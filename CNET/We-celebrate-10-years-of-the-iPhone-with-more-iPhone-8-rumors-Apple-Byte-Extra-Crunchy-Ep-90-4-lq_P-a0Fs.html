supports the vid the weekly video show
that's only about four or five minutes
this is the show where you could get
in-depth down-and-dirty talk about some
of the details as well as new
developments going on in the world of
Apple also this show is all about you
all watching and listening you make the
show what it is so we want you to call
us leave your number your name not your

where you're from and just vent or
expand or bring new information or just
want to talk about whatever's on your
mind about the world of Apple so let's
just jump into the show and we can't
ignore the fact that what it was it was
it basically yesterday technically
yesterday was the tenth anniversary of
the original iPhone the game-changer
that the phone that changed everything
for everyone whether you were an Apple
phone user an iPhone user or not right
whether you didn't want an iPhone it
still changed everything for you because
look at where we are today I it's crazy
to think right 10 years
a long time and yeah a paradigm shift
man I was like a huge shape change for
everybody I know it changed my life I'm
sure I'll have your life I think a lot
of people you know what some people
don't understand like voice or tone
because yesterday I tweeted out you know
to celebrate the 10th anniversary I said
game-changer what an accomplishment and
then something long lines of like not as
innovative as it was before and then
like dot dot dot smiley smiley smiley
smiley and I can't tell you ok I'm gonna
just lay this out here you all need to
just like chill out and soften like not
even soften I'm just like get over the
fact that if someone if you interpret
someone sliding your phone you like take
it real personal like real personal
I don't can't like come on we're having
fun here's like do you are you defined
by your phone because I think a lot of
people they get so riled up when you say
like this phone sucks that phone sucks
they take it personally
yeah it's a totally cultural phenomenon
going on with people on their phone
loved you know so yeah people do take it
personal it's it's really weird I mean
it's just you know it's just a device
we're all less technology like this like
this is mind blowing stuff like you
could order a pizza from your phone and
it gets there by the time you get home
there's like wait I'm driving and
there's like satellites tracking where
I'm going and showing me on the road I
mean it's no it's incredible what is
there to complain about I don't get it
so anyways we just wanted to first of
all before people think we're hating on
the iPhone because we're not no now we
are celebrating the iPhone so for all of
you I can't you know what my original
iPhone because I you know I moved a
little while ago I can't find where it's
in some little white Apple bag but I
can't find my original iPhone like that
to me that's like a that's like a that's
like a gem for me you should frame in a
pumpkin wall or something I should do
something with it but now let's kind of
roll into the show and roll into the
stories of today and you know to kind of
also follow on the theme
talking about the 10th anniversary
iPhone this is a great story in Wired
magazine Tony Fadell if you aren't
familiar with them he now is part of
nest he basically is the top dog at nest
labs which was then acquired by Google
for somewhere around 3 billion dollars
he was notably at the time of during his
time at Apple you know people call him
like the Godfather of the iPod but he
was also there during the actual iPhones
development so I thought this was kind
of some fun I guess again last week we
talked about letter Scott Forstall
talked about in relationship to the
actual iPhone this is what Tony Fadell
said about the iPhone and kind of how it
started so why I asked him the question
you know there's so many different
origin stories from the iPhone why is
this infidel said this is according to
him well there were many projects that
came together to make the final phone
there was a large screen iPod for video
that had a touch interface there was an
iPod phone which was basically an iPod
mini perhaps a little bit bigger with a
phone inside that had a wheel in a smart
screen there was a touchscreen MacBook
Pro being worked on and a multi-touch
MacBook Pro that was going to go that
well that's where they were at from a
hardware perspective there were also
different stories of software project
this was over a period of basically 9 to
12 months now when you hear about a
touchscreen MacBook your ears kind of
peak up because you're like wait why is
it Apple doing it they like that's
exactly what I did I'm like what they
were working on that that long ago I
mean I get what he's he's at least
telling us they were looking at he was
saying that at the time basically to get
the touchscreen technology into a Mac at
that time they wanted to compete with
Microsoft tablet tablets and this is
funny Fidel also says Steve was pissed
off and wanted to show them how to do it
right so it totally validates exactly
what Scott Forstall talked about last
week they realized though there was so
much software and so many new apps that
need to be done and built and they were
also worried like we didn't know if they
could scale it into a large full screen
display at that time with the max oh
really this big size iPod with the
display and a single touch system not
multi-touch because remember multi-touch
was a game changer I mean that is one of
the biggest game changing text in any
device period that we have from a
technology standpoint cuz you know there
were touchscreens way long ago but not
multi-touch pinch and zoom rotate all
that so that that was just a game
changer in the way that we use them that
we use these devices but they were he
was just timing out how they tried
different ways to replicate kind of the
wheel style of the iPod I mean putting
the phone but it just it just wasn't
good enough a single touch screen wasn't
good enough but I think the main kind of
thing that you can pull from this is how
it wasn't easy and Apple was doing
really four or five hardware projects at
the same time and I don't know if
they're looking at it I'm sure they have
some sort of modernized touchscreen
MacBook Pro concept in their underground
bunker labs but it's just kind of crazy
that it's really more but he even says
it was more of a software thing they
didn't have the apps they'd have to
build new software the funny thing is
that's exactly the same thing that is
affecting them right now or I totally
don't have software to support a MacBook
Pro also another cool thing in the story
they talked about the Motorola ROKR do
you remember do you remember this phone
and I don't okay so it was a it was a
handheld phone and the kind of key about
it I don't know maybe you might even be
able to find something online while I'm
talking about
it had like iid iTunes Store capability
built into it and this was really
Apple's kind of first foray into phones
before the iPhone ever came out right at
the time like Sony Ericsson phones were
really hot Nokia phones were super hot
the razor was super hot and Apple
partnered with Motorola for this razor
phone and it it was clearly not Apple's
entire vision but they were trying at
least they learned a lot from this
experience you know Fidel talked about
it he said the question would man yeah
yeah yeah that's it pretty good it was
it was hooked up with iTunes so you
could plug it directly in your phone um
the question asked him was did Apple
deliberately make the rocker a poor
device and they're like no it was not
we made poor not at all Fidel says we
tried our best motorola would only do so
much with it their software team was
only so good their operation system
their OS was only so good and that
experience just didn't work very well it
was a clash of all kinds of problems but
it wasn't a case of trying to not make
it good and I think when you hear that
it definitely reinforces the idea of how
Apple you know excels the best when they
control the software and the hardware
and all levels of building the phone
which is really what what Google has
learned you know as Android has evolved
and has Google as the company's evolved
I mean their pixel phone was their first
phone where they decided to pretty much
control everything we know that I
believe is HTC that at least
manufactured it but the design the
software that's that's all Google that
though you know every company takes
pieces from each other that that's
clearly what they learned
but I remember honestly almost wanted to
buy that phone because I was I'm still
that guy that at least will try every
Apple product one time it looks pretty
cool actually I mean doesn't look
doesn't look ugly or anything looks like
like I'm those old-school Nokia phones
we all used to you it was clunky and
slow I mean I don't even know what it
feel like to use that phone today like
today to use that phone I don't know
what am i feel really crazy because I
can see like kids getting retro and like
starting in a rock like old Nokia phones
again maybe I'm totally wrong but I
could see kids because the 90s are
coming back you know so oh my goodness
our nineties are coming back baby I need
hey if the music from the 90s comes back
all that good man I mean honestly like
rock and you know grunge and hip-hop and
R&amp;amp;B doesn't I mean that's some of the
hate is about I felt sure especially
like a pop 90s hip-hop is the best and
he's hip-hop good I mean I was at a we
did a cool story that we're gonna drop
later at a Korean barbeque restaurant
with robots and they were playing like
90s hip-hop the whole time I was like I
can't even pay attention I was just
feeling it the whole time like oh my
gosh okay I should juvenile was up in
there okay I'll get back on track now
man I gotta get back on track okay so
let's kind of transition over to kind of
what's happened
with um the new just Apple right now iOS
11 we know that the public beta came out
earlier in the week for both the iPhone
and the iPad pro I put it on my pro it
looked I don't recommend people putting
betas on their gadgets all the time
because some apps end up literally not
working and you're stuck like that for I
mean you can revert back click your
phone or break your device okay how
about this technically it could I'm not
gonna tell people like oh it won't break
your device you know I'm just saying
just be careful just know what you're
getting into but I put it on my iPad Pro
and I'm like dude the iPad pro although
yeah it's a little buggy it's it's
actually made my eye my iPad pro a
little slower in some ways but damn it's
gonna be hot like iPad users iOS 11
game-changer it's really slow it's
really slick the other thing is also
though apple also released the public
beta of makos hi yeah so that public
beta is out as well I would definitely
not recommend you install that as your
primary OS but a great thing is if you
want to you should part what I always do
is actually partition my hard drive so
there's about like a 30 gig segment or
chunk on it that I end up installing
developer betas of Mac OS on there so I
can try them out it's it's a really cool
way to do it so if you're gonna do it at
least try partition your hard drive in
the disk utility app of your of your Mac
you can do it there and then that'll
allow you to do that but the biggest the
biggest thing but I don't understand why
they do this
you know we're showing a video of iOS 11
in action with Scott Stein and there's
this feature that they now it's called
like the basically where you could flick
on the keyboard and what's cool about
that is you know a lot of times you have
to change your keyboards characters even
on your iPhone right like from the
characters the you know to the numbers
versus the letters well in iOS 11 you
can flick the keyboard like kind of
flick a key swipe it instead of just
tapping it and it uses the alternate
character now oh that's awesome that's
super awesome that's
save so much time man but you know
what's super not awesome for whatever
reason they decided not to put it on the
iPad pro twelve point nine inch but they
gave it to the nine point seven and the
ten point five no damp no good damn
reason I literally I literally don't
understand no I don't so but do you
think that I'll it'll come to those
devices when they finally release the
entire OS right
they said it's not support supported on
the twelve point nine inch iPad pro oh
man so my third generation like I'm
starting to get worried about my third
generation like updating apps and I'm
I'm definitely not gonna go to iOS
eleven on that I won't never even be
able to so why am I even trippin to buy
it's time to buy I'm to buy away to my
kids destroy it completely then I'll buy
one
alright take this out for those y'all um
watching this is a really cool thing
over at Mobile World Congress in
Shanghai Qualcomm announced their new
fingerprint scanner technology that goes
below the surface right that is embedded
really into the screen so there's no
physical button and this is really cool
they showed it off the actual technology
in action with company vivo that makes
their own phone so they showed it as
really a proof of concept and it's why
am i showing you this yes this actual
technology from Qualcomm will not be
used in the iPhone but it's just a proof
of concept shows like look this is
happening the components that they have
here are going to be coming out sometime
in 2018 but if they're doing it
obviously Apple's been like trying to
crack this and that for I don't know how
long quite honestly and they might have
been trying to work on this for at least
two three plus years to get this
embedded into the glass to make it a
single piece but I thought what was cool
is that Qualcomm expects commercial
devices using their sensors in early
2018 also though they said that not only
could it go under the glass it could be
tech detected under a combination of
metal and glass and even the fingerprint
sensor could work underwater oh wow
that's awesome I was like wow
pretty slick yeah because when I get out
of the shower and where I wash my hands
and I'm like locked out of my phone for
a few minutes unless I put in the code
you know you know I hear I grind your
finger off just for that um it also says
that their new scanner will have
ultrasonic scanning you'll be able to
pick up a person's heartbeat and blood
flow as an extra measure of security
that's so I know so detect your heart
that's that's that's care heartbeat and
and blood flow you know great that's
getting back to the Apple taking over
the health you know the health sector
the healthcare sector you know like be
able that you know monitor someone's
blood flow and their heartbeat from but
you know it's just I'm having a hard
time wrapping my head around that right
now but that's Qualcomm sensor we don't
know what we don't know if Apple's
Apple's own sensor that they have or
that they are working on reportedly
we'll be able to do exactly the same
stuff but a Qualcomm just kind of trying
to flex their muscle like don't worry
we've got our own don't worry all you
Android phones we got you that's what
they're basically trying to say right
yeah so um that that's always pretty
cool and then um just some other this is
something that people want to listen to
I phone eight stuff okay so in the iOS
11 files a new charging sound has been
discovered and I think people will want
to hear this I have the file pulled up
or the the link for you to go look at a
beach yeah but what it is is that in
this in this file clip you'll be able to
hear first the original charging sound
and then you're gonna hear this second
charging sound which a lot of people
think is the sound for wireless charging
like kind of a cue that tells you that
your phone is wirelessly charging
because that's a rumored feature so I
don't you just let me know when you have
that file and just like play it I got
the blog yes right here I'm gonna go and
play the video here we go and hopefully
there's no add-on okay that's the
original one
do it again
you came out video that was all okay let
me try yeah here we go oh yeah that's it
that's the jam that's the new one the
boom the like beam me up like tickle my
eye
touch me in all those places sound yeah
that's cool so I know really
revolutionary but that that was
discovered and then in other iPhone 8
news um this is a good this is good news
I'm how I'm hoping this actually happens
but the report is that we know the
iPhone comes with like apples dinky 5
watt power adapter that charges over USB
CA that is super slow one of the whole
you write everything is always it's
gotta be faster and slimmer well they
have run reports are now claiming
according to Barclays is that the new
iPhone at least the 5.8 inch OLED phone
that we're talking about will according
this rort will include a 10 watt USB C
charger so what does that really means
the charger itself will support a higher
voltage and then it'll also support USB
power delivery which sends the power
faster to your phone so ideally we're
looking at a charging adapter with the
USBC connector the cable actually being
USB C on one end and lightning on the
other and then the Lightning port goes
in your phone and it'll charge it a
whole lot faster that that's the goal
and if it's more than the 10 watt they
should honestly charge your phone twice
as fast this is really similar to what
the iPad pro has the ability to support
that fast charging via USB Sita
lightning cable so um that's gotta
happen to me too it's got to happen I'm
tired of getting there like cheap eels
stupid slow chargers only that's great
that's gonna charge fast the only thing
that is gonna be a little annoying is
that the charger looks like it's a tiny
bit bigger you know like it's like a
bigger cell like it I thought you liked
it bigger Oh everyone likes it bigger
but not when it comes to charging your
you know your little adapter
your little adapter and uh just to tease
you for those who can see this I know a
lot of you really do listen to us a new
video you guys can look it up a new
video from on leaks as showed off really
probably the best-looking render of faux
iPhone eight don't I fo 8 because it's
the iPhone it looks grill I mean this is
exactly like what you expect it to look
like so um I mean I know it's just juicy
why don't they rotate like that stand
that it's sitting on there look so
that's fake that's very looks like
rotating around looking kid looks
exactly like my iPhone 6 except for the
lenses the lens cameras vertical it's
sleek okay whatever like how much shiny
even people that are listen to this they
don't even have to know what it looks
like they already know what it looks
like I don't know what it looks like
yeah alright um we're gonna kind of jump
through some some quick stories here I
found this one to be pretty cool Apple
is believed to acquire German eye
tracking firm senso motor motor ORAC
motoric glasses look terrible okay hold
up that's not what they're fine they
have these like big ol nerdy glasses in
the image in the article senso motoric
instruments all right they have eye
tracking glasses and systems not the
actual eye glasses bro the systems
systems okay the system so basically on
May 2nd this is just unearthed Apple's
vice president of corporate law Jean
leva he has his signature his signature
is basically on this document under like
a shell company called vineyard Capital
Corporation right basically right
incorporating a coin believed to be
acquiring SMI but what they do some
really cool tech stuff that basically
it's all about their eye Tracking's
their eye tracking system so this in the
eye tracking world or at least you know
with hololens and VR there's this
function or you know feature they call
it gaze right and what it means is when
you stare at something the glasses can
not only tell you
looking at something but if you start at
for an extended period of time
maybe there's a some sort of an option
to you know stare at your TV and when
you stare for a little longer it turns
it on or I means that happen like you
know if you're given three choices and
you stare at one of the three choices
long enough
it basically activates it that's okay
they have this natural gaze behavior in
real time technology that can be used in
real world situations a sampling rate of
up to 120 Hertz and so that they even
have this like tennis video of this boy
hitting a tennis ball but you can see
exactly where his eyes are looking the
reason why this is important is because
Apple has been rumored to be working and
developing on some sort of pair of smart
glasses project now yes Beecham I hope
it doesn't look like that picture it's
not funny they do look funny but here's
eye tracking things cool that little uh
looks like a little target kind of in
the middle and exactly it's it sees
where you see here's what here's what I
always find funny like people get like
oh I'll never wear smart glasses I'll
never do this XY and Z you just have to
remember that the phone that we have
today is not gonna be the phone in ten
years I think we'll still have some sort
of like piece of glass you know slate
piece that yeah is primarily might
primarily be our phone but you know as
we kind of minimize things ai is gonna
be really a bigger thing I don't know if
it's gonna be something like just a
microphone headpiece in our ears you
know you kind of think eventually the
the whole idea of a wristwatch strap if
that could actually just just be your
phone you didn't even have to carry it
to anything in your pocket which it will
be an option that's gonna happen but in
ten years are we all going to be having
just this this phone to a certain degree
I I think some of us will but some of us
will have actually stuff that's more
advanced I mean I'm not gonna say the
phone is disappearing let's just be
straight with that right this put the
idea of just like a slate uh that is
networked to whatever you're doing
around you whether it's your home or
your TV and it's able to pull down
information like your phone could be
your wristwatch and this could just be
the thing that you interact with all
your devices for yeah I'm just underway
to change though I'm sitting here
thinking about that and I'm like maybe
it could be
like you know a pair of contact lenses
and then like an earpiece and a watch
and then that's all your communications
you need or something you know it things
will change so like just think about
where we were ten years ago with the
original iPhone and where we are now and
then where we would be from a technology
jump in ten more years yeah think about
how we were texting before the iPhone
came out we were like pressing one like
two times to get to C or B and then
pressing two a few times
you remember texting I'm like a Nike
years ago right so don't worry o swiping
and like emoji I mean don't sleep on
this whole like I'll never work lot it
may not be glass it might be something
different but it's going to be different
right that's that's just a fact
I'll wear some contact lenses man no
problem give me some cool you know
admitted reality contact lenses I'll
rock that and then you know kids will
get all like cool and like start to have
like weird LED lights and their eyeballs
and stuff and like just talk you know
like just finish it spinner stuff like
that so you walk into a club your lights
or your eyes are glowing red everyone's
looking at you it already happens right
it's like color you know colored
contacts so crazy okay check this out um
this is kind of a fun little story I
guess you called music service beef
service beef but it is relevant because
right jay-z dropped his new 444 album OD
o fo fo-fo on title exclusively also
like if you're a sprint subscriber or
user you get access to it earlier but
unearthed in that I don't have access to
it because obviously I'm not on title
like I'm not and guess what that's fine
I'll just wait for it although you know
the huh everyone is buzzing about it you
know it'll come to like all the other
services in the next week or so well
they got to make money I mean even uh
was it Beyonce's album that was on title
for a week or so and then it
I think lemonade was on title also just
for like a one-week two-week window
before it got into like
Apple music and 9i two were same with
Kanye like Kanye's I think was on all
the other yeah really limited really
limited fast just for a week or two
get somebody so check this out unearthed
from his new album from the track smile
this is kind of some fun lyrics thrown
kind of thrown some shade out calling
out Apple musics Jimmy Iovine directly
come on it's not it's not it's not
gnarly but alright here we go
F a slice of the apple pie want my own
cake charging my own fate respect Jimmy
Iovine but he got respect the Elohim or
the Elohim sorry as a whole new regime
the Elohim is basically like in the
Hebrew in Hebrew it's like God so
respect the God is a whole new regime
right he's trying to say like F Apple
music it's all about title show me love
that I I'm happy that he said respect I
am Jimmy I mean because Jimmy Iovine is
incredible man yeah yeah he has done a
lot for Apple music and just for music
and jazz music in general right but yeah
I mean that's funny they're now now like
gangsters or not gangster he's not
gangster rap but rapping from like
beefing with like different crews like
west coast East Coast
- like beefing with like exact lat forms
you know coming at you that's crazy
what's happening is how it's evolved
right and also like it shows like how
jay-z's evolved - you know this album
from all indications a lot more intimate
it's a lot more personal and it is a
little more grown-up so it's I think
it's interesting because come on is
jay-z but it's also interesting to see
when I when I actually get a listen to
it and I'm fine I'll wait a week I'm not
like tripping I'm not like training a
title account right now again like a
fake hotmail address just to get it but
you know I you know if you talk about
some of the you know true quote-unquote
real artists rappers what Kendrick Lamar
yeah jay-z are at the top yes you know
in those are two of the top dogs so
you've got it I think it's just I think
it's just fascinating how although they
want to talk all that if you really
is gonna back it up he just shouldn't
put his album on Apple music iTunes at
all it'll end up there how long how long
do you think it's gonna take before it's
gonna be a week or two a weekend it'll
be a night it'll be everywhere music
it's gotta be got to be um in some other
quick stories Apple is supporting
national parks this is kind of like a
fun little initiative that they're doing
it will donate $1 to the National Park
Foundation for every purchase made with
Apple pay at any Apple Store it's very
small so you basically have to buy
something from the Apple store with your
Apple pay okay so you have only a few
buy from Apple from the Apple store I
feel like if you buy a two thousand
dollars of goods and it's just like a
MacBook Pro $1 donated to the National
Park Foundation and you have to use
Apple pay you know that's pretty cool
actually
give me an you know but only better than
one dollar okay paper but point zero
zero zero one percent you know Chin's
better than nothing I guess
additionally on July 15th Apple watcher
Apple watch users around the world can
compete in their walk run or wheelchair
workout of 3.5 miles basically to earn
awards and stickers for your messages
app inspired by national parks it's kind
of like these little icons I'm like all
right that's cool it's just kind of fun
you got a shoal of the national parks I
we are so tech tech centric it's like
honestly sometimes it sounds really bad
but sometimes I want to tell people that
are like all fired up about like oh you
said this about that so I just go take a
walk go outside and take a hike like go
somewhere where your phone doesn't work
out in nature seriously like you and I
are going on break pretty soon which I
guess we should save cuz we don't know
what the schedule site gonna be for the
show yeah in the next month but like I
completely shut it down when I'm on
vacation yeah yeah I'm going I'm leaving
tomorrow man I can't wait can't wait to
get out of town get out of Dodge
that's nice that's real nice so anyways
go outside bring some
and then finally this is like kind of a
attach on add on to something we talked
about a little while ago

of a hint of it but Starcraft remastered

good improve graphics it's gonna have

what did it say there at the end land oh
no say modem online play or monitor
something like that modern online play
you got to get that you got to get that
so there you go Starcraft remastered
coming soon dig it she'll get to the
calls let's do some calls dude all right
thank you all for calling remember to be
a part of the show ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls 1-866 268 we'll tease
that at the end of the show but this
calls you guys make our show and make
sure you're like using your phone
properly because we had like four or
five like technical difficulty things
yeah yeah there were like just really
bad connections so we're sorry but we
got a couple of that we're gonna play so
here we go number one hey Brian hey
Beach this Steve and Gilroy so I feel
like Minneapolis like Apple has lost
some of its fire in the last few years
you know series mobile near as intensive
intellects or the Google assistant
MacBook Pros are kind of a two steps
forward two steps back kinda thing and
half-baked releases like ear pods the TV
app and Brian's favorite the smart
battery case all things are kind of weak
and the justification for the Apple
premium so this is how I think users are
feeling but my main question is what's
it gonna take for Apple to feel like
they need to step up their game I mean
maybe we're seeing started that with for
iOS 11 but
how does that feel into the present for
me all of the company's product line
once a lot love as well thank you for
calling um you know I think that it come
it always comes from the top of like
what is the vision that you know the
person driving the company has and I
think whether it was maybe control too
much by Tim Cook or not the vision of
him is like about operations optimizing
profits hitting all these different
price points making multiple categories
forcing a product line to hit all those
price points to make the best margins
his grand vision or his biggest thing
that he pushed out for him was the Apple
watch I mean that was his baby he kind
of made it clear um I think it is still
evolving but you know if you want to
talk about how do you get back that
innovative edge it comes from inside it
comes from the top as well and until he
maybe hands that over to someone who is
saying like okay we have three new
product initiatives led by person a led
by person B and person C and if people
rally around those visions and I think
you'll start seeing new things I mean I
I do like again I like the iPad the air
pods I think they're really really good
I don't think they're great but they are
really really good you know that that
that is one thing I think that they're
paying attention to at least you know
for whatever reason is like all of a
sudden the 10th anniversary of the
iPhone made them go oh we've got to
actually do something big like they
should be thinking like that every year
quite honestly and that's how we felt
they used to think but I don't think
they necessarily think like that anymore
we have the iMac Pro which was kind of a
miscalculation of how they viewed the
pro machine so the Mac Pro is coming
back there they're learning but it's I
don't I just think that they didn't
necessarily have to learn when their
loyal customer base is like kind of
telling them like hey this is what we
want and when you have a company that
has that much power it's kind of like
the fat cat they've kind of shown us
that they've acted like a fat cat so
let's get back on track y'all yeah I
definitely think they have some heat on
them from their customers and all their
fans you know so they're they're
probably working on it ok next call here
we go
hi guys this is Jennifer from Oklahoma
and I just wanted to call and say one
more thing about Apple Maps um I found
this on accident somehow and you all
probably know this already but when
you're you've programmed in where you're
going in Apple Maps and then your phone
turns off and you're driving
if you reach to pick up your phone which
I know you're not supposed to do but you
pick it up it shows you the map and
where you're going on the screen so it's
not just like a little pop-up text
message from Google it is actually the
map and I like that it's just something
cool um it's had me using Apple maps
about 50% of the time now instead of
Google I use them both but I just
thought I'd let people know thanks so
much I love the show bye Thank You
Jennifer we love you too oh my gosh I
love you know what it's so funny how
like out of all of the things we've
talked to I feel like Apple Maps has had
the most response on calls for people to
like but you know what it's good though
because we don't use it I mean I use it
once in a blue moon but you know people
they're like no it does this it does
this it's just like I didn't know I
didn't I didn't know about the
lockscreen part that is Apple Maps lock
screen is better than Google Maps okay I
said it now I want to try it I'm gonna
try it on the way to Tahoe did you see
if that works cuz no that's kind of a
cool tip but out yeah it's funny a lot
of people have been defending they're
like we have to call and defend Apple
Maps like big time you know so it's
pretty funny alright so there you go
