exciting iPhone news this year is iOS 8
Apple software update that will roll out
to users this fall there are dozens of
enhancements and tweaks and brand new
features coming in this update but in
this top five I'm going to boil it down
to the handful that really matter
starting off at number five airdrop
apple gave us airdrop in iOS 7 is a way
to let users transfer files switching
their iPhones and their iPads and
frankly to address Samsung's whole phone
bumping ad campaign but to everyone
shocked and frustration you couldn't
actually use the feature to transfer
files from your phone to your computer
or the other way around you'd shoot a
great video on your phone and then you'd
want to edit it over on your computer
and you have to email it to yourself
like some kind of cave person well
apples fix that now thus finally making
airdrop useful a legitimate innovation
comes in at number four hand off here's
Apple's closed ecosystem working to your
advantage you're on your macbook your
iPad and a call comes in on your iPhone
and because all your Apple devices can
see each other your iPhone will hand off
the call to whatever you're using you
can answer calls in your macbook or
reply to messages on your iPad or
continue working on an email on your
phone when your laptop is back at the
office once everything is
interchangeable maybe life will become a
little easier probably not but maybe at
number three actionable notifications
right now your iPhone gets a text
message and a little notification
appears and then you tap it and then
that takes you into the messages app and
you compose your reply and then if
you're me you tried really hard to
remember what you were doing before that
message came through but an iOS 8 you
can message back right from the
notification without jumping in and out
of apps it makes so much sense that
Android did it to two years ago come on
out coming in at number two family
sharing whether you're married with
children or single with cats iOS 8 will
let you share your itunes purchases with
up to six family members that includes
apps music videos I books everything no
more juggling account logins to
redownload the stuff that you already
bought once you designate your fan
members everyone's catalogue of itunes
purchases can be shared across your
devices even the embarrassing crap
finally my vote for the number one
feature of iOS 8 worth getting excited
over a better keyboard not only with a
new keyboard and iOS 8 offers selectable
predictive text options like every other
smartphone but it will now support
third-party keyboard software that users
can buy in the App Store you want to
have one of those futuristic swipe
keyboards go for it custom keys
alternative layouts extra mo geez just
do it your keyboard can now be just as
obnoxious as anything Android has
dreamed up I'm not sure if Steve Jobs
would have gone for this one but if it
makes it easier for me to curse on my
iPhone I'm all for it so there you go
five reasons to get excited about
updating your iPhone software this fall
more on the ins and outs of iOS 8 head
over to cnet and for more top 5s from me
