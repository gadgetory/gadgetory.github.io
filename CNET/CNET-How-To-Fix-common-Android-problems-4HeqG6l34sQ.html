our mobile devices will never be perfect
when they are running out of juice they
are slow they won't power on or they're
having problems connecting to the
Internet
I'm dan Graziano in today's how-to I am
going to show you quick fixes for some
of the most common problems Android
owners face let's start with battery
drain unless you own a phone like the
Droid Maxx you are most likely always
worried about battery life rather than
carrying around an extra battery pack or
a charger try changing your location
settings on stock Android enter settings
click on location and select battery
saving mode ask for brightness you
should avoid using auto brightness and
instead turn your screen down somewhere
below halfway or to a level that's
acceptable for your eyes you should also
try to avoid those gimmicky live
wallpapers all they will do is slow down
your phone and drain your battery how
about those times where your device is
running slow or even freezing phones
typically begin to slow down as their
internal storage fills up try deleting
unused apps and old photos or moving
them to services like Google Drive or
Dropbox if your device has one try
moving apps and photos to a microSD card
you should also close any open apps you
are no longer using and delete app cache
which can be done by going to settings
clicking on apps selecting the specific
app and choosing clear cache option
there are also free programs such as app
cache cleaner and clean masters that can
be used to automate the process of
clearing cache does your phone or tablet
have a bunch of preloaded apps from your
carrier or manufacturer that you never
use while you can't uninstall most of
them you can disable them in the apps
section of the settings menu if you are
having a problem with connecting to
Bluetooth Wi-Fi or your cellular network
enabling airplane mode for 30 seconds
can sometimes fix the problem toggle it
off and check again sometimes simply
toggling the specific connection can
also solve the problem if neither of
these work try restarting your phone
still having an issue try repairing your
Bluetooth device or for
getting the Wi-Fi network and setting it
up again for more tips and tricks like
