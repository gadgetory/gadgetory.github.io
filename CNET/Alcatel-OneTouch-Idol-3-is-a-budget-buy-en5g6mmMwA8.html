typically underperform I'm happy to
report all that's changed with the one
touch idol 3 i'm jessica doll court for
cnet taking a first look at this budget
phone physically the idol 3 here is
pretty dapper it's uniformly slim with
silvery accents and a dark brush plastic
finish there's a nice heft but it isn't
overly heavy the specs pile up pretty
high for this 5.5 inch version here you
get a 1080p HD screen in android 5.0
lollipop there's also a 13 megapixel
camera on the back and an 8 megapixel
camera on the front low light shots are
pretty terrible if you aren't using
flash but in well-lit conditions the
photos are actually pretty good alcohol
also gives us two JBL stereo speakers on
the front that turned out decent sound
watch this see how the phone is right
side up with the camera at the top well
when you turn it upside down the whole
display swaps making the interface
completely reversible you can toggle
this on and off in the settings I also
really like the future that locks and
unlocks the phone by double tapping the
screen a few other handsets do this too
and I find it really fast and effective
that's also something you have to turn
on in settings ok now for the downsides
the idol 3 is noticeably slow especially
when navigating around not necessarily a
deal breaker but just be aware it also
slipped out of my hands once or twice
while I was using it if you've used
other phones you'll also have to train
yourself to all guitars custom Android
layer like figuring out how to review a
picture you just took in the gallery
it's just not very intuitive still the
unlocked handset supports LTE speeds and
costs less than half of a super premium
smartphone so there's that the price is
pretty good for what you get and in fact
this is probably the best alcatel phone
i've ever seen check your online and
retail stores for local prices and go to
cnet com for all the pros and cons
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
