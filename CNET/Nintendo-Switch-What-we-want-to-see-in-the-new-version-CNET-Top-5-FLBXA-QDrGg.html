in a new Nintendo switch there was a
report by The Wall Street Journal that
said Nintendo will release a new version
of the Nintendo switch in the far-off
year of 2019 I know that all kinds of
news reports pop up from time to time
but this is the Wall Street Journal and
it's got a pretty good track record so
let's talk about what we want to see and
number five is more battery life this is
number five because the switch has ok
battery life already and is easily
charged thanks to its USBC connector
there are also lots of battery packs
available for the switch all that being
said the switch is marketed as a device
that can be taken wherever you go
Nintendo says the switch can last around
six hours but that's a best-case
scenario more battery life is always
great for any portable device Nintendo
make it happen coming at number four is
a time better joy cons and Bluetooth you
know what would be nice on a joy con how
about a traditional d-pad sometimes the
joy con controls don't cut it when a
traditional d-pad would be great on the
matter of Bluetooth no one is saying to
get rid of the headphone jack keep that
just add Bluetooth audio to the switch
right now you have to be tethered to the
switch if you want to keep your game
play quiet
number three is more onboard storage yes
you can add more storage using a microSD
card but did you know that reports
dating back to 2017 say that load times
are fastest using the internal storage
yep I don't know about you but when a
game takes too long to load it takes me
out of the game even if load times were
equal having more space to download more
games would be very useful also storage
gets cheaper as time goes on 2019 could
easily see Nintendo doubling up storage
without any price increase that brings
us to number two which is a better
screen the Nintendo switch has a 6.2
inch 720p LCD screen if you want to see
a game run a 1080p resolution you'll
have to dock the switch maybe a higher
resolution screen would be good but that
would require improved internals
Nintendo is also using some older screen
technologies in its
which moving towards something like a
smartphone display could allow the
switch to be thinner brighter and
potentially more power efficient the
Journal report says the new switch will
probably not have an OLED screen but we
can dream and at number one is refined
overall design let's put up some video
of the Nintendo switch take a good look
at it okay now let's take a detour let's
look at huawei's mate 20x the thing fits
a 7.2 inch screen in a body with minimal
bezels Huawei even showed off how to
attach a controller to the mate 20x and
compared it to the Nintendo switch the
may 20 X had a larger screen larger
battery better screen resolution and
claimed 6.67 hours of gaming life now
Nintendo doesn't have to copy Huawei
completely but slimming down the bezels
and the entire body would help him
making the switch more pocketable that
would be great
