flamethrower and this hot seller can be
yours too for five hundred dollars plus
tax this is a product from the boring
company it is a tunnel construction
company that musk founded in 2016 now on
Saturday must announce the product on
social media and opened up advanced
orders with a limited number of 20,000
this stunt really lit up the internet
musk has been tweeting sales updates
with early Monday morning saying 7,000
were sold that's three and a half
million dollars worth of flamethrowers
oh and his company is also selling a $30
fire extinguisher naturally the CEO of
SpaceX and Tesla also runs the boring
company to make tunnels for the
underground Hyperloop transportation
system
it's called boring because it bores a
tunnel boring yeah he's a funny
billionaire so what sparked this crazy
product back in December must promise
that after his boring company sold
50,000 promotional baseball caps they
would start selling the boring company
flamethrower and then on Christmas Eve
he tweeted that the flamethrowers were
coming soon
so it seems interest in his joke didn't
burn out and he kept true to his promise
the website says the flamethrowers will
ship in the spring maybe that's April
maybe that's April first oh and for
those of you with the burning question
yes flamethrowers are legal the United
States Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco
Firearms and Explosives allows
flamethrowers just as long as the flame
is shorter than 10 feet I'm Bridget
