upend the way we all use computers and
it's hoping you might be willing to test
it out
the newest pre-release software being
sent to windows insider program
participants will include a new feature
called sets which groups the apps Word
documents browser windows and whatever
else together as a set of tabs in a
window it's a radical departure from the
way we all typically use computers with
apps and browser windows all over the
place but that's not all Microsoft will
also sync your sets between computers so
you could be working on a project at the
office and then when you get home you
open up your PC and you'll be able to
resume with all the same apps browser
windows and everything else set up just
the way you left it there's a catch this
whiz-bang idea though Microsoft isn't
sure it'll work which is why it's
releasing it through the windows insider
program where you can sign up to get
pre-release versions of Windows for free
just be warned the software is untested
for use by the masses so it could eat
that critical presentation due to your
boss tomorrow so I do this well
Microsoft says it wants to study how we
all use this new feature and that makes
sense but it's also part of a growing
trend in the tech industry of offering
beta versions of software so
enthusiastic fans can test it out before
it's released to the wider public
remember Google's Gmail it was in beta
from 2004 through 2009 even Apple the
secret of iPhone maker offers a public
beta version of its iOS software these
days for iPhones iPads and the Apple
watch it's good to see Microsoft come up
with new ideas like sets and even more
interesting that the company says it may
never release this feature for now
Microsoft wants to see how we all use it
first one thing's for sure as software
gets ever more sophisticated companies
are turning to us to be a bunch of
testers to help make it work hopefully
that means less bugs in the end though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
