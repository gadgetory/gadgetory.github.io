comes apples new music streaming service
Apple music I'm Lexie CBDs for CNET and
I'm gonna run you through how to install
and setup Apple music on your iOS device
the first thing you'll need to do is
install the iOS 8.4 update and to do
that you'll need to go into the settings
panel tap it and then find general then
from here you'll need to tap software
update it should then automatically
search and find the iOS 8.4 update
you'll need to tap download and install
enter your passcode so agree to the
terms and then the update will start to
download this can take anywhere from a
couple of minutes to an hour or so
depending on your connection so be
patient and there you have it it looks
pretty similar to iOS 8.3 with the
exception of the music icon in the
bottom right hand corner you'll now see
this icon looks slightly different to
before that is Apple music so when you
fire up the app you're presented with
two options when you first start it
either to start your first three month
free trial or you can simply not do that
and go to my music so if we want to sign
up all we need to do is choose the plan
that we want to select I'm going to
select individual and then I'm going to
enter my passcode I'm going to agree to
the iTunes terms and conditions now I
have to confirm that I want to buy the
free trial to Apple music but I have to
confirm that I'm gonna spend $9.99 a
month after that so now it's saying that
I club music library can't be enabled
and if I want to enable it later from
the settings menu I can do so but until
then my music is not going to be
available on my other devices okay so
this is Apple music as you can see you
can see a whole bunch of the existing
music that is on my phone up here I can
then go into for you now this is the
customization tab so from this screen I
can tell Apple music exactly the types
of music that I like
love or don't like so I like rock with a
single tap I really like experimental
with a double tap and I really don't
like metal so I press and hold and then
it will remove it then I tap next and
then I can choose three or more of my
favourite bands again tap once on the
artist that you like such as ac/dc tap
twice on the ones that I really like
such as Sonic Youth or press and hold
the ones that I don't like sorry fish
I'll hit done and now it will give me a
bunch of different recommendations based
on what I selected now we're all set up
you can explore a whole bunch of the
different options in the tab down the
bottom such as the new artists and new
music beats 1 radio connect and also
your own music in the library over here
if you signed up for the 3 month free
trial then you'll automatically be
charged as soon as that 3 month trial
period is up if you want to cancel
before the trial ends then you need to
go into your profile by tapping the icon
up here then view your Apple ID you
might need to sign it at this stage and
then have a look at your subscriptions
tap manage and then here you'll see the
renewal options for your subscription
you can then turn off automatic renewal
here it will tell you when your trial
will be finished you simply tap turn off
and you're done
so that's a quick look at setting up and
getting started with Apple music on your
iOS device for more tips and tricks on
Apple music you can check out the Netcom
