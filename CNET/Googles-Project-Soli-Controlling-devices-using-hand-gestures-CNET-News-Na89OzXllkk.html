you can see as my hand approaches it
dynamically starts to react note are the
responsiveness and precision of radar
enables us to create these continuous
fluid interactions okay but what if I
want to interact with more detail that's
easy I just move my hand closer to the
watch and now I can use a virtual dial
gesture to interact with the
complication so here you can see I'm
using a virtual dial gesture to rotate
through these various complications so
we've got the messages the weather and
the calendar these gestures represent
interactions with with physical controls
such as using an analog dial because I
don't have to touch the screen we can
get a lot more information on the
display and of course just because
they're micro gestures doesn't mean I
have to them right next to the device
they also work at a distance so let's
select one of the other applications the
weather for example I'll remove my hand
and now when I come back in I can
instantly look at what the next weather
information is so you can see with just
a few solely gestures we can already
start to build these rich interactions
slowly embedded fully on a SmartWatch so
here so it allows to control control
home devices from the distance without
touching them this is a very first you
know prototype is here with speaker very
early work but the idea here is exactly
the same interaction principles and the
same gestures that we design for watch
also allow also allow us to control the
speaker you can see
it's a different embodiment but the
principle is the same as approaching his
hand you can see that speaker recognize
it and reacts to it so in the next Nick
yeah so note that the interactions here
are much larger than the watch they're
several feet the sensor actually
consents up to around 15 meters so we
can do some pretty amazing stuff for
this and this is the same thing that's
in the watch same algorithms so as I
approach I can you now use the virtual
tool to turn it on okay let's try
another track what do you think next one
yeah that's pretty cool okay
but I can also do other gestures more
immediate ones like shut up
great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
