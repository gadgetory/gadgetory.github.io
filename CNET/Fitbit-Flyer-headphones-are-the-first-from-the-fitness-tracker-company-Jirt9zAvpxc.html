game with the Fitbit flyer a hundred and
thirty dollar in-ear wireless sports
model that comes in lunar gray and
nightfall blue it's fully sweat proof it
offers six hours of battery life along
with two sound modes the design is
pretty typical of this type of fitness
oriented headphone but does have a few
distinguishing features the sports wings
and fins which help keep the buds
securely in your ear are integrated into
the bud and can be snapped off and
traded for a different sized fin or wing
there are also dual microphones for
making cell phone calls one of which is
supposed to help produce wind and other
external noise and a cord shortener is
integrated into the cord so you can
easily adjust its length
finally like some competing models
there's a quick charge boat that gets
you an hour of juice with just a 15
minute charge Fitbit isn't claiming to
be an audio company but the flyer is
being marketed as a premium fitness
headphone and it certainly does deliver
respectable sound along with a signature
listening mode there's an amped-up power
boost mode developed by a company called
waves that delivers more bass the flyer
can be paired simultaneously with two
devices so you can seamlessly move from
say your computer to your phone without
having to fiddle around with your
Bluetooth settings it pairs with any
Bluetooth audio device but it
automatically pairs with fitbit's new
ionic SmartWatch when the watch is in
range the fitbit flyer is set to ship in
October and I'll have a full review of
its features sound quality and
ergonomics or once it's available to
consumers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
