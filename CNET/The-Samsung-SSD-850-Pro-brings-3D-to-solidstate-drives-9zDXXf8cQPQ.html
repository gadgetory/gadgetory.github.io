all-new Samsung SSD 850 pro but before I
get to it well last week I reviewed this
one right here the SanDisk Extreme Pro
and I said this is the best SSD on the
market well I was up absolutely right
and I still am now which is no longer
absolutely because today I decide that
the new Samsung here will also share
that title one of the best SSD on the
market and a few reason to do so let's
see now first this one here also has the
longest industry-leading 10 year
warranty it also is internal standard
right to replace your hard drive and
when you do it win both the computer
performance by a great deal it's one
thing this new driver is buried at the
SanDisk care apart that's the endurance
you can write at least 150 terabyte of
storage to this drive here before it
becomes unreliable and that's a huge map
data and honestly even me cannot write
that must be any drive at all in my
whole lifetime the truth is I chained my
drive every signal or so and have no
plans on getting married to one just and
that's more this new Samsung here is the
first 3d SSD on the market and don't
worry there's no need for the special
glasses it basically means that the
stored memory cells string on the inside
here are placed in a more efficient way
let me show you a traditionally you know
the memory step string up like my arms
right here I placed on a surface just
like that put on a samsung here they
actually lift it up in a vertical
position so as you can see now I can put
more in the same real estate of the
surface like the Lauren that's are in
tune by the way and that means you can
have more storage density in a samsung
here it also means that the dry can
offer better performance and other
features and in my testing it was indeed
faster slightly faster than the SanDisk
to be the fastest esterday on the market
right now and it can get even faster
with a feature called rapid mode which
can you up to 25% of the host computer
system memory as cache you can turn on
the rabbit mode using the Samsung
register
software and also use that software to
manage other feature of the drive such
as updating is firmware turning on
encryption and so on really cool
actually now the question is so fast and
so cool why is this new Samsung Drive
here is not the best SSD on the market
well that's because is also very
expensive costing somewhere between $30
and hundred thirty dollars more than the
SanDisk counterpart depending on the
capacity for example the one terabyte
Samsung Drive here is price as seven
hundred and thirty dollars why the
sadist is only some $600 and honestly in
willwill usage you might not see that
different between the two arrow they are
both very fast drive if I'm on the drive
here check out my full review at
cnet.com you know which one to get the
said is all the Samsung depends entirely
on the size of your wallet not me them
and get them both in fact ungettable and
that's only because I'm dumb low and
this has been the first look at the
Samsung SSD
850 Pro yeah I have them all right here
we think about that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
