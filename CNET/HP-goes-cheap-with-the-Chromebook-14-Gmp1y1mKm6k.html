taking a first look at HP's Chromebook
14 as the name suggests it's a 14 inch
Chromebook that's the only size that
comes in
it also has 16 gigabytes of on-board
storage reason being it's a Chromebook
the idea is to work in the cloud so also
with that HP is offering 100 gigabytes
of free Google Drive storage something
you'll have to redeem when you purchase
the device it's got a full-size
Chromebook layout keyboard HP hasn't
done any modifications here but what's
also great is that it has full port so
you've got USB 2.0 and 3.0 you've got an
SD card slot and an HDMI port also
packed in here are 2 gigabytes of RAM
and a Haswell processor now it's not the
lightest Chromebook we've gotten our
hands on it's about 4 pounds and weighs
in a little bit heavy but you can expect
about nine and a half hours of battery
life the Chromebook 14 comes in three
different colors you've got this Snow
White and all of them have this matte
finish on top along with the metal look
inside it's not real aluminium just a
look come in Snow White coral peach and
ocean turquoise the PC will come in at
$249 version with all the specs we
talked about here along with the $349
version that comes with built-in 4G
along with two years of service at 200
megabytes a month look out for this
device around the holidays for cnet.com
I'm Sharon Vaknin
