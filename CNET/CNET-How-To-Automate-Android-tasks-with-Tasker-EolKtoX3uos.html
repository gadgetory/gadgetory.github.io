launched a music player when you plugged
headphones in or enabled Wi-Fi when you
got home with Tasker you can automate
those tasks and much more using a simple
formula if I'm in X situation than Y
happens for instance if I'm at home then
my Wi-Fi is enabled and the lockscreen
is off Tasker is a whopping six dollars
but hopefully I can convince you that
it's totally worth it the possibilities
for this app are endless but to truly
understand Tasker you have to dig in so
let me show you a couple of examples of
how this app works let's say I want my
phone to do a certain number of things
when I'm at work launch Tasker and in
the profiles tab tap the plus button you
don't have to create a title but to help
you remember it type work now here's
where you define the situation in which
this profile is triggered in this case I
want it to be triggered between 9:00
a.m. and 5:00 p.m. when I'm in the
office so I'll tap time and enter in
those two values the next step is to
define the tasks so between 9:00 and
5:00 while I'm working what do I want my
phone to do well I have a few things in
mind I'll tap the new task button and I
won't bother to name it now I'll add the
action press the plus sign and you'll
see a ton of options these are basically
all the things your phone can do
settings wise in this case I'll go to
audio settings and select silent mode
and turn it on hit the checkmark I also
want to add an action to turn on Wi-Fi
so I'll add a task go to net then tap
Wi-Fi set it to on tap the checkmark and
you're done I'll also adjust my display
brightness by adding another task go to
display and adjust it here finally tap
the checkmark tap it again and the
profile will be saved now whenever I go
to work all of these tasks will happen
automatically
just to check we can look here and see
that Tasker is running and since it's
before or 5:00 o'clock my Wi-Fi is
turned on you might be wondering why I
don't set up these tasks to be activated
when I arrive at work based on my
location you certainly can do that but
it'll be a huge drain on your battery as
your phone constantly checks your
coordinates so I really don't suggest it
ok here's another cool task that shows
off just how much Tasker can do I'll
make it so that when I plug in my
headphones a music app launches ok add a
new profile name it music and in the
context menu select state then tap
hardware and tap headphone plugged hit
the checkmark and create a new task hit
the plus sign select app load app and
choose your preferred music app when
you're done hit the check marks to save
everything and now every time I plug my
headphones in play music will launch ok
those are just two of the literally
thousands of ways you can use Tasker and
a little introduction to help you get
started now that you know how it works
dig into the profiles and look at all
the other ways you can use trigger
actions like by day or by week or even
location I'll include more useful combos
in my blog at Cena how-to and if you
have any questions along the way tweet
me first seen it I'm Sharon Vaknin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
