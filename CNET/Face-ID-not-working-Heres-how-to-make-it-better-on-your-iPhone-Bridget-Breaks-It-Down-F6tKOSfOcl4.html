iPhone models have bid farewell to the
fingerprint reader and now face scanning
is the new normal at Apple where your
phone notice what you look like and your
face becomes your password the face ID
security feature was first launched in
the iPhone 10 and it's also in the new
tennis the tennis max and the 10 R if
you never used it before to unlock an
iPhone get ready to ask yourself
questions like why doesn't it work with
my sunglasses why does it feel so
awkward paying with my face why does it
feel like it never works when you wake
up in the morning I'm Bridget Carey
let's break it down
go okay so for starters face ID is
pretty cool advanced technology you just
glanced at a phone and it unlocks you
can throw on different hats and glasses
and it will still work
it is totally encrypted and the chance
of someone else unlocking your phone
with their face is one in a million no
other smartphone has this capability but
it has its quirks especially for new
users if it cannot read your face access
is denied and you have to try again or
enter a passcode and that fail moment
can be so irritating because it slows
you down so how do you avoid those
misfires
I spoke with Apple to get some
clarification on the tech the tricks to
make it work better and if there is any
truth to the theories I've heard on why
it fails this is what I learned let's
start with how it works
face ID is packed into this little top
zone here it's what Apple calls the true
depth camera system it scans the details
of your face with infrared light and you
cannot see the scan unless that is you
have a special camera Oh spooky infrared
mode so with face ID there are over
30,000 dots of infrared light being
beamed to your face and it creates a map
of the face which is matched with the
face it has on file this all happens in
an instant and it is primarily checking
the details around your eyes nose and
mouth so that means it needs a clear
scan of everything in this zone and you
need your eyes open and looking at the
phone so the big learning curve here as
well learning how to hold the phone so
we can see you this just takes more work
than scanning a fingerprint if you're
distracted it's going to fail if you
check it while eating fail yawning
that's a fail if it's winter and your
face is covered up expect a cold hard
fail leaning in a chair to the side
while you're watching TV and checking
your phone that is a fail if you get a
shocking text from your BFF and you get
dramatic and cover your mouth with your
hands and try to open the phone fail
the distance also matters Apple says 10
to 20 inches from your face is the sweet
spot so if you're checking your phone in
bed and it doesn't work you probably
have it too close or it's at a bad angle
or your pillow is in the way if you're
using Apple pay and you want to do it
fast the trick is to scan your face when
you're waiting in line before you order
double tap the side button and then
point it at your face then put the phone
down to your side make your order and
then tap the NFC payment sensor like
normal that way you're not fumbling
looking like you're trying to take a
selfie in front of the register and
about the lighting for the most part it
doesn't matter
remember it's using infrared light so a
face scan can work in total darkness
well there is one kind of lighting that
could give you problems if you're trying
to unlock your phone while the camera is
pointed directly into the Sun because
the intense sunlight could throw off the
IR sensor which brings us to sunglasses
some work with face ID and some do not
it's a tricky problem but if it is not
working then the sunglasses are designed
in a way that it's blocking the IR light
from scanning your eyes some people say
polarized lenses are the problem but
that's not always true some polarized
lenses work fine it varies as for your
normal spectacles well it shouldn't be a
problem but if you are having a little
trouble give it some time face ID gets
better the more you use it and it adapts
to slight changes in your appearance so
let's say you have a moustache and
you've been rocking it for a while but
one day you suddenly decide to shave it
all off you may get a request to enter
in a passcode to confirm it is really
you that's how the system updates your
face data but sometimes the passcode
request is there not because you changed
but because it just didn't scan you
right maybe the angle was bad you don't
have to be slowed down by typing in the
code just
a little dip you want to dip the phone
back away from your face and bring it
forward to try it again now if it still
cannot detect you after five tries it's
gonna require a passcode
there's also another trick you can try
if you think you have bad luck with face
ID Iowa's 12:00 lets you register a
second look an alternate appearance so
if your night look is drastic from your
day look maybe this could help it fail
on you less or you could use this
feature to allow someone else the
ability to unlock your phone like a
spouse now if you do want to add a
second person I'm told this is not gonna
mess up your personal face ID experience
you're not gonna get more fails and the
phone is not merging the two faces into
one hybrid monster face identity you
know if you were wondering about that
sort of thing
bottom line is if you're new to face ID
the best advice is to just give it time
time for it to learn your face and time
for you to learn how it behaves and what
angles work best because when you do get
a fail the most likely reason is you're
holding it wrong that's it for this
bridge it breaks it down be sure to
write in the comments what your tips are
for making face ID work best and of
course you got a like subscribe and ring
the bell
thanks for watching guys see you next
