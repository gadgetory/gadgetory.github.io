how to contributor and today we're going
to take a look at the latest update to
Instagram version 3.0 for both iPhone
and Android apps that brought a new
photo map feature and when you first set
up your photo map you may have gone in
and just selected and allowed all of
your photos to show up later on you may
decide that you don't want some photos
to show up on a map of exactly where you
took that photo so what you can do is
launch it instagram app go to your
profile tab and then tap on photo map
you'll then see a map of all your photos
and you can zoom in and get to a more
precise area and then when you want to
edit an area tap on edit tap on the
photos to tap on edit again and then you
can scroll through and uncheck in your
photo you don't want to show up so this
photo here we'll just pick around them
one and then click or tap on done now
this removing geotag it means it once
you confirm any location history so if
you used it as on a Foursquare check-in
all that information will be taken away
from the photo and you can't go back and
add it in so if you used it like I said
for a Foursquare check-in the photo
still stays on your four-score account
or on Twitter or Facebook or whatever
but it removes the geotag information
from Instagram and thus from your photo
map on Instagram so we'll go ahead and
confirm it and now that photo is gone
from this area this is a good way to
make sure you're home for example if
you're geotagging photos from your house
stays private as well as any other
places you may not want people to a
scene on a map once again this is Jason
Cipriani scene at how to contributor and
that was how to control which Instagram
photos show up on your photo map
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
