refer to the $600 nebula Mars as a home
theater in a lunchbox on top of being
able to project an image up to around
150 inches it has dual JBL 10 watt
speakers built into its chassis as well
as they rechargeable battery delivers up
to three hours of projection time those
speakers don't sound great but they do
sound much better and play much louder
than the tiny speaker built-ins your
typical pico projector while you can
project 850 inch image you're going to
get a much better picture projecting in
the 55 to 75 inch range rated at 3000
lumens projector is fairly bright
particularly for a projector of its size
but you'll still want to project in a
dark room so the image doesn't get
washed out the projector has a native
resolution of 1280 by 800 or 800 P and
the images I projected were fairly sharp
though there was a little bit of
softness that made you feel like you're
watching something in between a DVD and
a blu-ray what's cool about the
projector is that there are a number of
ways to get video to run through it it's
powered by an Android based operating
system and has built-in Wi-Fi so you can
stream content right from the projector
via apps like Netflix and YouTube
another option is to plug a video source
such as an amazon firetv stick google
chromecast for apple TV into the HDMI
port and stream content that way you can
also play a video file from a USB thumb
drive and of course a laptop is always
an option I thought the picture was a
little soft using the internal Netflix
app but I had better luck running video
directly from a USB stick on my iPhone
using an HDMI adapter cable the
projector software is upgradeable and I
expect to see some tweaks going forward
that offers some small improvements but
overall we were pretty impressed with
this portable home cinema it's got a lot
to like about it although I'd like to
see it cost about $100 less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
