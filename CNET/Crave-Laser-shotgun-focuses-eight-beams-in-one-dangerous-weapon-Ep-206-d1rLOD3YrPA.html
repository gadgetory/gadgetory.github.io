a 40 watt blue diode array that
concentrates eight laser beams into a
magnifying glass that focuses the beams
into one dangerous laser beam kind of
like the desktop the diode array is
powered by a huge lithium polymer
battery pack capable of dumping 250 amps

the video description styro pyro demos
the laser by destroying balloons
ping-pong balls and lighting things on
fire much like every other laser video
