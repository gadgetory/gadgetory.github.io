it's called the experience at 5:00 now
as a flagship phone it is of course
packed with a whole host of top-end tech
but it probably the camera that had the
most updates it's now rocking a whopping
23 megapixel sensor which just packs the
image with detail what that allows you
to do is either digitally zoom into a
scene when you're taking the shot or
even crop into a shot you've already
taken without losing much image quality
it uses a method of focusing called
phase detection which is something that
we normally find on pricey DSLRs what it
means on here though is that it can
focus very very quickly and I found very
accurately as well it's really handy if
you take a lot of action shots of your
mates as it can lock on very quickly
it's got a wide-angle lens too which can
capture a lot of the scene perfect for
these wide expansive scenes here and it
has good exposure and colors as well you
still find a whole range of modes
including panorama there's a backlight
correction mode or HDR as everyone else
calls it and you'll also find the quite
fun augmented reality which can put a
dinosaur into your scene you'll notice
some tweaks elsewhere as well the body
itself has been a lot more squared off
and the back panel is now made with
frosted glass rather than velocity which
i think is a really nice touch the power
button on the side is now long and flat
and that's because it incorporates a
fingerprint scanner which works really
well now the zed v has the same
waterproof thing that we've come to
expect from all of Sony's Xperia said
range of smartphones however it's only
now says that this isn't actually
submersible in water but rather its
waterproofing is there to help keep it
safe from spilled drinks or
appropriately enough from the rain and
that note I'm gonna put up my hood you
can expand the storage using the micro
SD card slot on the side which of course
is hidden under a waterproof flap to
help keep out the rain the 5.2 inch
display is a bright and vivid Full HD
affair and inside is a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 810 processor if you want
something even bigger and flashier check
out Sony's Xperia z5 premium which has a
bonkers 4k display
with so many of its key components being
quite similar to the existing z3 there's
not a whole lot of reasons to upgrade
however if you do have an older Sony
phone or a different Android brand
altogether it's camera and fingerprint
sensor alone make it well worth a look
I'm Andrew Hoyle for CNET and this is a
sony xperia z5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
