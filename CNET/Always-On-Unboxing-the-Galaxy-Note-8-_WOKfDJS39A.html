Note 8.0 I'm pretty excited about this
little tablet it is sort of bucking the
seven inch tablet trend by going all the
way to eight inches although that trend
let's be fair it was first bucked by the
iPad Mini so let's get this thing out of
the box and check it out
do not accept if the steel is broken
this is a really nice box it sort of
feels like it's like all recycling you
know a slightly more responsible
steaming box it's not shiny so we have
the Wi-Fi 16 gig version unfortunately
there is a three version that has 3G
connectivity built in but that one's not
coming out in the US only the UK Galaxy
Note 8.0 I love this new trend towards
stickers I tell you everything that's
going on inside the tablet the tablet
itself though nice lightweight nice big
camera right on the back and let's see
what else is in the box alright so we
have our little manual our white
charging cable which se is my favorite
microUSB pretty good size power brick
alright and that is it and then I'm sure
we could just recycle this no problem
I'm gonna go through some setup and in
the meantime here are the specs on the
Galaxy Note 8 the Galaxy Note 8 runs
Android 4.1 jelly bean with Samsung's
custom TouchWiz UI it does have a stylus
which they like to call the s-pen I do
not like to call it that I like to call
it a stylus it has a 1.6 gigahertz
quad-core processor with 2 gigs of
internal ram the no dates display is 8
inches with a 1280 by 800 pixel
resolution that's not bad compared to
the iPad Mini which has just 1024 by 768
samsung claims you'll get 14 hours of
battery life which is not bad but of
course we'll have to test that
front-facing camera is not impressive
1.3 megapixels the rear-facing camera is
also not that impressive at 5 megapixels
in terms of course you get microUSB a
slot for the s-pen and a micro SD card
slot the note 8 is expandable up to 64
gigs now for the bad news the iPad Mini
cost 329 dollars to start the note 8
which is probably its best competitor is
399 dollars
wha-wha so let's compare the note 8 to
its primary competition the iPad Mini
now the screen is better and I actually
prefer the size a little bit the notates
a little bit taller than the iPad but
what I really like about it is that it
has this sort of extra bezel space on
the side that actually makes it easier
to hold than the iPad Mini because if
your thumb kind of strays onto the
screen you'll start making things happen
this one if you're using it as an
e-reader or something like that you
actually have a place for your thumb all
of that said this is a wonderful tablet
with a truly bummer price tag when I
found out it was $399 I was crushed
because I think it has so much potential
it's so nice to use and it's such a nice
size but with all those 7-inch tablets
being $200 or less about 399 tags could
be a killer now for the most part our
