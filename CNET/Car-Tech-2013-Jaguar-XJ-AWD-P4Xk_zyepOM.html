to mean a very quaint thing full of wood
and leather that might not start
tomorrow morning nowadays it's a whole
different story they got a new high-tech
v6 this thing's all aluminum skin and
they have more screens inside the cabin
than almost anything on the road let's
drive this 2013 jagex J all wheel drive
and check the tech now the current
generation XJ is not so much a pretty or
elegant car to me like it used to be as
much as it is a handsome and a very
present vehicle it definitely makes a
statement as you roll up in one but your
key styling cues here are three things
the narrow blade taillights in the back
very distinctive the blackout see
pillars that make the back of the roof
appear to float except on a black car
where the effect is canceled out and the
Jaguar face which is now the new family
grille now before we even get in this
guy I want to know who's paying off
Jaguar is it the chiropractor's union or
the orthopedic surgeons Union one's
gonna make a ton of money on this guy
because of this big wide sill you see it
sticks out so far that every damn time I
get it out of this guy I bang my
Achilles tendon on it give me about a
150 reps of that and I'm in the hospital
getting it sewn up again now I don't
know why Jaguar keeps sending us cards
and have such ugly color schemes I was
encouraged by the black on the outside
but not by this color of a cheap
synthetic baseball mitt on the inside
let's get to the tech now you got two
big screens the one here on the left is
still pretty revolutionary a 12 inch
wide profile LCD for the instrument
panel there are no dials or gauges in
this car with the exception of the clock
if you want to count that fuel
temperature speed tachometer and those
can change and morph into a different
type of screen sometimes the tach gives
way to warnings and the whole thing
turns red when you're in dynamic mode or
blue when you're in winter driving mode
so it's very evocative and as you can
see the map quality is pretty good I've
always been pretty pleased with Jaguars
map quality and it's very well rendered
but pretty basic you've got a 3d mode
you've got a 2d mode and you've got
North up there isn't a lot of nonsense
like fly through buildings there's no
Google Earth there's nothing of the
really advanced type of map display but
they get the job done
they've got a new interface for the
different destination menus address is
the one you'll use the most often but
they've also got some oddballs like
getting to a highway by route number
when would I do that
or coordinates what is this thing a Land
Rover San Francisco California
I give up if you can't recognize that
and ain't much good to me so I'll be
tapping things in over here on the
screen as you can see this car is kind
of pokey when you're entering things on
the on screen interface so it's an
improvement but it's still kind of a
underperformance system with either its
dopey voice command or the fact that it
takes a very long time to tap things in
on the screen now in terms of meaning
you've got am/fm satellite radio free
for three months and HD radio on this
guy as well under my music you find all
the other interesting choices and yes
they break up radio from my music which
always makes me nuts here's what an iPod
interface looks like they do a pretty
good job of calling out the the
navigation I find the buttons and all
are very clear but I wish they would use
more screen real estate for things like
titles bluetooth streaming worked
yesterday won't work at all today but it
has a pretty good support for meta tags
and was pretty good at navigating my
actual music collection but that was
yesterday you've also got 30 gigabytes
of hard drive space in this car
something else that I don't think is
terribly exciting what you do have are a
whole lot of surround modes from
standard stereo to Meridien to Dolby PL
to 2 DTS and that's because we have the
top Meridian sound system here this guy
is 825 watts and 20 speakers now of
course the Jaguar is full of nice
amenities inside the cabin especially in
XJ you'll notice of course their
trademark pop-up shift rotating deal
here for Park reverse neutral Drive and
sport mode when you're in Reverse you do
have a standard backup camera and front
and rear sensors no extra cost on those
next to it here is the winter driving
mode I mentioned earlier right below
that is dynamic driving mode your most
aggressive recurving of the entire
drivetrain related to the drivetrain
controls though are this eco button over
here which I pushed a lot because this
car has automatic start/stop and as
you'll see when we get on the road I'm
not a huge fan of it in this case Jaguar
has lots of little economic quirks
throughout this car
our first of all this is apparently a
cellphone bin but it's too weird for a
modern phone it's nice and tall and it's
not white enough for it to go sideways
so it's basically useless they went to
the effort of making a touch-sensitive
glovebox release I never had a problem
releasing a glove box with an actual
button or lever but I guess that's an
identifying principle for the Jaguar
brand and the same thing goes for the
overhead lights nothing moves you just
touch them it's cool I don't know that
it gets us anywhere and this switch over
here for the steering wheel heater is so
big and so touchy you'll be turning on
the wheel heater all the time believe me
and when you want to go verify if it's
on or off you can't because the little
indicator light isn't bright enough to
be seen in the daylight so you just kind
of got to hold it and say is it a hot
day or is the wheel on not available
here would be lane departure warning
whether it's active or passive not here
or front collision prevention even
though you can get the car with optional
adaptive cruise control and the overhead
dual panoramic sunroof which is not
really panoramic that's got a big old
bar in the middle that is standard as
well on an XJ but that one over the
second row is really shallow I'm not
sure it's that well done compared to
having a big glass top here now here in
the scoop we've got a three liter
supercharged direct-injected v6 this is
a big story because this car used to
come with a v8 only a big old five liter
you can still get that but this is the
new smart motor in the XJ the numbers
340 horsepower 332 foot-pounds of torque
this thing weighs a little over 4100
pounds by the way 250 of that is
all-wheel drive gear but it gets up to
60 in 6.1 seconds while delivering 1624
mpg which by the way is considered
pretty good for its class thank you to
the aluminum body and the now
supercharged v6
okay so what's it like driving the XJ
with all-wheel drive and a supercharged
v6 well the first thing I do is I turn
off that auto start-stop because I hate
it it's kind of crude when it starts and
stops you're very aware of it the whole
car shutters and shutters and it sounds
like a car starting which is fine except
it's a Jaguar it's not supposed to have
moments like that the next thing you
notice is this engine is a doll it just
keeps coming great torque very linear
the all-wheel drive in this car starts
off being rear biased it's a rear-wheel
drive car that can activate the front
pause think of it that way this is
definitely not a BMW there's more roll
and there's less Road feedback than
you'll get in a similar competing Beemer
so it's not a car I want to take in a
street fight it's a car I want to take
on a weekend trip that has some great
roads and one last note there's
something about a Jaguar cabin and ride
that really has a different kind of
distinctive soulful luxury to it there's
something sort of quaint sort of
traditional and sort of elegant about
the cabins of these guys do and it's a
nice place to do your business
okay let's price this big black beast
we've got seventy six six as a base
that's four all wheel drive rolled in
there really two options to go CNET
style one is the Meridian audio upgrade
from base Meridian to a hundred and
twenty five watts and 20 speakers and
that's gonna run you twenty three
hundred bucks
then there's adaptive cruise control
that alone is another twenty three
hundred I might leave that one out but
if I rolled it all in we're at eighty
one three CNET style for a car that's
awfully cosseting and has some great
tech as well as a few standout bugs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
