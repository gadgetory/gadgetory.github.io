phone our opening 25 Apple own retail
stores across the u.s. this calendar
year 2000 this is what Quicksilver looks
like and Quicksilver is going to come in
three models they are all very fast what
is ipod i haven't had one right here my
positive effect there it is right there
well rather talk about the future and
this is an amazing device in now with
five gigs that fits in your pocket and
for many customers that's enough to have
their whole digital music library today
we redesign fundamentally the entire
photo the cables the connectors yet even
even the connective of translucent you
should either go with your code name
like we did with the mac or you should
pick a real name quite a bit different
than your code name so I'll probably
stumble and call this ITV five times
today by mistake I apologize Apple TV so
the teenage effects are really great I'm
gonna pick bulge here
and it's a stunner the new wide ipod and
yes it does video and we'd like to show
it to you today for the first time and
we call it the ipad an ipod a phone
these are not three separate devices
this is one device
we are calling it iPhone so let's go
ahead and turn it on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
