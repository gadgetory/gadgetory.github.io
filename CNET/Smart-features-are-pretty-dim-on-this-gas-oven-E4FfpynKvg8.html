43:15 st the cooktop on this LG unit is
really really impressive the ultra heat
burner boils water nearly as fast as
we've ever seen during our boil water
test LG equipped this oven with a
heating element around the convection
fan in the bottom oven however I didn't
find that it made much of an impact when
it came to testing two racks of biscuits
on that convection baking mode the
convection baking tests were especially
disappointing because LG has been
bragging about its probic feature in its
latest line of ovens a biggest
frustration was this ovens app now the
app uses near-field communication in
order to work with the oven what this
means is that you have to have your
device whether it's a tablet or a phone
right next to the oven to access its
features if you're already at the oven
couldn't you just use the oven to access
those features rather than bringing your
tablet or phone to the oven I didn't see
the point
in this app and it was just really
frustrating to get set up and to find
really any use for it I expected a lot
from this lg oven but for $1,899.00 I
wanted a lot more than it gave me to
