is the summer blockbuster spectacular
edition and it's also the one-year
anniversary of our first in studio crave
cast so today we're gonna be looking at
all the new geekier movies and TV shows
that we're excited about going into the
summer season i am your host eric mack
and i'm joined by stephen Beecham Bonnie
Burton Jeff Sparkman and Kelsey atoms in
the cnet studios in San Francisco and
also via the magic of skype from tejas
is new crave minion Danny Gallagher so
we got a bunch of people already in the
YouTube chat room and in the livestream
chat room you can head over those we're
at the YouTube / seen that you'll find
the crave cast link we're broadcasting
live there also livestream.com / cnet go
ahead and join us in those chat rooms
you can also tweet at us at crave and at
erics emac got any comments questions
and I once again and live from my home
town of Taos New Mexico and the
beautiful offices of the award-winning
taos news my hometown newspaper and
one-time employer and in the taos news
this week the paper tackled one of the
topics of our show today the ultimately
important avengers age of ultron and so
now the taos news review you can see
right there of what is arguably the
first summer blockbuster says that it
delivers the goods but they ultimately
didn't find it as good as Captain
America Winter Soldier so i'm not sure
who in our group here is seen this one
but if you if you've seen it agree or
disagree um well first of all I need to
point out my Scarlet Witch t-shirt nice
excellent that bootleggers that like
legit I don't know what you mean Betsy
no good well bubble um okay yeah so I
thought Ultron was entertaining but
ultimately most of the characters were
out of character and I really didn't
like what did with Captain America
particularly however I think a lot of
the complaints about black widow or
unjustified she's been a really key part
of
this whole Marvel Cinematic Universe
she's been key to several of these
movies and I think people are just
willfully not seeing that possibly
because Scarlett Johansson's performance
is so low key maybe or something is it
because I love interest with Hulk is
that white people are like that I think
that's part of it yeah anyway so to my
bona fides here are that on my bedside
table where other people keep a photo
their family I have a DVD of winter
soldier so if you with my opinion is
this is literally true I could show you
photos it framed no okay cuz I need to
be watching so bright okay is it going
to be able to snuggle with it yeah maybe
oh oh yeah I think wieder so my word was
better I'm not touching Sparkman's seen
it I don't judge yeah I saw it what do
you think it was cool Wow oak smash I
thought you need Hulk smash I haven't
seen it Simon seen I haven't seen any
I'm still behind i still haven't seen
Thor too cuz i'm not a big Natalie
Portman fan it's not that great uh I'm
big Loki fan though sighs she watchin I
does have a good look II scenes yeah so
I'm Way behind so when I watch age I'm
not behind on agents of shield but of
course when they give spoilers on agents
of shield from the movies I'm like oh ok
he's alive okay he's not dead okay that
was a spoiler I guess oh I guess I
should be shocked so if you're watching
agents of shield know that you might
want to watch all those movies including
Ultron cuz i guess the most recent
agents of shield they give away but
Stefan Ultron i just i glossed over me I
was just like okay whatever I know k is
it wrong that I've kind of been avoiding
agents of shield because I feel like I
have to watch every movie no cuz like i
said well i did I haven't watched I
haven't watched any of them like I'm not
caught up with movies there really isn't
that much crossing over that's people
complained about that they wanted more
crossing over but yeah right that's what
I was taking my mios and stuff but not
really that big a deal okay it just
feels like you have to read I hate
reading footnotes so no no please feel
like giant hole size and just read fan
of fiction fan fictions better so just
do that you'll get caught up okay you'll
be totally misinformed but it'll be nice
for Sherlock for example yeah anyway
yeah so I feel like our the group takes
scene then seems to be almost as
unhelpful
he went why were here do you want a fun
watchable movie it is certainly that
they packed in a huge amount of stuff
they did pack in character arcs they're
just out of character and lots of action
and I mean there are three different
women who talk I mean it's it's a good
movie huh it's just not as good as
Winterson I will say though that I know
that there's been a lot of talk about
the collectibles because there's no
black widow figure and then the target
commercial that shows them all in action
is missing Black Widow and that you're
like wait a minute and then the scene
where she throws a car or something or
something happens big time in the movie
and they replace her with another of the
Avenger male characters with the toy oh
she comes out of a helicopter on a
motorcycle that's it and they replace
that with one of the dudes because you
know the dudes have all the toys so he
rides a motorcycle earlier in the movie
and I guess that no one would know but
if you do follow mark ruffalo who plays
the Hulk if you follow him on Twitter he
did post on twitter twitter to marvel
hey where's our Black Widow actually my
daughter once my daughter wants it so i
think it's hopefully Marvel and hasbro
listening and know that there are female
characters deserve as many action
figures as the dudes i really want to
know why people are complaining about
Black Widow so much and I'm not hearing
people talking about how great Scarlet
Witch was is this to me I thought the
movie was all about her that's what I
thought too and I haven't heard anything
about scarlet witch from fans really
maybe they're waiting because the next
movie is gonna have more of her in it I
don't know man this had her hero shot
decided blowing the doors open yeah no
no that's why I have a t-shirt yeah well
oh well I'm gonna go see it again next
all right so we'll move on to the movie
I've seen I think I'm the only one who's
seen ex machina did anyone else see that
one no I want to see I want to see it
how good was it it was really good it
was it was thoroughly entertaining we
had to decide between Mad Max and ex
machina they both had really good
reviews Mad Max seems to have great
reviews mainly for the performances and
the action sequences but ex machina had
a really good story pretty good take on
you know why we should be scared of AI
yeah and also some nice uh you know a
gentle satirize ation of Silicon Valley
no I'm trying to be have you seen
diamond I'm curious about this because I
haven't seen this movie but I've seen
the machine
and I've seen robo Mata which is also i
mean i've also no matter the one with
them with any event yeah that one so
rato mata and the machine also have and
the Machine I thought was very close to
what I saw in the trailer of this
because obvious that female AI and
there's story it's not like a romance
but there's that kind of level of
empathy going on and it was just
interesting and so I'm definitely
excited to see this movie I think we're
going to see more and more movies like
this too as people start exploring a I
more as a possibility in real life I
just I've seen all three of those and
this would be my favorite of all three
and I like and I liked all three but
this is probably the it has the least
action and the most kind of thinking
going on and and some really you're like
that just to was Ernie was like was
there any kind of shoutouts to Blade
Runner and replicants and that whole
discussion of do replicants have you
know like any kind of rights and that
sort of thing or was it a strictly no
they I know there's some there's a lot
of ethical and moral discussion going on
for sure that's actually a big part of
it I just think it's interesting this
came out and chappy came out very close
to each other and chappies more about a
robot with a I and this is more about a
humanoid robot Android replicant type
thing right right right and it's you
know the first movie directed by alex
garland who of the what do you do the
beach and he did some other stuff more
recently for those that have seen alex
garland movie since 1997 but yeah I I
give it I give it two thumbs up for sure
I'm dominicks in the new Star Wars so
you know was that true yeah yeah Dominic
license in the new Star Wars so hmm
excellent yay so so I think a few of you
saw the one that I passed on to see ex
machina though which is mad max um what
fury road right that's what is you saw
that Danny saw this and I realized
everybody on twitter has been blowing up
about how this is worth waiting 30 years
it's the best action movie of ever and
so on right what do you think ya tell us
you me um I don't like to use
superlatives but this is the greatest
thing my eyes have ever seen
no no this was so much fun and I mean I
kind of a naturally wary of hype because
whenever someone tells me oh you have to
go see this i read a review that's like
oh this is a greatest thing ever you
know my mind is kind of like okay it
can't deliver this this that this gets
there this is like the way I look at it
is like it's totally a fan movie it's
totally for fans of the man max trilogy
but it moves so fast that like you could
know nothing about Mad Max and still
enjoy it so I was following I was
following the stunt woman that was in
this as playing charlize theron stunt
woman oh yeah she posted a bunch of
stuff on Twitter of just all because
they did a lot of them did their own
stunts and a lot of the stunt people got
thrashed so I just was curious what you
thought about the stunts did you think
they were believable that were they
interesting enough that they did they
capture your attention or was it a
little over the top with the violence it
was I mean it's it's when when you look
at the characters the violence is kind
of justified because you have this you
have this great villain I can't remember
the guy who plays the toecutter but it's
the same actor oh I'm gonna get reamed
for this oh I can't remember gonna hear
any weeds now okay that's what the chat
rooms for ya mom look it up on IMDb for
me right now i would google it but i'm
not typing toecutter into search in case
i gots a google image i don't want to
see but no the guy too many the
characters and the plot justify the
violence cuz you again if you know the
lore and you know right where r it's
like okay yeah the people are in stained
and resources are depleted and you know
one person can kind of owned by the way
and I just I just as a side note you
just saw the the giant ant playing war I
don't know what you call him like
basically like he's the the war drummer
guitar guy the guar I'm just totally
shredding not true that's gone right
there if anything she knew that was
coming yeah but when I saw that in the
theater yeah we got to be very careful
but I would say this i laughs I laughed
my son
thing off okay your spleen yeah let us
say much whatever comes in pairs um I am
i fired no I'm okay lots of things i
dint Paris like I saw that I knew that
images come when I saw it on the screen
and it was that big and there's fire
shooting it that's like every heavy
metal fantasy I've ever had yeah it's
like a rhino Stein concert it is or
alice cooper's the wild boys videos get
out that was it look yeah okay looks
like in the filming of this the the
camera people were always moving
backwards is that shouldn't you be I
mean it the thing I love about it is it
just starts and it just goes it doesn't
it doesn't bog it down with exposition
because it's very kind of a very
familiar you know he loses his family
and he's mad yeah it is max I mean
that's all you need to know and it just
starts and goes and just does not I mean
there are some points where it gets
heavy but it doesn't and I think that's
important to the story cuz you know it
just did I think would be just a big
dumb movie did you see ya did you see in
human vision or 3d certain 3d a shot at
the mo drafthouse nice yes question so I
really I I love Mad Max Beyond
Thunderdome I mean I do want to see this
and I love action movies but with the
blender thing I think I revealed my
problem with extreme torture and
violence how like on a scale from beyond
thunderdome to John Carter's ghosts of
mars or beyond where would you put this
um it's really not very brutal so like
between temple of doom and saw bloody
man there's bloody like there's heart
coming out mola Ram style and then
there's like creative is the culture
Terry yeah I I would put it below temple
of doom how many limbs how many limbs
are lost finest movie I'm dance ah wait
no wait no there is one but its a
spoiler moment not I don't tell Toto but
it's like about it look like it doesn't
have to be I mean it's violent and it's
loud and it's yeah you know ok that's
what's about me but it's not like it
saves it saves its violent moments so
perfectly like it doesn't
it doesn't have to be a big blood orgy
doesn't have to show you limbs flying
okay drive it home goodbye Lucy the more
I won't say what it was there is one
pretty blade moment that that's key but
it's it knows how to pick its moments is
what i like and i have heard to that
it's like if there's there's kind of
moments where there's almost like a
feminist kind of feel to it too which is
always I always like action movies with
strong female characters and there's
plenty of them in this movie of hurt so
yeah obviously Charlene's a great
example of that but then the brides as
well so yeah she's great in it I mean
they have kind of you know they have to
have the bride's it's kind of like the
feminine but even they have some of
their moments they grow you know kind of
badass good warrior fighters which isn't
a good way to say it but um I'm sold I'm
gonna go see this just forget I don't
get the guys movement about why they
hate the the strong female character so
I could have stopped you could have
stopped at the work after the word
movement I don't know where that's
coming from cuz it's just so weird to me
because it's like horror sci-fi and
fantasy have all had strong female
characters I mean Ripley wherever's from
aliens and the first alien movie was in
nineteen seventy 1979 so it's like I
don't know why we're talking about this
now when we've had strong female
characters and all of these genres even
before the 70s I mean I deck it's
anonymous anonymous people with voices I
know I think it's just some I think it's
just angry dudes that just suddenly
found a podcast station to talk on so I
don't know that's just we just we all
need somebody to love I know anyway so
thank you for because i am so i am so
super excited for mad max I've been
excited ever since think geeks April
first fake kids mobiles water bottles
yeah yeah I wish I'd said to see you the
drafthouse had one of those little power
wheels oh and i and i wedged my big fat
you know what there and i think i broke
it sorry dude it's on my face i wish i
wish i wish i should have thought to
share that with you cuz it's it's
hilarious and my hair looks a lot better
than it doesn't that's yeah I love that
time
I love the Mad Max kid thing that they
did so thank you i will watch that for
sure yes good four thumbs up yay alright
so next on our list I don't know what to
say about this next one too much it's I
don't know too much about it I know
Disney Clooney Tomorrowland that's about
all I know yeah I feel too we have the
trailer Stephen it's like well it's
supposed to be like a willy wonka type
thing right it's like a future is like a
optimistic future is amazing section of
the park right but yeah oh yeah cuz
they're building a whole park out of it
oh look how serious Clooney is no looked
at kalyan who's on last month it's gonna
do us a review of this is just like
Tomorrowland they have riots at
tomorrowland at Disney World yeah in the
future Spanish grass will cover the way
Greene's video app in that takes you to
Kansas great okay I'm too jaded to
appreciate I appreciate her boots they
really wanted to make the book and it
Disney World they just have lines
everywhere yeah Tomorrowland of lines
the lines of tomorrow are vertically
George Clooney comes up like do you want
to see the trans mafia later well here's
a fastpass I could think I might i think
i might be too old and jaded to go see
this but i know there's so many disney
fans excited for this film so as good as
a review i've been seeing is you're
gonna roll your eyes a lot yeah unless
you're a disney fan and there are plenty
of adult disney fans out there who are
gonna love this so a disney theme park
fan and I I kind of had my doubts about
though really oh yeah like I mean I'll
go and be a big dumb kid and yeah
because because they serve alcohol now
which is that space mountain yes yeah I
think there's gonna be plenty of Easter
eggs of the parks and this I'm sure see
is there a text this is based on is
there a book I missed or something or
just tight on the ride just the rise
deception didn't be a carousel of
progress you remember parts of the
Caribbean rate that way
yeah that was a ride and then they made
it into this huge battery yeah sure I've
disturbs me about this is that
eventually Disney's gonna run out of
parts of the theme park your turn into
movies I say run out I mean like are we
gonna see like like a horror movie
called the line I hope such a Hollywood
hotel stay out yeah will be people who
are trapped on Tom Sawyer's Island and
well you know for the bathroom they're
doing a movie too small world you guys
do that right yeah yeah they announced
that last year small world what's
happening it was a whole list of movies
all of us are like what like they're
doing a monopoly movie they're doing a
candle and movie there's a hey candy
land did I just say that I hate candy
land oh wait cuz we snakes and ladders
man dressage I am tired of these months
anyway um no can you land I'm just
saying that game sucks when you're a
little kid and you're colorblind because
every time yeah all i have to say sad
anyway small where I'm supposed to
happen so mmm that could be you know
what's not a small world is the new
movie Jurassic world that's why he's the
host ah which and I am confused a little
bit about where Jurassic world exists in
the the universe here you check it's on
something right but is it sure is it in
a world that we're Jurassic Park
happened and then this is afterwards
they picked up the pieces and rebuilt it
yeah I yeah I what company was I think
was an engine that was the original
company that tried to build the park or
is this a new company I don't remember
the second Jurassic Park so was that
jurassic park that was like in united
states was like basically they had if i
remember cuz my I was actually talking
my dad about this that the the second
book / movie was a separate island off
of Island I'll island new new bar i
think it was called yeah where's
basically like their backup dinosaurs
yeah first movie in the real and they
and they they nuked of the island in the
right can between the first in a second
yeah uh Richard Attenborough's
characters like a we've got we've got
these we've got these
sirs I guess there's a big glass thing
they had to break to get him out or
something like they had basically like a
reserve island of dinosaurs and so um
cuz the first one went so well right oh
we totally got it covered this and then
there was a third one or is this the
third one third one this is the third
okay the third one was somebody needed a
directional my problem Colonel frontier
director make a movie yeah you know
after the first one the villain is the
humans like they should not be doing
this you know it's I don't know humans
ever learn we never know we never learn
you know everything ask ruler it's like
you're going to the movie knowing these
people are stupid our heroes just
brought this on themselves it just makes
me mad well except for Chris Pratt he's
gonna say to us because this is
basically a very long audition for the
next Indiana Jones movie that is because
that fast yeah well that's the best fast
that's a mustache so I'm not sure that
it's really but I kind of want to see
this because what my plan is i'll see
Tomorrowland and hate it and wish luck
man I wish there were dinosaurs yeah in
part Marlon ants yes then I'll go see
this and be like this is a movie i
wanted i wish i could have seen first
yeah I'll go see this I remember seeing
Jurassic Park when it came out in
theaters and I just and I was an adult I
mean I adult but in college I think and
that scared the crap out of me so I yeah
I'm excited for this well you know to
tie it all together if you go back and
read some of our cnet stories from a
couple weeks ago I wrote one about you
know there's an actual effort underway
to bring back the woolly mammoth and
there's there's a lab at home there's a
lab at Harvard where they plan to do it
in about the next five years yeah two
and then we'll have woolly woolly world
no that's the thing that's what you
would think right that's what I know you
risk miss I think what it really is
about is about trying to bring back
woolly mammoths to Siberia to try to
bring back grasslands to lock in the
permafrost to slow down climate change
so really what they want to do is create
that grassland from Tomorrowland that's
cool but I so it's all interconnected
man when you said they're bringing
woolly mammoths to Siberia I was like
please say they're gonna use him to
fight Putin me it we have a lot of we
supposedly have a lot of Russians in our
chat room
so feel free russian viewers to chime in
on how you would like to have woolly
mammoths spread across your vast country
because I think that would be an
interesting thing to chat about I I
imagine there will be a lot of sweaters
yeah I I just wonder how how do they
taste not the Russians the woolly
mammoths sorry here's the key question
will they have ray Romano's voice god I
hope so I hope so you know chat room is
also interesting right now for the
phenomenon of people showing up taking
the time to come watch to tell us they
don't have time for this nobody got time
for this I don't have time for this i'm
here yeah hey fine make time we all have
24 hours it just depends on how you use
it that's all I'm saying nice resist
okay so comic book people fantastic for
God which is huh this one confuses me
Kelsey you had some thoughts on this we
boot right yeah cuz we already first one
slot mmhmm yeah the one with you and
Griffith who I still love but now don't
because those movies were so terrible
wasn't it from the shield the guy that
was like a Michael Chiklis what's
amazing is chris evans who's so good as
Captain America was so hateful as Johnny
torch I've never thought was the same
guy but it is and he's not disguised and
all there anyone interesting yeah he's a
total bro in the first two yeah he's
horrible but that is not I'm sorry I
apologize to bros but um but that is not
the movie we're talking about it's
already really different oh yeah
Fantastic Four movie I'm sorry did I
cross along boys yeah Holly fan for
stick is they actually appear to have
title did man what fan for stick that
okay what they put the four in for the a
so it's like Fanta 400 fan-forced it
okay just really difficult so yeah I
know where they so what a bit version
what's the dudes in this was the guy in
the movie about the little boy he wants
to dance ballet right yeah and the girl
was in house of cards as a corner yeah
this is lose who would work upcoming
like I've causes twenty-something actors
who aren't household names but you
recognize that basically was the driver
would lash yeah and there was Ben the
doctor just Reggie kathy was was a Frank
Underwood's down the BBQ restaurant that
Frank Underwood went to
how's the card so here's the thing I
don't know anything about the comics of
this group is this movie's supposed to
be more like the comics or they ignoring
the first ones were more like the comics
cuz they they're cheesier white yeah
like it's like it it's okay I can't it's
like trying to do it's like if you turn
Archie comics into madman desk soap
operas oh my god you're on to something
that is the best idea I've ever heard
I'm saying but this is like mrs. issue
yeah this and kiss feels like you're
trying to add a gritty reboot to to
something that's just kind of big dumb
comic fun yeah and they made them all
look younger than I that's a CW show
basically doesn't it I'm not saying that
in a bad way because i watch pretty much
everything on CW so I'm Pro CW I'm just
saying this is this being in a bad way
this it feels like you can totally do
that that's fine I'm just saying it
feels like a CW show so whether you hate
CW or left CW I think we can all agree
it kind of feels like a CW show like I
mean the first two were bad but I kind
of expected that like the refrigerant
was bad yeah there was a silver surfer
oh yeah oh you try watching with the
rifftrax know it does oh yeah yeah
alright the first expected to be bad but
it's like well I'm watching it cuz I
want it to be comic book bad yeah you
want to know it was like Tim Burton
Batman right that bad we talking about
no I'm winner great fight well then so
the next one on our list if we can agree
that that's just a CW show on the big
screen the next one is what I really see
as a great American success story in
which an Austrian becomes a robot and
then becomes the governor and then goes
back to being a robot oh ok let me tell
you my theory is very moving where are
we terminator genisys oh ok ok so here's
how I see this movie the Khaleesi sorry
you know how Terminator 2 was for people
who thought Terminator one was fun but
they thought the robot was the coolest
part so they said hey let's make that
movie again but have the robot be the
hero right yeah so then this trailer
seems to be my how I figure they made
this up as they're like okay I love
Terminator 2 everything except for that
kid I hate that shit wouldn't it be
great if Sarah Connor and the term ater
would team up and just hunt that kid
with a shotgun and the Terminator 3 was
with the hot robot right the hot girl
right so I figured somebody said this
person you know what okay so my watch
dad somebody said this is critical okay
yeah this series is always interrogated
humanity and and it would make sense of
jungle those are eventually started to
combine the two and they're like yeah
whatever just just have his mom on him
down and kill him that's all I want to
see there she is basically for everybody
that watched Rambo and wish she'd just
step on a claymore haha it's also kinda
like aliens you know well you can't
really have a gun in an enemy without
eventually saying we're all one and
heroes know right same yeah I mean I
think that's pretty played out at that
point really covered by this that's a
good way to cook I mean I'm i'm just
literally confused of who I'm supposed
to be rooting for at this point like I
don't know they could try to make it
confusing really I have anybody explode
my guess John Connor the guy I'm like a
circle clear is it the robot and you're
trying to kind of redeem him is it
Skynet is the hero now like I have no
idea what going on for america america
we're Cylons the hero is our governor is
the H is a terminator aging do they have
aging technology wonder about aging
technology and robots because we're
gonna have this problem with Harrison
Ford and the blade runner he will never
get older okay sorry yeah cuz I mean
Harrison Ford is not the same deck with
it so they don't have a younger one and
a younger terminator in this one like
look like what they did with tron the
less Tron they CGA out CDI everything
yeah st. coming up in the trailer I
thought I saw ya kinda looks about 13 to
anybody else but this is that her ain't
supposed to be like a younger Sarah
Connor that I know and there's a young
arnold right there yeah they put him in
there you go there's your answer they
just snuck him in yeah this has got to
be the most confusing University
franchise really I am genuinely confused
I have no idea who
I'm gonna go they go through all these
different times you know like different
period the day the Terminator pretending
to be other terminators it's like
whenever they screw up like they sent
him back in time and he didn't kill him
right so I'm like okay we got to do
something else we got to go back further
and every time you get changing reality
yeah yeah yeah it's like back to the
future it's like butterfly wings was
that show what I isagoo shutter Flicka
what if I thanks sorry girl eat it up
sorry butterfly kisses with ashton
kutcher that's Steve Jobs movie was my
kisses kisses a fact I would watch that
I totally would next summer get this
song out of my head gonna fly through
these movies we got like 20 bottom line
next so next is ant-man which we've
talked about before but we have the
trailer talked about it why is it
against a man next why are you mad let's
just skipping up mad late it's only fans
oh right haters nobody love Paul Rudd
all rights great it's just this I just
don't understand how ant-man's cool
ant-man's never cool the reason why it's
cool because it's a very it's very like
not very popular comic book so they're
taking very obscure comic books and
trying to bring them out and make the
story I will wait four hours to get out
cool howard the duck gets cooler already
that once they're gonna do it again
really yeah oh my you know howard the
duck was the first yeah it'll be a
duckling I'm sorry I mean I I love Paul
Rudd I think this cast looks amazing I'm
a big fan of the wasp I loved her I love
that the original ant-man was and the
wasp or the Avengers creators there are
the founders of the vengers if you read
these comics they have a very
interesting origin story and backstory I
just find this movie silly because we
may do this is bearded silly but yeah it
is totally so mean after Liberace he's
never gonna be able to take you can't
take him seriously I'm are high heaven I
have a special kind of hate for him in
because I'm mad that Edgar Wright huh
yeah me too I like to me there wouldn't
you wouldn't have this obscure comic
book movie without cuz he was like i
don't remember though we've been working
on it for 10 years or eight years or
something crazy wanna make and he picked
this one that
no one would ever make a movie about and
and we just get the same cookie cutter
comic book movie that I'm frankly tired
of yeah I want to see what he's training
with ants I think this I want to see how
fuzz stop yeah me too training with ends
though did you read that article at
simon pegg got interviewed today is
saying that comic book movies are
dumbing us down and I kept thinking dude
all of your movies are done in funny
movies and you just wrote the new Star
Trek you probably should shut up Simon
right you made how to lose friends and
influence you made us stupid yeah so
anyway Rachel and man is not most
excited about MN look to the west yes
movie what's that I said I agree with
what Bonnie said but I still have a bro
crush on Simon Pegg and Nick Frost I do
too I love Simon Pegg and Nick fur I
mean here's the thing like the trio of
Edgar Wright Simon Pegg and Nick Frost I
think they should do as many movies as
possible I wish we could just throw
money at them and make them do stuff for
our amusement frankly I want to see Nick
Frost is ant-man oh god I'm not to think
of what good character he could play
though it would be a fun superhero
character for him and there's just I
don't I don't know I mean he's a funny
guy too so i could make fat joke now but
i want no he would have been better you
would actually have been better in the
next movie which conceptually is awesome
it's called pixels it hasn't gotten a
lot of press oh the video game video and
were we're we're aliens take the form of
video games that we have sent out into
space I know through an Adam Sandler for
once isn't doing Adam Sandler's Adam
Sandler he's actually that Marcus and he
kind of is though is he okay nevermind
what's adam sandler and kevin lady
pac-man and ms pac kevin is a movie yeah
it's both of them that they're like the
last two people want to see in this
movie yeah but I want to see the movie
because it's awesome concept yeah it's
basically we sent out all this Seto just
watch trailer that's not a light playing
yeah yeah yeah it's kind of like galaxy
quest where the aliens basically they
believed what we sent out but they
thought right the wrong way and now
they're sending these video game
characters after us to destroy the earth
so how can we do not get attacked by
giant pongs that's it there no
it's in the trailer i think its Qbert
attacking yes but Hubert would never
attack there's a trailer q'bert's in it
its customers revenge he's gonna jump
haha by the way apprecia mini yeah look
at that look at that glory and the minis
are the ghosts just so you know cuz
we've been talking to the trailer I'm
worried about the comedy in this cuz i
remember i'm sure you all remember a
futurama my name all the games so i
don't remember that one nothing like
donkey kong dong what was the one before
that i don't remember the 14 I don't
know you have to reward like uh had a
thought my lost ah as I said a centipede
they'd yeah galleries in there pac-man
yeah there's a ghost he goes yeah
product placement yeah Dinklage is a
mess yeah I'll see King but there's your
palm yeah there it is guys huh pong was
using I think we are all gonna die
alright that's combat really that's
adam-san are not so sorry that sims no
kidding uh this minecraft logo yeah
flanker well i don't think i do
minecraft though the logos aircraft it's
all a tease oh no that's all old old
school games yeah and then the intendo
creator you will see a pac-man creator
oh we talk to him you can say really
hammer an actor no i think that's really
him i don't know i just like to pretend
this is awful yeah I kind of know how
this is gonna this is pixelated I'm it's
mixed up blood
blood but you know Dinklage is great let
mullets amazing yeah that's the thing I
feel abandoned like Josh GAD and Peter
Dinklage yeah grated disks and then I'm
like why the hell are adam sandler and
kevin because you know what Adam sound
was probably paying for it cuz the
doodling in money this is probably know
that for this what I'm saying if we
looked at all look at that I'm in love
if I was ever gonna have a am in love
never been so torn about a movie I've
never been so turned on all right lost
in the wrong movie though yes we've got
time for just a few TV shows Supergirl
we have just about Supergirl I think of
everything this is actually the only
thing that actually excites me uh so you
have to any of the trailer for Supergirl
it's very long trailer may be just put
it on a talk but yeah who's excited we
find if the trailer first because the
trailers devil wears prada with a cape
and I don't care how many people are
gonna yell at me for saying this but
when you watch the Super Girl trailer
the beginning it's like okay she's Dino
being sent away it's kind of a Superman
there he is Superman my cousin blah blah
blah it's great this looks awesome what
how great this is get it quickly her mom
is the chick from Nashville that left
the show this is great can't wait and
then all of a sudden it's an office
comedy my Starbucks Oh herb are
disgusted is a devil wears prada Calista
Flockhart ya baba Zilla I have a rental
benefits anyway places to play the same
ease of the newspapers you got nerdy
glasses I'm sorry yeah I'm sorry cute
guy can't go on again with you what the
Betty come in oh wait no just look look
at this look at Calista look at Ally
McBeal she's she's like gained one pound
so far since the 80's 90's whatever
she's still with us yeah yep yep she's
mrs. Ford that'll be new and different
yeah exciting hi I'm a klutz oh so Jimmy
Olsen's in Africa Cassandra six minutes
but ok so i guess trailer it's a first
love girl right yeah right oh god my
ovaries hurt so here I thing here I'm
just gonna say my quick spiel and then
you guys can all say how much you love
the show but
I think Supergirl is an awesome
character and I've loved her since like
the original 80s version from you know
when it was crappy then too but here's
the thing we don't have a lot of great
female lead shows with superheroes agent
Carter's not a superhero she's awesome
but she's not a superhero practically
but I know what you're saying Buffy was
never a superhero she's practically but
she was totally soon no no not a DC
Marvel superhero that's fun it's not a
yeah or any what I'm saying a part of
like with a cape or a costume not like a
typical awesome strong female character
we're talking just wonder woman maybe
Xena counts I don't know ionic woman
Bionic Woman we haven't had a lot of
this so it's really important we get
this right because if it's done wrong
we're never gonna get another chance
because Wonder Woman we didn't even get
to see that it was so bad the pilot I
saw the pilot so and that likes told us
for five years or something crazy this
better be good or we're never gonna get
anything again she is writing a plan
she's writing a play a bad guy or she's
just saving people from she's saving
general from tragedies this there will
be a bad guy this is where she pouts are
sorry but here's the thing w no no so
she's outing herself as Supergirl right
now I was like oh my god it's just like
Superman but she's kid girl but she's
like hey so she's watching this on the
couch she sees herself and giggles
because she has her own hashtag okay
it's annoying and there's the thing it
would be a great CW show but this is CBS
this is mainstream we need to do this oh
wait a sec Supergirl should we be care k
this is the part watch this part
shouldn't you be called super woman what
do you think is so bad about girl I'm a
girl
and your boss and powerful and rich and
hot and smart so if you perceive
Supergirl as anything less than
excellent isn't the real problem you is
this a good time for me to take why I
hate this so very very way to go on okay
here's to do they took the language of
girl power right and they twisted it if
I say I choose to embrace being a girl I
think being a girl is great hey that's
empowering if I say no you have to call
yourself a girl because he wanting to be
a woman threatens me because I'm a lot
older than you and I'm still calling
myself the girl so I need to take away
your power that's not empowering and now
they put that scene in as a lampshade to
explain why it's called that but also so
that people could be like Oh feminists
got told you know yeah quit complaining
nobody wants you with your women in this
show you've all the women don't want you
in this show get out you know I saw
people doing that in the comments on
Barney's oh my god yeah this is why they
put that seen it and it's insidious and
that makes me very nervous you want to
see the evil of why I'm talking about
why the show really needs to be done
well and done right because we're gonna
get the worst backlash ever of see this
is why we can't have female character
just superheroes read my cnet article
because the comments is just like the
dregs of society hate me for bringing up
this is like Devil Wears Prada and I
bring up this is exactly like this SNL
spoof of the Black Widow movie trailer
it really is yeah what I thought someone
did a frame-by-frame comparison and it
was almost exactly and then there's
another blog that went on to say hey
girls relax don't be all uptight about
this blah blah on a feminist blog and
the dude and it was written by a dude
and it's like don't tell me not to freak
out like I'm gonna freak out I'm a girl
I want superhero characters that I can
relate to I don't mind rom-coms I love
girly movie we like fun we like I'm a
FEMINIST who likes fun but don't screw
with Supergirl she doesn't have to be
super dark she can have fun like Buffy
had fun Xena had fun but don't make her
a joke don't make her into a CW
character if it's not a CW show don't
make this gilmore girls with a cape and
by the way I love gilmore girls make
this make this actually make sense for
the audience and I don't think CBS knows
what their demographic is with this show
so I'm a little worried but the next day
after this horrible first look was
passed CBS showed another clip that just
had all the action and no girly stuff no
hey I wish I had a date but on time cuz
i have to say the world no you're not a
girl you're a woman no I'm a woman I'm a
girl like none of that crap there was no
frappuccino moments there was no awkward
date moments there's no cleanse moments
there was all this sounds cool right i
mean yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna give it a
try obviously i'm just hoping that it'll
be better I'll support it but i
guarantee you CBS is gonna cancel this i
can almost bet my hands on it it just
feels like they weren't way too safe
yeah you know but i won't give them
points for making Jamie Olson into James
Olson and having him be african-american
so at least it's sorted diverse can I
just ask how many days is it take it to
watch this trailer oh we've orange like
how long has just been running it sorry
Wednesday oh here here's the end yeah
so you know I'm what ironically now that
we've been ripping on the CW there is a
more badass a female character in the CW
show tomorrow um and I totally forgot
the name of the character that's in the
trenches all right come on hot girl
alrighty to my white canary white canary
yeah she came back I did she would cuz
she'd spoiler I said she would spoilers
she oh yeah she gets washed in the hot
tub that the League of Assassins has as
flash calls it the hot tub but it's like
I'm sorry Azeris pit yeah that it's some
sort of water that brings you back to
life is it really called the Lazarus Pit
yeah that's the Lazarus Pit that's what
ratio al Ghul used yeah yeah yeah stay
alive yep and that's how arrows sister
stays alive to come back ok sorry
spoiler oh I thought we are watching the
Super Girl I didn't know it ended no but
here's the thing because by shows are in
the DC Universe they had said there
might be some crossovers with Supergirl
in the flash and I think Vanity Fair aw
has a picture of them together so yeah
they did a cover yeah yeah was do I
think oh my god this actually looks good
iron man was it no now that's a man
which is DC's version of Moqaddas DMD
autumn yeah I was I was blurry it was
laura girls awesome ok that white
Canaries great she came back so cool
and that's the same actress actually
that was playing yeah doesn't act the
second version of canary on era well her
sister took over the canary man tall
narrow well no no but directly two
actresses playing right the sister right
not just yeah yeah I got it okay side
note i think was Hawkgirl in the last
injustice game yeah she was she was
actually one of my favorite playable
characters well now you get to see Rahab
adventures now now I get to now I get to
not be interacting with you can rape the
other fictions that's not me and that's
what fanfictions for who's gonna pick
Amy for that okay what's next what sex
oh I said pre to just to preempt the
comments that people will leave the Adam
came before a min okay thanks why I'm
here that's our here and it's and it's
not iron man I'm sorry yeah so many men
you should be sorry for that so many
costumes it was very I can see I'm
hoping we can agree that the last two
shows on my list should just go away no
oh my god I loved it it was on a dress
for the trailer okay where's the thing
it's not I no one behind the show except
for Geoff Johns has ever read the comic
I think because the comic is one of the
longest-running comics from vertigo
which is a DC imprint and it has not
it's not a police procedural at all the
comic this is a police show because
apparently every single comic that we
love has to be turned into a cop show in
order to be a TV show like a zombie cuz
I zombies not a cop procedural but
that's doing great just for a minute
they look like a reboot of dynasty on
those yes he does so this is Tom Ellis a
British actor that's plain Lucifer he's
doing a good job at least he's British
at least I didn't like give an American
boys cuz he's supposed to be British in
the comic so must be blond kind of like
a David Bowie guy bomb cool with this
and he's actually really good at being
swarmy which Lucifer is Lucifer is kind
of a douchebag but yeah name like
Lucifer right oh but he's a charming
douchebag and the whole premise of the
show is that he gets people to tell them
their innermost desires so he's really
good at interviewing suspects except for
the cop that he's working with he can't
read her thoughts or anything so that's
why she's intriguing to him
hmm cuz he she doesn't you know fall for
his charms so you know of course that's
traditional they do that a lot like a
true blood did yeah yeah true blood that
pretty much any any show where someone
can read your mind but they suddenly
can't read your mind like oh I don't
know it's a spin on the old romance I've
you're the one grows not chasing Vampire
Diaries or I don't know there's so many
shows like that but anyway it looks good
because some of the characters are
pretty awesome that's the Archangel so
basically whole premise so you get he
quits hell and comes to LA and runs a
piano bar this is so insanely carnival
Reimer but that yeah but he doesn t but
that's what there's blow shins come in
yeah this doesn't last though does it
well here's the thing i don't think it's
gonna last because it's on it's on
regular TV right or is this a chance
yeah fox is gonna talk about it Robert
yeah do it oxxo get religious Fox cancel
shows premature I don't know cuz sleepy
hollow was made into a police show and
that's it pretty well ABC is the king of
canceling stuff though like I've given
up like I don't think a bees I don't
trust ABC like I looked through all the
ABC shows that are happening isn't the
Frankenstein code on maybes here is that
Fox yeah I don't trust any of this they
just they just got done gut their
schedule and she did when you watch all
these up fronts like when i watch TV
previews I'm like should I watch it or
I'm gonna jinx it cuz I'm pretty
concerned I don't want to waste time on
the season if they're gonna cancel it
halfway through yeah so I don't think
Lucifer's gonna stay cuz it's it's kind
of Constantine concentrate hellblazer
the comic amazing comic also from
vertigo and it just lost it it's weird
cuz it just started getting good right
as they canceled it so well that was NBC
NBC never knows when they have a good
true yeah but that was based on a comic
that's very much like Lucifer and then
we have preacher coming but that's I
don't know if that's gonna be on cable
so that's who knows that might have more
legs that might have more legs can like
The Walking Dead where you have a little
bit more freedom to be violent and I see
what you did there 30 alright so so
final word um I'm gonna take two final
words mine is heroes reborn just forget
about not
that shouldn't happen and now we can all
take another final word which is let's
go around and say what we're most
excited about for the summer of
everything we've talked about Danny why
don't you start oh did me last cuz
that's right about Kelsey for the summer
or just like tomorrow I guess I don't
know what Mad Max obviously okay legends
of tomorrow mad max um Jeff what excites
you the most but everything we talked
about nothing i'm dead and so oh the
legends of tomorrow sounds pretty cool
especially now that they're gonna let
the atom actually shrink there you go um
i don't know like i am excited i'm sort
of excited about Lucifer by know they're
gonna cancel its I don't get my hopes up
actually if all the up fronts and this
none of this ship the shows not even
gonna happen until 2016 and lucifer's
not happen until 2016 but I was most
excited about the Muppets so I just want
the muppet show so excited they're doing
it documentary style I think it's gonna
be hilarious bill preity from Big Bang
Theory's writing it co-writing it it's
gonna be amazing so I'm all Muppets so
that's like the most Ungava i can say
but I freaking love Muppet so the
Muppets Muppets Gotham ogre kata Mabus
the surprise vote for Muppets okay I'll
go along with Mad Max cuz that the sales
job everyone did was too much to pass up
Danny people you get the last last word
Danny Danny okay new guy um I'm gonna
have to go with Magic Mike XXL no no no
please make that be either that or
vacation no no it's there's there's not
enough whiskey in the world to me
totally no offense um no I'm really
excited two pictures I'm really excited
that pic stars coming back with a new
movie inside out looks great and I just
love that they cast Lewis Black is anger
I think that's you can't do better than
that and what was the other one oh and
train wreck I know I'm going outside of
the geek realm no that's cool I'm a big
I'm a big Amy Schumer fan and that
actually looks good cuz she wrote it too
yeah she wrote it that happens now may
finally get a movie that people will see
and I feel like she's a new Amy Poehler
I don't know if I should say that but
she
just feel like she's everywhere now like
I searing so much stuff from the TV show
from Stan's she's doing another stand-up
show she has this movie coming out and
she has like a book coming out looks
just like all over the place so it's
kind of cool to see that she's got a
beverage coming out I'm just glad none
of you so I'm just I just wanna say I'm
glad none of you said entourage so thank
you oh that reminds me no all right let
me see entourage wants entourage in
space oh you'll see it then you don't
know you just my even oh yes demon oh
yeah I'm definitely a big fan of this ex
machina I got to see that movie it looks
it looks the most interesting about the
arrow statement has kind of had some
gattaca vibe I don't know I like gattaca
yeah there's something like that in
there for sure all right well that is
about all the time we've got with
apologies today to the CW and despite
and CBN working well to be fair I am
gonna watch the flesh oh and I'd like to
fuck Tyler Perry yeah all right that's
all the time we've got for the crave
