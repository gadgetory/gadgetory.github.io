hello hello hello hello welcome welcome
boca to the 4 horse show on this friday
october ninth man what a freakin week
it's been rough rush it has been a crazy
crazy week whoo very busy man lot of
hustle was there bustle there was some
bustle a fair number of bustles yes I uh
yeah I'm just beat yeah I'm exhausted
too but this is gonna be a high energy
high octane no-holds-barred program
we're gonna fist fight yes we're in a
cage not gonna be super interesting
orally but you know just take our word
for my decision use your imagination hey
uh there's so much going on Comic Cons
in town New York Comic Con new york
comic con is in town the ever
underwhelming comic-con such a redheaded
stepchild of the comic con family it's
just like well i guess it's the second
biggest probably it's number two but
it's still such a drop from like the
event that is san diego comic-con yes I
mean there's like hi big brands and
actors and stuff that show up but it's
just like not like no one's premiering a
big Marvel is not premiering a big movie
yeah and you're not gone I mean and it's
so silly it's in the worst part of the
city I mean if you really want to get
down to the basics of why this thing
sucks yeah it's terrible it's a pain me
ask to get to it's all the way it's
basically in hoboken yeah where the
where the jacob javits center is on the
west side of manhattan where a comic con
goes down they don't bring out the
highlight reel people all the dead pools
are like budget Deadpool's yeah you know
I've seen some pretty impressive cosplay
there hmm no and so so I start
periscoping yeah my thing there have you
ever periscope did see one now once
before and you screwed up the other day
so I thought you could periscope a
horizontally now you can on iOS oh
really yeah I distinctly recall that
being a feature ad it's almost like
Android is inferior platform it's almost
like
mouth and leave my operating system
alone uh so I'm doing that and that's
fun and then did you see that big iron
man thing on you now you've left I left
oh how long was I supposed to watch it
for you're just wandering around I had
like at one point I had like 40 people
watching which was like is that good I
dropped the 39 excuse me yeah well no
because like the bandwidth in there is
terrible yeah I was surprised you got a
good connection yeah it was working okay
for a little bit nevertheless Russell
protects me while I'm doing this though
he's i uhh yeah dude you left you left
the phone sideways it doesn't work I'm
like it was cool though I felt like I
had a power cuz I could hear him get the
text message and I could see him right
the ship so it was like I was
communicating from beyond the void oh
you were just like pulling the strings
behind the podmaster anyway long story
short Comic Con 2015 new york city i was
there for maybe an hour and a half i
just could not get anything really done
there everyone's booth is a tenth of the
size of what it is in in san diego yeah
um like you just said they don't really
have a lot of big-time celebrities there
I know there's a few panels and I'm sure
people are gonna you know throw junk in
our face me like no no there is a big
deal it's important yeah and I guess
every year it gets a little bigger but
it's for the people who don't live out
west totally and it's a different crowd
like their way nastier here Oh settle
down what does that mean we are with
nadir like New York people are nastier
than San Diego what does that mean nest
like mean yeah like don't care about
bumping into you where's in San Diego
it's like hey you know it's fine you can
just be yourself be friendly with people
and not have to worry about kissing
anyone I mean I think they still I think
they're just more inhibited yeah so New
York people will be more honest with you
no it's more like spit in your face and
don't ask for anything I mean if there's
there's a weird camaraderie with the new
york comic con people just because they
get so few of these type of n
yeah that it does seem like it I don't
know I don't find them to be an overly
aggressive bunch uh-huh you're just
lying to yourself I've been to it San
Diego people are I've been to five San
Diego's and a bit 25 new york's so I'm
allowed to say this yeah me it's
probably just a California versus New
York yeah well that's exactly what it is
yeah I mean don't they'd certainly say
sup brah more often at San Diego one do
you not get me wrong yeah we're still
better okay like we're better than them
yeah but at the same time they're
cosplays what was there anything cool
you saw before you were there for an
hour and a half did you have any goal
while you were there I had my goal was
like let me see something i can get
excited about okay that's all it really
is sure totally and i didn't know i mean
nothing I went by the image booth yeah I
want to be like hey when is saga coming
back right and like it just it was such
a shitshow it was your person at the
desk didn't tell you when sagas coming
back I guess it's like a dumbass I don't
know but I go there's more of a fan sure
right so I'm trying to geek out yeah and
comic con New York would not let me get
out it's tough it's tough but again for
people that don't get this very often
and wanna see some nerdy you know nerdy
 go to town I guess sure it's weird
gamma guns weird go to it one time if
you've never been ah let's parlay that
into back to the future okay I know
clearly we talked about back to the
future a whole bunch on this show yeah
it's been at least two weeks since we
noted it right which is fine we have to
meet our October quote especially
because October 21st 2015 yeah is the
day yeah the real day that Biff got
covered in poop he gets comfortable
every day in the universe is back to the
future it's manure material like that
manure yeah um it is the october twenty
first that is d-day any time you see one
of those memes or someone photoshopped
the wrong date no the only real date is
october 21st 2015 that is rapidly
approaching yeah and it occurred to me
very quickly when we entered october
that we were not going to be able to
enjoy
this day as fans because it will be sold
to you it will be shoved down your
throat and it will prevent you from
actually enjoying it for what it's worth
it's the same situation I'm maybe not
one to one but it's similar to the
situation where all the brands were like
paying homage to 911 and trying to
associate their brand like like paying
homage to 911 this is a legitimate it's
like we're going to associate our brand
with another major event which was the
day that Marty McFly while I don't know
if I completely agree with you know what
I know where my Dunkin Donuts like
tweeted like you know respect your
heroes whenever brought to you by Dunkin
Donuts eat our egg sandwiches not nine
Elevens just such a different monster
what that draw right into but okay I'm
gonna give you this bag I just I just
don't want things bastardized by brands
and it's to it that's the problem canton
point back to the future month so so as
i understand it so far that I've I've
seen I saw the 20-hour coke Paris re
Pepsi perfect that's the perfect thing
okay so let's let and that's my that's
my like okay case in point sure Pepsi
yeah making that weird-looking bottle
sure that Marty got buys in the cafe 80s
and back to the future too yeah he wants
a tab they don't know what that is
there's a what stabbed right you don't
know in order to anything yet funny
that's actually that Jo doesn't even
work now then the pastor's on the future
that might be the power right that's the
end that's when you screwed up whoopsie
he goes in together eighties and goes
OMG perfectly if he had ordered a tab
2000 they would have been like oh you
don't like of course the soda from the
future so he orders the pet and this
thing pops out of the counter yes and
it's super cool it's a it's a super cold
pepsi and a weird glass bottle with an
oblong sort of its got like a straw
built into it whatever it is yeah Pepsi
is selling that exact replica yes forget
this $20 like 15 secs sense
really because 2015 I think it no I
think it is over twenty dollars i think
it's like 20 hours in some weird set
amount so where can you buy that way not
that I care sure some not you definitely
do care a little bit no I'm not really
someone was I aming me the other day and
they're like how many of those Pepsi's
are you gonna get I'm like zero because
that's terrible it does seem weird
though cause it's like you didn't get
excited when the nike thing happened not
really really the the shoes are
different because the i don't know i
guess you can make the argument they're
the exact same thing right but i have a
problem and I'm gonna catch flack for
this but I have a problem with like I've
run with soda being able to like I know
you hate soda yeah but I have a problem
with it like being the official partner
of the Olympics and I have a process
unhealthy cuz its all full free yeah and
there's no two ways about it like what
that is nothing to do with this right
but it's still like I don't know I don't
that's me you're overly sensitive about
soda but I and plus I hate Pepsi aisle
if I have to drink soda i'll drink like
Coke Zero okay cuz it's zero fun yeah I
don't yeah like if mattel came out with
a hoverboard you'd feel the same way
they did did they sell came out with a
replica but it wasn't obviously a real
hoverboard no cuz that's not real sort
is it's getting there gonna be on a
metal plank you have to be on a metal
blank and you have to have a Kickstarter
yeah uh but yeah i don't think i would
buy it okay I I like it was right like
usually like Toto if someone came into
the office today and handed you one that
worked perfectly no I don't mean the
hoverboard I mean the Pepsi thing oh you
didn't like keep it on your desk I
probably would okay so whatever I just I
mean hey it was to drinking I was more
put off by the fact that they only made
6500 of them oh there's only 65 only
6500 on the planet oh I thought there
were like 10 million down no definitely
not so you would need to so these are
gonna be worth so yeah they're gonna be
on ebay for like two or three hundred
bucks whatever good so that's that
that's what bothers me I don't mind the
execution of it it's honestly it's
whatever like i don't know why i guess i
guess my problem yeah with the whole
thing is that they
our commercializing this sacred thing
which is really I was really ironic now
because the entire movie is commercial
right where it's like well you bought
tickets right you see the movie not only
that you have toys you have this and the
only reason at their FC is cuz Pepsi
paid more than coke of course they would
pick coke first right Ned mattel right
had Texaco and it was one of these most
brand filled movies of the time you're
right I your I should just shut up yours
I'm totally wrong about this totally
wrong I will say the one cool that fax
company toshiba I don't remember it
might have been um yeah they were way
off on faxes huh they did not get that
right uh and ties I don't the double
time double time the one thing that I
did like was the fact that the the cubs
were playing Miami right in the
postseason which was like a nice
forward-thinking little joke and it's
happening right now so that's like cool
Miami well they're the Marlins they're
not the Florida Marlins there now the
Miami Marlins those clubs are actually
playing the Marlins right now that is
very cool now in the movie if you want
to be technical the Miami team is a
gator the Gator with about what a bat
with a bad but whatever we're gonna let
that slide I think we can let that slide
also wouldn't the Almanac have been way
bigger way thicker I've always the text
must been really small was like a
graphic it's been on a minute I've
always wondered weird things from that
movie and I do want to bring up one
gigantic issue i have sheriff's the end
of two um but yes wouldn't you imagine
50 years of sports scores in statistics
and not fittin ways actually like wire
maybe it's only like World Series and
layout now because every game because
the the the game that old Biff
exemplifies two young beth yeah some
random all right turns it on yeah I mean
you only need one line for everything
else I'm sure some jerk I'm already
figured it probably it probably exists
like a current actual one you think so
yeah it's called the internet right I
agree it writes weird that it's like 16
pages it seems like it's like a very
small pamphlet
Yeah right with just like 50 years of
data yeah okay fine let's put that aside
my biggest problem with back to the
future and now we're just getting into
the weeds and the geekery okay whole
thing the celebration and whatnot we can
put we can shelve maybe from wentzville
next week but okay back to the future
too mm-hmm Marty yes is uh is on the
road where his development will soon be
built doc is up flying in the DeLorean
and gets caught on the flags yes right
the flags get caught yes in the time I
in the tire and uh you know he's sitting
there and it the storms intensifying and
and he goes doc be careful ya don't want
to get struck by lightning and boom and
then he's gone gone ok and makes those
like nines in the sky yes they're always
wonder like what was that anyway why
does he time travel right what don't you
have to now the whole idea of her movie
is a genetic Oh 88 miles per hour so
you're just getting hit by lighting is
not enough is right the whole like if
that was the thing they wouldn't have
had to arrange that intricate you know a
lightning delivery system the way they
didn't end the first one right because
he needed to be moving 88 miles an oh
and he got struck by lightning right so
my point is what the like how do you
explain that maybe argue that the fusion
man that's now in the back of his
delorean no no you wouldn't you I mean
I'm open to I'm open to Thea this is
more technologically advanced so maybe
that's all he needs I'm open to Theory
sure what I'm saying okay sure so figure
that out for me okay like what are they
doing we're like who would who would be
able to make an argument that somehow
the lightning and I was reading a few
things sure some was saying like oh no
when the lightning hit it forced the car
to spin real quick to spin yeah what is
that way it's great like to spin on its
axis yeah it's crazy there's some
creative that in the footage no it just
does
years just disappear so that's crazy
that's crazy yeah he it did like so what
they say is that I think the only way
they touch on it is when the guy the
western union guy yeah oh noes a yeah
west but whatever whatever the telegram
area was it was yeah says like hey you
read the letter yeah and he says oh you
know it overloaded the time circuits and
so right right but that I mean is that a
thing were like oh if a time sir if that
flux capacitor gets overloaded right a
interesting way goes it just operates
because that's that is the thing about
the first movie is that when it gets hit
by lightning that is exactly when it
teleports right right so again a nation
that energy to tell but to transfer to
travel through time they needed that
boost of energy now in the new Dorian
they didn't need the Lightning right to
the trick to tell bro of course they did
so maybe it was already like Adam
meconium they need to put on him but
let's say it was already at a hundred
right and the lightning pushed it over
that need whereas in the first movie was
a fifty percent in the white and got it
100 all right I like stuff like that i'm
cool with here i'm cool with like you
know oh yeah my head but i'm cool and
right now with it sure um did you see by
the way uh since we're done talking
about your stupid conspiracy theory it's
not a conspiracy it's just like we
explain that did you see the footage
that someone filmed from their lawn oh
my god right back the future three so if
you're listening to this and you're as
geeky as we are with back to the future
go search it was someone living uh like
across the street from where they were
shooting right yeah like right across
the street on that block they were
filming back the future three and it's
just crappy VHS footage of like uh you
know them just like standing in front of
Marty's house right and he's like in a
poncho and like you could tell us back
the future three but it's really just
this bizarre time trip and it's crazy
because it's been sitting somewhere in
someone's backyard right it's been
sitting somewhere and what's what's also
very strange is just like it the way
it's filmed is bizarre to it just adds
to the confusion because it's you know
like home-video i mean i guess you could
say home videos had better you know
camera skills back then and people do
now with their phones but it's just this
weird yeah juxtaposition right yeah cool
was like a bizarre relic yeah so search
for that and give that a look it's
pretty awesome we're gonna take a break
when we come back we'll get into oh
right like Microsoft did a big thing
this week don't worry we had
acknowledged II haven't forgotten about
that junk more for for right after this
Ross I'm not gonna lie I ain't gonna lie

welcome back to the 404 show did you get
your back to the future Phil are you are
you full of pepsi perfect are you
satisfied they we're doing a video scene
it's doing a video about what came to
fruition what didn't Luke Lester Lester
way that's his name from our UK office
is putting this together and apparently
he's having a lot of fun doing that so
stay tuned for that we're gonna we're
gonna pivot into microsoft microsoft
microsoft had itself a week it was a
week for microsoft certainly when
windows 10 came out like they were not
massive complaints people generally
liked it but in terms of you know i
don't think anyone expected this
reaction to its its little announcements
this week and the big one karma from
wrong was their laptop they have a
laptop they have a laptop it's the first
laptop they've ever made it's called the
surface book yes right things ball it
looks cool i mean i even used it
personally but design wise i actually
really like the design i think we have
it here i was out yesterday so i gotta
go check it out yeah i mean it's a
impressive piece of machinery and look
we can get into the specs and all that
junk um but i think the big thing to
take note is that Microsoft is playing
fought is fighting fire with fire a
little bit here yep and that's kind of
cool yeah it's good to have competition
especially with like the two big players
in the space is it to me seems very
clearly just like be there answer for
the macbook air which is like a really
very popular model especially for work
and stuff
that and a lot of people did not get
services because they're like well I
need like an actual work computer and
the surface is sort of halfway there and
this seems like the answer to that which
is like okay this is my work computer
it's not an enormous toshiba whatever
thinkpad fiasco it's like a cool looking
you know windows laptop they kind of
trumped the macbook in a lot of ways
here too and that's the big thing
they're going for ya well how do you how
do you think they trumped it ah if
you're looking at the numbers I mean
Beck was spec-wise the in a few
categories they edged at the sharp book
and they also edge it out in price it is
two hundred dollars more starting right
short includes more expensive but how
many times have you said what the hell
why aren't they just making a macbook
air with a touchscreen like that right
to me yes probably the most sought-after
mm-hmm uh innovation from from from
Apple that people yeah I think there's
definitely demand for it so there's that
they also and don't forget like ipad pro
it's kind of a surface ya later let's
look at a spade a spade yeah um alright
so when you look at the specs the pixel
resolution tire on the on the surface
book more pixel density in higher pixel
density um it weighs uh this is crazy so
this is the macbook pro we're comparing
this to okay it weighs half half I don't
know that you can compare it to the
macbook pro why is that the direct
comparison is the man pro I mean look at
the I mean they both run a core i7 chips
you can put a core i7 on a air though
I'm just saying like it's got a better
good bending in terms are like it's I
mean it's there like that I think that I
think you absolutely can make that
argument yeah okay fair enough right i
mean sure uh so yeah it's I don't know
it's a it's a crazy world yeah right
here I definitely think there's a big
big audience of people that like I know
I was shocked at how many people are
like very die hard surface people like
there are definitely there
out there around this is like their
favorite weekend right and this is like
a very good product for those people I
don't think this product is necessarily
going to bring anyone over that like has
a macbook air or macbook pro I don't
agreed and I think it's for people who
are entering that yes giving them on way
more significant yeah choice at a real
competition and something that they can
feel more confident about because like
when you're shopping for windows pc it's
like you have so many choices and you
just sort of want to know like what is
the like best plugin pot like if you buy
from asus who knows their spyware fiasco
and at least hear you're like okay i'm
buying from microsoft if they do shady
stuff everyone's gonna know about it
very quickly and you know they might but
at least then everyone started in the
same boat it's like unified hardware for
a windows laptop i don't know i think
it's i think it's great and I think in a
lot of ways you're going to see like
programs whether it's Photoshop whether
it's a game that'll be like this runs at
this frame rate on this machine in the
same way that like I have a 2011 macbook
air this program runs like it's very
easy to determine how well something
will run because it's like a unified
relatively unified you know set of specs
sure so I think it's great I think it's
a very smart move by Microsoft I'm
interested to see how it sells um yeah
it's it's cool I think what's really uh
kind of RAD too is you know people dig
Windows 10 yeah and it's I don't know
it's just I think it I'm not saying this
is the beginning of the end for a Paul
not saying that okay but it's certainly
I think the beginning of may be a
renaissance for Microsoft yeah and I
think it's more you know there's more
parody more competition between the two
where is like the last few years it has
felt like Microsoft's just been like
playing not catch up but just like I
mean making a lot of bad choice bad
choices dealing with a damaged almost
brand anyway um and not doing it any
favors and now yeah this last year I
think they've really started to turn it
around it is crazy that this is the
first laptop they ever made
yeah I'm having shocked I'm sure but I
mean that's I think a big part of it has
to do with the climate like they don't
want to shower the relationships they
have with like OEM xand right but but
that's the thing like think like if your
acer right i mean terrified you're
really pissed sure right cuz there's no
way they made this decision without
really upsetting yeah totally why why
would someone go to a store and buy the
acer laptop if they oh I'll just buy
this one this is like this got the
microsoft windows on it I mean why
where's right why do I buy anything else
anymore from another from a third party
company and it doesn't look like it
looks cool like you can keep it on your
lap and not be embarrassed it's it's
impressive I mean it's after if it's
from out of left field and that's and I
think part of that a part of the appeal
part of the you know I guess fanfare is
the fact that no one knew that this was
coming too yeah this came out of these
knows it seems like nothing can make it
to announcement without being a spoiled
just goes by nature of likes one person
needing a cell phone in the factory and
then boom it's done right this really
surprised a ton of people and it might
have been because it's like maybe a leak
you would have seen like oh there's like
a laptop being produced and I'm sure
it's a partnership with toshiba or
whatever so the you know just a laptop
existing and like having a frame for a
laptop is not enough to like get people
crazy excited right but you know with
the reveal of it being like the official
windows laptop it's pretty crazy it's
kind of cool make sure you check out
cnet com for the latest we've got a
bunch of hands on checking out not just
the surface book but all the other
tablets that they announced the surface
tablets and real quick before we move on
to the next story that that freaking
hololens demo I mean that that is the
best demo of the year when you combine
you know stuff at e3 what their did
earlier this week and the first time
they debuted hololens I mean that thing
is a kick-ass demo I don't know if I
don't think it's as I don't I think the
video I think demos do it
very generous favor yes one hundred
percent I mean the big thing is when we
use it at e3 the whole thing was viewing
angle right and you those videos do not
portray how narrow the viewing angle is
where you have to be looking through
this like postage stamp-sized square to
see this hologram and and those things
are really expensive they are using
really expensive pathology the dev kits
they announce our three thousand dollars
which compare that to the oculus dev kit
which is like what was it 600 600
something like that yeah so like the
technology is through the roof expensive
and while those debt like their demos
are very very cool I have not seen a
really great case for how this could be
like a broad piece of technology yeah
we'll see yeah okay I want to go into
apple now excuse me we're not gonna
praise Microsoft Pat Microsoft on the
back and then just go in beat up Apple
are we I'm just gonna do well I guess in
this show we're probably going uh so
here's the deal the three month trial
period that everyone was gifted when
Apple music day bude well that's up yep
and now it's time to take a step back
and say hey is this worth paying for am
I going to keep this service yeah you in
Spence from forbes as a contributor for
the tech section of the site has written
a story that says Apple music has failed
yeah Forbes can be a little Forbes can
be on there let's just leave it at that
Forbes can be a little yeah nevertheless
I understand the message and I
understand the sort of sticker shock
sure sticker price shock that amendment
many people are probably experiencing
when that first credit card statement
comes in like what is it give a ten
bucks yeah for a spotify is right
exactly yeah um he's making the argument
that apple's model their service does
not deliver the value that competing
services offer sure closely says close
to four months of peasants launch and
the apple music experiences
not been improved in any substantial way
the package that Apple delivered out of
the box was horribly mainstream totally
agree with that yeah uh with a huge
focus on popular artists in my time
exploring the playlist and radio it has
been hard to find the niche music in the
packaging and that is the entire basis
yes for music discovery yes we know what
taylor swift's new album sounds like and
it's great and it's spectacular we know
what with the new justin bieber song
sounds like me and I yell at Shannon
when she comes here he plays that stuff
yes right so what is going on and who is
in charge of doing this I mean you
parade like you know these these mega
ultra popular artists out there you're
just not appealing to people who have
any sense of like individualism yeah and
it kind of feels like the maps situation
again yeah a little bit sure in the
sense that like Maps granted when it
first launched there were some goofy
stories about people driving into lakes
and stuff like that which is bad hazing
but you mean amazing amazing but then in
the herd but another like big omission
that they left out was having like
public transport on the maps and like
support for stuff like that yeah and
it's those like nature neech features
that only apply to a set number of
people that get people on board
especially when you're dealing with like
you know the UH you know people in high
hesitated a media cities like New York
in LA he said media cities what the
hell's that Mike central I media places
were like just low are like us
evangelize these services and you need
to sort of give those sorts of people
saw a reason to cheer you can't just
give them like McDonald's hamburger you
need like McDonald's hamburger with a
Pepsi permit some like angle to it
beyond just like this is a baseline that
we've hit and people are upset with that
uniformity yes if if that makes sense he
goes on he says look there's no app in
the world that's perfect and this
continues up
the fact that yeah it's a it's a it's a
mess in terms of the content there but
also the app itself is kind of a
disaster he goes on to say it can easily
hang on opening if it can't find a solid
internet connection and it makes it
harder to search and locate your own
music on a handset album and artist
lists are compressed into a single drop
down box while opposite emptive global
at a global radio station is given a tab
all its own yeah so this is what I will
say I I that's all fair I have not used
the ton of the part I used a little bit
but not a ton I just Spotify
predominantly the benefit that Apple has
is not necessarily now so I don't think
you can say it has failed the benefit is
long-term the benefit is i just bought a
new phone this apple music thing is
pre-installed i guess i'll sign up for
that it is the internet explorer it's
the internet explorer of music at one
hundred percent is not cool that's not
cool you're right I get it I get it I
got it is easy you could say that yeah
and it's an easy way to get people in
the hook for 10 bucks a month which up
until now Apple has really not had the
equivalent of that right so I get it
from a business standpoint I think the
product will get better it's very
difficult to like create a very robust
library in a relatively short amount of
time I'm not excusing it I think it's
certainly not in a great place right now
but their place it's all along here and
play it's a human lung plan I don't know
what spot if I was like at launch I'll
bet it's it was pretty broad as well it
was better at lunch okay I mean that's
just from my short experience I don't
burn music but I remember I distinctly
remember Spotify just kind of being like
oh this makes perfect sure having a lot
of like not not that it was perfect but
just it was intuitive yeah and I showed
I showed my dad Apple music and he is
like brain farted it's like what um I
guess all the music you want for it just
didn't convey probably anyway uh we'll
have more on Apple music at as it
continues to evolve we must take one
more break and then we're back with some
game stuff and the product hunt game of
the week keke keke keke more 404 right
after this
what do you think of when you think of
clouds Ross intimidatingly large ah
you're talking about the weather notion
of clouds not not the computing but loud
computing and the web they both terrify
yes well softlayer is going to make it
that much less intimidating for you sir
for which for both no they're not going
to do the weather clouds are going to do
the computing class I understand all
right because softlayer delivers clouds
built for flexibility your business your
applications your workloads are unique
you deserve a cloud that meets your
specific needs softlayer is an IBM
company in fact and I learned this
yesterday from someone who works at
softlayer in fact iBM uses software as
its cloud infrastructure foundation for
all of IBM's cloud computing products
and services that's a lot of cloud style
that's a lot of class is what maybe I
should have just said instead of that
hella cloud stuff hella cloud stuff all
of our listeners have the opportunity to
get five hundred dollars of cloud
infrastructure by visiting softlayer
calm / podcast use that and get five
hundred dollars off server storage
network and security all built on a
cloud for flexibility from softlayer
okay make sure you do it new customers
you're the only ones that can take
advantage of that five hundred dollars
off do it right now head over to
softlayer calm / podcast welcome back to
the show also in it in addition to
comic-con being in town in addition to
the anarchy that is back to the future
month oh you call it anarchy I think
it's very organized to the point of
depressing huh way to bring it down briz
re ah no uh EA was in town this week
they were indeed they were here on
Wednesday I was out of town I was in
Philadelphia how do you feel about
Philly I'm not gonna play that game
right now right yeah i was at UPenn like
on campus oh yeah and i've been to the
campus it's very like a traditional yeah
cow very Ivy Lee
very yeah it's just like with the frat
houses and everything it's like very
traditional felt a lot like Harvard in a
way yeah uh similar similar kind of
setup uh they got they've got some smart
smart people there yeah not bad I I
confused I'm sorry where'd you go do you
go to you it I went to you I'm roxford
no where'd you go Emerson College
Emerson yeah oxford university i don't
know if you've heard of it it's called
Yale uh yeah it's it's a very nice
campus I I why we know there why was I
there when I went to upenn yeah I was
dating a girl that went to you been is
it about the girl or isn't it about the
girl I don't know it's always about the
girl I gotta go see about a girl I gotta
see something with a girl they got
amazing building called the bits of
nanotechnology yeah building it's tiny
easy for small is this a school for ants
is what I said yeah and everyone nodded
everyone's like you're the 8,000th
person to make that joke today yeah it
was cool i liked it i don't i'm not a
big philly fan but that's a gorgeous
campus got some good food situations
whatever you got to tell yourself if
you're from there um so uh EA like i
said we're in town yep they had some
stuff yeah uh you were there I was there
you played a game called unravel unravel
oh I'm excited about this one it's a
cool game uh the idea is you're a little
yarn person you're made of yarn and you
escaped from an old lady's house I don't
know if you escape is it like your
grandma or she's just like an old lady I
mean you're a yarn person so it's not
like a yarn grandma your yarn ma you're
on mon it's not that okay you just sort
of leave the house and then you go
exploring and it's like a 2d platformer
or 32.5 d platformer you're bouncing
around but the hook is everywhere you're
good you go you're dragging this yarn
behind you so you're leaving like a yarn
trail yarn trail and it's like
infinitely long and you get more yarn as
you progress you like pick up more yarn
and you can go further as you get more
yarn but you can run out you can run out
so but it's a puzzle game so the idea is
you like
get just enough yarn to bring you to the
next piece of yarn so if you're like I
don't you probably miss some yarn right
so you so it's all about like the
shortest path right I just saw this I
was like oh it kind of looks like a
little big planet like yeah it's okay
but mechanically it's really really cool
because you can do stuff where you like
Thai one piece of yarn in one place and
tie another piece of yarn in the other
place and like repel yourself up a wall
cool or use it as like a spring more
pitchers constantly spending yarn you're
constantly using yarn yeah no matter
where you're going but you have to like
be smart about it where you can like
okay I'm going to swing on the yarn here
latch myself onto this wall and then
create like a yarn rope that I can like
rappel down on so there's like a lot of
really cool puzzle mechanics there was
one where I'd like pushed some apples up
a piece of yarn which doesn't really
make sense but that sounds terrible but
I'm sure it was fun you just have to be
very it's like a thoughtful puzzle game
if you ever play limbo it's very similar
to limbo amazing space stuff um they
don't make Limbo's like they used to
they don't one of those guys gonna do
another one they have another one coming
inside or side I okay next year sometime
oh speaking of next year's that's
unravel as well right yeah sure Roy next
year it's cool definitely a game that I
didn't really have a lot of expectations
for and went in and was really impressed
by it I think the thing here and if
you're listening you're like god damn
with the talking about games yeah here's
the deal it's an indie game yes right
being published by EA yes which does not
happen a lot no it's a rarity so like a
little artsy cutesy game that yeah it
feels I know you Vsauce been doing this
similar things right like EA is
following suit that's great good for
them so I'm where's the developer from
under nationally I think it's Iceland or
Nordic lands some Nordic developer yeah
that's very cool man you to win that EA
indie lottery you gotta that's lightning
in a bottle we'll see how it sells that
I'm the determining factor very good
let's move along to the product hunt
girl oh we're know I have to make
everything a song it's that well I mean
it's I guess yeah I guess I was that you
too dramatic or a little bit too all
right this way you're usually pretty
good with these game recommendations
yeah it's a cool game uh it's called
read only memories that's India as well
it's a bike pixelated adventure game
like kind of like day the tentacle if
you're into that sort of like throwback
style game but this was a steam game
yeah it's on steam yeah and really cool
vibe it's set in like a new Annie Oh San
Francisco um it's got the cyberpunk
thing going on yeah cyberpunk is fired
kind of like you know like but not edgy
it's like mega man levels right rippon
right see so if you like kind of
adventure games tech space adventure
games with like cool hand-drawn pixar
check it out read only memories it's on
product on uh what so what but like why
this game now what do you mean like why
is this your game of the week like this
game is it but its not New right it's oh
no it is it's only about two months old
no it came out the official release was
october six so just oh maybe for another
platform maybe for another platform
varies theme it just came out have you
played it how much of it have you played
like an hour of it yeah yeah I dig it
it's uh right now it's on sale for 1350
but 15 bucks is like the state a
standard price man uh you know I I spend
so much money on Steam games than I
never play yeah the thing i do babe
you're not allowed to talk about that
okay okay I don't I think I literally am
NOT I got that ah we've talked about it
on the Beast cast before not you
specifically but the idea of what we're
beating around yeah um but yes uh I you
know and I usually try and wait for the
summer sale and then the winter sale
yeah so r us what they have on steam
yeah they have these gigantic sales
really where you can yeah where you save
upwards of sixty seventy percent off a
game well how do you take sixty percent
off like free they pay you money they
pay money like yeah russ russ has a
thing where he say tell because now
we're
acting shady well there's a press
account yeah and members of the press
have access to download things from
steam on free for run free and free for
free but it's it's very limited and and
really I think I don't even know if they
still give them out they don't begin now
I when I first started seeing it I had
like a chance yeah and I didn't Eckstein
they asked you did what it was there was
an opportunity that presented itself and
it was steam wasn't as established back
oh you're like this is like 07 yeah sure
and I'm like who cares like what games
are on there yeah not a big deal yeah
well yeah kind of beat myself up like
that one it feels like this is the
equivalent of like a rent-controlled
apartment yep we get grandfathered in
just got passed down through the
generations you know and it's Korea it's
just like you can't give up that seat
yeah it's like season tickets to the
Giants exactly is like no that's gonna
stay in the family it's in the will
keeping it all right um all right man
this has been great good times thanks so
much for for tuning in 866 404 cnet
that's our phone number leave us a
voicemail we can choose an email the 404
at cnet com um if you give me a minute I
want to talk about an email we got okay
we do that sure yeah it sounds worrying
no this is for Marcy hi Marcy ah dear
Jeff and Ross there's a great story on
the most recent episode of radiolab
about the ransomware that you're talking
about this from last night cool uh it's
the first segment pretty scary that
police agencies have fallen victim to
this so the link goes to a radio lab
story uh and it's just and like you
won't I listened to it you won't believe
what members of what you would think to
be this authoritative you know so really
the police in size do dumb things I know
you've never heard of this it is a thing
coincidentally while walking my dogs in
western New York last week we came upon
a rogue cow huh who was walking out of
the woods
toward us this is also Marcie this is
awesome RC AO looked like it must have
been a couple thousand pounds made sure
it wasn't a rogue bull before I took a
couple pics even though they're docile
animals pretty scary being so close to
an animal that could crush you yes if it
got spooked the farmer came and walked
her home come on Betsy back into the pan
was he is he gonna sell it for beans
maybe yeah like is that a jack and the
beanstalk it is it's a jack only beats
like reference to Jack Jack was he sold
his cow for beans it was his cow yeah
cows are so stupid yeah they'll just
walk anywhere like though they'll see
the cow in front us gonna sound bad
they'll see the cow in front of it get
slaughtered yeah I'm just gonna stay the
course yeah do they I don't think know
that they slaughtered no I don't think
so you think the cow in front of it gets
its head cut off and the cows standing
mine is like no there goes bill well
well mr. Tom it's your tongue I don't I
think if you kill the cow around a bunch
of other cows the other cows would freak
the hell out I don't know about that you
think that would happen with a bunch of
chickens yes you think chicken be we'll
see chicken eh I think they probably
have some sort of innate like if they
smell blood they'll tow that's not good
oh hey for the record for four sho is
absolutely one hundred percent for the
humane treatment of animals true we are
not for uh not eating them we enjoy very
much eat them eat some chicken yes
delicious yeah but humanely please
please please thank you a yarmulke on
that cow before you kill a well I
that's George now it's not torture and
