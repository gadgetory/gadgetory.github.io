that stands out from the crowd I'm Dan
Ackerman and this is the HP Pavilion x2
this is the 2015 update to this system
we've seen it for the past couple of
years since Windows ain't really this
new version looks a lot different from
the previous ones it's actually one of
the sharpest looking inexpensive hybrids
I think I've ever seen this guy starts
at about three hundred dollars and for
that you get a fairly standard set of
components Intel Atom processor two gigs
of RAM a fairly small built in
solid-state hard drive and of course
it's a hybrid so that everything is here
behind the screen and then you have a
separate keyboard base unlike some of
the earlier generations of pavilion x2
hybrids or other HP hybrids you don't
have a big clunky plastic latch here you
have to like press down or wiggle with
your finger in order to separate the two
hands it's just a magnet so you hold the
base down and then you can just lift the
screen up like that it's a lot easier
than having like an actual latch that
you have to press or move around and
then it's a strong magnet so you just
get anywhere close to this and it just
snaps right back on like that so we like
that part however a lot of the space on
the display right here is taken up by
these big speaker grilles and if you
look down here there's a new logo here
HP used to partner with Beats Audio for
the audio systems in their laptops and
desktops Apple bought beats that
partnership is over now they have a new
high-end audio partner and that's Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen a very well respected name in
speakers and audio
however Beno did not actually design or
build a speaker's in this or any other
HP laptops they just provided some sort
of sound shaping and EQ software they
say is based on the actual size and and
and design of the speakers and design of
the laptop etc etc I got to tell you
that when real life this is shockingly
one of the thinnest weakest sounding
laptops at any price that we've ever
heard we lined it up in our lab with a
bunch of other two and three at 350
dollar laptops definitely the weakest
and thinnest sound by far despite this
big logo stand this is one of the areas
where the HP x2 over promises and under
delivers despite the weak audio performs
about as
as other atom based hybrids which is you
know good for casual web surfing you
wouldn't want to work on it all day
every day battery life just a little bit
shorter than some of the competition but
not radically so but it still got those
good looks going for it that is the HP
Pavilion x2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
