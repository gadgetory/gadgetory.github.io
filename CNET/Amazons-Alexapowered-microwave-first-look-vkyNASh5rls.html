microwave
specifically the amazonbasics microwave
it's a 60 dollar 700 watt microwave
which Amazon tells us is the
best-selling size on amazon.com and it's
gonna be one that you can connect with
Alexa now it doesn't have a LexA
actually built-in there's no speaker
inside of this microwave so you'll need
a dedicated Alexa device like the echo
or echo dot or echo show in your kitchen
in order to talk to the microwave and
tell it to cook things you can say cook
one potato and they'll automatically put
the correct time for a potato you can
say cook popcorn and we'll do the same
thing
it also has dash replenishment built in
so if you run out of popcorn it can
order more now the thing that really
makes this microwave tick is the Alexa
connect kit chipset it's a new chip that
developers can use to smarten up
existing appliances you can just put
this chip into your microwave or
whatever appliance or device you have
and give Wi-Fi connectivity Bluetooth
connectivity all of that within Amazon's
protocols and encrypted and Amazon
standards so the chipsets really just an
affordable way to get more devices
onboard the Alexa platform in this
microwave is sort of a showcase or that
it's kind of proving the point that you
can take a ordinary old appliance add
this chipset in and make it an Alexa
enabled appliance with a lot of Appeal
well see if that appeal translates the
sales if people buy this microwave and
mask maybe we'll see a flood of new
Alexa enabled appliances with this
chipset inside time will tell once the
microwave starts shipping to customers
at this November we'll get one into the
scene that smart home test it out and
let you know how it cooks up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
