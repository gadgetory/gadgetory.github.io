cnet here at Google launch event for the
Nexus 7 tablet just like the old Nexus 7
this one has a 7.0 2 inch screen what's
different about this one though is that
it has a completely full HD 1080p
display it also has two cameras there's
a 5 megapixel camera on the back and at
one point to make a pixel camera on the
front they're going to be free versions
of this device it's going to come in
Wi-Fi only 16 gigabytes 32 gigabytes and
an LTE version as well now the backing
is a little bit different sort of had
more of like a tennis shoe style backing
on the previous version little rubbery
this one has a regular soft touch finish
still seems pretty comfortable to hold
and pretty grippy it is a thinner device
so that means that it'll be more
comfortable if you hold it up for longer
periods of time the ports are still
pretty minimalistic there's a headset
jack we've got a power lock button and a
volume rocker these are oblong and easy
to press you also have a micro USB
charging port at the bottom one of the
most important things about this device
is that it will be the first to ship
with Android 4.3 is the operating system
this is a version of jelly bean that's a
lot like the other versions but it does
come with a couple enhancements on the
back end especially for gaming now this
tablet is going to be going on sale in
eight countries in the US you can get it
for two hundred thirty dollars two
hundred seventy dollars and three
hundred fifty dollars depending on the
capacity and if it's connected to LTE it
will be sold through verizon AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile we're going to get much deeper
on this device to stick around with Cena
I'm jessica's all heard you can catch
our hands on it Cena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
