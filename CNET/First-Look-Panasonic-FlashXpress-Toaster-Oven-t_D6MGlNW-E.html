is the Panasonic flash Express toaster
oven what I really love about this
toaster oven is the price and how well
built it is for the price it's 150 bucks
we found it for about 90 on Amazon and
it's just super affordable it's one of
the least expensive ones we tested and
it just consistently outperformed or at
least as good as the other ones it is a
really well built machine but it also
has some really wonky design that some
people will love and some people will
kind of hate so you know up here it has
this strange sort of temperature gauge
that's set for Fahrenheit and Celsius it
looks kind of like one of those old AM
FM tuners on your radio you have the
Celsius down here and the Fahrenheit up
here but it's actually calibrated just
for Celsius another thing that's kind of
wonky about this design is that it only
goes up to 25 minutes on the timer so if
you need to cook something for longer
you have to come back and check and then
bump up the time again the Panasonic
flash Express is really really easy to
use I particularly love the presets that
they have because they work really
consistently on usability something that
might present a bit of a challenge is
going off the presets so if you're not
making toast
frozen pizza frozen waffles because this
isn't a convection oven or traditional
toaster oven it actually uses double
infrared heating so it cooks a lot
faster if you have a box it says on the
instructions to cook something for half
an hour it might be closer to 22 minutes
or maybe even less so you're going to
have to kind of play around with it and
see what works best for you let's talk a
bit about performance now this toaster
stacks up really well against the others
as far as performance it consistently
performed as well if not better than all
of the other ones so overall this
Panasonic flash Express toaster oven
with double infrared heating is a
complete winner
consistently does a great job and it's
cute and quirky at the same time so it's
great for CNET I'm Megan Willerton and
this is the Panasonic flash Express</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
