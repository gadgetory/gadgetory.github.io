labs with the macbook air that Apple
introduced recently as well as the Adele
latitude a typical Windows 7 PC one of
the challenges that I think the new
macbook air presents for Windows is it
really brings some of the instant on
capabilities that have been very popular
on the iphone and ipad and takes them
into the computer realm windows seven is
certainly the best Windows machine yet
at going to sleep and waking from sleep
but my hunch is that it's still not the
same kind of performance we're going to
see from this so I wanted to give it a
little bit of a run-through so I grabbed
one of the faster machines we had in the
Dell now it's not a solid-state drive so
it's not an apples-to-apples comparison
pardon the pun but I do think it gives a
sense of the performance of a typical
windows 7 machine a typical new modern
machine and the macbook air so the first
thing I'm going to do is put both
machines to sleep to do that in both
cases all you have to do is shut the lid
and it takes the windows machine a
little bit longer you see the apple
light go out sooner the sleep button on
the Windows machine it takes a little
bit longer but that's not something the
average user is going to notice much now
I'm going to wake the two machines and
you'll see the difference with the
macbook air it's up almost instantly the
dell it takes just a little bit longer
now it may not seem like a huge
difference but i do think that over time
this is a potential advantage for the
mac as its able to tell really the same
kind of instant zippy experience that
you get on an ipad actually brought to
the computer the dell it's not slow but
my experience is that over time that
resume just isn't quite a zippy it's a
computer experience versus a consumer
electronics experience and that's a key
difference that i think microsoft needs
to worry about as it works on the future
of windows for cnet i mean a freed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
