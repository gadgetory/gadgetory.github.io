serious about hardware with its two new
Google branded pixel phones that are
taking on Apple's iPhones in a very
obvious way same size and storage
options similar design amazing camera
and at almost the exact same price range
so are they really going to be the
iPhone killers
Google seems to think so the pixel
phones want to set a new quick charge
standard with seven hours of use for
just 15 minutes of charge at this rate
they go head-to-head with samsung's new
Galaxy phones when they're not catching
on fire and definitely out charged the
newest iPhones Google made some hefty
claims when presenting the cameras of
the new pixel phones claiming they're
the best ever made on a smartphone this
isn't only the best camera we've ever
made it's the best smartphone camera
anyone has ever made and of course we've
never heard that one before it is a huge
advancement in photography for cell
phones the camera has a twelve point
three megapixel sensor compared to the
12 megapixels on the iPhone with an HDR
plus mode a smart burst feature that
picks out the best shot automatically
and the gyroscope based video
stabilization but at this point it's all
about the bump because until we subject
them to a proper shootout the specs
themselves don't mean much if you've
ever paid for iCloud storage on an
iPhone this one is sure to inspire some
major pixel Envy like the iPhones
Google's pixel phones offer a 32 and 128
gigabyte option with no expandable
storage but unlike Apple Google is
giving away unlimited storage on their
cloud-based Google Photos service and
that's for full resolution images and 4k
video
Apple is really lagging behind on the VR
front with no platform or headset in
sight the pixels are the first daydream
ready phones meeting they'll be able to
support the new virtual reality platform
along with a daydream view headset which
will run you about $79 and includes a
remote it won't give you the full
immersive experience of a pc-based
oculus rift or HTC vive but you'll get a
taste of the virtual world with a
minimal investment but the biggest draw
for the pixel is all about software
google's assistant is positioning itself
to be a central hub for all your
electronics both in and out of the home
because the pixel phones will be the
first to have the assistant baked in you
can rest assured that they will work
seamlessly with the other members of the
Google family including home chromecast
and Wi-Fi Apple is said to be working on
a home hub of its own but at this point
Google's got the advantage and then
there's that punchline for those still
mourning the headphone jack on the
iPhone low-blow Google low blow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
