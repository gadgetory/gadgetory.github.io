next big wave in tech is the connected
home getting everything from your
doorbell to your toaster connected to
the Internet working together to cut
down your energy bill make your
breakfast and watch your cats
I'm Donnell Bell and if this sounds like
the life for you here are my personal
recommendations for the top by simple
home upgrades that will jumpstart your
smart home starting off at number five
smart lights the philips hue is really
the king of this category two hundred
bucks gets you three bulbs and a
wireless hub with extra bulbs setting
you back about $60 each it's not cheap
but these LED bulbs last about 15 years
plus they pack more show off factor than
anything else on this list just invite
your neighbors over cue up Dark Side of
the Moon and play with your light bulbs
for 20 minutes heck in Colorado this
could be a full weekend of fun at number
four smart outlets a lot of options in
this space but belkin's $50 Wemo switch
is arguably the most well known you just
plug it in download the app and within
minutes you've got an outlet that you
can control and schedule with your phone
for $30 more you can add a motion sensor
that will activate the outlet when you
walk in the room or freak out your pets
all day while you're at work coming in
at number three smart smoke detectors
pretty much talking about the nest
protect here unless you're buying a more
comprehensive security system someone
who sets off my smoke detector almost
every time I cook I would gladly fork
over the 130 dollars here for a smoke
detector that will talk to me a little
bit before going to red alert
it's also room aware so it can politely
wake up my sleeping wife to let her know
that I burned my grilled cheese
downstairs there aunt lightballs makes
me a little hungry at number two a smart
thermostat now here I'm not just talking
about nest they have one of the
prettiest ones but there are some good
connected thermostats out there for
about half the price the bottom line is
that here's an upgrade that can really
translate into a smaller energy bill
almost immediately a thermostat that
adapts to you and sends you feedback on
your energy use and even tells you when
it's time to change the air filter
that's progress now before we get to
number one let's take
to call out one of these silliest smart
home appliances we've seen the crockpot
smart slow cooker now don't get me wrong
I rely on my crock-pot for cooking
dinners that won't set off my smoke
alarm but why does the most basic
kitchen appliance ever invented need an
app I suspect we're going to see a
ridiculous wave of unnecessarily smart
appliances over the next few years until
we collectively figure out what really
makes sense and $99 crock-pot does not
meet that threshold alright and finally
my number one pick for a simple smart
home upgrade a smart lock we're seeing a
bunch of these coming out this year
Gogi august lockitron kevo some will
replace your entire lock some will fit
over your existing deadbolt but all of
them promise that they can be installed
in under 20 minutes a great range of
prices and features some have NFC and
well unlock your door with a wave of
your phone some will notify you when you
get a knock at the door
some will even send you a picture of the
person who's been stealing your amazon
packages if nothing else as the first
thing that people see when they come to
your house it sends a message
a proud geek liz here so there you go
five products you can buy right now to
make your home a little smarter and
impress your friends be sure to check

latest in home tech and for more top
fives from me
