Carnegie Mellon are working on a way for
you to control your smartphone with
sound there is a drone fashion show
coming to town that we're gonna tell you
all about and a wetsuit you can wear to
your wedding thanks Japan tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the Internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show computers I'm your host Ashley
skellige enemies always my co-host kale
anonymous the man of mystery I'm not
that oh cuz of a not the anonymous not a
messy anonymous they gave me my card for
the office today like they gave me a
little new entries card and they put
their like we made a mistake in your
name we put anonymous kale I was like
all right yeah sure whatever that's the
least offensive mess up anybody's ever
made of anyone's name is usually people
are like this is not your real name yeah
give us your real name no they're the
like your first name is anonymous now
your last name scale so that's cool so
why don't we just get him headlines do
that I really hope we don't fall off the
rails earliness this time I guarantee
only wednesday so this is a meanwhile in
japan story like that because uh this
this story is coming from quicksilver
japan none of you know quicksilver but
they make aquatic gear for the ocean and
they have decided that everybody would
really like it if they had a wetsuit
that wasn't only a wetsuit god i'm
waiting for the video to catch up to me
I know waiting to catch up wait there
they're creating a web suit a wetsuit
that's not only a wetsuit but is also a
business wetsuit that you can wear into
the ocean so this is a see he's wearing
a suit in this video so much he's just
about to jump straight into the ocean so
this season this is uh this is called so
true wet suits were developed with the
boardroom and surfboard in MA look at
this this is amazing look at this guy
please so you guys are missing it if you
listen it's this story is purely a
visual the visuals is definitely a
visual story you see this guy in a
business suit on the button as he hits
the way he's like ah yes so the shirt is
made with dri-fit which is a fabric that
usually that's actually water repellent
now some it's a the jacket and pants or
neoprene yeah the same material as a
regular wetsuit so that so you got
neoprene and dry fit that's the shirt
yeah this your Dreyfuss sure it's dry
fit wow these are
these are details you need so let's say
you want one of these right let's say oh
it's okay yes i'm in well good luck with
that how much so these are made-to-order
so you know they're going to be
expensive cars just three hundred
thousand yen and that's two thousand
five hundred dollars in US currency a
lot of money and they take about it
takes about two months to arrive they
come in they go you make a little noise
after everything that's a yes so the two
comes in two colors navy and black
business suit or tuxedo style the tuxedo
style seems like the way to go it's
going to get James Bond yeah so yes
there you go now available um can I just
say this is like the perfect formal wear
for Southern California yeah I mean cuz
after a meeting you want to jump right
into the after that meeting for your
screenplay you jump right into the ocean
yeah you go surfing you probably are
really warm in that suit until you get
into the ocean I I tell you what though
if you want to send us one was it myself
yeah a quick summer you want to send
this one will try it out producer Logan
will try it out I'm gonna have producer
Logan wear it even though he's a drone
as we described it yeah but will they
custom fit ok custom fitted yeah we
loved up beginning it loves adam on it
but that brings us to our hashtag of the
day what is it it is hashtag TD suits so
we want to know what kind of shoot do
you need and what's the second function
what second function would provide so
what what would your suit yeah but it
has to actually look like a suit you
can't be like I would have iron man suit
that's not a suit yeah I guess that's
yeah that's a good caveat okay so what's
yours I feel like I feel like I would
this is gonna sound really weird I feel
like I would want an edible suit made
out of like I don't know like chocolate
and then that way it's like if my blood
sugar got low or if I got sad i could
just like take a little piece off of it
and i eat it eat the sleeves so if i
wanted it i would go for like a
chocolate made chocolate suit and then
that way it's like i'm wearing my suit
and during the day I keep eating like
the sleeves until finally it's casual
and then I can like go out at night I
can change it into a different thing no
I'm saying like in a like this is
special neoprene and
dreyfus bro technology where the child
feel like you're forgetting a lot of
stuff okay like that i live in
california's 91 degrees like it would be
technology where I wouldn't melt ocial
chocolate oh that would be the second
feature yeah it doesn't matter it would
not be cool okay and I could just take
little blinds not any better no these
are terrible no mines magnet knowing
isn't gonna be any better mine um i just
bought the cuff it would be a little bit
of an inflatable suit it would fill in
with uh with helium so that i could go
up in the air and the second feature
would be that it there would be like
fans built-in or like some sort of
propulsion saw her so that i could fly
to locations because it takes me a half
an hour to get to work when it should
take me five minutes how's the belly
traffic now it's why not just be the
Bubble Boy and float over every 30
little baby max you'd be like a little
big man yes I was look I would look like
pain acts it was a good way around and
people would market but be early to
everything you would never be late to a
meeting that's what is this fun check on
that all right quick sell chocolate suit
baymax what is yours hashtag TV suit
okay section suit alright cool okay I
got to tell you about a coup struments
all right so uh this is really weird but
it's kind of awesome so Disney research
and Carnegie Mellon have been working on
this for a while and these are low-cost
powerless you don't have to power them
low-cost powerless plastic mechanisms
that use acoustics to input commands on
smartphones so you can see they're kind
of in a circuit like either they go
around like they kind of go around the
phone or there's like a little circuit
underneath the phone like at the bottom
so what they did was they thought about
things like the slide whistle and they
were like that changes the sound wave so
why can't we teach a phone to have an
input based on changing sound waves so
here's how it works so there's a little
plastic piece that is 3d printed and it
has a continuous ultrasonic path running
through it ok so you attach that to the
bottom of your smartphone and then
there's another part that plugs into the
microphone so you can't hear that
ultrasonic path the frequency but your
microphone in your smartphone can so
that means you can add these little tiny
3d printed attachments like dials and
switches and you
actually control the input on the
smartphone without needing any power at
all and also I for very very very
cheaply and here are all the different
options they came up with right yeah
those are all the different options so
they'll show a few of them so like some
of the ideas they have here like rocker
switches multi turn knobs like volume or
you know different things like that
they've balls out so you can like shift
through stuff you can swipe so one this
could be really great for somebody with
a disability of some kind they might be
able to develop accessories but the big
thing is is they were saying that the
kind of point of this is is you can make
even even bigger things so like an alarm
clock so here is this little alarm clock
they made and it's an end user
application and obviously you know yes
you have an alarm clock on your phone
it's very simple but this has like so
you hit the toggle turns it on and you
have this like little lock screen and
then there's a little button inside the
box where it interrupts that ultrasonic
frequency and you're able to you know
snooze it and then they also show this
like smart case where depending on how
you're gripping the smart case it knows
exactly what you want from it so if it's
on the table and not being gripped it
knows that if you pick it up it's in
your hand oh I know that too or if I'm
using it as a camera like I'm
interrupting the frequency holding it in
different ways then they have these like
little toys and stuff like that but
they're all again powered by your
smartphone and they're really low-cost
so they were saying this could pave the
way for cheaper mobile accessories all
different kinds of mobile accessories
and and also mobile accessories that
don't require power to use and would
also take up less of a carbon footprint
they would easier to recycle because
it's plastics that is so clever super it
is incredibly weird yeah and really
weird like really ingenious like it's
really smart way if you like the sound
waves and the microphone yeah I've seen
it I've seen it you like use your phone
as an ocarina and like how much you blow
on it stuff like that but creating its
own noise and stuff like that isn't
that's incredibly we're totally inspired
by that they were like we were inspired
by instruments and so that's why they're
called a coup strument so it's like
accessory and instrument put together so
the up that supports go wit ago this
portion is all right I got to tell you
about Silicon Valley Fashion Week now we
heard about Silicon Valley comic-con
which is going to be smashing together
deep pop culture and technology which we
love here but I also am a lover of
fashion and technology and this sounds
like the fashion week for me as opposed
to LA or New York Fashion Week this is
Silicon Valley Fashion Week being put on
by beta brand and they're using things
like drones as supermodels to walk the
run to fly the runway as it were I'm
glad my god gizelle retired just in time
she's out of a job anyway yeah this
bronze thinner anyway so you know and
they eat though just about the same
backstage which is nothing this is
nothing um so yeah this is a really
interesting kind of event that they're
doing beta brand is putting this on I'm
sure there'll be other designers there
who do future stuff maybe cute circuit
which is one of my favorite futuristic
designers that I like to keep tabs on it
kicks off on May twelfth so it starts
next week so this is not actual footage
from it this is them practicing so this
is beta brand footage of them practicing
for next week they had some other crazy
stuff like they have so they have this
like space kind of like NASA looking
jacket which I thought was kind of cool
like space kind of a space-themed jacket
and then they also have like this disco
thing that was super weird so here's the
disco thing so that obviously it's being
fluttered around in the air from the
drone like the the copters on the drone
right it doesn't seem perfect science
just big jobs just being like flapped
around all over the place and then
they're gonna land it and it's just
really bizarre like these are it's just
so strange but it's so weird that I love
it yeah and and I I totally want to go
and I wish I could but I just I don't
have time have time to get up there so
I've got like I'm gonna have to check
out videos and sup its Silicon Valley
Fashion Week like you can like
supposedly your you're able to go so
it's this is like a thing that you can
attend but we can't like a they're gonna
walk it down the runway just like that
walk a little walk a little drawing
right all right hi guys meet oh there it
is it's very interesting sure yeah which
I just love it so much that's it for the
headlines we're gonna take a quick break
we're gonna be right back with an
Avengers inspired Mod Squad and of
course we're going to have a
continuation of our user feedback with
our Konami feedback oh yeah and then our
photogra for the day so don't click away
it's tomorrow dealing
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's a wednesday and it's also the
wednesday before the avengers age of
ultron launches oh that little thing yep
I'm that tiny indie movie as we all know
we don't know if it's gonna make any
money it's gonna be close may not ever
see another one uh but yeah it's a we
want to do a really cool kind of
Avengers theme Mod Squad and there was a
perfect candidate so let's hit it worked
on my graphic I really really really did
um are you familiar with Patrick freeze
on YouTube the laser guy he's like a
super laser enthusiast he's gonna burn
stuff with the lasers to a lot of times
he okay yeah maybe Mia easy well there's
a lot of us and said if I was a lot of
laser dudes you know what is this thanks
guys okay so Patrick priebe is kind of a
popular youtuber I've seen his videos
before and he was really excited that
age of Ultron was comin out and so he
built this Iron Man hand that has a
laser in the hand and it's a really
really strong laser it's actually got
two lasers on board so he made a cool
working replica of an Iron Man glove
unfortunately we won't be shooting any
missiles out of it or anything like that
so it has sound effects and it has
lasers from in the palm and on the top
of his wrist like so you do that so
there's the laser right there he's like
okay cool as soon as he opens his hand
up its pops the laser it's made of
aluminium the firing mechanism is brass
and there's two lasers on board the red
one that you're seeing right now out of
the top of his hand is a 300 millet red
laser and then the one on his palm on
the other side is actually really
powerful as a 700 milliwatts I mean that
one he uses to pop balloons and also
etch would he was like hedging a
designer we have put it to that oh my
god oh yes Larry is doing that so yeah
he's action etched in some would
probably drawing a picture of robert
downey jr of course as one would do with
the laser to with that orange i probably
you burn a hole right through it find a
guess but yeah so he's he's got some
great stuff over on the laser gadgets
youtube channel which is pretty neat he
sells a lot of his create
on his website there he goes with the
orange yes he's a burn a hole right
through that orange you're like a whole
Julie pull wall of blues and stuff um
but yeah so cool and it's a he said it
took three weeks to make but he bug he's
real I mean this is like this is what he
does so he's got that whole website
where he sells like little contraptions
and things with lasers say I hear their
egos Oh get it get am Iron Man its
actual pew pew kill thank you kill
Evelyn he says a note to self add aiming
laser which I like so ya see the red one
takes a lot longer obviously because
it's less powerful but yeah pretty cool
yeah that's pretty scary as well so I
think you know if Tony Stark was hiring
Marvel was hiring jeez like hire that
guy yeah make really really concerns I
got to take on those balloons yeah those
evil balloons robot oh but that's crazy
that he made the full glove yeah it's so
cool so yeah three weeks pretty good
nice job pat pat pat priebe um okay we
gotta continue our discussion from
yesterday on the teeth for about Konami
so let's talk about user feedback settle
in this is gonna be a Wong email you're
comfortable okay this email is from nick
nick has never written into the show
before never last time you made up for
lost time 170 episodes in today this is
this is his hundred and seventy of Saudi
mail I stopped talking about Konami
we're wondering what's going on Konami
he has some really good points bear with
us cuz it's a long email but I think he
makes a lot of great points first of all
I love the show try to watch every day
most of the time over my lunch but this
is my first time responding to hashtag
add a second on the topic of Konami I
think you're spot on that they're
restructuring I happen to be a project
manager at a large bank so when you
reported they were cancelling major
projects letting people go D listing it
immediately told me they were refocusing
their efforts strategically I did a
quick google and found an article
explaining Japan is on the verge of
legalizing casinos there it is seeing as
that that is Konami home turf in a very
lucrative market for them it makes sense
they would revise their capital plan to
focus on that without boring you with
too many details US regulators tend to
not like it when you completely revise
your capital plan mid-year that may be
one reason they delisted themselves in
the US but not other markets like London
london berlin tokyo exactly not to
mention the firestorm that would come
from the rating agencies with konami not
clearly articulating why they're making
the changes speaks to uncertainty in the
company and what could have gotten them
devalued which obviously would have hurt
their plans to invest in more casinos on
that topic the article I found a Reuters
explain Kaname is positioning itself not
only to supply casinos with machines but
to become a full partner in the casinos
this guy did his homework they
apparently plan to make this division a
subsidiary of the larger konami company
this tells me they need to strengthen
their brand name which may be why we're
seeing them push it rather than the
creator's names should be why they would
take a G Moff of the site fair enough
overall as long as they didn't really
take anyone off tick any of their
creators off they may still be able to
release the cancelled games in the
future actually if their casino business
goes well may bolster their gaming
division as well by allowing them to
hire on more and more new and
exceptional talent unless of course they
go the opposite way and exit the gaming
market altogether the focus on the
casino business wouldn't that stink just
my thoughts sorry it's so long I tend to
be long-winded keep up the good work no
you keep up the good work Nick that was
real good you keep it up that's real
good our new host of tomorrow daily jack
thank you for trying to financial
analyst on tomorrow daily viewer Nick
boy that did not give me any hope at all
for Konami honestly well you know if you
think about it a lot of people don't
realize Nintendo used to be a they used
to be a gaming company like cards like
they like um bicycle like playing cards
yeah they used to be like these do that
stuff and even before then it's the
intent has been around for a really long
time not to video games until the 80s
but they've been around since I think
the 1890s that company has been around
since like the late 1800s Wow okay so
they they have done a lot of stuff and
this is just sort of a blip on the radar
for them in terms of like I mean this is
what they're known for but they've done
a lot more other things before
previously and there they'll probably do
more things in the future than just
gaming but again if they're so excited
about their whole gambling area I don't
see them even wanting money box anymore
then want to strengthen up it looks like
they're they're dropping their games
once they got metal gear out they don't
really need they don't need consume
anymore you know they can sell out their
properties or just like lease them out
to have other people make them
me ask you this if could you know left
if kijima leaves konami yeah where does
he go to make games what's that what's
the gaming publisher or the gaming
developer where's the game company that
he should go to to make games yay I'm
just kidding hahahaha as a terrible
answer oh we kid around here at jokers I
have no idea I would like but maybe
Bethesda yeah his own IP sabbath esta
like not work on current current
franchise but like his own do his own
thing it may be Bethesda is this good I
aware that would also be good I was also
good yeah those are both I think the
only options uh if you want to do
exclusives I could say maybe like
Microsoft like a microsoft developer
bungee you do bungee that could be good
um but yeah I think probably those would
be that's all good call so anyway
alright so that was our user feedback is
our only piece of user feedback and what
we're gonna do TD bullets and TD suit
tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow show don't
double whammy but thank you Nick that
was a very good at email I know where do
