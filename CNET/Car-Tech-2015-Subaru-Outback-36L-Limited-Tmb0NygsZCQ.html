selling a ton of cars but also enjoying
the second highest customer loyalty
after Ford let's find out what's making
folks come and making them stay as we
drive the new six generation outback
this one a 3.6 limited and check the
tech now this new outback for 2015 as
you can see has been very unmistakeably
revised it's a little more Manhattan if
you will a little less at or on deck
just finessed all around the edges that
does not take it away it's chunky
presentation or its high ground
clearance 8.7 inch just like the last
model and now the grille has automatic
arrow shutters that will close at
highway speeds to smooth the airflow and
improve its mpg we'll talk about that a
little bit later
inside you'll find a cabin that is also
more urban more urbane to be honest
although sube just can't shake their
penchant for bright garish colors in the
instrument panel and the nighttime
lighting and Outback 3.6 is gonna cost
you about 34 grand delivered we're gonna
add a $3,000 option package for
navigation driver assist moonroof and
keyless we're at about 37 let's see what
you get and the biggest change in the
cabin you see right away is Subaru
finally has a more modern sophisticated
interface on their head unit here's the
home screen you can see your basic
functions are all there before we even
get to those though notice it's kind of
like this sort of this one single sheet
of glass type design very very
sophisticated and the touch response is
really outstanding it moves quickly and
I almost never have to touch anything
twice to get it to understand what I
wanted under the navigation you find the
map that now has much nicer rendering
look how smooth and nicely done that is
and I find that Road labels are always
very readable very usable system now in
addition to that very snappy easy to use
touch command you've also got the voice
button here on the wheel voice in this
system they've tried to make very
natural how many my help you play
satellite radio
which satellite station would you like
to listen to chill tuning to chill
that's how you actually want to talk to
a radio right it hiccups a little where
if you notice the master choices you
have are all based around audio climate
control maybe some settings to get to
navigation commands you've got to tell
it to shift to that mode and frankly
using voice command to control things
like the temperature or the radio
station is way less important to me than
using it for a complex task like finding
or entering an address so it should be
easier to voice command nav than
everything else not harder now going
into your media things get a little bit
chaotic you've got your traditional
media if you will will you find things
like broadcast but also aha
Pandora and blue to streaming but under
apps you're going to find another set of
layers there's aha and Pandora again
here is star link which is Subarus own
sort of a master menu system that goes
through your phone in general I find
star link is painfully slow and
frequently tends to bonk and say you
need to reconnect then you've got mirror
link which is the phone screen
projection technology that is sort of
trying to emerge it would take much of
us on your phone and put it on the
screen like Google navigation for
example except mirror link technology
requires a Maryland compatible phone
which mostly means either an HTC or Sony
Foam a galaxy s3 would work but no
iPhones
no other galaxies and these guys are
signed on to do apple carplay and
android auto this year so imagine a
future out back with mirrorlink StarLink
carplay Android and the home audio menu
here that would be a mess of
unprecedented proportions if I got to be
harsh dump Starling because it sucks and
dump Maryland cause it might be DOA now
under the hood we of course have the 3.6
out back that means the 3.6 liter flat 6
boxer engine not the flat 4 we're doing
256 horsepower out of this unit now
247 pound-feet of pork 0 to 16 about
seven point three seconds it's not super
snappy but I don't think these buyers
care weighs about 3,800 pounds gets you
mpg of 20 city twenty-seven highway as
our director Kelly said no I'm done with
the 20s that's a little low thirst of
course these vehicles are all
symmetrical all-wheel drive that Subaru
stock-in-trade
first thing I noticed getting in this
outback is responsiveness is quite good
that doesn't mean it's overwhelmingly
powerful I'm going up a grade here right
now it's got enough power but not too
much but when you ask it for power you
get it in a linear fashion when you lift
off the pedal you get deceleration
that's satisfying that isn't found that
often in a lot of cars I Drive it's also
very nice and quiet in this car they've
used some new fluid engine mounts and
they've also done some stuff with
laminating the windshield glass CVT only
in this guy if I put it the manual gate
and grab some shifts and not bad it kind
of simulates a true automatic pretty
well this is pretty good CVT I've never
found it rubbery or slippery at any
point that I can recall
ride quality is great I've never found a
point where it felt wallowy
in the extreme nor too harsh now there
is a technology called the iSight camera
that lets them handle things like
forward collision warning helps with
adaptive cruise control lane departure
warning they've improved it recently
it's a stereo camera now I understand
they've added more of a color imaging
technology our car though unfortunately
is not equipped with that assist in some
happy friendly little approachable car
to drive now that's a little after all
spacious and comfortable inside a look
that's more urban and modern they're not
gonna have any problem continuing their
rather torrid sales pace these days
