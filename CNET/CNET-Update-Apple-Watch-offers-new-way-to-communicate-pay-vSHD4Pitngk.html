iPhone 6 plus I'm Bridget Carey and in
this CNET update I have everything you
need to know about Apple's new products
in under three minutes Apple has created
a new way to communicate make payments
and interact with objects around us with
a brand new product the Apple wash to
stand out in a sea of smart watches that
are in the market now the Apple watch
does more than just show you tweets and
text messages although yes it does show
typical notifications including map
directions to navigate you'll use a dial
knob on the side it has the health
sensors that you expect to track your
heartbeat and you can even send your
heartbeat to another watch to flirt or
doodle and tap secret messages to your
friends but there's also this NFC chip
that lets you pay wirelessly at the
register with the tap of your wrist you
can also use this tech for other tricks
like opening up the door to your hotel
room at Starwood Hotels and I'm sure app
developers will program more uses for it
as for style there are 3 versions
including a sporty version and a gold
model and it comes in a smaller size for
those with smaller wrists it'll come out
early next year starting at 350 dollars
and yes it does require an iphone to use
but let's go back to pain with the watch
Apple has introduced a new wireless
payment system called Apple pay it means
you can pay with your Apple watch or the
new iPhone 6 models by tapping the
device to the register you don't need to
take out your credit card apple says it
has encrypted the data to keep your
information secure and to add to your
protection you would pay while putting
your fingerprint on that touch ID sensor
now it'll first launched in the US next
month with American Express cards
MasterCard and Visa and it's also
compatible with a majority of banks
major retailers like Macy's McDonald's
and Disney will soon accept Apple pay in
stores you'll even be able to use it in
the McDonald's drive-through just don't
drop your phone out the window please
and as for those new iPhones well if you
wanted a larger screen Apple served up
to the iPhone 6 has a 4.7 inch screen
and the iPhone 6 plus has a 5.5
scream along with a sensor to use Apple
pay it has a boost in speed with faster
processors and the camera also has
improvements like being able to focus
twice as fast and video is captured with
more detail Apple also squeeze them a
little more battery juice although if
you're paying with your phone all day
measuring your work out with new sensors
and syncing it all into the Apple watch
I'm not sure your battery is gonna last
much longer the iPhone 6 starts at $200
the iPhone six-plus starts at $300
pre-orders begin Friday September 12th
and it hit stores on September 19th
that's your quick Apple summary but if
you crave more head to cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
