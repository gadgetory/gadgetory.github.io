home theater projector it costs a mint
although not quite $10,000 and delivers
some of the best image quality we've
ever seen and like all of its kind can
fill screens bigger than any TV but the
real story here is told with lasers
unlike most projectors on the market
which have replaceable lamps that cost
250 to 500 bucks each and need to be
replaced every few thousand hours the LS
10000 has lasers inside this bulbous
heavy cabinet is a pair of blue lasers
one provides the red light and one is
split by yellow phosphor to create the
red and green light another advantage
over lamp based projectors is a quick
turn on time this projector reaches peak
brightness in about 30 seconds while
lamp based projectors take about three
times as long in terms of non laser
features the LS 10000 is very well
equipped its input array offers more
analog connections than competitors and
one of its HDMI inputs has hdcp 2.2
compatibility for 4k sources it comes
with a pair of 3d glasses has a
motorized lens covered its extensive
menus offer you tiles of setup options
and tweaks including provisions and
memories for ultra wide screens I
compared the LS 10000 to a couple of top
competitors from Sony and JVC and its
picture more than held its own contrast
was great thanks to exceedingly deep
black levels although not quite as deep
as on the JBC colors are accurate and
video processing options including a
feature that tried to approximate 4k
resolution were also solid no it doesn't
deliver quite the same level of detail
with 4k sources as Sony's native 4k
projector but sharpness was still superb
between these three I still like the
high contrast JVC best especially since
it cost the least but the laser powered
Epson is a beast in its own right that's
a look at the Epson LS 10000 laser
projector I'm David Katz my resina</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
