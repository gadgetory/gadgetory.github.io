company unveiled two new insect BOTS and
we're gonna tell you all about them this
product may seem like an April Fool's
joke but remember this is April 2nd so
let's I'll tell you more about in a sec
very trail and we have a really cool
look at an ark pen which is helping
Parkinson's patients use their hands to
write letters and stuff which is pretty
awesome alright guys it's April 2nd
April Fool's Day is out of the way
tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best cake
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley Scavo join me as always kale
anonymous you survived April Fool's Day
I did you know I'm glad we didn't do
anything and you survived cupcake a
Palooza for your birthday I did there is
a cupcake girl at this hardest time of
your life so I'm glad you can make it it
was yesterday was an extremely difficult
day yeah thanks thanks thanks April
Fool's Day but now everything is back to
normal
presumably back to sue we've got some
good story in the blog about your
stories
yeah real honest stories we agree a lot
of stories yesterday but everyone else
did not so okay guys let's uh let's hit
that once all right so I'm gonna tell
you about these insect bugs okay you're
like you're doing where you looking at
the insect bucks do we have something oh
I know I know um so this is from German
robotics somebody Festo you're gonna
freak out when you see these videos okay
they're gonna weird you out actually a
lot right there were they unveiled these
two new insect robots like either early
this though I know they're so creepy
looking but they're also kind of stylish
in their own way so anyway those are
Bionic ants and the Bionic ants are
inspired by nature as you're seeing on
the screen rubies are these are real
those are real answer um but that is the
that is the robot ant and they are
inspired by swarm intelligence just like
regular ants and they communicate with
each other and coordinate their movement
based on the others so they can actually
kind of talk to each other which is
pretty cool they're all individually
autonomous but they all have a common
objective to work towards so they they
talk to each other to sort of figure out
exactly what they each need to do and
all that stuff there's a radio module on
their abdomens that lets each robot ant
talk to the other and then they can kind
of figure out each individually like
what they need to do to accomplish this
task they say Oh like well you're doing
this so I should go over to this side of
this thing and push this you know things
like that so pretty awesome and I like I
just love the concept of these sort of
swarm I like smart the idea of swarm
robots I think they're really fun and
they all have yeah independent charging
they like walk up and put their intent
on that's
charge and I think they they don't they
don't last very long I want to say it's
like maybe like a couple hours like they
like moving around but um okay so why
did they make us nightmare fuel well so
the second bug I'll explain a little bit
like once we take a look at the second
because it's a little bit different so
we went from the ground to the sky and
these are the emotions butterflies now
they look kind of small but there are 50
centimetres wingspan so they're pretty
big actually they're kind of larger and
also obviously inspired by real-life
butterflies like he's a real butterfl
those are real on the screen right now
and then those are fake so you can see
there they're quite a bit bigger than
normal size butterflies but the cool
thing about these is again they use
collective behavior so they all have
individually controlled wings and
different types of it's really weird to
watch them fly Wow super pretty there
they're so stylish looking right so
they're huge and they each have so they
fly these butterflies in a in a confined
space or in an area where they're able
to put up these infrared cameras and
then each one of these butterflies has
an infrared sensor on it so that the
cameras can pick up exactly where they
are in the room spatially send that data
to a master computer and then the
computer tells all of the butterflies
where to fly so that they don't bump
into each other which is pretty awesome
so you have to set up a lot of stuff to
make these guys fly around yeah these
ones not just like you fly you just let
them kind of like a box of doves yes
just amount cameras so they don't hit
each other each other yeah this is sort
of a more experimental kind of
coordinating behavioral flight kind of
thing so unfortunately we will not be
able to purchase any of these as
consumers these are not like things that
they're working on to bring to market
they're actually making these in the
hopes that they will continue to sort of
fuel the autonomous robot robotics
development that they have going on at
Festo so it's these are sort of like
like promotional robots okay here's some
of the stuff we're working on look at
how cool this is these are all work
these robots even though they're insects
like they make them more interesting to
look at because they have a shape or a
form that we're familiar with they say
one of the cool things we're doing with
Thomas robots doing a collective task
together so this is just created for
inspiration yeah future it's not like
they're like oh we're gonna have ants
rescue people no it's all part of their
like Bionic Learning Network so they
have like a whole thing where they have
like unveiled these robots and stuff
they also had like a gripper that was
based on like a chameleons tongue it was
really weird but those two the insect
bugs I thought were the most interesting
hey as long as they don't make spider
things I'm totally okay with that so
well done I now to the second story I'm
not like the best businessman or am i
any sort of businessman at all what if I
was a company I would not launch
something on March 31st the day before
April Fool's Day you know I don't know
because I don't want people to think
it's fake especially if it seems fake
but it was something weird yeah but
Amazon decided hey whatever let's just
do it we're Amazon and they decided to
launch Amazon - now Amazon - it takes
your one-step ordering - to infinity and
beyond basically it is a little tiny
device that you just set to your account
and you hit the button whenever you so
like if it's a dishwasher detergent you
put on your washing machine oh no I'm
not a detergent boom you get the - and
it orders more detergent for you right
yeah so it's it's one step touch if you
waited it that quickly I guess I guess
there's a need for that I don't I don't
really know so some of this stuff
there's about 18 buttons available I'm
some of the ones that we saw them for
was bounty I ran a paper towels all the
time yeah well Maxwell House of coffee
Smart Water ol a Gerber glad tide and
there's more in the video but again it's
one touch and if you accidentally press
like if you have a kid that's just like
a button tight tight tight tight tight
tight tight tight tight you could be
like you could cancel it on your
smartphone within a little small amount
of time if you lived with Cale who's
literally can't help himself and just
presses every button he sees yeah I like
it so there you go that is that's fast
ordering made easily yeah so I don't
know what
it's one-click ordering right now
without a computer which is crazy if you
want it right now
again it is real and then we get Amazon
Prime and they have a thing where you
can just like if you have Amazon Prime
you can just click that and they're
giving some away for free right now it's
like a demo run Amazon likes to do that
kind of thing so you can go they'll only
send three max to each home so I mean
it's kind of a gamble to try it out I
already did it I already like you're
like you're in good luck let's see I
think I may go I may go Brita water
filters they're saying that they'll have
one that have you put it on your put a
water water filter will tell you when
your Brita water filters yeah and bad
and mine I you drink so much water that
it's gonna go bad this is which is bad
because they're gonna like they're gonna
really cut it close part of this program
is like letting manufacturers in on this
like one-click sort of process or
automated ordering process so you might
not be able to get that right away but
what they're saying is like they're
letting developers into the back end of
that like whole process so that they can
integrate the technology into stuff like
these Brita filters where it's like oh
your Brita filters bad oh you
automatically ordered another one it's
coming in the mail like you wouldn't you
just get an email on your phone say
Internet of Things yeah things everybody
so weird this is too much it's a little
weird but I could see the coffee thing
or I could see a lot of these being
really useful in an office environment
like it like coffees out oh we just
click the button and it comes to me the
next day or paper towels are tied or
what or is that one guy that would hit
then you just have this you know the
person in the account like says oh no no
this is like 18 people have ordered
coffee today ha ha ha ha I wish there
was some kind of notification that was
like this was the last time you ordered
from this button like I wish there was a
tiny just LEDs where they had the last
date of last order so that way if it's
at an office not every person going to
the coffee machine realizing that the
coffee's gone is like oh we gotta order
more coffee it's like then you have 18
but I'm very curious to see how how
useful this actually is yes so I mean I
only buy tied what once every two months
so one quick button may not be necessary
we'll see yeah Amazon is trying to break
new grounds I totally get that it's not
an April Fool's joke if you want to try
it out Amazon - go stand for it
while they're still doing it for free so
there you go Amazon - that's our hashtag
of the day - what is TD - oh so I want
to know are you guys good is anybody
actually interested in using this one
and - what's the what's the button that
you need like what's the what you Pizza
button oh yes why no but I mean like
urgency no I was gonna say it like you
just have like with you all the time is
like you need it on a keychain where you
press a button and Pizza comment so
we're gonna have our I run out of really
unorthodox stuff like lemon juice I ran
a lemon juice a lot sriracha I run out
of sriracha all the time so watch a
button okay good
I would say but a guy in a chili pepper
would have to show up and deliver like
that's what's missing right stuff is
that's interesting here is it's not just
a delivery thing there's like it's step
up like if this was one touch button and
a drone came and delivered it if they
started binding all their stuff see I
was gonna say it would have to be for me
integrated with Amazon now which brings
it like within an hour yeah that's like
if I could be like oh gosh I'm not a
coffee I need this I need a fix within
an hour because otherwise I'm just gonna
get in my car go to the store cuz I'm
desperate for coffee and I'm just gonna
go get some coffee
or honey can you pick up paper towels
you know on your way home yeah exactly
it's what's your one thing I would say
for me it would probably be oh that's
tough um good you came with a question
oh I know I like I said I never actually
think about the answer to these
questions before we sit in these chairs
and I ask it to Kail I would probably
say you know I really I really I would
say creamer like that's we run out of
creamer all the time for our coffee and
I just that would be the thing I would
need like right away cuz I can't can't
have coffee without creamer seems like
such a boring like like device I haven't
handy I haven't really needed this yet
but that's what I'm saying is that maybe
your gave a device where you get it
you're like I can't live without this
yeah cuz I remember when I got my smart
phone I was like why do I need a smart
phone right I can just go to the
internet and now it's like if I'm go
without it for what this is
we'll see hey so tell us if you guys
think you want this what's it what is it
TV - PD - that's it yeah let's see I'm
so curious I hear one thing and then
what's the button that you would need to
use it all the night
so I'd love a programmable button where
you say if I press this button I get
this thing but they but it's all
partnerships with all these why did they
say it was like 30 18 18 of them at
first I'm not sure they'll have more
diapers would be another one if that's a
big one or a new parent it would have a
baby all right all right let's talk
about the Parkinson's pen this is cool
this is called the arc pen this is from
a British design firm called dopa
solution and they made this pen and it
looks a little different than a standard
pen it's it's pretty wide and it has
sort of a almost like a triangular shape
to it but the thing with Parkinsons is
people who suffer from that disease a
lot of times they have this additional
disorder that is specific to their
handwriting called micrographia and it
means their writing gets smaller as
their hand cramps up more and it just it
gets tinier and more cramped as they
write because it's really tough for them
to grip a pen for an extended period of
time especially because a lot of times
pens are really thin and they're very
difficult to hold on to when you have
Parkinsons so they may dope a solution
made this pen the ark pen that uses high
frequency vibration to stimulate muscles
in the hand for Parkinson's patients and
it lets those users write larger and
clearer characters for extended amounts
of time which is pretty great so you can
see the before and after like it's a
pretty pretty good difference and like
the video saying right now 86% of the
participants to improved there were four
only 14 it was a very small group of
people who tested it but they 86% marked
improvement they saw improvement in 86
percent so I thought that was pretty
cool they very cool they're still in
testing yeah they want to improve it
obviously it has inductive charging
which I thought was really cool it has
like a docking station they want to this
is the part I thought was awesome
so they want to expand this type of
technology this high frequency vibration
for Parkinson's patients to write into
other handheld tools so for example
makeup brushes and artist brushes like
different things like that where you
would hold on a computer mice that was
another thing that they mentioned oh
where is where it makes it easier for
somebody suffering from Parkinson's to
be able to serve do these things on
their own
opposed to having someone else do it for
them or not doing it at all so maybe
somebody was an artist they get
Parkinson's then they say why I can't
hold a paintbrush anymore that's just
terrible I can't do it
well now hopefully they would be able to
give that back to them and say well no
now you can you can go back and do this
if use these brushes or whatever so I
thought that was a really cool invention
really neat I love that you know
companies are working towards things
like this because you know it doesn't
affect a large portion of the population
but it is an important part of the
population who needs our help
and so I thought that was pretty amazing
yeah I liked it I like that it doesn't
just stop at the pen that they're like
continuously going they want to solve
all of the problems that these people
face and they definitely deserve it yeah
they've got something real difficult I
really like that they have these like
sort of really broad plans for it and I
thought that was so cool so great job
dopa nice work we're gonna take a quick
break we'll be right back we have a
roundup into it because it's Thursday
we're gonna tell you what's draining our
wallets and then we have our a TD fold
user feedback we're gonna talk to all
the crazy April Fool's gags that we're
going around the internet yesterday and
of course our phone art for the day so
don't click away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show everybody you
are so pumped right now about your
Intuit that we should just go right we
should just go right to the segment this
is into it I don't even want to waste
time I'm not into that segue but I am
what I'm into this time is a Furious 7
it came out didn't it hasn't come out
here yet I know come out overseas and
globally they're projecting 250 jillion
dollars million dollars but I'm super
excited about it there's a lot of buzz a
lot of positive buzz almost every outlet
is like super like this is amazing
everyone should see this I it's it's got
that they apparently the Paul Walker
thing is handled really well
they're like there's tons of info about
this there's gonna be this is the
beginning of a new trilogy for Fast and
Furious
what Vin Diesel's like this is gonna be
this is gonna win Best Picture at the
Oscars yeah I'm very excited about this
we were talking about this on Tuesday
for new releases and I just like I think
you're absolutely right and that you
said you're like when you go see movie
like this like you know exactly we're
getting know exactly where you're gonna
go see that's cop and if you want to
have fun oh my god he brings on his cast
with his muscle it's his rage on the
rock there's ruffles in it he jumps a
car from one and look there was a
minigun and you jump SATCOM oh boy it
just looks so fun and outrageous and fun
like there's no I for me it's just I see
these trailers I'm like that just looks
like fun yeah and I'm anytime I mention
it on on Twitter people are like it's
amazing you're gonna love it I had
friends who went and saw press screening
and I'm so jealous so jealous
what do you into so I'm into the rainy
pot there it is okay okay so the rainy
pot is what we have our lower third
right now but I'll lift it up okay so
the rainy pot is a little planter that
you hang on your wall I got it for my
birthday from my dear friend Mike he's
been on the show before you guys might
remember back in like August so what you
do is you plant a little plant in here
and you get seeds it comes with seeds
and or you can plant whatever you want
and
and there's a little sponge inside this
cloud is our video yeah we have a video
of it and so you can see when it's so
cute when you pour the water in there it
looks like it's raining onto the plant
cuz it like it spreads out the water so
it doesn't look like one constant stream
it trickles down and do it looks like
it's raining right onto your little
plant it's super cute and you can hang
it on it's basically you mount it on
your wall and then you have a little
little planter there's it evenly
distributed over time where is it just
like here here's the know there's the
sponge holds quite a bit of water in
there like I would imagine if you don't
want to just be like on it all the time
like being like adding water to it but
the sponge like will evenly distribute
that water over a period of time like
after you pour it in so it go it'll
it'll dry out obviously but yeah you've
probably water it once and then over
time it will like you know trickle down
into your that's adorable
lot of stuff this is a birthday gift yes
this is a birthday gift and I'm excited
I didn't mount it on my wall cuz yet
because I wanted to bring it into the
show these are the seeds that they send
I don't know what they are because the
box was not clear on that so maybe it's
like I don't know maybe like ulugh
berries or something or no idea yeah
it's super adorable
I just it reminds me of Mario it's like
all green wet oh why it's a piranha
plant that's exactly what it is oh my
god now I have to go plan it immediately
because I'm excited to grow my own
piranha plant but that's what I'm into
shoot fire it's called rainy pot and you
can find them all over there are their
own how much is it I didn't want to look
it up because I felt weird about looking
up a gift from a friend the price good I
saw I felt kind of weird about it it's
for a friend it is it's priceless to me
so but if you want I can't imagine it
would be terribly expensive it's not
made of gold or anything I mean not that
we know of the piranha plant seeds
though they might cost you extra not
really sure okay so that being said we
have to talk about April Fool's and
you're a user feedback so let's let's
get into that
so we asked everybody on Tuesday to use
the hashtag TV fool and tell us like
what their favorite April Fool's joke
was and I think we weren't exactly clear
like we didn't recertify which we never
are that this year's April Fool's Day
like maybe just like keep an eye on
everything and then like tell us but a
lot of people send in stuff that was
like from years ago like I appreciate
that though so I'm like but there were
some stuff I'd never heard of so for
example we had Matthew Matlock write in
and say Google knows from 1 or 2 years
ago which is funny cuz I had like a kind
of a Glee remember this and that was a
really weird thing we have a little bit
of video that everybody likes the Google
ones remember that really likes the
Google ones and Google also did that so
we'll talk a little bit right now about
some of our favorites that we saw I mean
the ones that I saw that I really liked
we're at PlayStation flow where you have
the goggles and then it said like ok so
you're in a game and you jump into the
water and then what you do is you put on
your PlayStation flow goggles and you go
dive in the pool and then you can
control your character like inside a
pool it's really that's weird and super
dumb but it made me laugh it was really
weird and then Google comm turned into
calm Google and everything was backwards
for the day that was annoying actually
it's a little bit annoying and then the
last one that I really liked was at the
National Air and Space Museum they put
they put out this video saying now on
display Wonder Woman's invisible jet and
there's a guy on a lift like a mime
pretending to clean the jet and it's
like the funniest thing ever like it's
there we go it's the extra mile that
makes it totally really is they put out
a whole news post about it they were
like talking about there's one of the
quotes on their blog the Museum of
Flight had acquired the plane with help
from Lieutenant Diana Prince in April
2013 since then our curator Bob van der
Linden wanted very very much to display
the plane at the Museum in Washington DC
and they talked about like the stealth
capabilities of the plane I'm like all
this so I just thought that was so
clever and funny and so perfect so
for a museum to step up and make a joke
yeah like and it's it's just a really
great kind of you know it's a nod to all
of us in geekdom but then also is it
so like sweet and clever it wasn't like
lame like I thought it was a really
clever April Fool's Day joke it actually
almost maybe not not like April Fool's
Day
it made me actually enjoy it although
that's a feat that is a feat indeed so
that is our that is our user feedback
generally dude Jim is there anything
that you were particularly blown away by
I don't I don't go out of my way to see
all that stuff I'm sorry I just I'll
find out about all of it tomorrow or
whatever it all you gonna read some
roundup post yeah I'll figure it out I
think we have I don't like to be played
the fool we like to play fools not be
played the fool already enough of we got
enough of that in our lives all right so
it's time for our very last piece of
user feedback which is always our front
Agri for the day I'd like to formally
apologize to the person who sent in this
picture because I'm about to completely
mess up your name I'm really sorry this
is from SIA Keith sigh Oh Keith sounds
good
guessing he took this on his one plus
one at this picture is so nice he says
hi I'm psyche Mullen here's a
picture of my Hyundai on a desert in
Colorado taken by my oneplus one during
my spring break at the Great Sand Dunes
loved the show keep up the good work
guys regards this is ridiculous looks
like an ad in a manual sits at of a
magazine yeah you ripped it out and took
a picture of it let's all just admit it
sorry Keith we know your games we know
your trickery Opie just copied and
pasted that this is a copypasta
but this is amazing one plus one which
is the first time we've had that
featured on the show pretty good pretty
good done so when I Sophia Pedro has a
one plus one I was little looks really
good really good make it literally looks
like an advertisement which who do you
work for because if you work for none
day shame on you but yeah pretty cool he
says he's on spring break he said he was
on spring break so I'm assuming he's in
school in some way she was yeah College
High School very cool it's probably done
correctly it's probably an eight year
old kid she's just so much better at
photography than we are got a great
future in super good um
