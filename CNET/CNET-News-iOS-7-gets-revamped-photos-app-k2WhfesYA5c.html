your camera and iOS 7 is for cameras in
one you can just swipe from your video
camera to your photo camera to your
square cropped camera to your pano
camera and when you're taking stills you
now have access to live photo filters
from some gorgeous black and whites to
some classic color filters as well so
with your great new camera want to give
you a great new way to manage your
photos and it's the new Photos app you
know for many users this is what their
photo organization looks like an endless
unorganized stream of their camera roll
we've all been there but you know it
doesn't have to be this way there's
great information in those photos iOS
knows where you took the photos and when
you took them and that provides inherent
structure that we can use to organize
those photos and now in photos in iOS 7
we do we organize them into moments I'd
like to give you a demo of that right
now
so let's take a look now at the Photos
app so here you see some photos that
were taken in San Francisco and you see
nothing was done to organize these
photos explicitly and yet they have
these labels like the palace of fine
arts baker beach lombard street it
provides this natural organization for
appreciating the photos we can go up two
more trips at more time in San Francisco
Golden Gate San Francisco Fisherman's
Wharf but then you see we have home we
have photos taken at home and photos
taken at the elementary school and
around that area and now if you want to
zoom back out to get a more of a
bird's-eye view of your collection we
draw these moments intelligently
together into collections so see here
how that multiple day trip around San
Francisco is collected sorry about that
got a little excited there in two it's a
very exciting interface into a multi-day
trip in San Francisco and that time at
home and around the school well that's
one moment that's one collection as well
it's a really great way to browse your
photos you can even go all the way out
to the year level look across your whole
photo collection
and looking at we pull out the
interesting places that you went in that
year like 2011 was colorado and hawaii
2012 went to South America you may not
remember when you did it but iOS does
it's right there and you know with this
retina display you can even kind of make
out patterns of photos and when
different occasions are and of course we
found like we had the urge that we
wanted to just tap in right from here
and so now in fact you can you can just
tap and scrub and find the photo you're
looking for just like that it's really
just amazing so I can just pick a photo
here whichever one I want it's kind of
cute and now we can edit it because we
have photo filter so I can go into the
filters here I can try different color
effects and if I find one I like maybe a
nice black and white can do it just like
that I apply it save that photo away we
also have great new ways to share your
photos in the photos apps let's bring up
sharing we have a airdrop right here if
any of you were running iOS 7 i'd see
you it looks like it didn't leak so
that's good you're not in there right
now but you have airdrop you have access
to other photos you can share them from
right here just really handy great photo
sharing option is iCloud photo sharing
I'm going to tap on that now it's going
to iCloud photo sharing and from here I
can select the photo streams that I want
to share too so I'm on family photos now
but I'm going to drill in and I can see
other photo streams I've set up and now
other people can share into my photo
stream as well so these are shared photo
streams
I'll just select a photo stream here and
type a little message will post that
photo so we made it really easy to share
and we've also made it a really great
experience to experience the photos you
and others have shared with this new
shared tab at the bottom so I'm going to
go in here see my photo with a comment I
can see the comments of other people and
the photos that they've shared and now
we even support sharing video via iCloud
photo sharing and we have a great way to
just browse those shared photos I just
tilt the device into landscape I can
scroll through it like this and just
look at how beautiful that is what a
great way to experience your photos so
that's the new Photos app in iOS 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
