upon us as you sketch out your plan of
attack
keep these basic rules in mind to avoid
getting suckered by a bad deal
for starters always do a little
background on the gadget is it brand new
or last year's model we've seen some
nice sales advertised on last year's
Roku which is still perfectly good as
well as last year's Beats Studio
wireless headphones and last year's
GoPro Hero 5 Smart speakers are gonna be
a hot gift and it seems every store is
selling the new Google home Mini at a
discounted price of $29 and stores are
even throwing in bonus gift cards and
coupons to sweeten the sale it sounds
perfect until you remember that Google
admitted there was a problem with the
speaker and how to disable the touch
controls not a big deal if you don't
mind only controlling it with your voice
see research matters Amazon will also
put its smart speakers up for sale but
if you're getting wrapped up an Amazon
deal hunting you should use the site
camel camel camel it will check the
price history of everything sold on
Amazon so you know if it's a really good
deal also do the math on bundles getting
a bundle doesn't always mean you're
getting a discount Nintendo has a Super
Mario Odyssey switch bundle that comes
with the console game and carrying case
and it costs the same as if you were
buying all three things separately there
are a few things that are never a good
deal for Black Friday do not buy mobile
chargers phone cases or accessories
those tend to be overpriced when you're
swept up in the shopping rush and stay
away from off-brand or no brand tablets
they will just end up being junk when it
comes to cheap tablets your best choice
is Amazons fire 7 tablet it's only 30
bucks when it's on sale now you may not
hit all the deals but rest assured there
will likely be more sales leading up to
Christmas and when it comes to the
turkey day gadget rush research from
Adobe Analytics says Thanksgiving Day
offers the best prices on computers and
video games Black Friday is best for
buying appliances tablets and TVs and
Cyber Monday always has plenty of sales
but toys usually see the best Monday
price cuts I'm Bridget Carey and you can
keep up with the latest hot holiday
gadget deals I see
