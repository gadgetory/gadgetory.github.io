SmartWatch for a very long time I backed
the pebble that was supposed to come out
it never did cuz Fitbit bought them and
we know what happened so I went out and
bought a versa because I was like this
seems like the one for me and I had it
for I don't know a week and a half and I
was like no I hate it I would wouldn't
turn on when I flick my wrist I complain
to you about it because it was it was
like almost your fault that this is not
my fault anyway somehow my fault oh your
fault someone on Twitter said hey check
out this brand from China that check it
was amaze Fitbit and I've been wearing
it for a month and I love this watch
because it just does what I wanted to do
it's always on it's got an e display it
was like $79 the battery lasts for you
know a month and then I changed the
watch face around and I get at least two
weeks out of it and it just gives me
like very basic notifications and that's
really all I want out of a SmartWatch
well you know it is my fault my fault is
that I did not look at the amazement bit
sooner and you pushed me to finally
review it it had this kind of surprised
us launch and it came available it's
been a cult hit where a lot of people
are buying this like five million people
have bought this world was and and this
watch I looked at amazed but the company
apart of Xiaomi they they're basically
taking what the pebble did and doing it
more like the pebble then will fit and
it's funny cos Fitbit bought pebble but
I'd say the Fitbit tried to make it much
more like the Apple watch and really
pursue trying to make this thing look
have a nice design and and and flashy
features which is fine but this is much
more utilitarian and this focus is on
things like their always-on screen
super long battery like I got I've got
two weeks of battery life no problem
with this and it does everything just
fine and is low key and for a lot of
people that don't want to worry about a
SmartWatch good enough yeah it takes
away all the annoying things I'd still
say it doesn't really address some of
the stuff like it takes a little bit of
time to connect to the watch and kind of
goes to sleep after a while and I still
like the Fitbit app if you want to do
fitness I feel like it's much better for
finding communities and tracking the me
fit app is like you're kind of on your
elbows no it's it's bare bones and a
little weird but it's if you want to
just track steps you want to just track
things like steps
leapin and not worry much about that it
definitely does that it even does heart
rate and the real question is why aren't
more watchmakers doing things like the
emaciation it's obviously cheaper to
make I did she / to sell you would
imagine people would buy this you know
it's look it's not the perfect watch but
I do like the fact that I was able to
customize my own just by doing a little
bit of research and and you know using
Photoshop to create my own face that was
awesome
feel like something like greater than I
would ever get couldn't do that but I
appreciate they already have a couple of
good ones a decent community yeah like
and you can get what you want this watch
to do don't expect a lot especially with
watch faces and apps because this has a
lot more of those yeah but again if
you're looking for something that's like
a digital watch it gets notifications
that you can also curate which is nice
you can turn on individual ones like the
Fitbit does and I just think that more
companies Fitbit if you're listening
which I'm sure you are should be
focusing on making more affordable
watches with always-on screens a better
battery life and not worry so much about
being the fanciest one because look this
thing is really easy to use well I mean
look it comes down to this what got me
to switch from the Versa to the BIP was
being able to tell the time I just want
to look at my wrist nothing freaking
flip it a thousand times
I think the duper you know I've been
super conditioned through smart watches
to start doing that I've got you know
what I do appreciate the fact that this
is always on and yeah it reminds me that
you can do it it's definitely doable and
they spits already doing it so you can
get this thing now but also you could
think about maybe a future watches start
incorporating this this is the message
just do that I'm happy to get rid of the
bit if if if it made the their version
of this I want them to come together
come to Taiwan I want the phone in the
bit to fuse into that future product
which we don't really have yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
