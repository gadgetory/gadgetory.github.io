and IT pros got carpal tunnel syndrome
well fast forward a few decades and now
it seems like everyone is on track to
get some kind of repetitive stress
injury and if you're shopping for a
keyboard and mouse set to ease your pain
Microsoft actually has a pretty good
contender I'm Justin you for CNET this
is your first look at the Microsoft
sculpt ergonomic desktop this keyboard
and mouse combo removes all the
non-essential parts and they give you
only what you need to type and click in
a comfortable position that really takes
the stress off your wrist so this is the
keyboard here it's flat on all sides and
it gradually rises in the center which
forces your hands into a more natural
typing position then you may be
currently used to with your keyboard it
also has a separate number pad here
which makes the keyboard a lot smaller
without it in fact it measures a little
bit more than 15 inches across now
typing on the keyboard is really easy
your wrists find more relief on the soft
padded rest down below and the option to
use this removable riser bar on the
bottom that actually pushes your hands
up even further so this is also pretty
clever Microsoft actually puts magnets
on all the compartments including the
riser bar and the battery door which
makes them really easy to put on and off
again you'll probably need a little bit
of time to adjust to the new layout of
the ergonomic keyboard though the cutout
in the centre separates your hands a
little bit more and since it's set up
for use with Windows 7 &amp;amp; 8 you'll find a
Windows Metro button next to the space
bar instead of the start key you also
get a set of shortcut buttons on top on
the s keys but instead of an FN button
on the bottom like we're used to
Microsoft makes you alternate using an
FN switch instead again it'll take a
week or so to get used to so now onto
the mouse this one's a new shape for the
company and its circular rather than
oval in terms of size it sort of feels
like an oblong baseball in your hand
with a cutout on the left side that acts
as a thumb rest your hand should feel
natural when you place them on the mouse
though I wouldn't have minded some extra
grooves for your index and ring fingers
to rest now the biggest gripe I have
with the mouse is that the top layer is
covered with a shiny plastic that's
really susceptible to fingerprints also
the top tends to get a little sticky
which may be a problem for users that
tend to have sweaty palms now that is
kind of gross but it's something you
should
before you buy you get the standard left
and right clickers on the mouse as well
as a notch scroll dial and a shortcut
button that automatically fires up the
Windows 8 Start menu there's also a
button on the left hand side for your
thumb that takes you back a page in your
browser though I do wish that we're a
little bit easier to press and neither
the keyboard nor the Mouse have
rechargeable batteries so you'll have to
keep a stock of double-a and triple-a s
around the house to replace them at a
hundred and thirty bucks for the set I
definitely would have liked to see some
backlit keys and maybe some rechargeable
batteries but aside from that this combo
definitely accomplishes its goal to
alleviate pressure off your wrists and
get you used to a more natural typing
and mousing position you can check out
more details in my full review on SEANET
but that's going to do it for me I'm
Justin you you just took a first look at
the Microsoft sculpt ergonomic desktop
