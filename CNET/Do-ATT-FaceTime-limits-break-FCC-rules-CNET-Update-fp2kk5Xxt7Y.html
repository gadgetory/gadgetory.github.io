overlords
I'm Richard Carey and this is your CNET
update using FaceTime video chat on the
iPhone has always been a Wi-Fi only
option but that will change in the fall
with the release of iOS 6 and 18 t just
announced it would lit I phone customers
with a shared data plan to use FaceTime
over its cellular network but some are
arguing this could be a rule violation
of the Federal Communications Commission
one outspoken nonprofit group says this
discriminates against customers with
other data plans a video chat service
like FaceTime could be a larger data
burden but there's no technical reason
you can video chat just because you have
a different data plan now ATT responded
saying it does not believe it's breaking
any FCC rules since it's already
available to all customers over Wi-Fi
it's just expanding availability even
further for those with a mobile shared
data plan so as you know we just landed
that Rover on Mars and they're still
testing out all the systems well NASA is
already talking about sending another
robot to Mars in 2016 next time it'll be
a lander that'll study whether Mars has
a solid or liquid core and if the red
planet has tectonic plates that slowly
move just like on earth anyone who
bought a new Windows PC after June 2nd
can register online for $15 upgrade to
Windows 8 when it comes out on October
26th now you might be thinking wasn't it
free for past upgrades for recent PC
buyers yeah and this is the pro version
this time and it's also a little more
than getting the basic version but if
you didn't just buy a computer
it'll cost $40 for you to upgrade and
some news 418 t customers in order to
put a focus on new data sharing plans
18t will no longer subsidize the cost of
a tablet with a contract verizon also
stopped doing that in June there's a
very important election coming up that
needs your vote I'm talking about the
robot Hall of Fame of course for the
first time Carnegie Mellon University is
allowing humans to elect who should be
inducted to its robot Hall of Fame the
award has been given to real and
fictional robots like the Roomba and
c-3po but this year will it be wall-e
Rosie or Johnny Five
it's the entertainment spot it's up to
you and maybe in the future hall-of-fame
it'll include
the MIMO by Honda a robot that mows your
lawn
well more like it nips at your lawn it
needs to cut several times a week since
it's not as powerful or doesn't cut as
much as a typical lawn mower it'll first
be available in Europe next year
starting at 2,500 euros that's your tech
