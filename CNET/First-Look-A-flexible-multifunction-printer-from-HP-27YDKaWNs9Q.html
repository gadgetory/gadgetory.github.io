a first look at the HP photosmart 7520
e-all-in-one printer this machine
combines a printer a scanner and a
copier into a pretty low profile chassis
design you also get the benefit of this
4.3 inch touchscreen on the front it may
look like an iPhone screen but it does
take a little bit of time to learn how
to accurately scroll through the menus
because the screen can be a little
twitchy HP photosmart line is really
targeted at the snapshot photographer
and that's why you get an auto document
feeder on top that's where scanning
stacks of photos the paper tray on the
bottom however can hold up to 125 sheets
of regular eight and a half by 11 inch
paper but there's also a separate 20
sheet photo paper tray on top of that
one so you don't have to be constantly
switching out media now if you don't
have a wireless network set up in your
workspace you can pretty much just
forget about getting this printer
because you really want to have that
Wi-Fi connection setup to take advantage
of all its cloud printing features Mac
users are in luck as well because this
printer is compatible with airprint for
easy setup but of course HP does include
an installation disk in the box so you
can install it on PCs as well or you can
use google cloud print on either
operating system if you're using a
Chrome browser when you talk about HP
cloud printing you're really talking
about two things eprint and the ePrint
center so ePrint is a simple cloud
printing technology that lets you send
jobs from any connected device using a
uniquely assigned email address that
comes with each printer they ship out
while the ePrint center is basically
just a print centric App Store for the
touch display that will give you apps
for quick prints from things like Sudoku
games weather news recipes coupons etc
so once you have the printer hooked up
to your wireless network it's really
easy and convenient for scheduled prints
in our speed test however the 75 10
performed slightly faster than the
average multifunction device in its
price category though it still couldn't
nudge out the epson workforce 645 out of
the fastest position
regardless this printer isn't really
meant for high-volume office printing
anyway so you won't likely notice a
difference if you're just printing a few
photos or news articles at a time you
can read all the details in my full
review on cnet but that's going to do it
for me I'm Justin you you just took a
first look at the HP photosmart 7520
e-all-in-one thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
