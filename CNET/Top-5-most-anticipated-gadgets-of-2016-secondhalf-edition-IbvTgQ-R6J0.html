toys have arrived but these are the top
5 most anticipated gadgets for the
second half of 2016 at number five the
iphone 7 normally a brand new iphone
seems like something everyone wants to
see however leaks of the new iphone
designs seem different firm rumors that
Apple is moving to a three-year upgrade
cycle on the iPhone that would be the
next iPhone would be something like the
iphone 6s to or 6s pro but not a true
redesign the rumor for the 2017 iPhone
are insane sounding like an edge-to-edge
OLED screen and ditching the home button
for a touch ID sensor built into the
glass but that's 2017 that number for
the PlayStation VR the PlayStation VR
has lots of competition but it might
have an advantage over the other guys
it'll work with the 40 million ps4s
already sold in the world there's no
need to buy an expensive PC to use it
the psv r will support 50 games around
it to launch in October it's displayed
manaphy as slick as the oculus rift but
the games could set it apart and number
three google home amazon echo set the
blueprint for smart home speakers I mean
come on that still doesn't sound like a
real category of things but here we are
Google home promises to bring Google to
your home if you use Gmail or Google
Calendar Google home can give you plenty
of information just by talking to it
additionally it'll work with chromecast
and nest products the question is
whether it'll be better than amazon's
Alexa assistant at number two a
redesigned macbook pro so the macbook
pro hasn't been exciting for a while
rumors say the new macbook pro will
ditch the top row keys on the keyboard
for an oled touch panel touch ID would
also make its way to a Mac which will
make a lot of sense since mac OS Sierra
brings things like Apple pay to max
could be pretty snazzy to have a touch
ID sensor for that and passwords rumors
also say the macbook pro will be thinner
and lighter with us bc and thunderbolt 3
expect all or none of these things to be
true in the fourth quarter of 2016 at
number one the Samsung Galaxy Note six
or seven the next samsung galaxy note is
due up in august the previous generation
is the note 5 but rumors say Samsung
will bump the note 2 lucky number seven
whatever it's called the new note to
feature a USBC port and in use
some skin running on top of Android if
this leaked video is accurate the new
skin looks so much better than TouchWiz
Evan blast a guy who always seems to
know what's going to happen says the new
note will feature a 5.7 inch Super
AMOLED screen a 12 megapixel rear camera
a 5-megapixel front-facing camera and an
iris scanner you want more top 5s check
