hanging on for dear life here at the
scene of studios in New York it's
episode 287 somehow I'm BBG thanks for
joining us in the house today we've got
Ben Fox Ruben Roger Chang and Scotty
stag toys I got lots of toys I've got
the iPhone 8 plus wait that's not know
seven plus this is the eighth notes
that's the six he goes there we go and
the beautiful glossy back is black the
glossy back is is back boss okay see
back is back actually is off to a
riveting start the black glossy back is
back we haven't even gotten to the main
podcast yeah but I'm going to attempt to
make that happen I can't even hear
myself in these strappy normal so we're
gonna you so okay we're gonna interview
Scott about his experience with all
these new Apple gadgets we're gonna be
talking about the Apple watch a our kid
and then also we want to take as many
questions as possible yeah we're we're
not we're not gonna talk about the
iPhone too much on the podcast itself
but if you have any questions if Scott's
here yeah we definitely talking about it
it is you know you read the reviews
updated processor not a huge amount of
well you will get it we'll get it -
alright so as always if you have any
questions about any of these products
mostly for Scott leave them in the
comments section Brian will pick out the
best and we will get to them in three
minutes in 59 seconds here we go in
three two
welcome to the 359 I rotor Chang I'm Ben
Fox bourbon and with us is super special
guest Scott's dying hi super special
guests iPhone 8 and Apple watch but
essentially Scott stop I know I'm just
here as their yeah as you can guess from
the introduction Scott's here to talk
about basically all Apple products the
Apple watch review is out I mean if
you've seen the spectrum reviews they've
been mostly negative pretty critical but
Scott what did you think about it hey
Siri what did I think about the Apple
watch
oh never mind it can actually nevermind
it talks it talks on your wrist so Apple
watch is a lot like the previous one it
looks similar you know if you're not
using the LTE it's actually improved
with the software okay and with some of
the Fitness features it's I think it's
the best SmartWatch however the LTE
brings a lot of compromises to the table
I mean it were that's the whole reason
to buy the thing yeah that's the big
selling point for sanity right that is
well yeah except they sell one without
the LTE to save seventy bucks so and
then you could even buy one of last
year's models they're very similar
across the board you can't buy last
year's model well maybe you're good
somewhere we're saying compromises what
compromises well there have been
attempts at these watch phones before
I've worn them Samsung gear s2 and three
and Android wear they usually pretty
buggy and weird and big I like the fact
this one's smaller I found that for
voice calls and for email that instantly
hooked in and felt nice nice and music
this is not an LTE thing right now yet
but the music syncing from your phone is
more like an iPod so but it will stream
later this year there will stream we
haven't even tested that yet no stream
later this year like in a month so I
thought that all created a pretty
seamless feel however it chews up
battery life and you know is it is rated
as an hour for LTE calls so that's
basically that's not a lot that's how
long I call you Roger and that doesn't
give us a long evening conversations
yeah it's more like a break in case of
emergency I shoulda said that like like
it's a mini phone that will expire and
you go home plus here's the other
frustrating thing it's not a standalone
phone at all you need to buy an iPhone
yeah and you need to sync it with that
it's designed for that so you can't
think of this as like the smallest most
affordable whatever you know phone ring
which is not even the most affordable
but that is the iPhone se if we're just
talking about the essenes
so there are a lot of limitations now
other people had talked about connection
problems as well I didn't have those
when I was using it but I did have
notification weirdness where I messages
wouldn't always pop in May that might be
early software at this point which
sometimes before you go to iOS 11 across
the board that might happen then also
note of the
Haitians are weird right you need to
have your phone on right now somewhere
to get third party notifications
yes yeah I don't know if that's gonna
change so I wanted to switch gears
really entirely what you think yeah you
also spend some time with some of the
new AR apps
yeah that exists tell us about that I
saw some of your tweets about this that
it looked really fun it looked pretty
exciting about like this is what the
future might be with like you know
beyond the world of Pokemon go yeah this
became really popular on Twitter and you
know I've been seeing demos of this
going back to WWDC and I'd been
cautiously excited about it and thinking
this would be a big deal a lot of people
go what is this for and when I saw a Kia
a while ago and then again here it's the
practical part of this it's kind of
amazing like there's one thing about
dancing robots but this this IKEA place
app you can lay down furniture from the
catalogue I I was going to CNBC and I
just did on the subway platform plan I
was like you know what I'm just gonna
start recording this because iOS 11 has
screen capture so it's pretty easy to do
oh nice and you can trim it and then
update it so that was always just a real
demo some people didn't believe that one
thing is that people pass in front of
that AR it totally breaks the illusion
yes I put up another tweet about that
but the tracking it does well it doesn't
always work it generally works so well
that it's astounding considering you
didn't have to buy a new phone
necessarily to do it and you're not
using a tango phone that has like the
two cameras phone and if you start doing
there are a ton of measurement apps and
home decorating things that are already
sprouting up that's the area where I
think it could be really interesting
games are gimmicky hmm but it's the
beginning of something that feels kind
of astounding and I was amazed at how
many comments came through so positive
you know to some degree I put it up
because it's absurd but everyone was
also really amazed by it and a lot of
people its effect really really good
yeah and that's the cool thing too is
it's shareable that's the big thing with
VR and versus AR is that I'm wearing a
helmet I can't really explain what it
really felt like in an amazing VR
experience alright but here it's exactly
what I'm experiencing and actually maybe
in some ways better because you could
craft some people are starting to use
this to create special effects you can
start crafting
different realities on your phone Apple
I'm mocking up your future for all right
unfortunately gotta kind of show cuz
that's all the time we have but I want
to put a special note we're gonna be off
tomorrow but we did tape a special
episode that will run I will be live we
won't be taking questions but it will
run tomorrow usual time and we also want
to throw it out there we're considering
doing a bit of a format change changing
things up a little to include not just
the four-minute podcast on the audio but
also the the Q&amp;amp;A that also comes for our
YouTube viewers basically keeping it in
line with how our youtubers YouTube fans
watch the show give us a shout out just
said if this is a good idea a terrible
idea if you're gonna hate this you're
gonna love it let us know you can tweet
back at us at the at the 359 podcast or
at the 359 at sea Netcom write any of
that right yep oh let us know alright
that's it let's close it up again we're
all these stories are more check us out
Messina time raka Chang I'm Ben Fox
bourbon from Scott Stein
thanks for listening I love that little
ending jingle ended pretty much enjoy
your stay can we do some this is easily
the closest we've ever actually done the
show to 359 in the afternoon hopefully
we still have Jesse gateman on I saw
Michael Brown was showing up but Jesse
hopefully you stuck with us totally
appreciate that yeah thanks to everybody
sticking around and putting up this is
this late in the day we do have a couple
of good questions to start off with
speaking of Jesse gateman it says Scott
any audio delay when using the air pods
and the watch for calls did you try any
voice over Internet Protocol services
like Skype on the watch no interesting
so I didn't do Skype on the watch and
I'm I'm sure there's no way to do Skype
on the watch right now so this is this
is purely phone calls I mean I didn't do
any anything else would be I don't think
there's anything set up over LTE you
could probably you could hand you off
from your phone
but that would just be a Bluetooth
connection to your phone there are some
limits to the number of apps and what
can actually take advantage of this
connectivity cuz I think right now the
perception is this is essentially a
phone in your wrist and that's not
really the case wait wait a minute so
you wouldn't be able to do like Spotify
streaming Wow well there's no Twitter
right now well there's no I think was in
the review but yeah to make it but I
will say that um the core apps work
right now a lot of third-party apps
don't work over LTE so that's
frustrating it was kind of like what
happened in the early days of the
standalone apps on ion watch OS now
they're I think it's up to those apps to
be able to eventually run an LTE and I
think they might start doing that
because this was before watch was for
launched but we're have to see I donno
if it's gonna be an interest of all and
then do it I don't know how many will
and that may not mean that they get
notification so vacations even if
there's a Twitter app a lot of players
also sunset their Apple watch apps like
the one that I'm thinking off the top of
my head is eBay because I cover eBay but
there are a handful of other ones that
were like you know this ecosystem really
isn't that worth it for us so
integrating into LTE yeah that might be
an impetus for people to drop the idea
is if you got a notification on your
eBay app on your phone you would get
that notification your watch right there
there's think together probably where
your phone is on yes which is a weird
that's a weird thing yeah it's so weird
and I was trying to get wrap my head
around that that's the sort of thing
that we're still gonna keep looking at
because we looked at this for about a
week which actually for a wearable is
not that much time it sounds crazy to
say but you want to keep seeing how
things settle in and how things change
but the yeah the point is that a lot of
that stuff feels experimental it's
really more about taking phone calls
which is something you don't even do
much on your phone anymore like that's
you know that's like that's like not the
key feature of a smart phone nobody else
killed done yeah so now like that's
where's over killed that that's right
and responding the things on your watch
you have to you have to like always
scribble or dictate which means that you
know like I got a work email and anyway
responding to it I try responding to
Falcone John Falcone had seen it and it
came off like a like a Twin Peaks
message it was like I I'm here at the
lodge the phone the the am I came I was
like what does that mean and you can't
edit it so what well now if you're
dictating no it's all mental but don't
write it don't dictate a long message on
watch just go be there soon is it yeah
also I know we should get some more
questions but also is it helpful or
useful to have Siri on the watch did you
spend much time good question yeah it's
not bad
Siri is better on a watch and I found
this also with with Android wear it's
it's more useful because you have such a
limited interface it's more like a mini
echo mmm so and now it talks to you
which may sound stupid but it also means
that if you're sitting around somewhere
you have conversations with yourself
you can get the answer as opposed to
before you had to keep staring at the
little screen so now it is like a little
mini serie echo thing on your wrist
basic information like when's the next
Jets game or what's my next appointment
or what time is why there yeah it
doesn't go you know there are limits a
lot of things we check back when you
asked when the next Jets game was what
time it is when it when I mention that I
realized that asking a watch what time
it is it's great a really dumb thing to
ask it it's the best dumb thing that I
say all the time mmm all right when I do
a demo video and I'm unconscious I'll
just default ooh hey Siri what time is
it like that's the thing you would
always say dear what are the questions
we got a question from Riggs med does
the watch have a separate number my AT&amp;amp;T
order states a separate number for my
watch so no there is a number that's
interesting I don't know if there's an
additional option for a separate second
number the the test so far that we've
done we're gonna keep taking a look at
what all the situations are is that it
shares the same phone number so in extra
ten dollars a month yeah that's that's
the
that's actually kind of a big deal
because the idea of multiple devices
with the same number is relatively new
like 18 t hat whisper sync yep
t-mobile has they've got a similar
program where they share multiple
numbers or the same number across
multiple devices but that's relatively
new like this gear s3 cannot have the
same number as as your phone still yeah
I mean you can through 18 TT mobile now
but like do some it's like it's not as
clumsy yeah in the early days they
didn't at all and then they started
adding and it's really nice to have
because it allows you to it's it's more
like the old days where you'd have
multiple landlines in your home I'm
grabbing the upstairs phone so now it's
like that idea where you have several
phones that are ringing and that's
already the case now if you're using
like on on Mac and iOS like your Mac
will ring or your phone will ring on
your Wi-Fi like or iPad so yeah it
virtualizes more of the phone experience
it's great it's when people call me I
really want all my devices going off
everywhere yeah great
it's great you know what what do you
need it for that's the thing I keep
saying in the review what do you need a
phone on your watch for and you I was
hoping that there would be more of a
clearer pitch for that there wasn't
really it was just my clear pitch was if
you're changing a kid if you're holding
a kid and you need to get your phone the
edge you don't need you don't need LTE
for that no guest your watch yeah your
home you're right
so changing your kid and you're in a
forest you're in a swamp very far from
okay all right more questions Michael
Brown Scott in your reviews I'm Michael
Brown you say wireless charging is slow
and BYO but in your study did you get
any notion that Apple is working on a Qi
charger makers to place them everywhere
in stores ie Starbucks etc etc it was a
very good question so here's the deal
with Wireless right now it is slow it's
like it feels like a trickle charge
after half an hour it went up like 15%
yeah we have a review so that overnight
yeah you should believe in your bets
okay not yeah but here's the difference
they're updating I believe you have the
firmware of the phone they'll be
compatible with 7.5 watt wireless
charging which should be somewhat faster
now the ones that Apple is recommending
the Mophie and the Belkin Chargers
those are seven point five watt
compatible so they will be faster soon
later this year it's not clear when
starting at a very low bar though it's
starting at a low card and it that's
exactly it I think that that is not the
main way I'd charge the phone at all
plus you to make sure it's lined up
because if it's not perfectly lined up
if you're not used to that's true with
phones the problem is is with public
places let's say I'm at Starbucks
I'm going to spend maybe twenty minutes
there like half an hour perhaps
immediate yeah that's gonna be you're
not really gonna get like a very nice
charge bump up from that you mother's
down to one percent I mean you'll take
what you can get right sure but treading
water use what would stay and keep your
head above let's compare it though - you
know how phones themselves charged back
in the day I remember when I got my
first iPhone like a hand-cranked yeah it
took forever it like the only time I got
to sell the charge was overnight so do
you think we're gonna kind of progress
along that line being expedited and
finding any luck yhe itself is
progressed faster I feel like apples
starting conservatively with there I'm
sure it'll keep improving if not just in
this model then down the road and the
other thing to keep an eye on and what
Apple's really I think after with this
is that right now it's Qi charging but
Apple has already announced air power
and that's clearly maybe it was even
intended to come out now but it's
clearly part of the immanent plan for
2018 that they're making that charge all
your devices Matt yeah now that's a
different standard it is yes and it
means that they haven't talked much
about it but it may charge significantly
faster we don't know but the interesting
thing about air power and why it's not
Qi is that some of apple's devices that
don't charge via Qi will charge via air
power weird but true the Apple watch
series 3 right is not wireless Qi but it
will work with air power so go face so I
mean
apples say that they would try to work
with chi to get some of those standards
into it so other makers would also maybe
incorporate the standards I think Apple
wants to control the new once you have
the newsstand I don't like the trouble
it took it took so many years there used
to be three separate standards right you
wrote all about always two standards and
then a third one that has sort of
emerged as sort of like the next-gen
standard for everyone well there's the
other one was a power-mad standard which
most which allows Starbucks have
wireless charging you use that now
they're currently switching them over to
Qi back to your original question
Michael though because they went I do
say I will say the retailers will
retailers airports are thanks to Apple
they will probably start putting in Qi
oh yeah recive Li then in the past
Starbucks like is you know they already
sell cheese stuff now they're probably
gonna double down on that McDonald's
McDonald's feed a lot of places now kind
of like what happened with mobile
payments it's good you're just gonna
help drive it's a lot of it drives an
ecosystem yeah it pushes it over the top
to like mobile payments is still not
mainstream I'll just throw that out
there but people pay their phone a lot
more to mess with economics like that I
mean look at things like Bitcoin that's
always gonna be a slower uptick than
actual technological inclusion right
people are afraid of money UK was
amazing using mobile payment so that's
part of the chip in pin it's a different
you know their system was already set up
here it's very slow weird yeah we don't
have Chip and PIN everywhere yet no
there's a hole where there's a lot of
stories of that that sound very strange
but like why places are deactivating
anyway but the thing I like about air
power is that you could charge multiple
things on the same mat that's the cool
part that's attentionally
that would be interesting you guys look
up you'll be like the intel charging
bowl from like question lots of
questions this is one that's actually
come up several times over the past week
hey Scott Frey Nell asks how are the
stereo speakers oh yeah yeah we were at
this burger
very very good question now I'm not a
big speaker very very good question it
sounds pretty good for a phone it's a
good thing we're finding it through a
mono microphone way music stop it before
we get sued anyway yeah we probably did
too much that was no music at all I was
just playing on my phone the point that
was that was not great that was your kid
right it's a terrible way to demonstrate
that podcast enjoy enjoy so I I'd say it
definitely sounds better it you know
when you're watching a movie now I'd say
the speaker experience is better than
looking at on the small screen like that
actually makes up for it like you you go
oh that sounds really good I wish my
scream is a little bigger do you put on
the on the 8 do you actually watch your
videos with I usually have headphones on
yes I wear headphones
I don't care about speakers that much
because I always have a headphone on I
always dismissive then again my
eight-year-old was like who can I hear
and I played the music he's like yeah it
sounds nice and like there are a lot of
people though in their day-to-day life
they look for something to take the
place of a boombox of a ghetto blaster
etc etc I've value having like a quiet
home so like that's why I had these
headphones on just playing
watching my videos heavenly yeah really
small like portable Bluetooth speakers
but they don't fit in your pocket yet
awesome kinda the second thing you have
to carry around so bottom line is this
it's it definitely sounds a little
better and they now it's definitely
louder the audio used to sound bad on
iPhones and now it actually sounds
pretty decent for watching movies or
sherry used to be very very tinny yeah
it's a hoarder it's totally fine
for like just playing a song as you're
like vacuuming being the self-proclaimed
audio file in the room the sound is
cleaner I'll give that my own personal
testimonial there it's cleaner it's
punch here it's got like a it's it's
there's still phone speakers though so
don't get too excited yeah wear
headphones don't be a monster
all right question more questions Jesse
Jesse gateman Scott is Siri any faster
on Ceres - she keeps saying I'll tap
I'll tap you when I'm ready
and then lags when she gets into your
phone to complete the task is the
process any faster on the new watch yeah
that still happens and I don't know why
I think a lot of times it's about
network or other things it's a lot of
network not handoffs but there's all I
could do an LTE and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
and yes there are wireless signals to
get through yeah there's a lot there's a
lot of times it's Siri seems like it's
waking up from a nap and like we'll be
ready with you sometime soon I'm so used
to winter time maybe I'm 2 years but
that's such sure across I don't think
there's a single wearable I've I've had
that has not had that experience but
yeah and then serious use cases series
not that smart like still to me not that
smart
at contextually answering things that I
need accurate I will completely agree
with that statement but it can be useful
let's slam through a couple more we're
almost out of time yep Timothy cook wait
what are we being spied on actually be
that's a weird incident I mean Tim gave
us a shout out during the show yeah that
go back through the Kino you'll notice
the shoutout it really subliminally just
like for some weird reason he overlooked
Brian Tong though Oh dong slam Wow I
love it alright anyways Timothy cook is
their video on the watch
no but you there have been ways to play
little short videos before in certain
apps I don't know if you want to watch
video and your watch though it's a tiny
screen what's the point yeah you see
noodle said that when the phones came
out oh god what if they just start
making watches bigger until eventually
you have the original size bomb on your
wrist goes over your wrists basically do
you they'll be like editorials on the
rise of circular video
my circular throw up in my mouth already
mad at no you know what I think though
there might be a bit well the iPhone 10
becomes popular moving towards notch
videos or like everybody's like serious
we need something in the notch and you
can't see it so many things to tackle
and talk about with the 10 including
knotch
yeah not to Kate including the fact that
we should I would just be calling it X
anyway
so much they say there's gonna be so
much face review let's get one more in
here yeah Michael Brown is o as always
as flooding us with fantastic commentary
but we only got time for one more so
Scott in your video you talked a lot
about the LTE capabilities of the watch
do you feel like Apple is mainly
focusing on fitness buffs disconnecting
from their phone or everyone I think
it's mainly Fitness I think this is
definitely a play for fitness and for if
you're running if you're out somewhere
and I guess it's okay because a lot of
Apple watch and wearables are targeted
at Fitness so you know it's just niche
it's nice to me
I used it not as much as that I use it
more like an everyday thing you know the
problem is use cases I think of when you
want to like not have your your phone we
get back to how do I know I won't have
the app I need or the other thing I need
usually on my phone I have something
else that's essential then now I can't
get on the watch so it's not just good
enough that I just have a watch on me
but yeah I mean that's the interesting
question with it but I think if you're a
runner sure the question is is that
battery life good enough and right we
haven't even gotten into streaming music
that's a whole I really wonder how
that's gonna work how long is that watch
gonna last
by the time you get down the block you
know your battery belt battery man I bet
the speakers on the watch would be just
killer oh my god you can't do audible
sound we found the battery belt won't
even work you'd have the wireless music
playback afterward why
yeah earpods do work well because
they're auto-switching and they're
better for I think for quit making quick
calls but then that's the problems you
can get into this thing where earpods
feel very well designed for Apple watch
and that's another $160 yep and you want
to wear those but I've but between the
call and the music and the seamlessness
I know I might want who for calls I
don't know or you just put in whatever
here of headphones it's it definitely
have good mics it definitely presents
the wireless future that if you want to
experience that you can today for more
than $500 some people are really going
to love that kind of thing but it's
super everybody know the watches already
loose maybe we can say that I'm looking
my watch now I got the battery very low
warning message of my Kerris theory so I
think I left it without my iPhone for
like 15 minutes so we just got applause
from somewhere yeah off in the distance
I have my friends a Giant Bomb just are
having a blast oh I don't know what
they're playing today and they always
have way more fun than we do that's true
hey before we go shout out to Adam m and
the - who are saying the rise of square
