Apple goes small Nintendo might kill the
wii u Microsoft's AI pot goes rogue and
everything else you need to know Apple
introduced a few small things first up
the iphone SE it essentially has the
body of the iphone 5s with a lot of the
features from the iphone 6s the SE
features a 4-inch screen a 12 megapixel
camera 4k video recording abilities and
costs about four hundred dollars without
a contract but not all is new the
fingerprint sensor is older the
front-facing camera is not as high
quality and it doesn't include 3d touch
then there's the new iPad instead of
updating the ipad air Apple opted to
introduce a new model entirely say hello
to the 9.7 inch iPad pro it weighs under
a pound and supports the Apple pencil
and a smaller smart keyboard accessory
apple also introduced a new display on
the 9.7 inch ipad pro that it calls a
true tone display the screen can adjust
its colors based on the lighting
conditions around it like say a piece of
paper wood oh one more thing this is the
first iPad to include a flash for all
you iPad photographers out there
switching gears the newspaper Nikkei
reported that Nintendo will stop
producing the wii u by the end of the
year nika has a pretty good track record
when it comes to Nintendo reports
however Nintendo told IT media that the
Nikkei article wasn't an announcement
from the company and that Nintendo plans
to continue production in the next
fiscal year and beyond so is the
Nintendo Wii U on its way out well yeah

microsoft created a twitter bot named
tay that used artificial intelligence to
talk like a millennial and it only took
15 hours for the internet to turn poor
old tay into a racist and sexist monster
you see the bot was designed to learn
from others and would often repeat
offensive tweets with her own commentary
which involved using emojis and making
jokes Microsoft has since deleted the
offensive tweets and has taken tail
offline to make adjustments and this is
why internet that we cannot have nice
