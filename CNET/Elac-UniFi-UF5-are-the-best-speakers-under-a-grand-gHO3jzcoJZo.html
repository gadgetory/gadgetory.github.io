thousand bucks and said go on by the
best speakers you can get I would have
um Denard spent a lot of time in hi-fi
stores and fretted about getting my
money's worth but now having listened to
the e lack you f5s long and hard that
decision is easy
I'd buy these before my heart even had
time to make a beat the ELA qf 5's are a
floorstanding speaker version of our
favorite bookshelf the ub5 they are
based around a concentric tweeter and
four inch mid-range driver like before
but you have five ads 35.2 five inch
aluminum base drivers for better bass
response the finish is the same as
before a brushed vinyl which shows dirt
and scratches pretty readily there is a
slim version of this speaker coming soon
which will add a painted finish for $400
more though the driver surrounds aren't
that flash looking and one was even
loose and rattling when we got it but it
does come with a magnetic grill to cover
things up if you don't like the look the
speaker terminals and carpet spikes are
pretty special though while they're not
the most exciting speakers to look at
they are the most exciting speakers to
listen to that concentric driver gives
you voices that sound stunningly
lifelike the bass wait the extra drive
is deliver means these speakers will
also please rock fans on most material I
can think of no other speaker under
foreground that I'll recommend quicker
than this one the ELAC you f5s are our
new reference speaker until the next
ELAC comes along probable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
