companies that has some of the best
design third-party products for Apple
products this in my hand this is called
the a loop n pro and what I love about
this is a lumen design pen it has the
rubber nip on one end to use on your
iPad whether it's for typing or even
drawing its pressure sensitive as well
and then you have this ball point pen
tip that you can screw so you can use
this either as a pen for one moment and
then on your iPad directly the next
moment so this is 3999 one of the hot
things from just mobile now another
product in the just mobile booth that I
love these are the highway pro and the
highway these are their cigarette
lighters but look at the design on them

they're super small really elegant when
you put them in their car this one the
highway pro is 4999 it comes with two
USB ports you can charge your iPhone or
your iPad simultaneously the highway is
39 99 charges one but really more than
anything it's the sexy size and the sexy
design so I love these let's go around
