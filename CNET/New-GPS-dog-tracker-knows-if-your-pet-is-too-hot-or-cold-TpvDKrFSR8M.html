with henry who is wearing the tag gps +
pet tracker it's a pet tracker that
works with all of your other home
automation let's take a look so tag has
been making these pet trackers for a
while now but this is the latest version
and it has a couple of cool new features
first off it has an air temperature
sensor so it can tell if your dog is in
an area that's maybe a little too hot or
too cold secondly it's integrated now
with alarm calms home automation system
so if you use alarm calm and you have
things like home security cameras or
door locks or thermostats using that
then this will slot in alongside those
so that could potentially let you do
some very cool things so for instance
talking about that air temperature
sensor we mentioned earlier if you do
get a notification that your dog is too
hot or too cold you could then use your
thermostat to change the temperature
remotely apart from that you get all the
usual pet tracker features so you can
see where your dog is you can get
notifications if your dog leaves a
particular area and you can also measure
your dog's fitness to check if he's
healthy the tag gps + is going to go to
retail in February and it's going to
cost you one hundred and twenty dollars
so if you're a dog owner who loves
keeping track of your pets this could be
one to check out that's all for now I'm
the questura cnet's here at CES 2015
check out cnet com /c yes but much much
more
