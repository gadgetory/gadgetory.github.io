on both desktop and mobile is an awesome
way to kill some time so here's how to
do it first you simply go to Google Maps
and sign in signing in is not required
but who knows there might be a
leaderboard eventually next choose
pretty much any destination on the map
we chose to play at Disneyland on the
bottom left of the screen a pac-man icon
will appear click on pac-man and your
screen will morph into a playable Google
Maps version of pac-man with sound
fruits points and everything the
controls are simple but they make it a
little difficult to turn your packet in
the right direction but it's still a lot
of fun to plant all you have to do is
clear the screen of all the pellets and
you win and you level up on the mobile
version pac-man is only available in
certain locations and Google Maps has
left a list of hints to help find the
tiny pellet eating pac-man
we found him in Times Square once you
find an area where pac-man is present
you can click the icon in the app and
begin swiping in the direction you want
pac-man to go it's actually a bit easier
than the desktop version now this isn't
the first time Google Maps has done
something like this Google loves April
Fool's Day pranks and in 2012 Google
Maps was morphed into Legend of Zelda
mode and last year pokiman were hiding
among the maps for users to find as part
of an elaborate April Fool's Day prank
so that's how to play pac-man and Google
Maps pac-man should be available to play
for at least a week thanks for watching
