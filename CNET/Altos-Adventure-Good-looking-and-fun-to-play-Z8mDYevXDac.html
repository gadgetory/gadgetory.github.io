which is a snowboarding game and it's a
survival game so you're trying to get as
far as you possibly can
there's also a lot of challenges and
missions along the way it's a very well
designed game really nice graphics just
a really good ambiance and what's really
cool is over the course of the game the
weather will change it'll change from
day to night so right now you can see
that it's raining it's not a bad storm
I've seen a much worse than this but the
game you start out with Alto and he's
just sort of a basic overall kind of
writer he can do everything fairly well
but nothing he's not really specialized
Maya is one that you'll unlock because
she can do backflips much faster than
also can pass is sort of the heavier
lumbering guy even though he's a lot
bigger and he won't do backflips very
well he's super fast because he has all
that weight sort of the basic mission of
the game is to go in capture llamas and
return them to the farm when you always
picking up coins and later on you'll be
able to use the coins in order to
increase the time that the magnet is
available or how long you can hover and
then also the wingsuit and there will be
certain missions that will actually
require you to use the wingsuit to jump
over a gap and stuff like that
OneTouch control that you do backflips
are jump so now I'm gonna grind these
flags here sort of like skateboarding
I'm grinding the coping and right now I
have an elder chasing me these guys live
on the mountain
whoa they live on and on they don't like
that I'm recklessly racing down this
mountain so they chase after you and
this guy will chase me until I find a
chasm here's one right here so this
chasm means he can't get past it so now
I've lost them and I can continue on
safely in the upper right of the screen
it also shows the combos that are
happening together so say if you do a
backflip and then you land on to the
flag coping and then you do a jump on
that and then maybe you do a backflip
off of that and land on the ground all
of those add up to give you a higher
score you always have to watch out for
rocks that'll make in your way oh man I
just got hit by rock and I'm dead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
