time to ask ourselves are any these
people really are friends I'm Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update
if you've logged into Facebook recently
then I'm sure you've seen a bunch of
videos in your timeline about friends
day it's a made-up holiday by Facebook
to mark its 12th anniversary Facebook
auto generates a video montage of random
photos of people who are your friends
because nothing says friends day like
seeing a photo of someone you don't talk
to anymore but with this gimmick
facebook also published a report about
our friends the network looked at the
1.5 9 billion people active on Facebook
and says we are all connected to
everyone by just three and a half other
people not six people as with scholars
have long proposed Facebook is just
doing this to troll poor Kevin Bacon and
I for one won't stand for it also I'm
not sure how you could have just half a
friend be a connection but based on what
I'm seeing in my feed lately I know
plenty of people who are half-wits so
yeah that's probably the key but in the
end friends on Facebook really don't
mean anything a study by oxford
university published a few weeks ago
shows that even if you have a huge
social circle with hundreds of Facebook
friends you can only really count on
three of them maybe for to help you out
in a crisis so let this Facebook friends
day be a reminder that we are all
basically alone in the world and since
it is just us and our meaningless social
networks and our cold gadgets you might
as well cat the most out of your tech if
you rather talk to your gadgets that
hold conversations with people then you
will be interested to hear the Amazon
echo smart speaker can now play music
off Spotify accounts but it only works
if you pay for a premium spotify account
you would say things like Alexa play a
dell on Spotify or alexa play my
playlist dancing with myself you can now
also use a voice command to order your
favorite dominos pizza because cooking
for one is no fun and just think friends
won't even call you for a ride when we
have self-driving cars in the future
Google's self-driving cars have
graduated from the sunny streets of
California and Texas and will now be
tested on the dreary rainy roads of
Kirkland Washington google wants to give
the program more experience with
different environments like the wet and
slushy conditions of the Northwest
United States well that's it that's the
end but if you feel like you need more
news to build the emptiness
you can head to cnet com for more from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
