episode 334 on Tuesday December 19 and
this is a pre-taped show we're doing a
little bit of filler because we are on
hiatus for a minute throughout the
holiday season and getting ready to hit
the road to the Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas and so on and so forth
so for right now we're just having a
little fun so bear with us if you
actually care about important tech
headline topics you're not going to get
it this is not the show for you today
sorry
anyways Ben what are we going to be
chattering about today we wanted to
focus on the second season of stranger
things we do for these filler shows
sometimes talk about just like whatever
is fun and streaming we did one on Game
of Thrones ones so we actually all
watched stranger things season two I've
been wanting to talk some smack for a
while now yeah apparently you watched it
like over the course of caution one day
yeah so I took a little bit longer but
we want to highlight some of our
favorite stuff from the season what to
expect from season three and whatever
else pops up into our head so why don't
we start off with like what were your
favorite moments from season two I loved
the bottle episode where 11 goes off and
finds her like sister mm-hmm I love that
might be the only person in the world
that liked that episode yeah I mean I
feel like we've found each other
you guys we must be you know perfect for
each other because I also like that up
because we've been held in a lab when we
were children it formed a kind of are
you - psychic brothers and sisters yeah
yeah what was bad about that that's like
a hilarious and it was so weird it was
like 11 joints the x-men or something
like that and then they're just super
hard I swear I just thought like this
doesn't make any sense at all if they
had these kinds of powers why don't they
just like do this other thing from the
beginning like if they could turn
themselves invisible why didn't they
just kill people while they were
invisible invisable no one turned
invisible no the girl the other girl ate
or whatever when she can lay don't be
come and visit yeah but they can make
them see different things right why
don't why do they have to wear masks if
she has that power well I think it's
been well established that none of their
powers are actually at their peak I
think that's why she's like you have to
hold
I can't do this if you're something she
didn't from bling and yeah but the mess
made a pretty good episode that I
thought like this is this is dumb you
have all these powers and you're doing
like stupid team things and they're
stupid teams why that whole crew is
assembled in the first place okay man
it's the 80s outcasts find each other it
feels like they're there like setting up
for a spin-off series just for those
kids this is this is gonna tear the
podcast apart I feel like I never
already a broken home 3:59 Civil War but
yeah I thought that was a very cool
episode but I agree that there were
certain like it was the flavor
eventually became too much yeah like
x-men I kind of thought that like maybe
eight should have had a similar power to
11 instead they like have all these like
different kinds of powers which means
maybe in other seasons they're gonna
discover what seven did or whatever they
were testing the waters to see how much
they can grow this franchise they don't
want to just be about these kids forever
and always they want to be able to
expand this into its own universe yeah
they want a marvel you want to marvel
eyes who doesn't want to move you're a
strange young serious Tokyo strange
crossover of dr. strange dr. strange
know everybody's about world-building
now am i right and I would be except as
I keep screwing it up but no you know
what's interesting about a versatile
with the dark universe they want to
build this they want to they want to
serialize everything so we actually it's
interesting that you say about the DC
universe because as much as everybody
knocks the DC Universe and how they
haven't been that successful Jonah and I
looked up box office mojo for 2017 all
they made money they Wonder Woman was
number two in the box office and it's
the highest grossing superhero film of
all time but Justice League was number
ten so DC did pretty well for themselves
All Things Considered those movies are
always gonna make money though even when
they suck hard Wonder Woman
okay but what you all made money okay so
if we had a Netflix originals universe
building right so what do we have like
narcos and like the upside down that
would be incredible I love your ideas
today I feel like you're making jokes
about this but narcos on the upside down
and a spin-off of the outcasts but I
would watch the hell out of all of them
but not house of cards
Bojack horseman in house of cards not
house of cards you know okay the time
the water gonna well they're gonna have
to go through their last season and then
we'll see what happens so I don't know
anyway can we get back to the favorite
moments from season two yeah I thought
we just talked about that we talked
about Jones what about yeah um I liked
it when Bob died oh my gosh Alfred you
are the worst
I thought your fire spoiler alert we
should have started with a spoiler the
whole thing was a spoiler wasn't it no
it's okay I've taken a poll literally
everybody on earth has seen stranger
things - yeah and yeah I thought it was
a really good scene I thought it was a
good scene I'll admit that I also think
he was really dumb for doing that - but
he dropped the broom he couldn't check
that what I don't and then the other
things like why is it that only Bob dies
in that part like the demo gorgon dogs
only attack him like they're clearly
they're eating him while there's three
alive people around looking in horror
because those are zombie roles once the
zombies get one person they just focus
on eating there's no sense no no no
that's that's totally typical zombie you
know like we got we got one on them yeah
I know I know I sound very negative
about this but I did enjoy the series
this is just how I even tell of you this
is just how I view and take in things
okay
the plot hole I found in that though is
how come the demo dogs ate Bob ate
completely right so many people were
left killed and scientist dude yeah I
hurt my knee leg and I'm just standing
here Bob was tasty it's yeah I I agree
what was it
sheriff hopper he was he should have
died and like whatever that like we are
done yeah
and it was just it just so they saved
him at the very last also Billy seducing
the mom that was a pretty cool scene I
thought that was kind of brilliant on
their part that they were able to give
you one last breath of levity before
everything comes out the hell my
favorite part about that show was
because I did watch because I did watch
the after show for the sexiest is that
if you notice when the mom is in the
bath and she doesn't have to answer the
door and you know she has the book that
book has his picture like no that's his
picture as like a like oh that's
actually yeah they put his face I
noticed that but I didn't know he's
actually him I was like that looks just
like yeah it might be I mean I'm you
know it's an illustration but I think
it's foreshadowing for season 3 that's
the new villain he is not any monsters
now it's just somebody like trying to
break up your family yeah
real monster in life well we did
favorite parts I can although favorite
parts has become Alfred's hated parts
but one of the things I didn't like is
yeah that character was that character's
name the brother the older brother Billy
Billy Billy I don't really like I know
that they like felt like they needed to
have a non paranormal like antagonist
and so that's why they're do something I
kind of felt like didn't really actually
felt like they didn't capitalize on that
entire subplot enough I was expecting
more backstory not necessarily
completely tied in but a little more
character building to what was the
girl's name
the magazine or vaccine to Mad Max I
thought we were going to get a few more
answers about her backstory yeah that
was that was I mean it's just like Oh
their family life did suck but it didn't
give you anything to fail outside of the
fact this is why she's kind of
impersonal and psych it worked I just
thought there was they were setting with
a lot more there might be more to come
yeah I agree with Billy I just I don't
and Luke's mom maybe I just remember
having that like Eureka moment after he
showed him like why do I know this kid
Red Ranger yeah yeah he's and Power
Rangers okay yeah what did you hate Ben
what did I hate yeah oh yeah hate rain I
can't I can't even like III like a lot
of the like the cool upside down stuff
so I actually thought it started out
kind of sets I asked you what you hate
it and you just said you like but we
were talking about our favorite stuff so
I'm
filet ignoring your question so yeah
when like the kid with when the kid gets
like taken over by like the shadow
monster that was kind of cool one of the
things I did something nominal act
didn't really shine through in this
season yeah it was like kind of
agonizing to watch and be like they made
him stay quiet for an entire season yeah
totally so yeah
when one of the aspects of the show that
I didn't actually like that much was
when they were in the shed and they were
telling him like these like nostalgic
stories to try to get him to like tap
out an answer about something like gate
or whatever I was just like that's
that's like so forced there's a little
silly but it also worked because they
did establish what the kids knew submit
some Morse code before that not only
that but like it was you know very 80s
we're like let's let's talk about our
feelings and like you know past past
occurrences you say that like the entire
show isn't built on the promise premise
that this is very 80s it is very and you
can excuse the like the really cheesy
elements for being 80s on purpose next
topic which season did you like more
season one or season two I know this is
gonna be a super hard question I think
season one was better
I like season two what's uh I don't I
don't like it when I shut up a little I
like it when you're like just getting
introduced to a show and it's like
relatively low stakes I think every time
a show jumps to its second season
especially something that's like a
horror thriller or something like this
they do have to raise the stakes like
much higher where they totally they're
gonna take over the world but first he
was like we got to find our friend back
and that I think like you know getting
introduced to like 11 story and all the
stuff I think that that was like much
better than there was only one Democrat
was like a focused like villain kind of
thing as opposed to you know also this
is happening and the world might end and
Bob's dead and there's a much more pure
story yeah yes it was easier to follow I
liked but I liked being forced to think
a little bit more I liked both but I I
think it's more like a preference of how
you like the story how you like a story
to be told like I liked both but I just
like that kind of like simple very
focused so yeah I totally agree and
that's why
like the first season more but I didn't
leave the second season feeling
disappointed did a really good job of
raising the stakes to a certain extent
and introducing enough new elements to
actually make it a really walkable and
enjoyable I think the challenge for
sequels is like how do you raise the
stakes without getting too ridiculous
yeah yeah maybe that'll be for season
three honestly I'll tell you why I like
season two like the payoff for me was
actually seeing so much of the character
progression in effect we got to see
Steve grow up we got to see Dustin stand
up hmm well we got to see Lucas step up
I thought they really handle character
development fantastically he's arguably
better than I've ever seen in most other
things and I think that's why I season
to appeal to me so much not that i
discredit season one at all but I was so
thrilled to see these characters that
you're invested in actually progress and
still maintain the key elements of why
you fell in love with them in the news I
also got to have great pairings like
hopper and xi together I mean how great
is putting those two actors and those
two characters literally like in a room
but you see him become a dad again yeah
as opposed to like I'm cold it shut off
yeah combination great character
development yeah that's why I like
season two so much I totally hear what
you're saying about how it got a little
silly and I like being able to focus on
that primary plot of like where's our
friend but season two had so many things
paid off I felt I felt like season two
was a great conclusion to season I own
as opposed to an extension I am confused
now like I was saying before with like
sequels how it you always raise the
stake for it when they're talking about
season three coming out in like 2019 hmm
I really don't know like how they're
gonna be able to raise the stakes
without making it even more ridiculous
so looking forward to it I kind of like
the idea of sidestepping it and doing
like The Outsiders in Chicago or at
least like presenting them again to a
certain extent because I would watch
spin-offs yeah otherwise you're so like
they're gonna have to like go to Mars to
like raise the stakes
upside down Mars upside down Mars and
like the demagogue and God
you know a Red Planet I would watch that
you know what Netflix if you guys want
to sign that idea give this man a bag of
money let's do it
do we want to take a shot at predictions
of how season three raises the stakes
well I think that I think one thing that
we could probably all agree on is that
there's definitely like by ending with
the snowball dance for this one they
definitely like have that kind of like
circular conclusion so I think that the
next season is going to be venturing
outside of the middle school realm
outside of them being in that sort of
they kind of closed the loop on a lot of
those things that started in season one
all right so the big adversary turns out
burly so it turns out that the lab
worker wasn't lying and that that evil
doctor man is still alive hiding
something
he raises like an army of little like
11s or whatever and hold all his little
children to like beat up like 11 and
then take her back to the underground to
the upside down and then the kids have
to go to the upside down themselves like
without Elevens help to rescue her like
that's the new rescue mission
right and then Darth Vader shows up and
kills all that broke off their deal with
there's no Star Wars crossovers sorry um
how are we on time I could get through a
few more well I got it I got an idea
okay I I think that what we're going to
see is a more true melding of the upside
down into the real world
whereas not necessarily they keep
crossing over back between the portals I
like the theory that the upside down is
indicative and representative of the
future there's been a few theories
floated about that and the one that I
latched onto most sincerely was that the
the spores that were launched Dustin and
hopper yeah just the beginning hmm we're
going to see essentially a zombie movie
in season 3 where it's going to progress
in a very Stephen King II where the kids
are going to be broaching in high school
and it's going to be drifting towards
like how it was a generational divide
and that's why we're going to be having
a delay in the release of season from
what we've heard
but the idea being that hopper and
Dustin become antagonists because now
they're possessed will
is still not fully let go and
essentially the upside down is
recruiting real-world members as an
invasive army and then xi has to respond
by recruiting other lab kids to fight
against him so we get like essentially
kind of like you said the outsiders
I almost x-men type force to fight
against Ken Dustin do evil yeah he's
he's the worst character justin was
definitely better this season
why do you say sure why he harbor an
alien in his home okay like a jerk and
then he lies to his friends friends
don't lie yeah the worst character but
it worked out okay because weren't they
like up against
d'Artagnan at one point and because of
his friendship with d'Artagnan they
didn't all get yeah didn't get eaten
yeah but what if another like sama
Corrigan dog had come by and so that
didn't just saying just better you don't
lie to your friends man he's the worst
character okay he's worse than Billy
uh-huh put your home address
ouch don't Doc's don't Doc's Alfred he
doesn't deserve that also Bill Murray
should definitely make a cameo in the
next season
oh yeah so was like a tease what other
eighty stars are we going to see pick up
and cameo because that was such a big
payoff was to see Sean Astin like the
king of 80s kids movies The Goonies oh
that means I think joy I think Judd
Nelson should show up what's what's
right well they are going to high school
exactly making the principal oh my god
Judd Nelson who's the girl from the
board
Molly ring just bring the entire but I
like Winona Ryder alright we're done
here goodbye everybody
no seriously like what if they brought
they bring him in the high school in the
high school has been is administered by
the members of The Breakfast Club that
would be kind of Awesome I would totally
be on because of Billy beat him does
Billy meet the rebel guy from The
Breakfast Club and then they have like a
little stare down no Billy just
everybody so Joan I wanted to direct
this more from like to a business
perspective oh yeah we're gonna talk
about serious stuff
yeah just just for a second here like
this is this
is also like how many strangers things
we can expect by looking at it from the
business perspective so like how
important is strangers thanks for
Netflix right especially with house of
cards ending pretty soon anyway right so
Netflix famously notoriously doesn't
share anything about their how much
people watch their programs really
except except yesterday because I
thought they would notoriously shame
people about how that was just you watch
you watch things but they don't say like
you know stranger things was watched by
60 million people and however long
people they don't give out ratings data
um but because it's annoyed people in
Hollywood for so long we're starting to
catch up where there are these outside
sources that claim that they can kind of
gauge how big these shows are by all
accounts stranger things it's like a
gigantic hit bigger than a house of car
your than anything they've had before
house parts actually wasn't one of their
most it was orange is the new black was
kind of a crossover with that a raining
a raining jewel or whatever it was
probably the most watch one before
stranger things came along and so I mean
having a gigantic hit you keep milk in
that cow so there's no reason to think
that they aren't going to have season
have like five different
it's like origin stories or whatever HBO
is doing with Game of Thrones once that
that ends yeah watch for the next season
when bub dies just be on the score B's
all those ain't like you also saw this
with Walking Dead too like they already
like started doing a spin-off of The
Walking Dead while The Walking Dead was
going on so I guess stranger things
could except becoming a universe I don't
really see it right now I think you made
a really good argument for it
I think the business perspective that
John you just mentioned it all makes
sense to me but I would hate to I don't
know see the story suffer but at the
same time I would probably watch all
that stuff I mean what would they even
call it though if The Walking Dead is
fear The Walking Dead which is a stupid
name would be even stranger things even
stranger things
danger earth strange
strangest things either way a bag of
money Netflix give him a bag of money I
am looking forward to season three very
much even if it isn't coming till 2019
I'll be a while let's let's wrap up by
telling saying who your favorite
character was from season two I'm gonna
go with hopper I was I was very into
hopper I thought he had like a lot of
different emotions and a lot of stuff
are unifying him David Harbor on social
media because you should be I was gonna
be hell Willy
okay it's gonna be Hellboy so we'll be
seeing more of hopper very soon
yeah harbors career is taking off then
you just get a Golden Globe nod I
believe you're asking me I don't know
either way well I'm on Instagram follow
him on Twitter he's he's going to be a
meme Lord he's adorable how much he
loves his cast and how the little
bromance is building with him and Steve
right now all right next up who else
I love 11 I think really Bobby Brown is
really a great actress that character is
really fun and she doesn't great I mean
she had like 52 lines in the first
season and she managed to make that a
super memorable character totally um
yeah I think it's great yeah 11 is
probably the most powerful character on
the show she I think could kill everyone
in a fight if she had to yeah she gets
my vote for best character well it goes
without a doubt papa Steve office Steve
yeah papa Steve that was really adorable
and becoming like the epitome of Big
Brother and surrogate like brother
I like swallowing his pride and letting
Nancy go and everything about Steve was
endearing and that that's coming from
you know it's like watching Chris
Pratt's character on Parks and Rec where
you start off and he's kind of like
partial antagonist he's a pain in the
ass and then you end up loving him and
that's exactly what they did with Steve
aka the father of John Ralphie oh and
Steve yeah was kind of schmuck in the
first season as I recall kind of they
just like like the actor and thought
that he was really great they're like
what's not making yeah yeah he's getting
up he's getting a lot of like publicity
now he was on like some live stream from
like GQ and all like he's getting like
all these
it's a now joke Yuri is his name Jack
theory yeah yeah they don't have real
names they only exist in strangers and
Hellboy a parent no anyway let's uh
let's wrap it up but this was a lot of
fun was thanks thanks everybody for
