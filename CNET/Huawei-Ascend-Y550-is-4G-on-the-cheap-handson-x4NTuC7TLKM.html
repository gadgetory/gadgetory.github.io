a look at the Hawaii ascend white 5 50s
4.5 inch Android phone now Kauai always
says this is LTE for all what that means
is that it has 4G LTE radio inside and
they will come with a very very
affordable price tag now such a cut-down
price tag you shouldn't expect brilliant
specs indeed 4.5 inch screen has an 8 54
by 480 pixel resolution which is rather
low but it seems fine for the basic
tasks now the body is fairly plain you
can see it's got this just gray back
panel and it's not the most slim or
stylish of phones but again completely
practical and just fine for the price
there's a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor to gain very very low-end but
seemed absolutely perfectly nippy and
Swift in my hands on time and the sorts
of things that the low-end phones going
to be our selves I'm sure it will be
adequate at least on the back of the
phone is a 5 megapixel camera which
should be more than enough for some
quick Facebook snaps or some instagrams
of your food and was a 2 megapixel
camera on the front for your selfies now
there's also a 2 thousand milliamp an
hour battery inside which is quite
capacious particularly given the low
resolution display so I should expect to
get at least a day of use out of this
phone now quite hasn't said exactly how
much this will cost in different regions
of the world but has said but it
shouldn't cost any more than 99 pounds
here in the UK which is very cheap we
will find out more pricing and indeed
where it's going to be on sale in the
next few weeks as this adieu to hit the
shelves in October
I'm Andrew hall for CNET and this is the
huawei ascend Y 550
