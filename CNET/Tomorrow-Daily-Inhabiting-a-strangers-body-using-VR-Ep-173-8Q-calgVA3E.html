University are trying to find a way for
you to get shots without pain an AR that
turns your home into your very own
survival horror game and Swedish
scientists are gonna put you in someone
else's body using virtual reality well
probably not you but there were some
other people will tell you about some
our daily
free of the internet welcome to tomorrow
daily the best geek to action in our
universe I'm Ashley skeleton of me as
always the man not in a mask kill
anonymous this is a shirt you gave me I
did look familiar yeah I really it's a
little big you're so trimmed caledonia
how do you keep your trim figure a
shrinking pills shrink oh yeah that's
gonna be on the show I'm a little
smaller every day one day kayla is going
to actually be the size of a I'm getting
ready for my aunt man cosplay I'm super
stoked comic-con is coming up yeah
coming up so you got to be be that small
get about like 60 days I already got I
already got my small ticket for a comic
con tiny little ticket I know I got a
little room at comic-con lanyard ready
to go I love it all right great uh well
let's hit the headlines its it's not
even Thursday no ok now it's not even
close the first time you to wednesday
we're not even close to going off the
rails um so I'm to tell you about this
really weird and interesting story out
of Sweden this comes from the Carolyn
Scarah links Institute karolinska in
Sweden and I thought this was super
fascinating so scientists took VR
headset state they stuck 15 people not
at all at once but one at a time into an
MRI machine they put VR headsets on them
and then they try to give them the a
sort of out-of-body experience by making
it look like they were in someone else's
body a stranger's body in the VR headset
ok and what they wanted to do was they
wanted that's terrifying situation
control threats and stuff so what they
wanted to do is they wanted to check
brain activity to see if your brain
would feel like you were in that
strangers body if you were using VR so
they were scanning while the experience
was happening to see what your brain did
it work surprisingly yes and it was
actually shockingly quick how
everybody's brains adjusted to being
inside these strangers body so is this
is super fascinating um they so what
would happen is you saw in the video you
could see two
different sets of feet you actually were
looking at the person who is actually in
the MRI machine with the VR headset on
is in the background you see them yeah
okay and they are seeing this point of
view that we're seeing in video right
now yes so this is a stranger's body but
first but but for all intent and
purposes they saw the same brain
activity as if they were in their own
body and when they saw people
threatening their body across the room
no response hahahaha think it was theirs
like it wasn't the same sort of like
feel sorry for that guy yeah yeah it was
sort of like phantom limb syndrome so
they were able they said they the they
would brush like a paint brush along the
legs of the strangers body and they
wouldn't feel it like they would feel it
as if it was their actual body like
their brain would light up as if it was
happening so and they would have sort of
a stress response if they did the like
the knife thing where they like or they
had like a sledgehammer like closer and
their stress levels would go up in the
strangers body when they had the VR
headset on but not when they saw their
body across the room inside the Machine
get threatened which is weird yeah that
is really weird it's super weird so um
they also did location that those were
the location tests and I thought that
the purpose of this was really
fascinating so the goal here because I
didn't think there could be a goal other
than we just want to see what your brain
let's just mess with some people let's
just see what your just to see what your
weird brain does is some day they want
to be able to give a doctor in one part
of the world a VR headset and controls
and have it control a robot across the
world and do surgery on somebody else
that's what they're trying to do with
this not trying to do it with this but
this is the start of understanding how
the brain works when put into a virtual
body somewhere else in another location
okay so this is a removed from what they
see the beginnings of that type of
research but the very far end game of
this is to be able to insert somebody
into a robotic body elsewhere and have
them sort of
treat treat that robotic body as if it
was their own and do things like surgery
or other things that require precision
hands or a lot of training a lot of
skills to do so I thought this was so
weird and so cool yeah but they even
like thought well maybe let's see and
and like I said it took within they said
the participants brains merged touch and
visual input within seconds and accepted
the strangers body almost as if it were
their own man I think I would probably
do that too I feel like I would if
somebody like if someone was to go I'm
so thirsty I'd be like oh yeah I'm
thirsty too oh yeah I / feeling a little
yeah ol thirsty but yeah that's pretty
it's pretty common pretty intense like I
think that's a coolant but also very
intense thing which actually brings us
to our hashtag today and I'm really
curious what your answered this is n
yours to everybody at home a TD Robo VR
and I want to know what it would take if
somebody came to you and said I can put
you like I can basically give you this
VR headset and we're going to keep your
body alive but you're gonna be able to
live out the rest of your life is a
robot would you do it and if you if you
might do it what is the thing that would
put you over the edge like absolutely I
would totally do it if this were the
case yes I would do it you were doing
yeah without a doubt but the question is
am I gonna be like a kale robot like am
I gonna be a kid like am I gonna have so
it would have to be you like you'd have
to look like you well yeah I mean if I'm
gonna live my life is this thing I want
to be able to have sex ok I want to be
able to taste food and no like i want to
have the normal senses is what I'm
saying ok have senses ok so that's like
you're tipping point to say yes you're
like okay if I can have all of my senses
I'm in yeah I'll live the rest of my
life out as a robot right yeah sizes I
think I think I would do it if there was
a way to keep me alive longer than a
normal human lifespan but you wouldn't
need the senses no you wouldn't need to
feel touch tastes
no that's just I just want to see it see
everything so you just hang out as a
robot yeah seems legit sad sad super sad
I feel like I would enjoy hanging out
with other robots like if I could talk
to other robots like I could talk to
them I'm saying emotions about I'm just
saying you know like robots that'd be
cool I would have to have some level of
God is a thing you it assimilates you
just said here's basically assimilate
into just being a robot like I wouldn't
be Ashley and weren't you'd be like oh
yeah I'm a robot I'm not sure that with
the road I'm saying is if it were me in
a robot's body I would still have
empathy because I'd still be a person
would be controlling it yes but still
have empathy and I'd still be able to
talk to people and have emotions but but
all you know I'm carrot okay let's make
me a robot do it oh go hang out the
robot only if I could live longer than
an average human life span because if
not then what's the point then I'd
rather just have my dumb old body my big
double meat bag walking around I don't
want to be like Terminator though like
normal terminator okay nobody emanator
and in my dreams be it would be t1000 of
course but you know I guess I realize
would just be k1000 yeah Caitlyn does
any one thousand I'll be back so that's
that's a second eight TD Robo VR and
that's your hashtag all right okay so
let me talk about this let me talk about
this survival new survival horror game
because there there's nothing scarier
than thinking there's something scary in
your house that's true because that's
where you feel like you're safe well
this new AR game that is actually being
a crowdfunded right now works within
that fear and then it adds but it turns
your house into a survival horror game
nope so basically the game builds a map
of your house using the phone's
accelerometer and then builds a custom
experience it's called night terrors
which i think is a fantastic name
perfect I love it so then basically what
you do is you turn off the lights in
your in the house of your apartment or
your house or apartment and then you
only get to use the LED on your phone
which is awesome uh to navigate around
the game any of this is designed to
predict your behavior
there was a spider that's a job there's
yeah I know you could just like change
it to be only spiders I i want that
toggle i'm gonna email the guy yeah the
spider one kill needs a spider delete
that app off my phone so anyway the
developers name is Brian Mitchell and
he's put in over a thousand hours into
making this this app and into his
computer vision system which makes the
game possible now uh it's actually not
done yet okay is this crown crowd
 yeah it's on IndieGoGo right now
okay for five dollars and it's scheduled
for delivery sometime next year so it's
not xterra it sounds amazing as far as
AR and games are and on horror games are
concerned it's really cool and like you
can just go into your house and then you
know do a little mapping with your
accelerometer write everything out walk
around in your terrible scary house and
never leave your house the same way
again nope oh this is this must be them
making it so they're filming like all
the different yeah things that'll show
up in the game I don't like it what's
that what's really cool about this is I
mean there's a lot of potential in this
I could see a horror movie that whatever
is a horror movie coming out they can be
like put our monster in there so like if
you play this game you see Slenderman or
so right yeah oh man that's a really
good point so he's got all these
prototypes and like so light scanners
and things I mean this is stuff that
hasn't really been done before an AR I
would imagine like all of this sort of
space spatial kind of scanning and
awareness and then like you were saying
they sort of manipulate you into doing
certain things during in the game like
they're like oh hey like so if we're
gonna make you if we want you to stay
still we're gonna shut the lights off
and play some scary music so you can't
move forward yeah I'm very interested to
see this actually like somebody walking
around trying to say that's it super
love to well we will shot as soon as we
have access to oh yeah absolutely this
looks so there you go uh IndieGoGo five
dollars chego awesome go check it out
love definitely worth I think this is
like one of the coolest AR game things
I've seen that's pretty awesome just
hands down so can you imagine this being
ported hololens know
no yeah well the the bad thing about
that is if you don't know how to shut it
off after you turn on your hollow lens
and you just like walking around oh hey
somebody else I'm trapped in my house
somebody finds kale just boy yeah it's
slightly done maybe that's why they
count canceled silent Hills is because
they're trying to make this yeah maybe
that's maybe that's it that would be
awesome though because you know silent
hill basically a position you're walking
around everything's normal and then
everything starts like shedding here in
the rusty yeah yeah the terrible air
raid horns bar and then Pyramid Head
shows up and everybody gets funny stuff
gets real um all right I got to tell you
about this very last thing and then
we're gonna have a little a little to do
before we hit the brake and food cuz
it's a little to do it is cinco de mayo
um i want to tell you about comfortably
numb so getting shots sucks look like it
hurts and i'm getting like blood draws
up anytime you get an injection no good
it kind of hurts so these are freshmen
students that had to come up with
something something innovative and so
they actually did you can see this is a
little device they called it comfortably
numb and it works a little bit like an
ice pack so the stuff that is inside an
ice pack is ammonium nitrate and and
water and when you actually break the
you know you basically crackle an ice
pack you're putting those two things
together which causes an endothermic
reaction which then makes your i SPECT
cold okay okay so they did something
very similar inside this little capsule
where they have two different chambers
and you twist it the top of it and it
combines the two and then there's a
little bit there's a metal bit at the
bottom like almost a tray that gets
really really cold and so they hold it
against your skin right before you get
an injection so basically numbs it okay
nice now obviously the question here is
like well what's the point of that why
not just use an ice pack cuz just use an
ice pack why did you build this thing
but what they want to do is they want at
some point to integrate this into actual
syringe caps so you'd be able to have
the end of it be that little metal bit
and you you basically like crack that
combine the two two substances have the
tip of the syringe get cold hold it and
then flip the syringe around and then
give
you an injection so basically it would
all be in one little pack very cool yeah
people use so I thought this is really
ingenious and and from like I said a
freshman team of like three took three
kids at Rice University so I thought
that was really interesting and cool and
and something that's like kind of small
but would it's like one of those kind of
very tiny life improvement things where
it's like it's just as very small
quality of life improvement but also
something that I thought was super cool
that they kind of came up with that is
really neat I hate needles so yeah I
don't like I don't like I love I'm happy
to give blood like but I also i hate the
feeling of like getting a needle and
ears like help me like how that hurts so
thank you guys for like little kids like
little kids would love this kids elderly
because obviously their skin is thinner
so it hurts a little bit more um so you
know stuff like that would be fantastic
so people with really sensitive skin I
mean there are people who when they get
any like if they get a booster shot or
you know if you get a shot your arm
hurts for days sometimes yeah so yeah
really very cool nice job students at
Rice University great work cheb rice
that is it for our headlines we are
going to take a quick break and come
back with our new releases up but before
we do that our friends over at gamespot
want to tell you what games they are
playing right now and why you should
also be playing them so we'll be right
back tomorrow daily
I'm currently playing PT and you should
as well because it is a entrancing and
very unique horror game from hideo
kojima but unfortunately it's been pull
off the PlayStation Network store if
you're lucky enough to have download it
play it now if not find a friend or
going ybañez spend about two thousand
dollars to get a playstation 4 with it
on the hard drive so i think you guys
should play grand theft auto 5 online i
know the game has gotten a little bit of
a bad rap and there's some questionable
material in it but playing online with
your friends is just a really fun
exciting experience especially you know
going through and accomplishing these
really elaborate heist so right now I'm
playing Skyrim again this time on PC
with tons and tons of graphics mods
installed so the whole purpose of course
is to see Skyrim at its most beautiful
so if you're looking to get lost in
something for a week a month a year and
decade then maybe Skyrim on PC with a
whole bunch of mods is the way to go so
these days I'm really into box boy on
the 3ds and if you've got a 3ds you
should totally pick it up it's five
bucks you download it from the eShop and
it's this really cute like minimalist
puzzle you play as a little box with
legs and you can generate boxes to help
you climb over things or snake around
things and like any good puzzle game it
kind of starts building those mechanics
in there and gets more and more complex
to the point where once you're solving
these tough puzzles it feels really good
welcome back to the show it's Tuesday
well game are you playing right now of
course you are nevermind why did I even
ask I don't know I thought you were
setting me up for that no I get that
you're shaming me no no I just I'd
realize of course you're playing grand
playground I thought oh yes o
course you are um ok so it's Tuesday we
like to talk about things that are gonna
be lightening our wallets this week so
let's talk about new releases wait what
game are you playing right now is that
was that why you're brought it up no I
was just curious oh because we did the
game are you playing right now I played
Final Fantasy parts ok lo yeah of course
the quarter yeah we're lame ok so what
are we going to lil I'm totally right so
do we got all right so first up
Wolfenstein the old blood is coming out
today it's out today glute offense dies
Wolfenstein if you want to go fight some
Nazis old school website that was the
very first video gamer ever played yeah
Wolfenstein castle wolfenstein on my
dad's completely it was a it's so funny
like my dad was definitely uh maybe oh
my God look how good this looks or this
is gorgeous um the game boy looks pretty
good uh apparently it's really fun it's
getting good reviews good notices from
what I've seen uh and and I I kind of
want to play it I like I haven't played
a Wolfenstein game in a really long time
this possum I think this is a prequel oh
my god yeah it looks really good that's
it there you go I'm sorry I haven't seen
this trailer here oh my god he shut his
leg off all right you fight fight Nazis
okay on PA what is the xbox one pc the
xbox one playstation 4 MPC okay get on i
need to get a new pc continue all right
yeah I already been talking together
this is an interesting release it's not
technically a game but remember the room
alive demo from Microsoft where they had
like the the people in the like Anna
living room and they were like fighting
stuff that was projected onto the walls
and everything and they was called room
alive we have I think we have any of
this so here's the do you remember this
never seen this movie okay so Microsoft
Research had this concept called room
alive and are we I think we might have
talked about it on the show maybe
it's a little okay um and and so it was
it's like I think it's a couple of
connects so there's some projection
technologies of scanning rooms and stuff
like that and then putting out these
sort of like little games whatever but
the point of all of this is that it d
code for this the source code for room
alive is now open source Microsoft has
released the code for this on github all
right I'm so you can go ahead and head
over there and download that if you want
to sort of build your own room alive
games which I thought was pretty cool I
thought it was pretty neat that they
serve released that to people because
they're like well we're kind of I think
maybe they kind of feel like we're
working on hollow lens we don't really
doing this anymore like maybe sort of
the types of things you would be doing
in room alive or things we'd rather have
you doing with the hollow lens on yeah
so I think this is sort of the the you
know kind of open source public access
version of you know that this is the
thing that sort of led to hololens I
would imagine but pretty cool that they
released it I like guitars very cool
that's cool that they were actually
covering it oh yeah i just i i read that
and i thought that was pretty awesome
they were like hey let's give this to
people and let them kind of figure out
their own stuff so whole thanks
microsoft hopefully we'll see some
really awesome so send me an xbox one I
don't know why I just send me what do it
uh and then of course a movie wise
there's like nothing really coming out
this week because nobody wants to go up
against the avengers weekend and Mad Max
is the weekend after so just go just go
see the Avengers again this week that's
my recommendation Logan you have an xbox
one okay he's good you don't have to
send him one at Microsoft yes kayla just
me you have a playstation as well uh
yeah yeah Logan yeah alright so just
send me a PlayStation as well at
Microsoft I know that's not your deal
but see just just to be fair yes be fair
and even of course yeah just send you
both but yeah so that's what's coming
out this week I think some good stuff I
really do actually want to check out
Wolfenstein looks pretty good yeah that
looked incredible it looks pretty fun
yeah um so okay we talked yesterday
about Star Wars and we asked you guys
use the hashtag TV for so it's time for
user feedback
okay guys um we asked you what
storylines you wanted to see in the new
Star Wars movie once again as always you
did not disappoint Frank wrote in to us
and said a cameo of the three masters
guiding new Jedi's qui-gon jinn obi-wan
Kenobi Yoda interesting blue glowies
yeah it simple guys going oh yeah yeah I
like it I like it Rick wrote and said I
want to see kylo Ren to be a stepson to
Darth Vader and his saying revenge will
be served father holding the Darth Vader
helmet well let's talk about that who
would be the mother then who would like
who would Darth Vader had cheated on
Padme with it would have to be cheap it
would have to be like I got it I got it
what you know keira knightley was her
decoy in in the first it's that's that
that character League that's really good
maybe he didn't even know it wasn't her
maybe she sent maybe she's just tired
she had a headache one night Pat
maze-like I just send in my decoy go
there you go before you've all been
there I have my decoy girls got a big
boys this is kills actually you know
what decoy Micah job send my decoy an
xbox one and playstation as well we just
I'm will you might as well true sorry
balance is uh um but I like that kind of
idea that it's like he's related to
Darth Vader maybe I I actually like your
fan fiction that you're writing right I
like Miami you're welcome you're welcome
everybody that could be official canon
someday hey sis wrote in and said here's
what I don't want to see any mention of
midi-chlorians Star Wars a space fantasy
not hard sci-fi agreed yeah I they
probably won't ever say midi-chlorians
ever again I don't think they're really
gonna think we're gonna ignore they look
like he's gonna be like like I'm in a
chlorine store let's think of it this
way and let's think of it this way so in
the prequels they use the word
midi-chlorians to describe something
like sciency they didn't really
understand like you know over the last
like let's say like 50 years or whatever
like things of Chiss science has changed
and so it let's just say it's a really
old archaic sort of like bad way to
describe the force and like people
thought they could describe it but
really isn't so I like to think that's
just oh that's just the old folks I get
into new movies though the guys just
sold folks talking my middle floor is
this ridiculous midi-chlorians is now
like a like a offensive term yeah yeah
exactly old people say it there like
midi-chlorians like who cramp
ah reum not now damn purse Helen yeah I
like that I like that pre Empire pretty
good Dustin wrote in and said I want to
see r2d2 talk who has not wanted that a
with like a like a deep boys she's like
Barry White yeah why do you guys keep
messing around let's just do the job we
came here to do it give it to Patrick
Warburton and give him like a voice that
are the two yeah perfect um it's good
it's good it's good it's good um and
then lastly Dave wrote us an email and
said hey kids wanted to throw my two
cents on plot lines for the new Star
Wars trilogy all billed on mr. uh not a
mrs. desire to want to see Leia using
the force warning Will Robinson spoilers
ahead I chole his ability with the force
building over the upcoming movies in
Episode seven maybe on a low level
moving say a plate with fruit across the
table to be closer to her maybe
something so subtle people around her
wouldn't even notice episode eight would
expand her use to the point where the
climax of the film will revolve around
her using the Force to save a main
character or characters and the final
episode would have the saga wrap up with
Leia as the pivotal character that saves
the star wars universe I could see a
scene with a representative of the dark
side thinks he or she has ensnared both
Luke and Leia and lay a kicked butt big
time the brainstorming makes me wonder
if the movie isn't telegraphing Leia's
use of the force with its subtitle the
force awakens that's some serious
thought but you know what I realize I
don't know what I want from Star Wars
anymore I know I just don't because I
feel like there was a lot of things that
I thought I wanted and then George Lucas
gave me a few of them and I got it may
be just like I didn't want that I don't
let that meant like wow we're so good at
lightsaber battles isn't it entertaining
no listen in claw and attack of the
clones though when all of those Jedi
fight and the Stygian OC and stadium
like that's awesome yeah that was cool
that's pretty cool and that was a moment
that was like I'm not necessarily a Jedi
girl like I love me some smugglers
scoundrels like that's my jam like amma
han solo girl not a Luke no Luke
Skywalker girl but that was all there's
a lot of Luke Skywalker girls I think
there's a lot of girls I don't love and
just love a Jedi love a Jedi and like so
I'm just not that guy
love love a han Solo that's my that's my
jam use a blaster no hokey religions we
gotta go that way but I thought that
scene was really cool like I loved
watching it and every time I see it even
now it's like it makes me feel like a
kid again like seeing that scene that's
cool hey that segment seriously you lost
me with the starburst whatever I'll take
it Fritz wrote in fritz wrote and sent
us this picture he says hey Ashley and
kale there has been a been construction
of a new bypass going through the
portion of the woods in my hometown here
in Georgia what you see here is a lone
chimney standing in the middle of where
the road is intended to be all work on
the projects has come to a halt as
County officials ponder what to do with
this historic chimney I took this
picture of my iphone 4s PS the main road
is located 50 yards for the chimney so I
drove my car up the service road
intended for the use of heavy machinery
on a Sunday because the workers have the
day off I enjoy the show and look
forward to every episode keep up the
good work Fritz yeah Fritz put in work
to get this photo really hard works but
in this photo but yeah well there's
living a story I'm on this little
chimney air I like that it's just
sitting there in the middle of the woods
onew is there what's it attached to what
was it part of I want to know well
what's historical what's a historical
chimney well maybe it's part of a
