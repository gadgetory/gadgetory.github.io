with just a little bit more of
everything well I'm Dan Akron and I've
got the Lenovo mixed two for you it's
Nick spelled miix2 reasons I have yet to
quite fathom but if you remember the
unique name you'll remember a few of the
things that make this stand out from
other windows tablets first it's got a
10 inch screen while most Windows
tablets have 8 inch screens it's a 1920
x 1200 screen resolution which is much
higher than usual and also tells us this
is a 16 x 10 aspect ratio screen instead
of a more common 16 by 9 aspect ratio
screen the effect is is not going to be
one that you notice the heck of a lot
but that extra screen real estate
especially when you're in the
traditional desktop view will give you
more room to work with things like big
excel spreadsheets and and big
photographs in Photoshop and other apps
like that if you switch back to the
windows menu you'll see it actually
scales very well to the higher
resolution and you won't really notice
that you're working on a screen with a
different resolution and different
aspect ratio then you're used to even
though this guy is 599 which is a little
bit more than most Windows tablets you
do get a few extras with it it's got the
same intel atom cpu is a lot of those
systems but you get a nice big 128 gig
SSD and you see it's a standalone tablet
like this but it's also got this pretty
unique keyboard dock it doesn't actually
latch on it help it holds itself
together through a little multi-pin
connector and a magnetic connection so I
can stick this on here and and type and
I can pick it up and it pretty much
stays on I wouldn't shake it too too
much I can also flip it around and show
to you from the rear angle like this and
you can have kind of a kiosk mode
there's really only one angle whether
you're going this way or the other way
so if you don't like that angle to type
on you're pretty much out of luck it's
not as flexible as let's say a clamshell
laptop but you can actually put the two
parts together let the magnet hold them
together when you hold it up like this
it actually looks like you're carrying a
laptop even though you're not you can
kind of shake it and toss it around and
the two parts are not going to come
apart I still exercise a little bit of
care when throwing it in your shoulder
bag just to make sure battery life and
performance of pretty similar to the 8
inch
Windows tablets that we seen but on the
slightly bigger screen you may expect
something a little bit closer to full
size laptop performance which means that
the occasional slow down instead of ring
you run into may seem a little more
pronounced even though the performance
is pretty much the same as an eight-inch
shuffle Windows tablet I'm Dan Akron and
that's the Lenovo mix too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
