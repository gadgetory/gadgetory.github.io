because of this thing called technology
welcome to the Apple buy for everything
inside the world of Apple let's get to
it and we've seen plenty of the rumors
and concepts of the iPhone 7 that claim
it will have a thinner design no antenna
lines a flush mirror camera and single
lightning port now Apple even teased our
own eagle eyes by showing a phone with a
completely flush camera in the beginning
of their Liem video but it looked like a
success
now Korean website et News reports Apple
is planning to use a new fan-out
packaging tech that allows the iPhone to
switch between LTE GSM and CDMA networks
while cutting down on the chip size the
process fits more components into a
single package while reducing the
potential for interference with wireless
communications and allowing for a
slimmer design and when anyone says the
word slimmer Apple they start drooling
out now the iPhone is still Apple's
bread and butter but its 3d touch in
trouble I'm a big fan of 3d touch and it
has the potential to be huge I've liked
it from the start and it's why I upgrade
it to the 6s but the iPhone 6s is
currently the only iOS Apple product
with 3d touch 12 point 9 inch iPad pro
nada the new iPhone se and nine point
seven inch iPad pro nada all three came
after the iPhone 6s Apple has their
reasons but you can't push an entirely
new iOS interface effectively when it's
only on one device from your entire iOS
family now the other challenge do you
even really know which apps support a 3d
touch because you don't it's a guessing
game there's no tiny icon or indicator
on apps that lets you know it's 3d touch
compatible it's a game of pushing really
hard on your screen you forget which
apps have it which ones don't
and then you ended up not using it much
that's not encouraging the developers to
all jump on board and where's the boat
load of great 3d touch games it's not
happening right now
really the only app I use it
consistently for is Shazam and I'm not
really peaking and popping at pictures
or emails and not that many other people
are unless you work for Apple and the
last issue production
reports say yield rates for the 3d
touchscreens are lower than normal they
also say they're having trouble getting
the tech to work properly on larger
screen sizes like the iPad so why push
it out just on the iPhone 6s when
clearly the tech isn't ready to be on
every iOS product other than a flagship
iPhone we know Apple typically is pushed
out new tech when it's ready to roll and
clearly it's not ready so where does 3d
touch stand now the only other product
of the next year that I think will have
it is most likely the iPhone 7 and Apple
this is a tech that I don't want to see
die but only time will tell
uncertain future all right a lot of
Apple watch fans are curious about the
next version but a trio of patent
applications might show the direction
Apple is taking with its watchbands
details from the patent Show modular
band designs with embedded electronics
that connect through the currently
unused Apple Diagnostics port now that
port was discovered to support power and
data right after the first watch
released future versions could support
things like wireless battery charging
pax displays GPS receivers and even
different add-on health sensors that's a
whole lot of thing of a bops and just in
case you didn't check already
Apple has released the iOS 9.3 point one
update to fix the web link crashing bug
so you can now get the update to the
update of the original 9.3 update now
I'm crossing my fingers that we don't
have to do another immediate update for
the update of the other update to the
iOS 9.3 and before we go since I'm
having fun playing in the water while
I'm on my break I didn't want to leave
you out of it so I'm doing a giveaway
for the three Mophie Juice Pack h2o pros
that are waterproof and give you 70%
more battery juice for your iPhone 6s
plus or iPhone 6 plus that's right it's
an underwater charging case rated ip68
that can last for 30 minutes straight
1.5 meters underwater that's about 5
feet so all you have to do to win these
cases is send me a tweet or email of
what underwater creature you would be if
you could pick one anyone and you can't
say the ultra rare pink dolphin because
that's mine all right that's gonna do it
for this week's show tweet me at Brian
Todd or email me
at the Apple Vitus cnet.com and I'll
announce our winners next week
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
you all next time for another bite of
the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
