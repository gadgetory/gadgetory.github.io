welcome to Google Isha's for all the
Google goodness that we can pack inside
of a show each week let's get to it and
everyone is talking about Google's
self-driving car they unveiled for the
first time at code con it's our first
prototype car designed from the ground
up with no steering wheel no brakes and
the push of a button will take you where
you want to go yes it's very cute and
it's just amazing to see how this
project has developed so quickly in just
a few years now the googs has started
building 100 of their electrical
experimental vehicles the cars would be
summoned by using a smartphone
application and it will be able to
automatically pick you up and then take
you to your destination and again this
is just amazing and the other big semi
big announcement was the official
unveiling of LG's g3 flagship phone that
looks to compete directly with a galaxy
s5 and the HTC One m8 now this beauty
features a 5.5 inch quad HD resolution
screen on a 2560 x 1440 resolution for
538 pixels per inch that's what's up in
this thing just looks so sessy now it
has a micro SD card slot for up to 128
gigs of additional storage and a 13
megapixel camera with ultra HD video
recording and a feature they call laser
autofocus now that uses laser technology
to measure the distance between the
camera and the subject or shooting for a
fast focus it will be running android
4.4 point2 KitKat out of the box and has
a clever case of their own with a quick
circle feature to access commonly used
apps with the case still on the phone it
goes on sale in south korea on May 28th
with the worldwide release to follow
sometime after that and I'm loving how
these companies continue to innovate
differently from each other alright last
week we talked about all Google's latest
acquisitions and a new report from the
information says the googs is planning
to move into the home security market
and is considering acquiring Dropcam the
makers of the popular camera system that
streams live footage directly to your
phones and computers it's what Brian
Cooley uses to watch his cats at home
for uncomfortably long long stretches of
time Oh kitty now the report says the
status of negotiations is unclear so
this could just be a pure rumor but it's
intriguing because it could be Google's
second company in the home automation
space after their acquisition of nest
and it's really a new market that's
still trying to figure itself out okay
rumors surrounding YouTube bringing a
music streaming service have been
swirling as far back as October from a
billboard report but according to the
New York Times the online video giant
has run into licensing troubles with
indie labels specifically less enticing
streaming deals compared to agreements
with Universal Sony and Warner now the
members of the worldwide independent
networks posted a letter of their
complaints including YouTube threatening
to block all the music on in these
official YouTube channels if they do not
agree to the current terms and YouTube
would also prevent them from collecting
revenues from videos that use their
music come on Google don't be evil now
the service has been reported to launch
later this year but we'll see how this
might all affect that alright Samsung
has released two smartwatches to the
market with a less than lukewarm
reception but they aren't finished after
Sammy today revealed a recent patent
filing that shows a gesture controlled
wearable device with a round screen
interface the patent filing also shows
the different placements that you can
possibly wear this ranging from a
necklace your chest to your arm to your
hand upon your hip when i dip you dip we
dip
alright i'll stop that now these patent
filings aren't always indicators that
this is exactly what we'll see in the
future but we know Samsung still isn't
finished here after the wall street
journal reports that the korean giant is
going to announce guess what another
smart watch this summer now the big
difference with this one is that it will
act as a standalone device that will
have its own sim card so you'll be able
to make calls without being connected to
a smartphone I'm sorry but Samsung has
already killed any excitement that they
could bring in the SmartWatch market
after two huge fails that were clearly
rushed out and then they still want us
to pay attention with their third
SmartWatch model in less than a year and
not having it but if there's any
SmartWatch that really has my interest
at all it's the Moto 360 a SmartWatch
that actually looks like a fashionable
watch now we've seen the concepts and
we're expecting the real deal this
summer but just to keep the momentum
going Motorola started a contest and is
letting the community submit watchface
designs ahead of the lunch now you can
get all the details at the link on the
screen and this contest ends on jun 24th
and they'll be giving away one moto 360
to the submission that's selected as the
winner now the community is really
coming up with some great stuff ranging
from this wood pattern this one looks
pretty cool too and there's also a Tron
theme but I decided to do a little work
on my own and let's be honest you're
looking at the winner right here alright
that's gonna do it for this week's show
email us at Google issues at cnet com or
tweet me at brian Tong thanks so much
for watching and we'll see you guys next
week for some more of that google issues
