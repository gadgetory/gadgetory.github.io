rabid football fans are upon us and that
means that they're in the stores looking
for the best TVs to buy I'm Jamie rodol
with CBS sports.com teaming up with CNS
senior editor David Katz Meyer who has
been studying TVs for the last two
decades so I always go to the experts
when it comes to football and you are
the expert my friend
football in TV's football and TVs we got
it covered all right what is the most
important thing to keep in mind when
purchasing a TV just break it down the
basics the biggest thing you need to
know is you don't need to pay a fortune
for really good picture quality these
days there's some really good HD TVs out
there that won't break the bank the
thing that I tell people to pay for is
bigger screen size so that speaks to
football fans you can really get a great
large television for not all that much
money anymore we really like the Vizio
TVs for the large screen sizes for the
least amount of money there's some other
good brands out there but again it you
don't really have to pay a fortune take
a great picture but if you did want to
break the bank if you wanted to open up
the wallet and have a couple flies come
out of there what are some things that
if people are telling you this is what
this TV has this is what it doesn't have
that you should keep an eye on - really
if you wanted to pay extra well there
are some that are worth paying extra for
some that aren't I'll start the ones
that are worth paying extra for again
that's the larger screen there is an
extra called local dimming on LED TVs
that actually really improves the
picture quality and if you're really
spending a lot of money there's a
technology called OLED Oh le D that has
spectacular picture quality but does
cost a heck of a lot of money okay so if
someone's trying to sell you something
that's just not worth it what would be
on that list well again with with
football people talk about motion so one
of the things you see is all these terms
thrown around a hundred twenty Hertz
that sort of thing I would ignore those
the motion artifacts you see in football
the blurring and stuff is generally
going to be in the source a lot of times
so as long as you have a really nice
source good HDTV channel feed those
motion things aren't really going to do
much for you a curved screen not a huge
fan of that's kind of just a gimmick
yeah so a smart TV a fancy remote you're
not going to really use those features
much if you're going to be having an
external box or a universal remote so
again not worth paying us for this right
who needs a smart fancy remote when
you're just going to take one channel
stick with it if your team is playing
one o'clock on CBS all right David Katz
Meyer with
all of your TV trends and how to buy
smart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
