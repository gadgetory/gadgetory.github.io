amazon may read your mind I'm short
zipkin in for Bridget Carey this is your
cnet update Intel's internet TV business
has finally found a home verizon said
Tuesday that it's buying the operations
from the chip maker to be sits FiOS TV
service until had been working for two
years on a TV box and service that would
deliver live programming and on-demand
content over the internet but Intel's
new CEO wanted to focus on the company's
core chip business along with fios
verizon will use Intel's technology to
bring video to users when where and how
they want it including on mobile devices
first Amazon talked about delivery
drones NAT might ship what you want
before you even order it the company
received a patent in late December
called method and system for
anticipatory package shipping that's
quite a mouthful but basically what it
does is predict which items are going to
order before you even place that order
amazon would look at a specific part of
the country and figure out what items
people want then when you place an order
the package gets to you faster Windows 8
has such a bad rep that HP is
advertising Windows 7 pcs the company
said the computers are back by popular
demand but our sisters fight ZDNet
reports that Windows 7 pcs never
actually went away at all still it's
interesting that the company is trying
to boost demand by pushing the older
operating system Windows 8 has faced a
lot of criticism since it launched in
late 2012 if you're sick of Pandora and
Spotify there's now a new option for
streaming music beats on tuesday
launched a new music app for iphone and
android devices called beats music it
operates a lot like rival music services
but differs in one key way there are no
free ad-supported versions of the app
only subscriptions that start at ten
dollars a month so why bother beat says
that service has the human touch it is
people like nine inch nails frontman
trent reznor heading up a team of
programmers these people cater to your
tastes instead of using an algorithm the
rumor mill keeps heating up about apples
gadgets the latest report comes from a
Chinese analyst who says the iphone 6
will come in two large screen sizes one
could be 4.7 inches while the other
could be 5.7 the new iPhones could show
up as soon as June which would be a big
change from Apple's recent timing it
announced the iphone 5s
I've seen September I'd be pretty
annoyed if I just bought a new iphone if
you already cracked the screen on your
iphone 5c you may be in luck Apple
stores can now replace the screens while
you ate that costs $149 vs. 229 to send
the phones to repair centers Apple
geniuses won't be able to fix all screen
damage though displays with scratches or
cracks could be treated in store while
those was heavier damage could still be
sent away for repair and for now in
store screen repairs only work for the
iphone 5c that's your tech news update
