cnet bringing you guys the lg optimus 4x
HD now this phone is LG's first
quad-core handset and it runs on Android
Ice Cream Sandwich it's powered by a 1.5
gigahertz Tegra 3 processor and I gotta
say it's stupid fast games played
smoothly apps launched and quit like
nobody's business and the 8 megapixel
camera is the quickest I've seen on any
LG phone you can even leave your finger
on the shutter and I'll take one picture
after another keep in mind that this is
different than automated continuous
shooting which the camera can still do
other camera options include HDR imaging
and a time machine feature that lets you
capture a frame right before you press
the shutter in case you missed something
you can also record in full HD 1080p
video the 1.3 megapixel front-facing
camera has a few tricks to like this
beauty shop module that lets you control
the blurriness or lighting of an image
this comes in handy when taking
self-portraits but unfortunately this
feature isn't available in real life the
4x HD also sports an attractive 4.7 inch
true HD IPS display that leaves images
looking crisp and colors vivid and
bright powered by a 2150 milliampere
hour battery this device is also NFC
enabled and comes with these tag plus
stickers these let you activate certain
settings on your phone so say every time
you get in your car you want to launch
the navigation app and turn bluetooth on
just set it here and save it stick the
car mode sticker in your car and now
every time you get in and tap it these
settings will activate there's also
office and sleep mode stickers that you
can use to automatically dim your phone
turn it on vibrate or set music timeouts
other features on the phone include some
nifty video playback options like
scrolling previews and you could
fast-forward or slow mo your recorded
videos it's not perfect however some
might find it a little too big audio
speaker quality isn't the best and the
new LG interface called optimus
three-point oh isn't as elegantly simple
as the Vanilla Ice Cream Sandwich skin
though I do like the way it launches
apps through the lock screen the biggest
disappointing feature however is that
the 4x HD is only available so far in
parts of Europe it will be sold in other
countries too but he
hoping that a US release will be planned
in the nearby future again I'm Lynn
bringing you guys the LG optimus 4x HD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
