that's gonna grow you a gross sludgy
dinner and I'm already skeptical because
we're gonna talk about hoverbikes and
hoverboards it's tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the Internet I'm
Ashley together this is killin onimous
and you're watching tomorrow daily good
st talked earlier on universe um you
seemed so down I've spent way too much
time on the internet to have things like
just slide by as just like a reality so
true right everything I Deanna is true
yeah everything I put up on the Internet
is true that's accurate well I mean I
feel like we got a really kind of nip we
got it we got to figure out this these
hover hover items so let's hit the
headlines many of you sent us this one
this is so many of you because uh
there's hoverboards now because because
of this video that was announced by
Lexus in which they've created a
hoverboard for their series amazing in
motion they claim that they have a
hoverboard they're going to be showing
off soon here's here's the ad yeah we're
gonna watch the sad all the way through
yet they claim it uses liquid nitrogen
cooled superconductors and permanent
magnets to support the weight of a
person that watch this here's here's the
twist miss right so there's the
hoverboard they slowly panned out
nitrogen right so liquid that's that's
cool i like that is pretty cool it looks
awesome but here we go here's here's why
we get skeptical and use that other cuts
to black that's where the actual ad
stops yeah now we've failed to see this
get used yet that's i mean that's all we
have apparently lexus is saying you can
follow them but they want they're also
saying that it's a the board actually
needs a surface lexus has admitted it's
similar to Hendo hoverboard remember
that hoverboard that like tony hawk used
and support especially second like it
was yeah i was just on like a metallic
sheet or whatever so it only works on
special surfaces so great we didn't
already see this so and we're I mean
what's eating as you should I'm upset
well what do you want to see what what
are we seeing we want to see somebody
use this we want to see somebody
actually use the hoverboard but this is
what Lexus has for us and it's called
again it's amazing it in motion it's
been in development for over a year and
a half so it's like they've been working
on it since they knew that this year's
2015
and teams in Germany and London worked
on it so so there you go we'll see so
what do you think Ashley I mean I said
yeah I feel cheated I feel cheetah this
is I got really excited today I cheated
yet you haven't seen it what so I saw
the video and I was really excited
because it was hovering on a service
that appeared to be concrete and I was
like oh my god somebody cracked it you
guys we have a hoverboard even if the
guy could just stand on it doesn't even
move I'd be excited no it's a special
surface just like just like we saw so
it's like we've been there we've seen
this I mean how many hoverboards are we
gonna have to suffer through in 2015
because it's the 30 year anniversary of
back to the future like how many i don't
i don't think my mole science heart can
take it look it's honestly your fault
for like being so interested in this
without actually just look because any
time somebody says hoverboard you're
gonna be drawn to whatever they're
saying actually I was just wait and like
not check out this Lexus until you hear
from us that it's actually cool yeah
from somebody else or if he is either it
after the thing is that lexus is
creating this because they know it's
gonna get eyeballs on lexus of course
well an ow many people like you said are
gonna you said they want people oh if
you want to see somebody write it you
have to follow us you keep tabs us of
course now millions of people are gonna
call Alexis who haven't before so it's
just like I feel like this is such a
cheap marketing ploy to get people to
follow their YouTube channel and that
makes me kind of mad like I'm kind of
mad about it I'm a little bit Hulk I did
it's shark week and I wore a shark shirt
and I feel very shark like right now and
I feel like I'm gonna chomp something I
not happy hashtag of the day all right
what is it TD hover what kind of
futuristic transportation would you
rather have instead of hoverboards
because apparently you're not gonna have
public yeah because we're not gonna get
any teleportation that's not even a
question really I mean no time travel I
mean time travel so teleportation
because honestly that way I can I can be
late I can be more time official you'll
never be late you'll never be late now
yeah well yeah Websense but yeah so
there how would you feel about being
killed and then rebuilt cuz that's
really kind of what teleporting is I'm
you know you'd be dissolved and then
rebuilt straight up won't matter to me
you won't care y'all here be dead all
right fair enough uh I would say you
know honestly I really
Hyperloop to be a real thing like I have
so much hope about Hyperloop that I'm
like I just like I know that it's
probably a little unrealistic but I'm so
slightly like really excited about
Hyperloop and it could if it even if it
happens like edit at a fraction of what
they think it could be like that would
still be really exciting so for me it's
Hyperloop I want to travel basically in
a vacuum tube like shoot me up to San
Francisco I could go visit you Charlie I
could go visit all of our Cena San
Francisco friends like we could go up
there and actually like party with them
all the time and hang out and stuff and
then we just come back and it would be
less than the commute I have now from
here to home cnet guys really got to
step it up we partied with the gamespot
guys this last weekend repair I don't
know we'll see I spent pretty amazing
though if that's true but I'd to leave
to go to a concert I didn't get to hang
out with all of it was a great i know i
do i do remember they were pretty they
were pretty good yeah we're actually it
was comparable for sure it was
comparable you guys would be surprised I
didn't get to spend my whole time with
the sea yet actually don't get to spend
the whole time with either I am look for
a commenter concert promotion jerk
concerts are more important ok next time
ok ok next up so that's our party news
I'm episode wrapping it back to hashtag
late TD hover hat what mode of
transportation would you rather
futuristic motor transportation would
you rather have aside from hoverboards
because we're not getting one to get to
your favorite people to party and teeny
party who do you think parties harder
gamespot or seen it I like that let's
answer that question too ok let's talk
about hoverbikes because that's also a
thing in the news apparently the US Army
Research Lab made a deal with a couple
of different companies to work on
hoverbikes this is a real thing this is
not a joke this is moved past the
concept phase these are these are things
that are happening right now the two
companies are malloway aeronautics and
service engineering they want to develop
these hoverbikes with the Department of
Defense a for the Department of Defense
i should say obviously they'd be a lot
better for range because you're not
having to ride over rocky terrain these
would be things that would be a little
bit more fuel-efficient obviously better
in in terrain where it's you know really
tough to get any vehicle through and
malloway this is a this is malinois
hoverbikes channel this is their hybrid
Hoverbike pretty awesome lifts
like a chopper and then right it looks
some rides kind of like a motorcycle so
this is a small way this little tiny
version of it or they have like almost a
little they have a little almost like an
action figure on there and he's like
riding around there so that was one of
their tests like prototypes and then
they did made a bigger one that's
actually like full-size for people with
I love it yeah super awesome and
actually Malloy had a successful
Kickstarter last year so this has been
in testing this is the full sized one
this is a human-sized test version of a
Hoverbike but nothing human ridden that
is untethered so everything's kind of
tethered right now yeah and they're able
to test with a person on it but only
when it's actually tethered and this is
this is not that so um it remains to be
seen whether or not they will end up
taking other taking over other forms of
transport like motorcycles and things
like that it was the military it does
look a little bit delicate but I would
imagine if there is Department of
Defense money behind it it it would
probably be you know kind of strengthen
this is so cool pretty I really liked
that didn't be a bunch of can I tell you
we have it we have secret footage of
actual military speeder bike mrs. at
first we're going to show here on
tomorrow it's an exclusive Logan he
rolled out
this is gonna look like like that all
right no I really I really hope you get
sued for that right that joke was not
worth getting sued for fair use and
collar top or you can think of
hoverbikes like this Logan Oh perfect
great the simpson the simpsons they have
hoverbikes are hovering mics I like that
so so much know what those look really
cool you look at exactly the Green
Goblin would you like floating around
you look very bad um okay speaking of
the color green we have to talk about
this because it's very upsetting to me
this is a table that grows you food
gross food for you which sounds great in
theory but then when I tell you what it
is and what it kind of looks like like
so here it is this is an actual it's not
a concept you know a lot of this stuff
is concept this is a prototype design
that they're actually showing at an art
museum in Philadelphia so this is from
architectural designer Jacob duenas and
industrial designer Ethan freer they put
together this conceptual design your
furniture grows food fries you can see
this big green tank inside the furniture
okay photosynthetic it uses waste heat
light and carbon dioxide inside the home
to feed little tiny edible bacteria
inside okay so and then gross yeah it
looks really disgusting and at a certain
point you'd be able to sort of tap one
of these glass containers and eat the
Green sludge inside as food that's how
you would do it you eat it as food watch
look this is so upsetting to me like oh
let's eat this gross Green sludge but
apparently it's blue-green algae which I
guess you can buy it supplement stores
you can actually buy blue-green algae
it's very healthy it has a lot of
proteins and people already eat it as a
supplement just not in this form and and
and so it is not a completely
unrealistic thing but yeah what I would
not eat that that is Soylent Green I am
a hundred percent convinced that's
people that's what it was yeah there you
go that's blue-green algae right there
the powder form nope
no cool nope won't eat it I think that's
cool I mean it shows up for likes the
astronauts and astronauts in their
leadership and they're all alone just
eating Green Green sludge well so I
don't know that they would have the
right environment to feed that bacteria
because it eats stuff like carbon
dioxide in the air so I'm not sure how
much food that little bacteria would
have but in a home they were saying like
it would it the idea is that so their
goal because they're artists and
architects and designers is to help
people remember that we're all at all
times completely surrounded by
microorganisms and by showing us
visually and giving us something that we
can actually consume it's a really good
reminder of like the fact that you know
it's okay to eat stuff like this like
this is this is life like life is
happening everywhere what's nutrition
value of this slime apparently it is I
think it has like double the amount of
protein then it I mean it's like up
there like if you look up blue-green
algae it's that's what it is it's
blue-green algae so it has like really
high calcium levels really hot like
there's some there is some real
nutritional value to this stuff well I
want that so and I know I could totally
see Kelly yeah cuz kale literally eats
like salads this is like kills life I
don't eat I don't even care about the
flavor of food real now as long as it
doesn't taste bad i'll eat it you'll eat
it so okay all right well that was it
listen I if you just put me up to it
like bein just like you put it yo my god
they've amazing hit a little button on
your chest well gee blue-green algae
that be glorious I'm actually curious to
see how many people that are watching
this would would be down yeah let us
know if you'll eat any of that stuff
because we're just curious another one
that imagine is also affordable to
imagine you know like yeah let's say
it's a cheap way maybe good buy it at
IKEA like you go get it go get the table
and the little thing and it starts like
a starter kit and you build your little
table and you put your crazy
photosynthesis growing plant food algae
bubble in the table be kind of weird
anyway that's it for headlines will come
right back with a mod squad that I'm
pretty sure is going to be kills
greatest mod squad of all time and then
we'll have your LG no but it's maybe
even better for you and then we're going
to talk about your user feedback and of
course our phone target for the day so
click
Wade smart daily welcome back to the
show it's Wednesday which means we like
talk about stuff people other people did
and put together because they're better
than us this is Mod Squad I found this
on reddit and I don't think kales seen
this yet i really i thought he had but
maybe he has not this is from a reddit
user the MCV and i'm pretty sure he gets
the title of best friend ever because he
made a pip-boy 3000 a and i like this
already yeah i figured you would um this
thing is amazing so check check this out
he's got a video of it um I'm gonna tell
you a little bit about it while he while
this video plays he got a 3d body of the
pip-boy printed from Nakamura's shop
online so he sent in a file so that's
there it is like pretty detailed looks
pretty great found a piece of curved
glass like actual curved glass not
plastic from a slide viewer that he
bought on ebay for 10 bucks that just
happen to fit perfectly into this pit
boy and it is a Raspberry Pi base user
interface from a developer called select
none and the the user interface for
raspberry PI's called Raz pitboy and it
actually shows your location in google
maps you can you can plug in an API key
for Google Maps and it'll tell you
exactly where you are here it is booting
up if you're wondering where the
computing and battery power comes from
you saw there were some cables attached
to it well that's because he also made
his friend an armored vault 101 suit to
hold the raspberry pi computer and the
batteries I mean this is incredible look
at this this is amazing it looks so so
good it looks real I mean the curved
screen really sells it for me that's the
thing that really blows my mind is the
curved screen it looks gorgeous he's
working on he's almost finished he's
saying he's like got to put the buttons
on and everything in the dials but he's
definitely like he's almost done with it
his friend I think but you know it
if I was his friend I'd pretty much make
this my halloween costume for the rest
of my life or until he made me something
else equally awesome but yeah pip-boy
3000 a just like just crushed it just
crush that's incredible yeah I want
these to be the collector's edition ones
we're gonna get little plastic things
that fit on our arms can't see him
turning the dials I think he's actually
using a controller right now just
because he hasn't installed dial ok how
much but actually there's the GPS
Washington that's that's good about that
was google maps is it amazing um yeah he
was saying I think he I he mentions a
whole bunch of stuff about like cuz the
Raspberry Pi is only like twenty-five
thirty bucks and then he talks Italy if
you go to the reddit thread it's really
we have a link to the to the reddit
thread in the show notes if you go to
the article version of the show it's so
detailed and it's so impressive I mean
really impressive that's unreal here's
some come on the bathroom really take
pictures with the bathroom that's look
at that curved screen I'm telling you is
the thing that really sells it for me
it's in it's incredible it's amazing it
doesn't look as bulky as the vault of
the collective pitch away from the
collectors edition football out for but
I mean it's really nice really nice so
now the MCV will take two first of all
and secondly can you be kales best
friend and make him one you didn't even
like it's also a big deal that he made
the vault 101 suit because you can't
just buy those I mean you can buy one
but he actually like hooked it up with
yeah he's got like the wires all hooked
in there I mean so good so good it's
impressive yeah super good um okay so
now that we've talked about Mod Squad
and given much praise to read a user the
MCV we got to talk about you it's time
for a user feedback
okay so TD Spidey we asked you guys use
TD spider tell us what you thought about
Tom Holland being cast as spider-man we
got an email from jolly rodent said just
saw the episode on Tom Holland I just
hope he takes a more Andrew Garfield
spin on the character i think andruw's
take has been the best so far it's sad
to see him go but hopefully it will be
kind of like the Hulk hand off before I
can see why Marvel will go with a
younger Peter Parker and I think it
gives them a lot more freedom with ways
to take the story I was really hoping
for an end credits scene in Avengers
with Spidey showing up somewhere and I
can't wait to see what happens now that
he's going to be in the MCU um so he and
he also talks about how he's picked up
Ultimate Universe and he's been into
Miles Morales a spider-man all the stuff
so he's like really into comic books and
the movies which is pretty awesome here
from that point of view and then Dustin
wrote in on Twitter and said meh not
really sure how i feel in tom holland
however he does have a job so i guess
it's not up to us anyway huh LOL true
dustin trade show you have no power now
we have no power powerless Matt wrote in
and said to be honest I didn't kill me
the best spread around and then made
that haha did you use the Tobey Maguire
body your head looks huge on Tobey
Maguire's body it's okay look freshly 10
we got like a Mexican spider behalf
Mexican spider-man I love Hispanic gusta
an amazing thank you for that whatever
amen the last one which you'll also
really like is from Hakimi says just one
thing just got one thing to say I can't
believe it's not butter filled hahaha
asa butterfield I love that love that I
was really funny it made me laugh quite
a bit so I thank you very much for your
user feedback we got a couple other ones
saying they couldn't believe that kale
was not cast and I i agree huge it's a
huge letdown it's Marvel Cinematic
Universe will never reach its true peaks
unless I'm either spider-man or Kraven
the hunter Kraven the hunter will know
in your offspring is gonna be spider-man
yeah I'm sorry baby son's gonna be spies
son or daughter ya havin girl spies my
girl as long as apparently spider mite
not black or gay it can be yeah great uh
so yeah that's that was your user
feedback which is great and then and

very last ease user feedback which is
our phone talker for the day
