building Jamie robot it's a t-rex and
it's a robot and it's designed to move
is that all this kit can do or can it do
other things it can kind of change in
two different things there's a baby
there's a seal and there's a parrot
there's a penguin there's a t-rex which
we did get in a nap cords builds it
gives you instructions there's a green
bar showing you how much progress you
have and you can like slides the green
bar so just skip the points and there's
two areas to go to bits you could move
it around and then shows you different
angles it was very helpful so like I
could just swipe to kind of see which
hole it was going to go in we started
from the very beginning just with one
motor and we didn't really need much
help a little bit of help some points it
felt a little bit tricky so it didn't
need a bit of parent to help most of the
time it's just like Lego you could just
snap things on you can code it to do
stuff and there's actions you can do
like moving forwards moving backwards
moving side to side and you can also
make it do little funny dances and stuff
on a few other bits so was it fun yeah
it was very fun it was awesome it was a
really good experience and it taught me
lots about robots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
