earpods feature that everyone pretty
much asked about and joked about ever
since the air pods were announced right
now this is the developer beta so it's
not available to the public but it will
be in the future I'm gonna show you how
you use it so the first thing that
you'll want to do is go into the Find My
iPhone app and open it up we're gonna
assume that you've already synced your
air pods but let's say you've used them
and like you don't know where they are
like like where where are they oh yeah
they're here okay so let's just say you
took them out you put them down now on
the Find My iPhone app you'll see a list
of devices your air pods will show up if
you want to find them you want to click
on your actual air pods it'll show them
on a map and then it gives you the
general approximation of what area they
are again they connect through bluetooth
and not the cellular connection so you
can't be very super specific but what
helps is if you click on the actions you
have the option to play a sound so I'm
gonna play a sound it's gonna start off
soft but get a little louder as time
goes on can you hear that alright so
there's that sound you can then stop
playing them I located my air pods and
there you go the other caveat about this
is if you have the air pods in the case
and they're closed it actually closes
off that Bluetooth connection so you
won't be able to see it it'll just show
you the last known spot you had that
Bluetooth connection so let's just hope
that they're there but overall that's
how to find your air pods
kind of
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
