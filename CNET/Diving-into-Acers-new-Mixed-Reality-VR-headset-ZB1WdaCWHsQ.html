reality headsets are here and the first
one I'm getting to play with extensively
is a sirs model called the Acer Windows
mix reality headset think of this as a
simplified version of a VR headset when
the costless works on a wider range of
computers and doesn't need you to set up
tracking cameras or sensors that's
because it uses front mounted cameras to
keep track of where you are and where
you're moving so you can interact with
the virtual world and you don't crash
into a wall the experience with the Acer
headset which is $399 with a pair of
handheld controllers isn't a slick and
immersive feeling as an oculus rift or
an HTC vive but setting up the hardware
along a pain point for VR was quick and
easy I also like that the visor part
flips up so you can take a quick reality
break when needed the biggest problem is
that there's not a lot to do in the
Windows mix reality universe right now
there's a bunch of 360 degree video
players and a handful of games already
available on other VR platforms like
space pirate trainer and really not much
else there is a new halo themed free app
called halo recruit but it's literally
just shooting some flat targets it's
hard to feel ripped off by a free app
but halo recruits somehow manages that
what I did like was the Frank Lloyd
Wright style cliff house that serves as
the main menu in there you can also
watch videos in a home theater room or
play around with a bunch of 3d models
ever want to take a 3d model of a creepy
animated mime and make them 20 feet tall
well now you can seriously that was
really creepy there's one other elephant
in the room when these windows mix
reality headsets were first announced
$399 seemed like a great price since
then the oculus rift with its own
handheld controllers has dropped its
price - you guessed it 399 and I can't
see why anyone with a computer that
could handle the extra graphics
horsepower the rift needs wouldn't just
get that instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
