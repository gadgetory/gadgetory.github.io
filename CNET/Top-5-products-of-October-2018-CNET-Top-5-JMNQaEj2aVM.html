readers checked out during October of
2018 you guys are definitely researching
phones heavily although I was seriously
not expecting what ended up being number
five what are we waiting for let's get
to it coming in at number five are the
Microsoft Surface headphones yeah you
heard me right
Microsoft's new 350 dollar headphones
piqued your curiosity each of the ear
cups has an integrated dial because
wheels are the future the right dial
controls the volume the left handles the
amount of noise cancellation there are
also touch controls if you like tapping
your noggin to skip music tracks or
answer calls on top of that you can call
up Cortana any time by saying hey
Cortana the headphones are always
listening to you at number four is the
only Samsung device on this list the
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 this thing is a
beast with a six point four inch screen
dual 12 megapixel cameras on the back
and it starts with 128 gigabytes of
storage and 6 gigs of RAM max it out to
get 512 gigs of internal storage along
with 8 gigabytes of RAM the s-pen got an
upgrade it's still a stylus but it
gained remote functions using bluetooth
the button on the stylus can be used to
call up different tasks the big battery
of the note 9 charges the s-pen - this
was not the only Android phone that you
guys were checking out the LGV 40 thin
cube comes in third place its gimmick is
plenty of cameras three on the back two
on the front here's the breakdown on the
rear cameras a 12 megapixel standard
lens a 16 megapixel wide-angle and a 12
megapixel telephoto with a 2x zoom with
all those cameras the v40 thinkyou has
lots of camera tricks like portrait
effects taking three pictures at once
and creating cinemagraphs
this LG also has a dedicated google
assisted shortcut button
speaking of Google the Google pixel 3
grabbed your attention this is the
smaller pixel without the knotch
as with previous pixels this latest one
has a great camera
it handles low-light very well and has
steady video those fancy portrait
pictures look good too on the front
there are two cameras a wide-angle lens
lets you get more people in your group
selfies although your arm might look a
little warped
there's no dedicated google assist
button but you can squeeze the sides to
bring up assistant the pixel also has a
call screening feature so you can avoid
talking to those humans and the device
you check out the most in the month of
October is a Lenovo mix 520 it's very
similar to the surface pro with a
kickstand it has a magnetic keyboard and
a pen okay I was kidding that was
actually number 1001 and number one is
the iPhone 10 are it's the most
affordable of the iPhone 10 models so it
makes a lot of sense why people are
curious about it it's very similar to
the other iPhone 10s models the 10r
has face ID like the others a bezel
that's a little bit bigger and a 6.1
inch screen let's talk about that screen
it's an LCD the black levels on the 10r
are not as deep as the OLED panels on
the s and max but they're pretty damn
good on the back is just one camera the
good news is it takes great photos
portrait mode is a little different here
because it's handled in software the 10r
also comes in colors if you like that
kind of thing
that does it for us can you just tell me
what your favorite non phone gadget is
I'm really curious I'm Maya's AK tire
and I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
