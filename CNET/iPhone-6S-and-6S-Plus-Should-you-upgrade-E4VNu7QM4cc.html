6s and 6s plus are in the wild and you
smartphone shopper have a choice to make
do you get one and if so which I've been
living with both of these phones for a
week and yes apples made a ton of
changes under the hood obviously it's
one of the best phones on the planet but
what's made the biggest difference to me
well here are some of the most
interesting things that I've noticed
faster touch ID I use touch ID for lots
of stuff now mainly unlocking my phone
Apple's not kidding the touch ID is
faster in fact it's so fast that I
usually can't even see my lockscreen
it feels instant speed speed speed yes
there's a faster a9 processor inside but
the speed really comes through when
you're switching apps jumping back and
forth to do things the new phones
remember older apps better thanks to
having more RAM Netflix games Safari
back again easy always-on Siri it really
is always on when driving I tried asking
for directions at home I asked about the
weather I set reminders alarms I played
music sure that's out there in a lot of
phones and it's not exactly like having
an Amazon echo but the days of always
listening devices are here and they're
more useful than ever
Siri doesn't always listen or respond
but it's fun for playing hide and seek
or finding where you lost your phone 3d
touch bit of a soft sell eventually 3d
touch will probably be in every touch
screen Apple makes and others will
develop competitors too it's a really
cool idea with a huge upside you're
pressing into the screen but it doesn't
live up to its full potential right now
iOS has peekaboo previews that can pop
out into new apps little pop-up menus
from your home screen but I want even
more right now it's clever sometimes
it's useful but I don't always use it
better cameras are always welcome we're
still not at the age of perfect
smartphone cameras but they keep making
huge strides I took photos and videos
everywhere tailgating at a Jets game at
a farmers market shooting selfies in the
dark the iPhone 6 had a great set of
cameras the 6s rear cameras
a bit better but the selfies are miles
better and the new built-in flash works
really well live photos are like gifts
of audio they can feel like little
motion memories but until Twitter
Facebook and all the other apps let you
share them I'm not sure what I'm gonna
do with them at least they're there as a
backup in case I forgot to shoot any
videos which is most of the time should
you upgrade it's a similar feeling phone
to last year's six for most cases and if
you have one of those you don't really
need one of these yet unless you're in a
plan that's already set you up to get a
new phone in which case go for it
there's enough that's new here to easily
justify $100 price difference versus
last year's phones just don't expect a
lot of obvious changes that are gonna
feel that different in everyday normal
use and 6s or 6s plus I get asked this
all the time
I like the features of the plus a lot
more battery bigger screen stabilization
for clearer photos smoother video but I
don't like the size I wish the regular
success at some of these features I'd
say go with the success unless you're a
pro user then find bigger pants
I'm Scott Stein and those are my
thoughts on the 6s and the 6s plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
