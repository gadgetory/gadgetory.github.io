kind that are based on Wi-Fi offer many
benefits over Bluetooth and they usually
cost about the same firstly your battery
will last longer as the speaker makes a
direct connection with the streaming
service and not your phone you can even
turn your phone off and the music will
keep playing secondly you won't get
interrupted by phone calls text messages
or other random alerts coming through
the speaker thirdly Wi-Fi speakers offer
both better sound quality and the
ability to listen in more than one room
at once if you're looking to buy a Wi-Fi
speaker these are four things you'll
need to consider first what are you
using the speaker for if you just need
it for background music then you don't
need to spend very much between 150 and
200 dollars we'll get you a speaker that
will sit on your kitchen counter stream
internet music and sound quite decent
but if you want something that will
double as your main stereo look at
adding a streaming dongle such as the
chromecast audio to your existing system
one box speakers are great for dorm
rooms but not as good for a living room
secondly there are many different
standards and if you want to play in
multiple rooms you'll need to get
speakers that will work together Sonos
is the most recognizable brand but it
does require you to use a new app the
same goes for play-fi speakers but if
you have an Android phone a chromecast
built-in system is best and lets you use
your existing apps and just tap the cast
button to play music meanwhile for iOS
users an Apple AirPlay system may also
work thirdly which streaming services do
you use most speakers will do spotify
connect
pandora and streaming from your phone
but it's best to check your favorite
services supported by the system before
you buy lastly if you're doing multi
room music how many different listening
zones do you want most households will
probably want at least three kitchen
living room and bedroom while there is
seemingly a lot to know about Wi-Fi
speakers in the end it's pretty easy and
sticking with one brand usually helps
and with the release of the chromecast
Audio it doesn't even cost a lot once
you go Wi-Fi you won't look back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
