smartphones out there and at 350 bucks
it's a real steal I'm Dan Graziano and
I'm going to share with you some tips
that will make you a nexus 5 all-star
Google really emphasized camera
performance with the Nexus 5
it features an 8 megapixel rear camera
with optical image stabilization early
performance was shaky but an update to
Android 4.4 to fix most of these
problems so be sure you're running the
latest version of Android but did you
know there's also a new feature that
promises even better looking pictures
while in the camera app click the circle
icon next to shutter and select hdr+
this feature promises to deliver more
vivid photos during the day and sharper
ones at night you can actually take
photos by tapping either the volume up
or volume down button or simply using
the shutter icon on most devices widgets
are found in the app drawer but with the
Nexus 5 that can be edited with a long
press on the home screen to enable
widgets on your phone's lock screen go
to settings enter security and select
enable widgets make sure you never miss
the notification by enabling the phone's
RGB notification light this can be done
by going to settings selecting display
and choosing pulse notification light
the light can then be customized with an
app like light flow which is available
on the Play Store
google recently added SMS support to
hangouts and made it the default
messaging app in Android 4.4 however you
can still download an alternative app
from Google Play once you've done so
enter settings click more select the
fault SMS option and choose the app you
would like to use the Nexus 5 is a
completely revamped dialer the top
search bar can be used not only to
search for contacts but also local
businesses for example typing in pizza
will reveal the numbers for nearby
pizzerias the phone also includes an
advanced caller ID feature that will
display the names of people and
businesses that aren't in your contacts
if for some reason you aren't interested
in these features they can be disabled
by clicking the three icon in the lower
right hand corner of the phone app
selecting setting
and clicking either the caller ID or
nearby places option and there you have
it you are now in Nexus 5 all-star like
always feel free to reach out to me on
Twitter with questions comments or to
share some of your own tips I'm Dan
