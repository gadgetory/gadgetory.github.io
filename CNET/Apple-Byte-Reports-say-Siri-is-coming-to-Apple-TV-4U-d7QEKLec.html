welcome to the Apple by for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
let's get to it and Apple still hasn't
released a new product in 2014 which
points to a bonkers second half of the
year but while we wait new code
appearing in iOS 7.1 points to Apple
working on Cirie voice input on the next
Apple TV now if you look at this image
from nine to five Mac assistant is
Apple's internal name for Siri and the
number three represents the Apple TV
family where one m2r for the iphone ipod
touch and ipad families now this new
info suggests voice input and feedback
will most likely be included in the next
Apple TV model but it also looks like
Syria may not be coming to the current
gen apple tvs also Amazons fire TV has
voice search that works pretty nicely an
apple would potentially be the second
streaming box with this functionality
but I'm pretty sure a gary busey isn't
at the top of their list for celebrity
reps if you're like me you're like
talking to things
that's just disturbing and a quick Apple
TV update more content has been added
with the addition of A&amp;amp;E the history
channel and lifetime you'll still need
to be a cable subscriber but you'll be
able to catch up on episodes you've
missed from shows like Dance Moms or
let's see there's wife swap or devious
maids or mission makeover but um I've
never actually watched any of those
great shows all right the iWatch is
another toy plenty of you are waiting to
see I may not want it right now but I'm
really curious the big a has registered
trademarks on the iWatch name in several
countries but now macrumors has found
that the fruit company has been
bolstering its trademark on the actual
name Apple to also cover jewelry and
watches trademarks are broken into 45
different classes watches and jewelry
are part of class 14 that covers
precious metals and stones and in
general covers jewelry clocks and
watches now Apple wants to bring that
bling but gamma goes I bling stan is not
one of those products in fact I actually
searched for I bling just to see if
anything existing yeah it does that
thing is so ugly and it's just begging
for a bad apple and if you own one of
those I'm blocking you from the show
alright apple announced their earnings
this week for the first calendar quarter
in the second fiscal quarter of 2014 the
big a beat estimates posting revenue of
forty five point six billion dollars and
in that quarterly profit of ten point
two billion besting the forty three
point six billion in revenue and net
quarterly profit of 9.5 billion from the
same quarter last year now iphone sales
were up forty three point seven million
units compared to 37.4 a year ago but i
pads were down 16 point 35 million
compared to 19.5 in the previous year so
maybe now Carl Icahn can stop his
whining in public in you know it looks
like he will after this tweet but bottom
line everyone gets paid all right in the
latest iphone 6 rumors and news taiwan's
industrial and commercial times reports
that apple's 5.5 inch iphone 6 has been
delayed and will launch in 2015 previous
rumors have pointed to potentially two
new iphone 6 screen sizes 4.7 and the 5
inch plus size the report says apolis
to find a sufficient battery that
measures two millimeters or less to fit
in the devices super thin profile now
the report also says parts suppliers are
referring to it as the iphone air but
that's not the official name yet and a
pass Reuters report also claimed the
larger 5.5 inch next-gen phone was
having production issues with its
display that was also causing delays at
the time and did you guys notice how
many concept images we use to cover
story about a product that hasn't been
announced has no release date doesn't
exist yet but feels very real and check
out these latest renderings from Martin
Hajek based on the latest schematics and
iphone 6 case leaks let's keep it real
this thing is going to have a bigger
screen faster a processor touch ID and a
better camera the lines for this thing
are going to be ten times longer than
the lines for the nike air yeezy
foamposites and i know one of you is
doing a google search right now alright
I've said it plenty of times on the show
but the next big transformative change
for the smartphone in my mind at least
here in the US is making it a true
digital wallet that works everywhere and
touch ID is the first piece to get us
there now still early in the process but
according to recode Apple is
interviewing senior payments industry
executives to take on roles with the
company to push ahead with their plan to
build an electronics payments business
now using the over 600 million itunes
accounts as the foundation Apple is
looking at ways to make it easier for
people to buy products in apps and on
the web using their iPhones and they're
also working on making purchases in
physical retail stores with iPhones as
well Tim Cook has publicly said mobile
payments was one of the thoughts behind
touch ID but you know what it's still a
long ways before we see anything like
this as a real service we're probably at
least one or two years away and I'll
remind you again the tech has been
around in Japan over about 10 years now
10 they had this tech on their flip
phones now let's get to the quick bites
Apple recently released an update for OS
7.1 point one that brings more
improvements to touch ID keyboard bug
fixes and security updates and this one
is a good one if you're curious about
what Apple is cooking with OS 10 they
are now letting anyone with an Apple ID
to test out OS 10 beta builds previously
you had to be
part of their paid developer program but
not anymore so the latest OS 10 10 point
9.3 build was released recently and you
can sign up here for their beta seed
program alright that's going to do it
for this week's show send me your email
to the Apple by to cnet com or tweet me
at brian Tong thanks so much for
watching I will catch you guys next week
for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
