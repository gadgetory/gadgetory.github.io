there's wine there's cheese there are
cute little appetizers this is not just
an ordinary conference here at leweb and
it's not just about coming to Paris to
eat and drink the future of technology
is being discussed here and the trend is
as always all connected all the time the
concept here at leweb 2012 and the
electronics world in general is the
Internet of Things as smart thing CTO
Jeff Hagen's put it on stage the entire
world is becoming programmable this
conference is about showing off some of
those programmable things so I'm going
to actually use the smartthings app
which everybody here at leweb can see
let's actually turn on the Christmas
lights from here there we go so that
looks great Jessie but I think it'll
look even better if I turned off the
overhead lights so I'm going to do that
as well as you can see this is so much
more than just like a remote control
ball this is a robotic gaming system I
must have been tired to a story know
where we make the Nest Learning
Thermostat it basically it's a
thermostat but redesigned totally to be
connected to the internet and to provide
new functions and features to provide
the best comfort but energy savings as
well and it can really bring those
features only through being an
internet-connected device oh we're going
on a date so I'm taking to a restaurant
and I can see the restaurant menu here
so I can select my item that I want to
order okay
and order some frozen solid a yeah and I
can order some champagne as well and
then yeah I think yeah debate orbiter to
davido's quickly this is the best
service we're going to happen oh come on
give me 10 minutes you in the future are
connected devices will in theory let us
live lives that are more convenient and
much more personalized we can connect
the real world on the internet and you
walk into a retail shop and they know
what sizes you have they know what you
like they know what not to show you you
will have a better shopping experience
and that's about taking frictional and
actually making retailers do what they
do best which is giving you a good
customer service now we can take all the
friction of paying out to that which is
what we're showing here it's even better
experience so they need to carry my
wallet full of loyalty cards vouchers
coupons credit cards I just walk in you
know it's me and today we're talking
mostly about phones and tablets in the
future who knows what devices will
communicate with each other and what
those devices will look like but
increasingly we won't just have one two
three four screens around us will
actually have 10 20 30 40 things that we
have around us on us smaller things
lighter things closer to the body that
also have sensors but they won't be the
full purpose multi-purpose they won't do
a hundred things they'll do a few things
really really well we're device agnostic
so you know moment everything's mobile
mobile because frankly they're cool and
very easy to work with but in the future
you'll be talking to TV or moon and we
might even get the internet fridge maybe
but everything that's on the internet
everything is connected by IP can do
eh PA system say everything from your
home appliances to the scale in your
bathroom at paris-based winning it's all
about using your data to help yourself
so this scale can work both in Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth in this case we are just in in
bluetooth so yes it just arrived now so
this is the last measurement time it's
75 dot something kilogram and so it will
be added maker you can see it Wow so for
example it's my white girl for the last
four years and you see there is a
periodic variation during summer animal
December not everyone is convinced that
every device needs to be connected
though or that all of these connections
are coming anytime soon I think that if
you look at it there are only certain
devices that shouldn't you should and
could be connected to the internet but
those things take time for the customers
that to adapt to and to understand now
you said only something should be
connected what kinds of things do you
think should not be connected to well
you look at a lot of things does your
stove need to be connected really it
absolutely needs to be painting to text
it and tell it to turn on cuz I'm making
dinner for a party exactly but it was
dinner in the stove no but it's free
heating yeah the preheating is not a bad
thing do you need a toilet to be
connected to the to the Internet maybe
for health reasons maybe maybe but the
question is not remember my implants I
mean all those really I'm gonna bring it
on camp well I'll let you be dere an
adapter I will wait how close are we to
using them to this this kind of pipe
dream of me that really truly connected
internet of things I think we're farther
away than people think I mean there are
more smart devices on the plan today
than there are humans so in terms of the
devices that are there everywhere but
but having them all connect together and
work on might be happy know people talk
about hey I want my stuff everywhere
look if you buy a Windows Phone you buy
windows pc and windows tablet you can
get it across those the refrigerator
that's a different story you know I
might have to work with the home
automation people in terms of how back
you know even if the data is in the
cloud it's another device so i think
we're closer than we've ever been i
think it's a journey and I think we're
you know part way down that journey and
it'll continue to go forward so it's not
next year all of a sudden magic or is it
connecting the world in a seamless easy
and personal way is tricky yes it
involves companies working together
radical new device and interface designs
and there will be serious privacy and
security hurdles to overcome but that
doesn't mean you can't get a glimpse
into the future and your own mind today
so the muse is a force sensor brainwave
headband it's actually able to sense
your brain activity and give you
feedback so that you can play games
directly with your mind as well as
improve your mental abilities in the far
future this is going to be a tool that
allows you to do things like control the
lighting in your home or your automated
phone system or your you know your phone
system your phone or your home system or
your car directly with your mind so the
long-term future is actually allowing us
to interact with devices in the world in
really smart ways that are able to
support you because they know something
about you we really like a far future do
you mean far far because I'm kind of
excited about that how far are we
talking I mean you would have thought
that a mind-control headset of any form
would be science fiction even a few
years ago and I think there are people
who think that now right who would hear
that thing with a kitty
you know so we're already in an exciting
future we are already in the future I
love it I love it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
