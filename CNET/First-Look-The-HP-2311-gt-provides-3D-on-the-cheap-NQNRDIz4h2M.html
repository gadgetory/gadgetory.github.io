provides a very basic 3d experience
probably the most basic and cheapest way
to get a 3d experience this side of an
$18 movie ticket hi I'm Eric Franklin
and today I'll be taking a first look at
the HP 2311 GT the GT is kind of like
the 3d version of the 2311 X I reviewed
a few months back
besides tilt there's no herbal options
like swivel or height adjustment but
honestly you wouldn't really expect to
see these on a monitor like this
connections include DVI HDMI and VGA and
they're really easy to get to I can't
really say enough about this recent
trend of making these really easy to
access connections vendors please
continue to do this the OSD has controls
for brightness contrast sharpness and
red green and blue color options movies
look fine but seem to have a slight
green push to them non 3d games look
fine as well but the colors don't pop
the way I usually like and look a little
bland
now the monitor uses passive 3d as
opposed to the more expensive but
usually more convincing active shutter
3d technique in my limited exposure to
the GT the 3d works you'll have to sit
about three feet away from the screen
but it does work and is actually pretty
convincing and 260 bucks the GT is the
cheapest way to get 3d on a monitor it's
not the best 3d you're gonna see and
it's probably not even the second-best
3d but it does give you what it says
it's going to which is 3d check out my
full written review for more details
once again this is Eric Franklin and
this has been the first look at the HP
2311 GT</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
