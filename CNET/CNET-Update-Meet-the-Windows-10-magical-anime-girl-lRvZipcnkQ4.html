I'm Bridget Carey this is your CNET
update now that the free Windows 10
update has arrived there's still one
very important question that Microsoft
has not answered and that is what's the
name of the Windows 10 magical anime
girl allow me to explain you see it's a
tradition for Microsoft to create an
anime schoolgirl character to represent
each version of Windows think of it as a
cartoon mascot you'll find these
characters used in marketing and in ads
in Japan as well as Singapore and Taiwan
with Windows 7 there was Madhavi Nanami
Windows 8 was represented by the twins
modo be you and I for the two different
versions of Windows 8 and this girl with
white and light blue hair she's the
personification of Windows 10 there's a
contest for fans to give her a name she
has a backstory she's 17 years old and
is visiting from a hundred years in the
future
so I guess Windows 10 is going to be
around for a long long time
in 2013 we met Inori Izawa the
personification of Internet Explorer in
a cartoon promoting the browser she
defends the world from the evils of
Internet malware but in Windows 10 there
is no Internet Explorer it's a new
browser program called windows edge so
what happens to all these outdated
magical anime operating system girls
maybe they all live together in the
retirement home of 1995's Microsoft Bob
well Google may not have anime mascots
but Android does have some new tricks
Google search can answer many questions
for you but now it can also tell you
when a store or restaurant is the most
crowded if you search for a store you
just go to the summary of details and
you can scroll through trends of when
it's the most busy by hours and days of
the week Google does this all with
location data it collects from users
it's similar to how it tracks traffic
congestion on the roads and over at
Amazon the company can now keep track of
how often you need toilet paper with -
buttons they're now on sale - all Prime
members for $5 a button these branded
wireless buttons can be put anywhere in
the home and when you press the button
you're telling
Amazon to order more of that item so it
can be helpful if you see you're running
low and you don't want to run to the
store you'll get an alert on your phone
to cancel if you made a mistake and if
there's a kid in the house going on a
button-pressing spree with twenty clicks
it's not going to order twenty items
it'll only order it once and it won't
respond to other clicks until the items
delivered I did order a few of these
buttons so I'll let you know later how
it works out that's it for this tech
