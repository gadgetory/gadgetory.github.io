gonna look at Apple's new Mac Mini so
this is the $7.99 Mac Mini config but it
also has a $250 upgrade to Apple's new
fusion drive so that means this is a
quad core Core i7 Mac with 4 gigs of RAM
in a terabyte hard drive as well as 128
gigabytes solid-state drive now aside
from the fusion drive there's actually
not that much different about this new
Mac from the last version does have
Intel's most recent Ivy Bridge CPUs in
here so that's nice you get a good speed
benefit and Apple has also brought core
i7 down here when before you could only
get Core i5 at least in the non server
models otherwise though the system is
basically identical on the outside
there's still no optical drive so apples
sticking with that no surprise there and
on the back the ports are exactly the
same you've got power
Ethernet firewire 800 HDMI Thunderbolt 4
USB ports audio in and headphone out you
also have the SDXC card slot now there
are actually some interesting things
here now these are USB 3 ports not USB 2
so it's a lot faster than the previous
version and that's nice the Mac Mini
also know has some ports that you won't
find on the new iMac specifically the
firewire 800 and the 2 audio ports
there's only a single audio port in the
new iMac but the big technical
difference of the system really is the
fusion drive so what that is essentially
is a way to give you all the speed
benefits of a solid-state hard drive as
well as all the big storage volume
benefits of a standard Drive now there
are some other similar hybrid hard
drives out there that work in a similar
way but the way Apple has it set up is
that it's really kind of a seamless
process with fusion the idea is that
fusion will automatically speed up
access to your files that you use most
frequently I found in our testing that
it actually works pretty well especially
with file rights file reads are a little
bit harder to tell apps like Photoshop
and certain games have characteristics
that get in the way of the file system
and make it more than just about load
speed there's CPU calculation and stuff
that goes on in the background
so if usually can't always be as
effective as maybe you want it to it's
also kind of a pricey upgrade it costs
250 bucks and it pushes the $70.99
config up 2049 dollars that's pretty
expensive for a Mac that's generally
considered to be a budget priced option
overall though I know that there's a
passionate niche of Mac Mini fans out
there and they tend to find all kinds of
creative uses for the system and I
expect it will certainly appreciate
faster drive access even if you don't
opt for fusion the core i7 chip provides
a nice speed boost and makes this
actually pretty competitive compared to
Windows PCs in the same price range of
course it also has apples hallmark
attention to design and this is still
one most attractive pcs out there so
overall Apple has improved the value of
the Mac Mini as well as the general
appeal thanks to its faster performance
fusion drive is also a nice touch for
the enthusiast who might want it
turmeric Brown this is Apple's new Mac
