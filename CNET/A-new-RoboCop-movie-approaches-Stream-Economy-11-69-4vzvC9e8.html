you where to invest your fan time across
movies TV shows and games there's huge
news this week in movies guys we got to
kick things off with a new Robocop movie
earlier this week MGM announced it was
developing a brand new Robocop movie set
for release in 2020 and none other than
district 9 director Neill Blomkamp would
be helming it there's an important
question to be answered here and that is
can Neill Blomkamp deliver a good
Robocop movie now first I thought the
answer that question was so obviously
yes because district 9 was freaking
amazing but then I started thinking
about it and I started remembering a
couple things and now I'm a little tiny
bit worried because Neill Blomkamp has a
habit of not delivering on high concept
blockbusters so the last two movies that
he's made since district 9 the feature
films that he's made have been Elysium
which didn't really light anybody's
world on fire and chappie chappie
so not exactly homeruns
but then there are an equal amount of
movies including the live-action Halo
film that was supposed to get made and
the alien movie he was supposed to do
that didn't end up making it to the
silver screen such a disappointment so
these things make me a little bit
worried that this outing is gonna be a
miss the 2014 Robocop remake with Joel
Kinnaman was pretty subpar so I think
you can officially skip that but you
should definitely watch the 1987
original which was awesome after that
2014 remake MGM and Neill Blomkamp have
a little bit of an uphill battle here
but let's hope the directors up to the
challenge
you Blom campers out there tell me why
I'm wrong in the comments it's fine you
can fight me over in gaming overwatch
League kicked off its inaugural playoff
season and announced a massive broadcast
partner freaking Disney Blizzard and
Disney have signed an exclusive
multi-year deal to broadcast some of
this season's playoff matches and the
grand finals along with overwatch League
season 2 is this good news for eSports
fans and eSports as a whole yes
obviously
a hundred percent overwatch is amazing
in fact producer Logan and I love it we
play it all the time but I did give the
overwatch league a report card a while
back over on CNET and I said that the
one thing that it really struggled with
was accessibility because the only way
to watch overwatch League is on the
twitch app or you have to go over to or
watch League calm and watch games
through there so watching it all day
long like you would any traditional
sports like football for example it was
really kind of annoying now if I want to
watch overwatch League all day on my TV
that's gonna happen because this deal
means that overwatch League is gonna be
broadcast on Disney XD it's gonna be on
ESPN espn2 and even network television
ABC that is super exciting for anybody
who loves eSports it doesn't matter what
eSport you're into now there is a door
that is open where other eSports can get
involved and maybe find themselves on
network television where an even bigger
audience can be found so this is awesome
news they're gonna have the grand finals
broadcast on network television which I
never thought I'd see in my lifetime cuz
I'm a nerd and on top of that honestly I
think it's just really good for
everybody so high fives guys can't wait
to watch alright let's talk about TV
News specifically the adaptation of Y
the last man FX just announced its cast
and it's really exciting FX announced
the initial cast for why the last man a
super popular and well-loved graphic
novel that's getting the TV treatment
Diane Lane Barry Keegan Imogen Poots
leshawna Lynch Juliana Canfield and
Marin Ireland will round out the cast so
what do I think about this cast well I
think it's awesome because these are a
combination of veteran actors and fresh
faces and I really think they're going
to make everything about Y last man pop
on your small 75 inch television so on
top of that white last man if you
haven't read it is a 60 issue graphic
novel from the mind of comic book icon
Bryan cave on the sky is a genius he
made saga he made paper
girls I mean this guy is an absolutely
incredible writer and white last man is
full of rich storylines and drama that
will be perfect for television so who is
show running this thing that's always a
question that I would like to know and
I'm excited to say that the show runners
for y the last man are going to be
American Gods showrunner Michael Greene
and he will be Co show running with item
a shock accrual who used to be a writer
producer on Luke Cage and Jessica Jones
like this woman knows her stuff so I
think it's in really good hands on top
of that Michael Green has said that the
series itself will be finite it will be
finite so fans don't feel like it'll
ever get stale unlike some other shows
based on graphic novels
yes Walking Dead I'm looking at you
right there I'm looking at you looking
at you
so I'm really excited about this I feel
super confident if you are a huge white
last man fan I would love to hear what
your most anticipated scenes or
sequences in the graphic novel that you
want to see come to life in the show
down in the comments so hit that now
lastly my friends we have to talk about
the World Cup and to do that there's
only one man who could do it
and that's mark Saros woke up why why
jump the end
nema stop roll it away I'm coming I'm
coming name our slogan Dyneema no no no
I need a little cup of my boy diri the
World Cup that's why that's my woman
fuck that's all we could afford the
morning followed by canceling its
overtime again let's go in Buffy I'm
popping a fever you are you're part of
