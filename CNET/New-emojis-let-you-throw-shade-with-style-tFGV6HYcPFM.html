the internet is getting way too giddy
just think about all the new ways to
throw shade with a smiley face later
this year we could be telling friends to
shut up with a smile or share a spew
with disgust question logic with a co
bare brow or get offended with a fancy
monocle but none of this is official yet
you see in June a new batch of emoji are
said to be approved by the Unicode
consortium
that's the governing body of the emoji
world and more than 50 of these are
currently being proposed including some
fantastical ones like merpeople fairies
vampires and elves hello Legolas the
folks at emoji pedia stirred up all the
excitement by making some sample art of
what these icons could look like and
once approved tech companies like Apple
and Google have to make their own art
and add the emoji to their various
platforms and only until that happens
will we get to send dinosaurs hedgehogs
orange hearts and get naked with a spoon
yeah that's supposed to be a sauna
people emojis may also better represent
different people in the list is a woman
with a job a bearded man gender-neutral
adults and even a breastfeeding mama but
it's not until June that these will even
be given the green light and it'll be
even longer before it hits your keyboard
I know you want to use that curling
stone now but you'll just have to wait
