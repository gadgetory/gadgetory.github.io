won't run your Windows or Mac apps don't
call me crazy until you've seen the new
pixel book from Google it's seriously
stunning with a frame that's just ten
millimeters thin and portable at 2.2
pounds or just one kilogram heavy the
aluminum chassis is beautiful and these
silicone palm rests feel nice underneath
my hands the touchpad and keyboard a
staple of the Chromebook pixel before
this one are excellent as well in a
brief test I was able to do some very
rapid accurate typing on the keyboard
and I want to say the touchpad is as
good or better than the MacBook Pros
I've tested again you're not going to be
able to use your Mac or Windows s
because this runs Chrome OS Google's
operating system that mostly consists of
the Chrome web browser and a selection
of Android applications and if you flip
over the twelve point three inch
touchscreen you can put in a tablet
configuration there's even an optional
$99 stylus that was developed in
collaboration with Wacom that has
extremely low latency they say it's down
to just 10 milliseconds on this
pressure-sensitive pen so far everything
I've told you about something you could
probably find on a Windows machine if
you looked hard but there are some
Google exclusive features as well
there's the Google assistant button a
dedicated button on the keyboard to
summon the voice assistant so you can
ask it things you might ask your phone
or Google home and there are a pair of
USB sea ports on either side of the
laptop so you can charge with either of
them the laptop box starts with a core
i5 processor 8 gigabytes of RAM and 128
gigs of storage at the $9.99 dollar mark
and can be configured up to a core i7
512 gigabytes of storage and 16 gigs of
RAM this device is on pre-order now
it'll be available in the US UK and
Canada and it's expected in stores at
the end of October</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
