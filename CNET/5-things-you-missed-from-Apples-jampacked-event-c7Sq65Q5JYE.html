iPhone the iPhone 6s and 6s plus can
both shoot 4k video but you probably
knew that what you might have missed was
that the new Apple TV coming out at the
end of October won't actually be able to
stream that 4k video we're still
scratching our heads about that one if
you want to upgrade to the new iPhones
but don't want to spend upwards of six
hundred and fifty dollars at once Apple
is offering its own payment plan it's
called the iphone upgrade program plans
start at about thirty two dollars a
month plus you can upgrade your phone
after a year oh hey there's a new iPad
Mini it has a Retina display that fast
a8 processor and it's only point 65
pounds basically it's a smaller iPad air
2 there's good news for bargain shoppers
the iphone 6 and 6 plus are now one
hundred dollars cheaper and the iPhone
5s is free but there is just one catch
gold is gone if you want your iPhone to
rock gold or rose gold bling you're
going to have to get the 6s or 6s plus
finally the iPad pro has a stylus or
pencil as Apple's calling it in 2007
Steve Jobs famously said who wants a
stylus you have to get them and put them
away you lose them about that um where
exactly does the stylus go short of
stowing it in your purse or man purse
there isn't an obvious place to safely
store the ipad pencil stylus and yes it
is a stylus you've been granted
permission to call it what it is it's
called Apple pencil
