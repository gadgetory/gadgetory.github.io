encountered had OnStar famous for crash
notification stolen vehicle slowed down
and unlocking your car when the keys are
in it made driving seem kind of scary
but today connected car tech OnStar
included does much happier things
to remember them just spell CNET c is
for communication that used to mean just
hands-free calling
now you can get text messages displayed
or even read to you where are you send
back a reply with a push of a button I'm
running a little bit late I better let
them know there's Twitter in the dash
Facebook and Yelp reviews clearly your
car isn't the quiet refuge it once was
n is for navigation GPS powered
turn-by-turn maps those are almost a
given now but add in live internet
search to find your destination
satellite view of the map itself and
when you find the destination on your
computer no need to jot it down just
send it to your connected car e is for
entertainment streaming audio from
Pandora MOG Spotify tune in and others
either replace broadcast radio or just
do it one better built into the dash or
streamed wirelessly from your phone and
streaming video in the backseat seems a
lot more promising than those dumb DVD
systems and t is for telematics remotely
locate start block charge your car even
set boundaries for where and how fast it
should be driven by your kid all from a
phone app in many cases
now at this point you may be thinking so
many ways to die distraction is where
one more piece of connected car tech
will come into play
that's autonomy self-driving cars that
can communicate with each other pavement
sensors smart traffic lights and data
centers to do all the tedious driving
that is probably 90% of all your time
behind the wheel
that's why cars get connected how they
do it comes in a couple flavors first
tethered very common this is where your
smartphone and its 3G connection are the
bridge between your car and the Internet
Toyota's Entune system is just one
example but there's also integrated much
less common but growing out E and BMW
we're the pioneers in actually building
3G connectivity into the car
no phone needed and GM just announced it
will build 4G into most of its 2015 cars
to provide a fast connection for the
services in the dash as well as create a
Wi-Fi hotspot in the car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
