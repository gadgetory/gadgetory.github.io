motorola moto g a cheap phone that
doesn't look like it this is an android
4.4 handset now this is not the same
Moto G that we've seen before this is
actually like the third generation at
this point looks a lot more like the
original moto x it's got a 5-inch screen
720p HD display not the highest
resolution but it still looks pretty
crisp and bright what I like about this
phone is they hand held feel and so I've
got a blue cover on this one there are
actually 15 different shades that you
can choose from just pop it off and pop
in another one to add some more
character it's got that signature divot
at the back which is really nice or
holding it got a place to put your
finger but be careful because you don't
want to stick your finger over the
camera lens now there is a curve to this
phone so it fits pretty well into your
palm it doesn't fit quite as well into
pockets as smaller phones but I think in
terms of size and comfort it definitely
hits that Motorola sweet spot now as
from specs we've got an 8 megapixel
camera on the back with a flash image
quality is a lot better than you'll see
on other cheek bones but there were a
few problems for example colors just
weren't as rich as they are in real life
inside you've got a 1.2 gigahertz of
Paul calm Snapdragon 400 processor it
was pretty fast unfortunately you only
have 4G HSPA+ speeds on here there is no
LTE there are also 8 and 16 gigabyte
options with some room for expandable
memory so this phone gives you quite a
lot for quite a little and I'm
definitely a fan I'm Jessica Valcourt

cons and see the photos at cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
