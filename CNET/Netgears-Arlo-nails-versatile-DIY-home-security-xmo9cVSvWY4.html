I'm Megan bulletin for scenic appliances
here with the Netgear Arlo
this is a three hundred and fifty dollar
home security camera kit that comes with
this Netgear hub and two cameras each
additional camera costs one hundred and
sixty bucks right off the bat you'll
notice something interesting about these
cameras they are not tethered to a power
cord that means that you can put these
things pretty much anywhere including
outside up to 300 feet now Netgear says
300 feet but I started to see some lag
time around 150 so it'll maybe depending
on your Wi-Fi connection but overall I
have nothing but good things to say
about this system it has 720p it has
night vision you can set schedules it
has motion related alerts so you can get
push and email notifications and it
works really well it's responsive and
it's so versatile it actually has this
magnetic backing so you can stick it to
something that's magnetic or you can use
the magnetic mounts that come with it
to adjust the angles as you like set up
was also really easy with this thing I
don't really fancy a big square plastic
box next to my router especially because
my router is centrally located in my
living room but it's kind of a necessity
because this is what provides the
constant connection that allows these
things to be several feet away up to
several hundred feet away one thing I'd
also be looking for with this kind of
hub set up is third party connectivity
and while that isn't an option right now
Netgear did say that ZigBee and z-wave
integrations could be a thing that's
happening in the future so stay tuned
for that one thing these don't have that
I kind of wish they did is audio so
there's no audio trigger if it hears
sound it won't start to record and
there's no two-way talk function
but these are really really good sort of
unobtrusive cameras that you can place
pretty much anywhere in and around your
house to optimize your security thanks

Netgear Arlo be sure to check out the
