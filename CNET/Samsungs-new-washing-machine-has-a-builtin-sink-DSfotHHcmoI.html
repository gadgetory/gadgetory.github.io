CES 2015 we're at Samsung's stand taking
look at the Samsung active wash it's a
washing machine with a built-in sink so
the big question is why would you want
to sink in your washing machine well the
thing to note is that this sink isn't
really for food preparation so you won't
be washing vegetables in it or anything
like that
in fact it's for clothes so you would
use this to pretreat or hand wash which
is something that's good for your
delicate clothes you can see that the
sink itself is designed for exactly that
it's got all these rough lines here for
scrubbing your clothes and there are two
holes in it so you don't have to worry
about water overflowing the sink has a 1
cubic foot capacity and water comes in
through this hose here as for the
washing machine itself samsung says this
has super-speeds technology now what
that means is samsung claims you'll be
able to do a full wash cycle in 36
minutes there's no price information yet
but this thing's coming out in spring
2015 so we won't have too long to wait
for a little more information would you
use this and what do you think of it let
me know and check out cnet.com / - yes
for much much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
