checking out the samsung galaxy s4 zoom
now when you look at the phone from the
front it looks basically like an s4 you
got very similar stylings and a 4.3 inch
screen turn it round though and you can
see it looks a lot like a standard
compact digital camera you got the
chunky hand grip on the side over here
and of course its enormous lens barrel
on the other side now that lens provides
a 10 times optical zoom making the s4
zoo the only smartphone with an optical
zoom built in all that camera kit does
of course bulk out the phone it's a lot
fatter and heading the standard s4 so
won't appeal if you just want a camera
focus line into your jeans it's got a 16
megapixel CMOS sensor which is
physically bigger than what you'd find
in normal smartphones which allowed to
take in more light therefore giving
better image quality at least that's the
idea having to take any test shots yet
so we'll have to see what it can really
do as a phone it might be a bit
disappointing for those of you wanting a
fully fledged s4 the screen only has a
960 x 540 pixel display just a big step
down for the full HD resolution of the
actual s4 and it's a dual rather than
quad-core processor running Android 4.2
2.2 jelly bean which samsung has given a
few tweaks to make the camera easier to
access it was considerably bigger size
the s4 zoom isn't going to appeal to
those of you wanting a slim and light
smartphone to slide into your jeans
instead is aimed squarely at the shutter
bugs whom valued image quality above
pocket ability make sure to keep it cnet
for all the latest news and the full
review amount of oil and this is a
samsung galaxy s4 Z</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
