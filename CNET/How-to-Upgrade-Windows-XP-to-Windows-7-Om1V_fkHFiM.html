XP to Windows Vista but are planning to
upgrade to Windows 7 there you leave the
Microsoft upgrade path as a punishment
you can't upgrade directly from XP to 7
you have to do what's called a clean
install which means you're gonna have to
jump through some hoops to keep your old
data and programs not to worry
we're going to show you a few ways to
deal with the pain of installing Windows
7 on your XP machine and afterward
Microsoft will forgive your trespasses
maybe before you start do these three
things first run the windows 7 upgrade
advisor will let you know if your
computer can handle any version of
Windows 7 second check the windows 7
compatibility center this is different
than the upgrade advisor it's going to
tell you if you need to update your
drivers or apps to make them work in
seven and third make a copy of your hard
drive just in case things go horribly
wrong I recommend using Mac rim reflect
it's a free download available from
download com ok now you're ready to
upgrade start by gathering all the
installation files for all your
applications windows 7 will put your
data into a Windows dot old file for you
but it's not going to reinstall your
apps make sure you have all the CDs or
if you downloaded programs back up any
install files you have on an external
drive also don't forget to gather all
the license keys either off the product
boxes or from emails you'll want them
all handy in a place outside the
computer you're upgrading and the last
thing before we get to the actual
windows 7 disc is to download and run
the Windows Easy Transfer wizard this is
going to allow you to backup all your
files and settings to an external hard
drive a different one and the one you
imaged earlier go to Windows Microsoft
comm and search for Windows Easy
Transfer download the right version and
install it launch the wizard and make
sure your external drive is plugged in
you can send your data to a network
location too but in this example we're
choosing an external drive the program
will check for what can be transferred
then give you an opportunity to password
protect the data finally choose your
external drive and begin the backup you
shouldn't use your computer while this
process is running it'll take a while to
move all your data over once it's done
you can set that drive aside you're not
going to need it until after Windows 7
completes updating finally you're
actually ready to insert the windows 7
disc when doing a clean install it
doesn't matter if you restart and boot
off the disk or if you just run it from
within windows it's going to give you a
last chance to check compatibility and
if you're sure you don't need that go
ahead and click install now it will ask
you if you want to go online and get
updates I say yes it could save you some
time later then agree to the EULA choose
custom install with XP if you choose
upgrade the installations going to fail
next pick the partition or drive you're
installing Windows 7 on now one listener
actually wrote in and said he put
Windows 7 on a separate partition from
Windows XP and it could still run as xp
apps no guaranteeing that will work for
you though a warning box will alert you
that you're going to lose your old
version of Windows and your old files
will be saved in C colon slash Windows
dot old then windows commences
installing your computer will reboot a
few times and eventually the wizard will
return this time running in Windows 7 at
this point you'll be able to do things
like set up a password set security
preferences set the time and date etc
finally look at that you're running
Windows 7 and you have device driver
issues let's take care of that launch
the device manager by pressing start and
typing device manager in the search box
if you see those yellow exclamation
points those devices have driver issues
now the easiest way to fix them is to
double click the item then click the
update driver button select search
automatically for updated driver
software
if you're lucky that'll fix your issues
if you're only human though you're still
going to have a few devices with
problems try looking at the windows 7
upgrade advisor again to see if the
device and its new driver are listed and
if that doesn't work check the
manufacturers website for that device
once you get your devices running to
your satisfaction it's time to install
your old programs yeah
CDs and external drives or whatever you
use to store the program's earlier and
get to install it for some programs you
might want to download the latest
versions directly from the web
finally you can restore your data it's
all there in a folder called Windows dot
old where you can manually move
everything back into the proper
directories under Windows 7 we don't
have to mess with that though because we
did that easy transfer wizard earlier so
make sure your external drive is
connected then click start choose
computer and under hard disk drives
choose the external drive where you
stored your transfer data find the file
you should have named Windows Easy
Transfer items from a little computer
double-click that file you can choose
which accounts to move and the transfer
wizard is going to figure out the rest
for you if it fails your data is still
in the windows old file you're just
going to have to move it by hand and
there you have it you've upgraded slowly
and slightly painfully from Windows XP
to Windows 7 now if you want to save a
lot of this hassle you can get a program
that will move all your data and your
installed applications for you it's
called the PCmover windows 7 upgrade
assistance from Lapp link and it's going
to cost you around $30.00 data and
programs again without you needing to do
any dragging and dropping or gathering
of disks and license keys whichever way
you decide to go once you're done do one
last thing image your drive again with
macri and reflect so you have a backup
copy of your new Windows 7 machine
that's just good practice and that's it
I hope this helps you make the jump I'm
