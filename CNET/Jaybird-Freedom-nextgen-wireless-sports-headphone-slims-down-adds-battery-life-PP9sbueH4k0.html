headphone with a totally new design the
freedom which it calls the most advanced
Bluetooth earbuds ever at $200 it's also
its most expensive headphone the buds
have a proprietary tapered step-down
design which is a fancy way of saying
the buds have been trimmed down and now
fit better in your ears you can also
wear a helmet over them without a
problem
j-bert has built all the electronics
into the inline remote and says the buds
and inline remote or at least part of
them are made out of metal not plastic
the headphones are sweat proof though
not waterproof and j-bird expects people
to use these not only as a sports
headphone but an everyday headphone
battery life is rated at eight hours
which is good for this type of headphone
but it's a bit misleading because you
get four hours from the buds and an
additional 4 hours of an included
charging clip that has a second
rechargeable battery inside it you can
continue wearing the headphones with the
clip attached but the package does look
a little funny dangling down near your
cheek you charge the headphones internal
battery and the external battery clip at
the same time via a micro USB port in
the clip it's a cool concept to have the
extra juice at your disposal when you
need it but the battery clip does seem a
little easy to lose luckily the
headphones which are available in five
color options come with a nice little
carrying pouch where you can store the
battery clip and any extra tips and ear
fins that come with the headphones a set
of core shorteners is also included but
they aren't the most elegant solution
Jaber needs to find a way to integrate a
court adjust design element into the
product not have you attached something
to it found the headphones fit better
than last year's x2 and I was able to
get a tight seal and secure fit using
the included ear fins with a tight seal
this is one of the best sounding
wireless in your sports headphones you
can buy and a new j-bert app will allow
Apple iOS and Android users to tweak the
sound profile to their liking I can't
say the freedom will be perfect for
everyone or perfect in general buts a
definite step up from earlier jaybird to
headphones and easily recommendable if
you can afford its high price tag
