nope less work this yes perfect come on
give me fantastic so working this scene
digital cameras have come a hell of a
long way from those bulky low resolution
boxes of bygone eras and now almost
everyone is walking around with an
extremely capable camera in their pocket
what if you want to take that further
what if you want not just great image
quality but the world's best image
quality that you can get what you need
then is this it's the phase 1 IQ 3 XF
camera system and welcome to Takeda's
the sheer size and not to mention the
hefty weight of this thing does
immediately tell you that this is no
ordinary camera far from the world of
the quick point-and-shoot you'll see on
the city streets this beast is designed
for the world's top commercial
photographers who want only the best
colors and the finest details and of
course who have high-paying clients who
demand the same and those clients would
have to be very high paying because this
camera system in it's about
$65,000 now that is a lot of money so
let's put that into some context for
that money you could get yourself a
brand new BMW m2 car with plenty of
money left over to actually put some
fuel in their thing or alternatively get
a hundred and thirty entry-level Canon
DSLRs or alternatively just go on a
luxury world tour and enjoy the sights
maybe go to Australia see how those guys
are doing
at the heart of the camera system is
this a bit this is the digital back the
actual image sensor that captures
everything now this has a hundred
megapixels 100 megapixels that does very
much put my 12 megapixel iphone to shame
now what that means is that this camera
can capture fine details like absolutely
nothing else
check out this London skyline this is
how much you can zoom in on elements in
the shot same goes for portraits of
course the level of clarity you can
achieve on the eyelashes of the models
eye is amazing and it means that when
these sorts of shots are printed
full-page in magazines like Vogue or
Vanity Fair every single detail remains
but it's not just detailed at this thing
Excel that that huge image sensor
captures a ton of light and what that
does is give your images a massive
dynamic range that allows you to lighten
shadows or tone down bright skies and
editing far beyond what you'd be able to
do with even a good DSLR from Canon or
NIC up and that's why these cameras are
aimed squarely at high-end pros the pros
that want ultimate image quality firm
massive billboard campaign or a double
page spread in a glossy magazine that
captures so much information in a single
shot that they can achieve pretty much
whatever look they want to in
post-production
now I'm certainly no world leading
photographer but even I was very curious
to see what I can achieve when I took
this thing into the studio I rented some
Profoto lights themselves the leaders in
the professional photography world and
brought in the help of our model Emily
and our makeup artist also called Emily
what I learned is that it's not a quick
camera everything about it from starting
it and taking a shot happens at a much
slower pace this is definitely not a
camera to consider if you want street
photographs where you can instantly
capture a moment as soon as you see it
it takes a more considered approach
where every setting I dialed it in every
slight nuance in the lighting I used
even every slight brushstroke of the
makeup had to be precise with so much
detail captured there's really no room
for error but it's by considering those
things that I was able to come away with
a series of shots that I'm really
pleased with their packs with detail and
have got beautiful rich colors and
$65,000 this is not the camera to buy if
you're simply an enthusiastic amateur
hoping to take some nice snaps on your
next holiday this is the camera you want
when you want to get the world's best
images and you want those images to
appear in the world's best magazines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
