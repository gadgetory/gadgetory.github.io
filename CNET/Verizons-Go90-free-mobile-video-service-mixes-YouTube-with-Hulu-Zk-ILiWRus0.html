new mobile free video service from
horizon I'm seen it's Joan Salzmann go
90 is a purely mobile video service it's
free from Verizon but you don't need to
be a Verizon customer to watch it
anybody from any carrier can watch its
mix of on-the-go traditional TV videos
alongside new digital era clips that you
would typically associate with sites
like YouTube it's free for anyone to
watch because it's supported by
advertising so you'll see ads instead of
having to pay a monthly subscription
like you would for Hulu for the first
time because Verizon has partnered with
companies like Viacom which owns cable
networks like Comedy Central and
Nickelodeon for the first time you'll be
able to watch Moberly some of these
shows like The Daily Show the next day
after they broadcasts for free you don't
need to have a cable subscription and
you don't need to have a subscription to
a service like Netflix or Hulu to see
them you find videos on go 90 mostly by
following people the company describes
it as a social entertainment platform so
unlike Netflix where you'll be suggested
new things to watch based on what you've
watched before you'll mostly find new
things because you'll see one of your
friends clipping a segment of a video
and sending it to you or maybe other
friends of theirs or you'll be able to
see what a friend already follows and
follow the things that you like that
they watch even though this is a video
service from Verizon don't expect to be
able to get a break on your data usage
streaming video takes a lot of data and
Rison isn't giving any free passes on
video 4 go 90 the company says that
they're expecting people to watch using
Wi-Fi network so not just their cellular
plans data usage but you'll need to be
careful that you don't go over your data
limit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
