lenovo is talking with amazon on how the
voice assistant Alexa can be used on its
computers Lenovo executives shared the
news with CNET but didn't provide more
details Amazon clearly wants Alexa to
grow beyond the echo smart speaker hubs
letting you talk to it from any device
but it won't be the first digital
assistant to make its way to pcs
Microsoft's Cortana is now also on
Windows 10 pcs and Siri is also coming
to Mac computers and a software update
later this year computer makers are
looking for new ways to get people
interested in buying more pcs because
worldwide PC shipments are expected to
fall 7.2 percent this year that's
according to research group IDC and not
only is lenovo talking to Amazon to
spice things up but it also just
unveiled the new $500 yoga book laptop
that has an all touchscreen keyboard and
because it's a touchscreen it can turn
into other tools like a drawing pad with
no real keyboard can we even still call
it a laptop if it's not a nightmare for
typing it could become a new trend in
laptops but it is not the first time
laptop makers have experimented with
replacing the clickity-clack keys with a
touchscreen Acer had a 14 inch dual
screen laptop way back in 2011 it was
called the Iconia that's it for this
