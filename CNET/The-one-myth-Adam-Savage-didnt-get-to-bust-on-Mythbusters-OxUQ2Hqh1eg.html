on reddit doing an AMA thousands of
questions and you graciously spent a
long time there and of course everyone
wanted to know about myth that you
didn't get to bust and you gave some
examples but the one that I'm really
intrigued about is where you want to
Punk a duck by pretending to be an
orange but no no no no no so it's an
American Indian hunting myth and we had
trouble finding the origin of this I
just remember hearing it years ago and
it went on my list apparently if you
want to hunt ducks the best a great
method is to float pumpkins in a duck
pond so that the Ducks become
acclimatized pumpkins floating around
them then when you're hungry for duck
you put a pumpkin on your head
presumably with a couple of eye holes in
it and you swim up to the ducks and they
don't even notice that you're coming up
to them because it's just another
pumpkin Edeka according to a friend of
mine who is a hunter you can really
literally grab the duck by its feet and
pull it under and the Ducks around it
won't notice that something's wrong
now to be clear we weren't going to do
that specific thing on television we're
not going to harm ducks or drown them or
abuse them but I was going to go up in a
pumpkin and catch a duck and
unfortunately we had to eliminate that
story at the end of the last season okay
but there is still a Karen's here in
francisca yeah no I had theirs stow Lake
there's there's there's Lake Merritt
down there by the by the zoo there's a
bunch of places that we were thinking
about filming this and we actually I we
had a duck pond over in the East Bay I
believe that we had been allowed to film
at we went very I went all the way to
building a remote-controlled pumpkin to
be used as a camera platform so that the
cameraman could get up close to the
action but one of the things that
happens sometimes is when things go
wrong with a story
it's very right for us editorially so we
had a couple of stories of the last
season go horribly wrong but that meant
that we got an extra like six or seven
minutes of screen time out of each of
those stories and that extra screen time
meant that we had to eliminate one of
our smaller stories and that was my
counting notes alright so we're gonna
have to wait for that in the few someday
someday I'll get to it and your pumpkin
platform camera you can see massive
application in the world for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
