him in for dinner uh I don't know rich
how does Batman's mom called him in for
dinner dinner dinner dinner dinner
dinner dinner dinner dinner Batman rich
and I went to go and see the lego batman
movie so rich what did you think loved
it and here's five things you need to
know rich wasn't it cool how they
basically just showed every Batman ever
I know right well it's great that in
like Lego world it's the one place where
you can bring together all the different
types of Batman from like dark and
brooding Batman too campy colorful
sixties Batman they're all there and it
all somehow makes sense in like crazy
Lego world I just couldn't take my eyes
off all the big buildings I know there's
some absolutely amazing set is already i
popping and gorgeous and colorful and
that sets like Wayne Manor looks amazing
the Batcave oh is in world of different
vehicles all the equipment and stuff so
that's really cool although it's not
really about like the building in the
way that maybe the lego movie was it's
not so much the leg onus as just being
in that Lego world and there's these
great nods to the way that Lego figures
actually work in the real world like the
way that they connect to each other or
the way they can't push buttons and that
kind of thing which is great I didn't
think the story was as good as the first
lego movie but it was good that they
didn't waste loads of time doing the
origin story what they're doing so many
Batman fits exactly it's great to see a
superhero movie that isn't beholden to
the the origin story that we've all seen
a million times before but it was but it
was a fun story a great sort of moral
about friendship it's a bit of frenetic
to start with and then you really
noticeably sags like later on when the
story kind of kicks in
her rich there was certainly enough
references to technology weren't there
there certainly were John and even
though the story is all about Batman
being the Caped Crusader the Dark Knight
this lone solitary figure there is one
woman in his life and that's Siri yes
Apple fans will be pleased to know that
there is loads of product placement for
Apple Siri actually provides the voice
of the Batcave computer I'm home welcome
home sir and the other develop tech as
well like Batman has the bat facts and
you'll also be pleased to know that
Bruce Wayne when he comes home from a
hard night dark knighting he still has
the same problem struggling with the
hdmi inputs as everybody else and rich
rich rich even egghead was in there yeah
all the villains are in there is
fantastic condiment King and King tart
and the Joker the Riddler Harley Quinn
poison ivy Mr Freeze bein all them and
some villains that we can't actually
talk about too much well we love the
lego batman movie and you can find out
more on CNN com to the Batmobile
it's the car right checks take the car I
really dig the legroom haha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
