the Porsche Boxster and Cayman are the
best cars the company makes and now
there's a new version of each the GTS
supposedly the ultimate drivers version
of each car so I can finally find out
which is best but first a small history
lesson on where the GTS name came from
this is a Porsche 904 Carrera GTS around
a hundred of them would hit the road as
part of a homologation program to get
the race ready version the 904 on track
and competing at the time the Porsche
718 racer was swiftly becoming obsolete
and Porsche needed something to further
its efforts on the world circuit while
the 904 and its later
evolutions went on to do quite well the
name given to the first of the so called
plastic Porsches thanks the material
that made it became quite the legend the
904 itself was a smart piece of design
not only was it penned by the incredible
Bootsy Porsche the same pen behind the
911 it was also damn near finished on
the first go
thanks to enormous time constraints to
get the car finished in time for
homologation the design team didn't have
all that much wiggle room to refine and
redesign the car as such it would remain
pretty similar to blitz C's original
draft later Bootsy will go on to say
that the 904 was his favorite design the
Nano force named GTS was something of a
necessity Peugeot owned the number zero
number naming convention the same thing
that stops the 911 being called the 901
so the naming bods at Porsche
needed something to make the car stand
out GTS or Gran Turismo sport Porsches
are the cars that offer the best driving
experience possible they're not about
outright power like a turbo or a turbo s
if a Porsche has got GTS on its deck is
gonna offer you the ultimate driving
experience at least that's what Porsche
says the GTS badge can be seen on the
current cayenne and Panamera and
featured on the best version of the 997
generation 911 now though there's a new
brace of GTS is in town the Cayman and
the Boxster have been given a spit
polish and some extra everything
so what has GCS off' ocation done to the
Boxster and the Cayman well I no I said
GTS is aren't about all-out power but
they are actually the most powerful in
their respective lineups Porsche has
added 15 horses over the S models of
each car which means the Boxster now has
330 and the Cayman 340 and when you can
see the S versions aren't exactly
underpowered these things are going to
be quick the power gives each car some
pretty impressive numbers they both
shave nought point three seconds of
their S versions nought to sixty two
times where the boxes are managing the
dash in 4.7 seconds and they came and
doing the same in four point six that's
with the PDK gearbox and launch control
their top speeds 174 on 177 miles an
hour depending on the choice of roof but
power does not a GTS make they have to
handle as well and Porsches added a few
toys to make sure that happens they both
care as standard the sports chrono pack
which adds a few fun little toys such as
launch control and a
it also has by Namek engine mounts now
they're really smart because they
stiffen when the car does anything so
under acceleration under braking under
cornering they make sure that the engine
mass doesn't travel too far that's smart
there's also fortunate active suspension
management now what that does is well it
allows you to tune the car suspension at
the press of a button if you want a
sharper or more comfortable ride for the
aesthetically minded both cars come with
natty black spoilers bi-xenon lamps and
all that jazz the cars are also lower
for a sporty a driver I don't really
care about any of that I just want to
find out which is best
so the Cayman GTS first up I will tell
you what I love the bass cave and it's
such a complete sports car it feels so
plant it's so good at any given
opportunity this just ups the game I've
been earning it around these mountain
roads and I'll tell you what it grips
and grips and grips and grips and grips
the steering is really good it feels
really nice you do feel so connected to
the car however program the noise did a
bloody good job because in Sport+ if you
rest in second just give it a try a
little bit
and then liftoff and get this awesome
gurgling noises there the cars going pop
time for some more fun because it just
wants to be driven and thrashed and
played with
getting into the Boxster you realized
just how sharp the Cayman is and that
thing it's very weighty you can feel
your hefting round something that's very
very focused designed to get round
corners as as quickly and as efficiently
as possible and the box does just so
much lighter the steering's lighter the
suspensions a little bit softer so it
feels more floaty gets a bit more mobile
in the corners it's not quite as razor
sharp it's not quite as GT se as the
Cayman GTS if that makes sense but it
does have a wonderful advantage this
while not being quite as hardcore as the
Cayman has more drama it's more
accessible fun so without the roof you
can hear it more and the engine in this
thing sounds incredible the sound
engineers did a stonking job we know
that from driving the Cayman but because
you don't have a roof and because
there's the engine right behind you then
the exhaust bang it into Sport Plus and
you can hear every crack every girl
every rev so much better and if you
don't have a roof and say have a tunnel
you can do this
the noise this thing kicks out is
amazing
Portia's very keen on saying that within
each of their cars there's a racing car
tech that's been developed on the track
and then filtered into each car
with this year there's lots of underbody
stuff but most immediately it Britain is
the noise I cannot stress how good it is
it sounds like a racing car from way
backwards
so really it comes down to what do you
prefer
do you prefer a car that feels super
hardcore very agile very very sporty or
do you prefer a car that is a bit more
dramatic it's a bit more accessible a
bit more of a giggle and that's entirely
down to you I suppose it also falls down
to whether you prefer roof or not
with the box from the Cayman GTS if you
look at their name where it came from
from the 904 that was a mid-engined
quite accessible sports car yeah they
didn't make that many of them but
Porsche says it was affordable when it
was new about 30,000 marks but still
when you look at the other GTS models
available the Panamera the Cayenne those
wear the badge they they have the name
and yeah they keep the ethos but really
the books from the Cayman GTS a proper
successors to it their mid engines their
proper sports cars they're accessible
and their bloody good fun and I bet you
any money the people are going to go mad
for these they really are because
they've there came and and Boxster S
Plus there's that little extra feeling
that you're sitting on something just a
little bit more focus a little bit more
hardcore and a little bit more rewarding
it feels so wonderful just to bounce
from corner to corner to corner in these
things and because it's so good to drive
because the steering is so good
and because the gearbox make sure you
don't do anything too stupid you can
have all the fun in the world having
driven both cars is safe to say they are
utterly brilliant but you'd expect that
from something bearing the GTS name
whichever you go for you won't be
disappointed the Boxster witnessed
driving the Cayman with its sharp run
but for me there can only be one winner
the Cayman as a drivers cast it's going
to be tough to beat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
