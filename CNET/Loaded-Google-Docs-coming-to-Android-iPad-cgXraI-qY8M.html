saya and it's time to get loaded you
remember a little music service called
Napster well a lot has changed since the
days of free music but the company is
back with a new iOS app the service is
ten dollars a month and lets you stream
and cash your favorite music from a
library of ten million songs iPhone and
iPad users can sign up today and VLC is
the most versatile video player out
there it can handle just about any video
file and today it's available for the
iPad app will approve the app and iPad
users can download it for free the folks
behind VLC say that an iphone version is
on its way Twitter users should be on
the lookout for any sketchy links on
their feet security firm sophos says a
potentially dangerous hack of Twitter
coms web interface is sending out these
URL tweets with the word onmouseover in
the text the links are spam and some
users are being redirected to porn sites
but other malware can appropriate this
just as easily but you know not to click
right and how about a new printer to go
with your new tablet HP is launching a
printer tablet combo called the
photosmart East Asian it's four hundred
dollars and it has a 7-inch tablet
running android it docks on to the
printer and it can act as a digital
photo frame but you can remove it and
take it around the house to check email
surf or view media almost anything you
do on the tablet is designed to be sent
to the printer the only downside is that
Android Market cannot be accessed from
the tablet so you're limited to what
comes pre-installed on the device Google
is letting iPad and Android users edit
their Google Docs this mention was brief
but Google did say that in the next few
weeks users can access and edit in the
Google Docs sweet this will allow full
editing of documents and the same
editing features as on a desktop
those are your headlines for today on
Marco save for cnet.com and you've just
been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
