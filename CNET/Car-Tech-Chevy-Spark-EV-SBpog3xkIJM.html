couple things you're supposed to do and
one thing you're not supposed to do and
that is be expensive so when you're a
spark Eevee how do you pull that off
what's your car is have a premium this
one Chevy says we'll be under
twenty-five thousand dollars after tax
incentives by that I assume they mean
the federal incentive of seventy five
hundred bucks because the state
incentives are way too unpredictable no
we don't know is the range on the car
chevy has not stated that yeah it's not
gonna come out till middle of next year
at that point though they say it'll have
the best range of any evey in its class
which is a pretty small class charging
time is interesting with in this port
they say you can hook it up to a fast
charger a high current that's gonna be a
480 volt that's gonna give you an eighty
percent charge in 20 minutes that may be
the new high benchmark for quick
charging otherwise on the 240 outlet
you're more likely to have it your house
we're looking at something around seven
hours for a full charge that's more
run-of-the-mill oh and by the way
they're telling me this car will have do
I have this right 400 foot-pounds of
torque that should put you on the moon
pretty easily zero to 60 around eight
something seconds so they're really
pushing this as a high-performing
compact inexpensive electric car now
inside check it out twin seven-inch LCD
is one way you expect it here in the
center and another one that is your
instrument pod everything's gonna be
right there
all your usual gauge information if you
will as well as evey information range
charge status probably distance to next
charging station things of that nature
now here in the main screen they're
gonna rely a lot on apps for things that
car makers often roll in themselves like
bring go for navigation Pandora stitcher
tune in for your connected media leaning
hard on what your phone can bring in
terms of richness to this car probably
helps them keep the price down a bit as
well now the last fascinating part of
the cabin tech in this car that we don't
have in here yet to show your try is
integrated Siri number Apple mention
this a little while ago how they're
going to be car makers who are
installing it this
is apparently gonna be the first car
with it Syria that will be a button
somewhere on the dash allowing you to
interface with your iPhone 4s or five or
whatever is out when you buy this car
and do voice commands just like you do
and do so in an eyes free mode Sunda
tactic eight emails burn okay now I tell
you a Chevy spark is a rather unassuming
car but given the fact that it's made
the jump to Evie will be apparently the
first car to have Siri integration has
some very aggressive app and screen
based cabin tech and a price under
twenty five after a federal bonus this
may be the story of the LA Auto Show
this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
