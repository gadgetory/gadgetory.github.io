based android tablets with its note line
and now toshiba enters a game with the
six hundred dollar excite write the
right is a 10.1 inch tablet with a 2560
by 1600 resolution screen ports include
a microSD card slot micro HDMI and
microUSB however the micro USB port
can't be used for charging there's only
one 32 gigabyte storage configuration
the 1.3 megapixel front facing camera is
as grainy as they get but the 8
megapixel back camera actually takes
sharp pics video handles colors pretty
well and has an LED flash the right is
essentially the excite pro with a Wacom
digitizer that means according to
toshiba that the screen can detect up to
1024 levels of pressure from the pen
however when using toshibas included
true note app you'd never notice to note
is a very basic note-taking and picture
annotating app that lets you organize
your files and virtual folders those
files can include simple notes doodles
and whatever else you can think of to
draw a right you can choose from a
couple of different styles of hens a
pencil or marker color thickness and
transparency levels can be adjusted
manually but line thickness doesn't
respond to different levels of pressure
no matter how hard or lightly you press
that's not the case however if using
Photoshop Touch which clearly responds
to different pressure levels if outside
the to note app you can take a
screenshot and then crop and annotate
the screen to your heart's content
that's pretty much it though true note
is surprisingly bare-bones with none of
the bells and whistles of Samsung's S
note app the pen is accurate and riding
with it felt more fluent and faster than
on the Galaxy Note 10.1 but about match
the note 8 and smoothness one features
samsung stylus is missing however is
this handy eraser button on the bottom
it's a useful and convenient extra even
if its detection isn't 12
the biggest difference however between
the note and right is OS integration the
note line includes stylus functionality
like cutting out a slice of the screen
any screen at any time also the notes
right to text conversion put Samsung's
tablets in a class all their own the
excite right doesn't come near that
level of integration and the overall
experience feels more limited for it the
excite right is a good tablet but for
six hundred dollars comes up way short
in the wild apartment a stylist features
can't match the competition and
ultimately it isn't worth the
unreasonable price toshiba is asking

this has been a first look at the
toshiba excite right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
