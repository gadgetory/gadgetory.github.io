cnet and this is the Fujifilm xq1
there's tons to like about Fujifilm's
weather sealed cold resistant
interchangeable lens camera it delivers
great photo quality and excellent
continuous shooting speed in a pretty
comfortable to shoot body that's mostly
well designed I say mostly because while
I generally like shooting with the xt-1
there are few design quirks that make me
kind of crazy on the good side it's got
a sufficiently big and pretty
comfortable grip manual dials for ISO
sensitivity shutter speed and exposure
compensation and a bright tilting LCD
plus the viewfinders terrific it's big
with several different views for
manually focusing including a dual view
and a digital split image view plus
focus peaking like the rest of the
recent generation of x-series cameras I
really enjoy it for street photography
but I really don't like the drive mode
control the movie record button or the
navigation buttons while the ISO and
shutter speed dials lock the drive mode
switch doesn't and the single shooting
selections right in the middle the
combination resulted in my constantly
accidentally switching out of single
shooting into burst mode and the movie
record navigation buttons are really
flat I frequently had to push the nav
buttons with my fingernail and ended up
with videos of me walking down the
sidewalk because i thought i'd pressed
the movie end button but hadn't these
are especially problematic in cold
weather when you're wearing gloves based
on the same sixteen point three
megapixel x-trans CMOS two sensor as the
xe2 but with some tweaking to lower the
noise the xt-1 delivers the same great
photo quality JPEGs are clean up to iso
800 and depending upon content can be
usable as high as iso 6400 unfortunately
like the XE to Ross ports not available
in the expanded ISO sensitivity range
the xt-1 delivers a great continuous
shooting rate of around seven point nine
frames per second at a pretty deep burst
of around 30 frames and that's with
autofocus and reasonably fast saves to
the card but the rest of its performance
is just okay there's no on-camera flash
but otherwise it provides a well-rounded
set including Wi-Fi and an
intervalometer Fujifilm's camera remote
app is nicer than most for instance it
lets you zoom when you're browsing
remotely which many apps don't but the
camera could really use NFC to simplify
connecting to Android all in all the
xt-1 isn't perfect but it's a great
camera and the best of fujifilm's x
series models today I'm Lori Brennan and
this is the Fujifilm xq1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
