past couple of years has been Apple's
12-inch MacBook not a pro not a tear but
a just plain MacBook it was smaller and
lighter than any other macbook but also
less powerful with a battery that didn't
last quite as long
now despite that it became a favorite of
mine ads because was so amazingly
portable and it had all the other
features I loved about Mac books like
that instant sleep-wake and all those
multi finger touch pad gestures so the
one year later version of the 12 inch
macbook it's a little bit different
under the hood it adds updated Corian
processors which in our tests of other
system so far are much better than the
original core em and it also comes in a
new color rose gold now the keyboard
still kind of shallow take some getting
used to and that single USB port means
you're going to need a pocket full of
dongles to connect video outputs
old-style USB keys and all kinds of
other accessories because there's USB
type-c which is that small reversible
port but obviously doesn't fit any of
your existing stuff and it's also still
$12.99 with an Intel Core m3 or 15.99
with an Intel Core m5 so you're paying a
premium for all that portability but
despite all that getting a decent boost
to the performance and the battery life
enters you know to the biggest issues I
had with the original version and I can
see this being my go-to laptop for
coffee-shop computing my only regret
I've got the straight-laced space grey
version instead of that festive rose
gold
