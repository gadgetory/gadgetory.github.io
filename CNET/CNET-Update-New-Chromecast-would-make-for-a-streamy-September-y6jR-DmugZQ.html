TV media streamers and Google maybe next
I'm Bridget Carey this is your cnet
update google may soon reveal a new
version of its chromecast video
streaming stick now just the other day
amazon came out with a new fire TV stick
in box the stick cost fifty dollars and
the box is 100 earlier this month Apple
revamped the Apple TV which is coming
out in October for a hundred and fifty
dollars but as for google it has not
released a new version of the chromecast
in more than two years and since the
first one came out it's been a hot
seller for the low price of thirty-five
dollars the chromecast is able to stream
music and video to your TV and you
control it from a smartphone or tablet
Google is holding an event to showcase
new products to the press on September
29th and we expect to see two new nexus
smartphones those would be the flagship
phones for Android marshmallow but
another report from nine to five google
says we're also going to see a new
chromecast at this event it cites
internal documents that indicate it has
a new look and support for faster Wi-Fi
and it may have some sort of new home
screen meanwhile it seems Apple is
taking more steps in testing a
self-driving car The Guardian reports
had obtained documents indicating that
Apple's senior legal counsel had a
meeting last month with several members
of California's DMV that specialized in
self-driving cars the Department said
that the meeting with Apple was to
review the dmv's autonomous vehicle
regulations according to the report
google has been testing various types of
self-driving cars for years now and uber
is also getting into the space although
Apple has not confirmed anything
publicly there has been speculation
about Apple working on self-driving cars
for quite some time California law
requires that any car that doesn't need
a human operator must be registered with
the state before it can be tested on
public roads Microsoft may not have its
own self driving car but it is working
on putting Cortana in the car a
Microsoft executive told a crowd at a
conference in Taiwan that the company
has created a concept car that uses
Cortana voice controls and projects a
display onto the windshield to perform
quick tasks and searches that's
according to the Taipei times also in
news we now know the new Xbox one elite
controller is going to go on sale on
october 27th that's the same day that
halo 5 guardians launches the beefed-up
controller costs a hundred and fifty
dollars and Alyss gamers do some pretty
specific customizations to the triggers
and thumb stick and there are
interchangeable rear paddles and there's
