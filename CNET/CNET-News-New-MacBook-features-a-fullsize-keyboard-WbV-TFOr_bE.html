a thinner design it took an entirely new
kind of invention to make it a beautiful
keyboard so the team studied how current
keyboard technology works there's a
slow-motion video of a customer typing
on a standard keyboard and as you see as
the keys get pressed through a bit
wobbly in fact if you press them on the
side they start to bottom out that's
because they're based on a mechanism
called a scissor mechanism and there was
a time when that was great but now
there's something new our team invented
a butterfly mechanism this butterfly
mechanism is built of a single assembly
and it's supported by a stainless steel
dome switch and that all adds up to a
key that is much more precise inaccurate
in fact it's four times more stable than
that scissor mechanism it is forty
percent thinner allowing us to make a
thinner keyboard and we also made the
key cap larger making it even easier to
strike and get a beautiful typing
experience so this is a slow-motion
video of typing than the new keyboard on
the new macbook the keys are much more
precise much more accurate even if you
strike them on the side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
