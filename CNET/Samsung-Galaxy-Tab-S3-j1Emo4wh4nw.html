best one it's ever made if you're
interested in buying a tablet primarily
for watching video it should be at the
top of your list
it has a bright colorful vibrant razor
sharp nine point seven inch screen and
four speakers one on each corner HD
content looks spectacular and the
speakers are loud enough to fill a room
though they tend to sound tinny at max
volume one of the most special things
about the Galaxy Tab s 3 is that it's
the first HD already tablet this means
it can play HDR content HDR videos have
enhanced contrast and an increased range
of color resulting in more vivid picture
quality basically it's like HD on
steroids the bad news is HDR content
that's easily accessible on a tablet
isn't available yet at the time of
review I wasn't able to find any HDR TV
shows or movies to download or stream
just one playlist on YouTube and I was
ready to pay $30 for a rival just check
it out the cutting-edge tech might come
in handy one day but not today the
tablet has a lot of other good things
going for it though namely it's gorgeous
instead of your typical aluminum or
plastic the tablet has a stylish all
glass back panel many people think it
looks like the iPhone but really it
copies the design of the galaxy s7 phone
another great thing about it is its
stylus it's bundled with Samsung's S Pen
and with simple software integration it
makes for a useful note-taking accessory
the S Pen is surprisingly comfortable
it's rubber tip feels smooth when
writing or drying and it's oblong shape
melts into your hand and prevents it
from rolling off your desk best of all
you never have to charge it
Samsung also offers a Pogo keyboard case
for the tablet sold separately for a
hundred and twenty nine dollars but I'm
not a big fan you can't adjust the
viewing angles the keys aren't backlit
and the screen goes to sleep when you
disconnect it so transitioning from
laptop mode to tablet isn't seamless it
does however give you a place to store
the stylus as a tablet and stylus combo
the Galaxy Tab s 3 is like a sexier Loki
version of Samsung's Note series though
for $600 it's the
same price as the iPad pro 9.7 and
Google pixel C which are both better for
those looking for a tablet for work or
gaming but if you want the best portable
movie watching experience the Samsung
Galaxy Tab s 3 is the way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
