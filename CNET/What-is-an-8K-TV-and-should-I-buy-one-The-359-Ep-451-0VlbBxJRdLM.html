- good morning to the 359 CNET's daily
news program brought to you in the same
format as what used to be radio now
known as a live podcast it's episode 451
on Wednesday August 30th we're coming at
you from the scene at New York studios
and I'm BVG let's commemorate today
because today was the day Skynet became
self-aware back in 1997 and humanity as
we know it was destroyed by the t800
Terminator series now here are your
hosts Alfred aying Roger Chang and
dammit Wow hey dude it's great that
you're really loud so we can hear you
but like it's hard so like thanks for
starting the show off in such a bright
note you know you know what's you know
it's a brighter note to start today off
of it is 100 days until the new super
smash brothers comes out
oh it is we're just gonna get smashed
questions all throughout the entire show
as it should be Brian
can we come here are you the other can
you not hear me out there
nope we can't hear you well we could
hear you kind of are you physically but
not with like the speakers and now with
the technology that is powering the show
all right well vamp for a second and
I'll I'll try to fix that louder
BAM all right so anyway so kinky exactly
all right well Brian is on Brian MA how
come you never just sit here with us
yeah you can see the top of his head no
you can't all right there it is
well so we'll just get him the topic so
we uh we've got David on for reason
Etha is here did before got some TV news
and we'll talk specifically about 8k TV
technology is a feature um he'll explain
what it is cuz I'm gonna tell what it is
beyond fact like supposed to be sharper
it's just eight thousand more it's more
you body board you get eight thousand
for free yeah that would be a great deal
actually and won't really break down all
TV news and take your questions about
all things TVs because that's what
David's here for yeah he knows more
about TVs than anyone else in the world
really
Yeah right actually eight times as much
as anybody else okay next person down it
sure all right can you hear me now well
yeah I'm a genius you are all right
let's get the show on all right let's do
it
so as always if you have any questions
mostly for David Nutt for us unless
they're smash questions leave them in
the comments section but I will pick out
the best and we'll get them in three
bits in 59 seconds from thorry
a two
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger chant I'm
out for dang and with us is special
guest and TV wizard David Katz Meyer
he's yours
what I was not actually a wizard but
he's well I'm like a level zero okay I
just learned can trips there we go he's
here because Etha is upon us and we've
already got some TV news Dave can you
break down some of the early
announcements from LG and sharp yeah we
saw those guys basically rolled out 8k
TVs so these things we've seen before
actually at CES and since like 2014
honestly I've been talking about these
things so LG showed their 88 inch 8k
OLED concept TV he thought you know 77
inch roads were expensive at 10 grand
imagine this thing and then sharp has
its own 8k TV they're known for really
large presentation monitors that's what
this is it's not a real consumer product
so let's break down what 8k is is it
just twice as sharper resolutions 4k
you'd think but it's actually four times
as sharp even better right the math
isn't I have it in front of me so don't
get it wrong okay hey is 7680 by 43 20
which is 33 million one hundred seventy
seven thousand six hundred pixels and 4k
is a mere eight million so right it's
it's it's a lot it's a lot smaller
pixels and a lot more it's the bottom
line I mean what does that mean for the
end-user the person watching this TV is
it really a noticeable benefit no okay I
mean how many and the podcast there how
many TV shows are even like recording in
like a cage well not every shows a this
is a podcast zero okay
the the there are actually a couple
movies that were shot in HK like guards
the galaxy 2 was shot in HK 4 sorry 8k
forgettable a couple of upcoming movies
as well that's just the film part
because the CGI has to be a lot lower
resolution cuz CGI takes a heck of a lot
more processing power to deal with and a
normal video but yeah there really
aren't that many 8k cameras out there
the content is just getting started
Netflix and those guys you know haven't
really done anything with it there are
some 8k quote-unquote videos on YouTube
but you know they're really hard to
watch and really Kay and blah blah blah
so it's super what is the point of
putting these things that is it
basically like plenty
flying on the ground saying hey we're
investing in 8k everyone else start
started jumping on this bandwagon yeah
and and these guys have been showing
these things for a while rumor has it
that Samsung is gonna come out with an
8k TV later at Aoife so yeah these guys
want to get in and and you know kind of
get it started essentially so you know
get the TVs out there and then they
think the content is gonna fall I feel
like these standards upgrades so quickly
that by the time everybody has an 8k TV
and everything is being filled with a ke
cameras it's like Oh check it out we got
16 K now yeah in terms of 4k content
like it's still not ubiquitous right
there are a lot of channels yeah they're
channels that weren't even broadcasting
in HD for a while right there's no TV
broadcast in 4k regularly and there's a
few streaming shows mainly originals on
Amazon and Netflix yeah in those places
but long story short 4k content isn't
really even here yet and now we're talk
about 8k so is this I mean you mentioned
concept are these all concepts are
always gonna see these in the market
anytime soon none of these ones that
we've seen done now so far are viable
you know the rumor has it that Samsung's
is gonna be viable we'll find out at CES
earlier this year they showed an ATV
that they said you were gonna be able to
buy later this year so we're thinking
that's gonna be it and so why would you
want to buy line if there's no content
writing rights not on your friends yeah
yeah yeah it's turnkey
Dunc all over those eight but again if
you've got a TV and there's no EK
content what do you like is it if the 4k
content does it look better so Samsung
says that it has AI processing course it
does that you guys gonna be a very big
buzzword yeah I will make that a K TV
sing with 4k and 1080p in your VHS
content oh I really wanna pull really
want to play VHS cassette we're on on an
8k party yeah just the best blow it up
as big as you can get it all right from
one of these stories chicks on CNET I'm
Roger Chang I'm out for a David Katz
Mayer thanks for listening
very jazzy oh yeah you guys can tease
all you want but the audience likes my
music oh yeah thanks everybody for
joining us for the recording of the
audio podcast that'll publish later
we'll tell you where to find it and for
now I'm gonna jump into the chat and dig
out some questions and comments let's go
ahead and give a shout out to any Oni
coming all the way from Kenya I love
hearing that we got these awesome
international numbers in the meantime
let's jump in and take one from Brian
Matthews he says instead of an 8k TV how
about an 8k projector TI properly si
would would we see a difference in a K
TV it would have to be like a hundred
inches big so yeah you're on the right
track the larger an image the more
you're liable to appreciate the the
extra resolution a same thing if you sit
closer to the picture you're gonna
appreciate it more so yeah sitting
really close to really gigantic TVs your
best chance of appreciating a K and
that's that's how I watch my 4k TV okay
my challenge is from it we're all raised
our mom's told us don't sit close to the
TV it'll ruin your eyes our mom's never
had a K TV babe right it's totally worth
[Laughter]
we have some skeptics in the audience
today people are asking no they're not
all a K believers already what's the
matter with you people
I'm not out there with chrome TV 3d TVs
um you know you can do that's that's
plenty
Curt you just say curved TV and you can
walk away from TV you have done they
still exist by the way that's shocking
right Daniel Peter says how clear can
you get really Mathew dieter says can
humans really see the difference between
4k and 8k at the current size of home
TVs and Sanjay says I believe the human
eye can't see beyond 2k right so all of
that stuff is generally true it all
depends on this eating distance the
screen size what you're actually
watching if you're just looking at still
lines they're really easy to
differentiate picture an eye chart or
your optometrist it's really easy to see
those ease
they're not moving but you know most
people watch TV that moves yeah color
yeah color resolutions a whole other
issue so all these things combined mean
that in general it's really hard to tell
the difference and of course if you
don't have 20/20 vision if you're not a
fighter pilot you know it's really hard
to you know again appreciate this extra
definition so is this just a marketing
thing to a large extent I'm not gonna
say that until actually get it into the
lab and sit side by side that I might
blow anybody's mind but from what we've
seen with to comparing 1080p and 4k back
in the day with 265 inch TVs right next
to each other basically the exact same
except for the resolution it was really
hard to tell it's 65 inches sitting
about 8 feet away which was pretty damn
close so a kale be even harder so I want
to ask about Apple and the iMac because
they they tout a 5k iMac I've never
actually looked at one but is that is
this somewhere in this in the spectrum
or is 5km marketing so we have looked at
that and again with 4k content upskilled
slightly you know to match the 5k it's
really hard to tell and again it's all
about a really tiny screen I mean
compared to a TV or an IMAX screen and
you know you got to sit really close and
you got to have the content be the kind
of content like stills or highly
detailed stuff that really shows it off
so if you see demos of this stuff you're
gonna see slow pans over nature and you
know things with a lot of lines and
really that that kind of content is what
these show off this high tax resolution
I just imagined cat smart going to like
a friend's house who like claims they
have a 4k TV and he's just like inches
away from the screen like no it's not
well you need a liar you know be like a
jeweler is magnifying the screen to
actually see the pixels even with 4k TVs
especially the small ones so imagine an
8k TV the pixels are gonna be literally
indiscernible so so you can just tell
people you have an 8k TV and tell people
that now well these ones you know if
they get launched we might have to
actually go up with a microscope to
actually see that they're a Kay you know
can't take these guys words for it
anyway if you're looking at our set on
background this is our 52 K TV super
ultra high def yeah yeah just it was
made specifically for our show
ironically as we're locked in to 1080
he on the outgoing so you can't
appreciate no just tell everybody it's a
Cayman yeah don't ever know it's like
bragging about that Canadian girlfriend
that no one can ever prove what got our
super claws I could totally tell the
difference yeah doesn't go to our school
you don't know all right let's take one
from n Sanjay a K offers better aliasing
over four K that's a question does eight
K offer better aliasing over 4 K because
in the studio's they only use 5 to 6 K
cameras yeah so again it really helps to
capture at a higher resolution um
Studios love a K and all that stuff in
the camera because it gives you room to
play on the Edit side and polish up your
boo-boos editor guy can tell us in fact
they can frame stuff really wide and
then just use the parts that they want
oh god the image okay and we were talked
about 4k that was one of the things that
really excited about Sony Pictures said
we love 4k you know we can make the
1080p image whatever we want
same thing with 8k even right larger
with aliasing again it'd be really hard
to see the difference in practice I
think that's basically just jagged edges
smoothing out you know again that'll
show it more readily than anything else
but already with 4k it's really hard to
see if the contents produce well okay
all right here's one from Ryan Williams
when okay let's take actually a few from
the same train of thought when does it
get to a point when her eyes can't
notice the difference Jacob Lombardo
expands this is a serious question at
one point do these increase in
resolution go past the human eyes I'm
sensing a trend here the short answer is
yes they're already past the human eye
so if you think about a 50 inch 4k TV
there's I mean there's a bunch of math I
don't know if thought my head so I'm not
gonna say it right now but if you get
close enough you can kind of see a
difference but if you get a little bit
further back and I have test patterns
where there's literally lines you know
30 or 20 lines and and if you get back
clothed far enough they blend together
and for everybody else that's slightly
different depending on your vision but
if you're in that range all of a sudden
the resolution doesn't matter at all and
there are a lot of people to claim oh
yeah I can see it or you know side by
side blah blah blah but you know if you
talk to an optometrist there is a real
limit to human
and with 4k at 50 inches you're kind of
already there if you go you know again a
lot larger screen set a lot closer you
might be able to see some difference
with a k and it's not a hard stop
because there's a lot of pixels in
between 8k and 4k so you know there's a
range but at the end of the day we're
kind of already there and that's kind of
what Apple is talking about with Retina
displays for example you're okay you're
at the level of being able to not
discern the difference in phone screens
are kind of already there as well with
very large phone screens you know high
resolution you there's really no benefit
to putting extra pixels on those things
so TVs are larger screens so they're
gonna try and get a little higher on the
number so ultimately this is a matter of
you know 4k is kind of run its course in
terms of like buzz or hype so they've
just needed to invent a new term well a
lot of things about 4k for example you
can buy a 4k TV for like 300 bucks an
hour yes you know so that's an issue for
manufacturers they wanna be able to
charge Warren you know make profits
which their companies that's what they
do right they need to have a premium
Branum feature it out the other issue is
that OLED out there which is a real
improvement in pure quality OLED TVs
from LG and others those are you know
the best in picture quality right now
and if you have a not OLED TV LCD like
Samsung and Vizio other guys make they
don't make an OLED TV they want to be
able to have something you can put up
against OLED and say hey look these guys
may have amazing contrast in color and
off angle and all this stuff but our we
have more pixels you know you know we
have more of these things that you can't
you'll see well you know right that's
exactly what it boils down to eight is
higher than four and you're comparing a
short hole led to an 8k LCD especially a
LCD cost the same or a little bit lower
and you're in the store and you're going
it's higher than four gimme v8o so
that's an interesting point do you think
the AKG V's will be cheaper than the
ohlet's it depends so like I said at the
beginning a 77 inch OLED TV right now is
about 10 grand
Nate 210 that's massively expensive
obviously but the 65s are in the three
$2,500 range so I don't think these you
know let's say Samsung comes out with a
65 inch a K TV I don't think that thing
is going to be less than the 65 inch
OLED at 3 grand
okay I especially at the beginning
because these things just started coming
right right
another thing with with a que is that
there's HDMI 2.1 which is a new standard
for hdmi transmission that can handle
the higher bandwidth and higher
resolution and it's kind of exciting for
us
TV nerds that maybe this will be the
first TV that has HDMI 2.1 which would
be kind of neat oh this is an extra
nerdy question but when do we get rid of
those HDMI cables and go completely
wireless talk to Apple seems like
there's an opportunity there their place
for cooling yeah but know that I think
they're gonna be around for a while
because it's just really efficient and
there's not you know once you hide the
cables behind your TV and everything
that we really understands they're there
when you're walking around the phone
Wireless has a lot more of a benefit but
within the TV there are wireless hdmi
solutions out there right now and they
work pretty well so you know if you
really want to get rid of the wire it's
great with projectors and long cable
runs and things like that you can buy
one but they're you know just not that
practical ok I got to wonder what the
impact is going to be on bandwidth for
content delivery if we keep blowing up
the pixels or 5g comes in about 5g yeah
that's a really good point so if you're
a Comcast or you're a purveyor of
bandwidth you're loved and all these
increases in resolution because they
just sucked down the megabits and make
people upgrade their packages your
internet home delivery so we're you know
right now they call for 15 to 20
megabits per second for 4k streaming for
Netflix and those guys they're you know
just do a little bit of math nobody's
amassed anything but I'm figuring at
least 40 to 50 megabits per second to
stream a single a.k show now for a lot
of households that's the entire
bandwidth who has that right I mean
seriously and and and if you don't then
hey let's go out and Patra for it so
everybody makes a lot of money that
actually kind of plays into the comment
coming in from Jade 49 asking can 8 K
TVs really only function in big sizes to
which I kind of like chuckle to myself a
little bit because I'm picturing like
those little like CRT TVs used to get
that were like portable I was like why
would you want content with like no no
no no for like phones well that makes
sense
yes oh and another thing where you talk
about phones it kind of makes sense
verse 4 reality is an area where higher
resolution does make sense as well so
right now with VR you're kind of limited
to the
screen and the way phones work is and we
put something in your Samsung gear VR
you got to use half of the resolution on
the phone so if you can double that
resolution then you can get rid of the
screen door effect get some nice what
actually makes sense on a mobile device
or on a VR headset yes I think there
there's some room for the extra pixels
to pay a dividend okay although there's
only I think as a as far as I know
there's only one 4k phone out there yeah
and and the way manufacturing works
these guys have to get on board and
start putting them out at that higher
resolution that's the only real use case
that I can see that makes sense for 4k
on the phone they're like those screens
are too small for there to be any real
other tangible benefit right yeah I mean
there is you know again the shooting
side of it makes sense you have to edit
and but when you're consuming it on you
know video or VR or anything like that I
think it's it's hard to think up another
use case besides yeah we actually wrote
an article I'm trying to Google it right
now about when 4k isn't enough the case
for higher resolutions and it talks
about VR it talks about 360 cameras
which is another market where you know
shoots in every direction and and that's
less about the screen more about the
camera right right exactly the capturing
yeah and PCs and gaming so this is
something where you know resolution can
go up a little bit in PCs and you get
textures and things like that going on
so we're now just getting video game the
console games in 4k right they're just
catching up to and and that gets back to
what I said it beginning so actually
smash is not gonna be in 4k no switch no
switch games it's and yeah it's an HD
the whole problem with all this extra
resolution is that it requires so much
more processing power on the cgi side
which can include video games or movies
or whatever when you're generating
graphics at these high resolutions you
often get to the point you talk to
gaming guys and we look at games is it
better to have 1080p at 60 frames a
second or you know less resolution at
120 frames per second you know right the
smoother frame rate looks better and you
only have so much bandwidth so you're
sucking up all this bandwidth with with
static pixels to make higher resolution
whereas you can use the bandwidth to
again create an increase frame rate yeah
you can increase color definition you
can do
a lot of other things with the bandwidth
besides using it for pixels so you know
a lot of people say HD are 1080p HD are
it sometimes gonna look better than 4k
non HD are you know so you're spending
your pixels not on increasing detail but
increasing other areas of picture
performance that are much more important
I'm glad you brought that up
Josh boy I was just asking about what's
better for K or 1080p with HDR right
right so 1080p HD R is really
non-existent right now you only get it
if you're watching Netflix and your
Netflix hasn't scaled up to 4k yet you
know when you first turn it on it's like
boop boop you can actually watch some
1080p HD R for a couple seconds or if
you have a you know that slow connection
but right now there it doesn't really
exist 10 4k and HDR go hand-in-hand
right now in the market so all the 4k
blu-ray discs have HDR on their 4k
there's no real 1080p HD are out there
but you can see that happening for
example with broadcast where or cable
where bandwidth is a lot more limited
and these guys have to send out you know
as efficient a signal as they can and
maybe you'll opt for you know again
sacrificing some of that pixel some of
that resolution to get better
HDR increases your contrast it makes
color better there's a lot of benefits
to HDR I definitely prefer it if you're
gonna choose between HDR and 4k I'll
take HDR every time mmm
Jacob Lombardo this is going to be the
next 3d useless feature flop no provider
is going to make a que footage since the
extreme price and no difference with
human eyes seeing the video picture
James Taylor I love you music we have
zero cable signal at 4k so why are we
even talking about this I mean I'm gonna
be uncharacteristically forgiving and
optimistic cause it's fun technology but
cats
is there really any benefit to this
besides the cosmetic appeal well okay
let me let me take a step back we said
very similar things when 4k came out and
it's really hard to tell Jensen with 4k
right but turn around today for Kay's
everywhere all it takes is scaling of
the technology it's it's kind of
everywhere okay a lot more places to be
right yeah if you pay Netflix 15 bucks a
month you get but loads of 4k and
everybody watch it all behind it's in
every home eight KS already good to be
obsolete well is is is the debut for
Kate Kate Kate Evie's right now making
4k obsolete absolutely not in fact it's
not even making 1080p obsolete all these
things can coexist
hmm they're still out there and and the
point is that you know in a couple years
every TV is gonna be 8k just like right
now almost every high-end mid-range TV
above two and three hundred bucks above
fifty inches is 4k so with LCD which is
the predominant display technology it's
super easy to scale up resolution so
there's no reason for these guys not to
make everything a Kay as soon as
possible regardless of what happens on
the content side I set them up you knock
them down Katz from Fernando at what
size screen do you think the advantage
of 8k comes into play I want projector
size TVs 52 78 is not big enough
I want the cinema experience alright so
100 inches I'll just throw it out there
I mean and how close can you sit to 100
inch TV without ralphing Tom yeah right
do you like to be the dude in the front
of the movie theater I'll put it that
way because that guy might be able to
see the difference on an 8k screen
bringing up movie theaters 4k projection
is out there in movie theaters and if
you say close enough you can see the
pixels so right there is a real benefit
to getting agent 8k projection Samsung
itself makes these cinema screens which
wall-sized crazy awesome displays for
movies and you know you can see those
things really benefitting for 4k but
sure hundred inch is fine again you
gotta look close you got the right
content you guys sit close blah blah
blah blah so speaking of content Larry
Mitchell's asking how soon are we
actually going to see contents showing
up in a ke do we know of anybody who's
working on developing new programming or
film 2020 that because NHK which is the
broadcaster in Japan is coming out with
they've already announced a ke footage
for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo yeah so
accents and it makes perfect sense
because you can stage the Olympics
everything is what's happening it's
super easy to film that stuff yeah
they've been doing 4k Olympic stuff for
a while so yeah I think that's gonna be
the first time it really comes out so it
makes sense for there to be a few TVs
out there that you can watch out okay
there you go Ricky B would you rather
have resolution or refresh which is more
important in the long run well there's a
point at which resolution is important
and then after that
becomes unimportant and refresh becomes
more important but the downside of
refresh is has anybody seen The Hobbit
and high refresh rate or watched Billy
Lynn's long halftime walk which was a
movie that Angley filmed in 100 frames
per second and it was shown in six
frames per second it's really really
smooth and looks really weird
so the refresh rate issue with video
games kind of as much as you can get is
great but with film a lot of people are
used to and want the 24p look of film
where refresh rate really doesn't help
you at all so and and for example a lot
of sports are shown shot and shown at 60
frames and that's really nice but it'd
be awesome if you could show them at 120
frames because your eye I don't really
know what your ivory fresh is at but
it's higher than 60 120 you can tell the
difference so you know for anything but
film
I'll take refresh rate once it's safe
for a resolution or higher it's
interesting how organically this
conversation is flowing because an
Sanjay is asking why do films still use
24 frames legacy that's what people are
used to so I think there's also an
element that it's not about the highest
quality of delivery it's about the
manipulation of your emotions so the
element of lower frame rates sometimes
implies harder faster action that
heavily used in a lot of action films I
used to use it when I would shoot music
videos just for the sake of the drama
and it added an increased sense of I
don't know in enhanced action really
yeah and and in right now for example
you talk to guys that really like it
like Angley who's the Titanic guy I keep
forgetting so he's a big advocate of
high frame rate in film and so he's
talking about doing avatar too in high
frame rate Peter Jackson obviously with
The Hobbit
so these guys really believe in the high
frame rate and they think that you know
what this is how our film should look
and they're the directors and you know
far be it from us the viewer to say you
know what this would be better if it was
24p so it all really is totally
subjective much more than something like
detail the frame rate of film most
people want to shoot in 24p cameras and
24p for a reason and you know that's
what people are used to but i think if
we had evolved in a different track and
you know we'd all evolved with 60 frames
per sec
film that wouldn't be an issue and
everybody would you know not really care
about that
all right we kind of rep we got reppin
guys just realize that time right away
sorry have fun with cats everybody
