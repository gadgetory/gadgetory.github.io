trendy right now but this is taking a
love of retro to the next level
this Street Fighter 2 machine is one of
several cabinets sold by a company
called arcade 1up it's designed for you
to relive the glory days of going to the
arcade without the need for a pocketful
of quarters let's get a few basics out
of the way for one this is not as big as
a real arcade machine it's just about 4
feet tall you have to sit to play at it
or put it on a riser to bring it to
standing height but if you look at the
design it has the same heart as the
original machines there's even old text
boxes explaining how to play oh and you
have to build it I found the process was
pretty straightforward and simple you
can do it yourself it took me about an
hour and a half or so to put it together
it's made of lightweight wood with
plexiglass that covers a monitor now all
the computer bits are tucked in with the
17 inch LCD screen in the back panel so
this cabinet is hollow inside it weighs
about 63 pounds when you're done so it's
manageable if you need to move it around
which is good for someone like me with
weak arms because all my power is in my
legs now let's talk about those controls
because that is what you care about
coming close to listen you hear that
clicking is yeah it's got just the right
feel you want between the joystick and
the buttons tugging on that joystick is
gonna tug on your nostalgic heartstrings
you're gonna yearn for the days when
games didn't turn you into a smartphone
zombie back when you had to talk to
people to figure out the special moves
back when there was no saving you played
to the end or it was game over and
that's why you're buying this right
well the nostalgia is not gonna come
cheap these start at $300 you got to
think of it more like a home decor piece
it's like a work of art that honors an
era of the past and you'll play it once
in a while or when your friends come
over
so Street Fighter is one of my favorite
games but these machines do come in
other flavors there's one for centipede
asteroids rampage and Galaga each come
with a few pre-loaded games the Street
Fighter model has three versions of
Street Fighter 2 along with the joystick
and buttons there is an on/off switch
and a volume switch so you could leave
it muted and play in the background if
you hold down a player select button
it'll take you to a menu screen and the
speakers are right over down here and
keep in mind a few things since it is
smaller and lightweight if you do get
two players getting really into it
this thing is going to shake a little
and players are going to be closer to
each other then you would be when you're
playing at an actual arcade machine but
an actual arcade machine is gonna cost
you more than two thousand dollars on
eBay this is what you're getting for
$300 so don't be such a crybaby about it
okay arcade one up says they're gonna be
making more types of these arcade
machines so here comes a new challenger
in the fight for your retro gaming
system gift money and you know what the
way I see it if you love Street Fighter
and if you have the space in your home
how do can you say no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
