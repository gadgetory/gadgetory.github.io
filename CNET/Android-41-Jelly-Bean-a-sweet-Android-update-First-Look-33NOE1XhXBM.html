introduced android 4.0 sandwich but time
never stands still at the google sweet
shop because here comes android 4.1
jelly bean I'm jessica's all cord for
Cena with a first look at jelly bean
running on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus here
are the highlights first google has sped
up the entire operating system so that
everything loads a little bit faster and
a little bit smoother here I'm comparing
it to a Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.0
now if you like widgets then you're
going to love that certain ones are now
resizable as long as you have space for
them on any given home screen I also
really love what Google is doing to
enrich the notifications bar now when
someone emails you when you miss a call
when you take a screenshot you get a
google plus photo and so on you'll be
able to get more information about
whatever the item is in the notification
shade you'll also be able to interact
with it from there and as usual you can
swipe it away when you're done google
has done a lot of work with voice and
keyboard search it's jazzed up voice
actions with a completely revamped
search step that you can now pull up
from the home button on the bottom you
can ask a range of questions like Google
when was a retha Franklin born show me
images of kittens sometimes you'll get a
card with the answers and other times
you'll get web search results you can
also voice navigate to a location search
nearby and so on but possibly the most
useful new feature is Google now which
is connected to the google voice app it
can do things like automatically
estimate your commute times check your
flight times and present sports scores
for your favorite teams it knows your
favorite teams because you have searched
for them the way it works is that Google
will periodically check your GPS
coordinates and calendar to see where
you are learn your commute and discern
when you're traveling since I just got
this phone I haven't actually had a lot
of time to test out those features but
they do sound really useful in a vaguely
creepy sort of way another aspect of
voice is offline typing so if you're
somewhere where you can't get online you
can still dictate a
message or email it works pretty well i
am now dictating an email message from
the train and I have absolutely no Wi-Fi
connectivity and no data connection
either period the new google play it
brings magazine subscriptions movie
purchases and TV episodes you can
download all the content for offline
viewing which is awesome for my daily
train commute google currents similarly
shows content like cnet headline news
for example and it's in a swipeable
magazine style that looks really good
moving on to the camera app jellybean
now lets you swipe to see your recently
shot photos and if you pinch a picture
you'll get a smaller film strip that you
can swipe through you can also swipe
away a photo to delete it and you can
undo that if you change your mind the
last feature i'm going to show you is
another terrific addition Android Beam
is now expanding to also let you share
larger content like photos and videos
from one compatible phone to another
that's in addition to urls Maps contact
information and all the other stuff you
could already share with being believe
it or not there's even more going on in
android 4.1 jelly bean so make sure that
you check out seeing its full review for
all the details I'm jessica's all court
and you're watching cnet TV
