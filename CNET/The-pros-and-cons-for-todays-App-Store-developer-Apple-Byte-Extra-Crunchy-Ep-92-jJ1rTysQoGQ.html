crunchy let's get to the show hello
everybody we are not live but we are
here in the studio together it's the
Apple bad extra country podcast with
your host mr. Brian Tong yeah we're in
the house mr. Beecham and the pho 92 if
you're listening this right now I'm
actually on a beach feeling the Sun
against my skin it is here the waves Oh
trust me I'm already here I'm seeing
them I'm hearing I'm smelling them right
now but welcome to the show Apple byte
extra crunchy episode 92 we're gonna do
something a little different today
because we wanted to kind of really dig
in a little bit more specifically to
talk about the apps or an app
development and all those things so what
I wanted to do is bring in my good
friend back way back from our Apple
retail store days yes if you didn't know
that I mean I've said it multiple times
on the show that I used to work for
Apple retail way back in the day oh gee
oh gee my good buddy Joe chip Polanski
he is now officially his official title
if we want to go buy that the creative
director of balmy brain interactive has
his own apps as an indie developer has
apps with bombing brain and really a
jack-of-all-trades Joe thank you so much
for coming on the show
welcome yeah it's a pleasure man it's
been a long time since we talked it's
been a while again I don't even remember
when you might know that when did the
when did the Palo Alto Apple Store man
open was it around 2005 or 6 I can't
remember do you remember that it was pre
iPods you know I it's got to be like
yeah I think it was closer to 2002 or so
I say but it was a while ago yeah so
that's how that's how far back we go we
were there
you know like you said for iPods iPhone
we were there for those first launches
and I think it's really great because
not only do we have that connection from
the past
I mean you are now you know a developer
I wanted to kind of first bring up so
people get a sense of maybe a little bit
of your journey and be like okay and
people that don't know you have your own
podcast called release notes that
focuses really deep dives and this stuff
but maybe you could tell people a little
about your journey from maybe a little
before the Apple store and then how you
have evolved in how you've gone to where
you are now sure my background actually
it was I was an English teacher believe
it or not that's what I studied in
school and I was teaching yeah lovely
city atmosphere but yeah so I was a
teacher for about five years first in
the Philadelphia area where I grew up
but then I moved down to California and
I taught for one last year there and I
was always interested in tech though I
was always doing kind of graphic stuff
and so when I quit teaching I let that
go I was looking for work you know in
graphic design and I found it full-time
job doing that but I also at the same
time applied for the Apple store and so
it was one of my first part-time jobs
outside of teaching and I would come in
on nights and weekends basically and
they kind of hired me to you know their
idea behind the part-timers were like
people who knew nothing about retail but
kind of knew the Mac and knew apples
stuff and we would go in there and I did
some of the like the presentations oh
yeah
yeah it's not used to do presentations
and whatnot and then you know I would
tell people I was a musician and things
like that so I was helping people with
buying Pro Solutions and it was a lot of
fun and that's where I met you that is
where we met I think also though as an
indie developer you know you were doing
graphic design but you weren't
necessarily doing coding or anything at
that time well what kind of drove you in
that direction as well yes you know
drove me all the way to the iPhone
basically a mobile development happens
you know people were there remember it
was you know prior to that it was not
really an open field for any user there
are established Indies out there there
were people making some decent money on
the Mac but it seems like a pipe dream
that you'd never be able to start your
own company software company at that
point you know is like go work for Adobe
or go work for Microsoft or Apple or one
of those companies if you really wanted
to build software and the iPhone
all that and so a couple friends of mine
who were computer science majors got in
touch with me right after the iPhone
right at the app store really in 2008
and they said hey you know we're
building some apps we need some graphics
we heard you're doing graphic design now
do you want to help us out and that's
how I got involved with ani brain and I
started doing graphics for them and over
the years what ended up happening was
you know I was doing the graphic design
that was great but more and more I was
asking lots of questions about code and
so the two guys gets me bugging me and
basically saying you gotta just start
you gotta start coding yourself you're
you're asking too many questions you're
asking all the right questions you're
obviously interested in this and so I
started learning the code on my own I
build a few apps of my own and it really
helped me to be a better designer but
also to build my own apps but then also
to help them with code along the way now
I do want to I want to do drop drop a
plug at least one of the balmy brain
apps is teleprompt plus which is a
teleprompter app which a lot of people
now you see a lot of people on the go
although yeah you can talk to your phone
or to a camera on the fly there is still
more than enough reasons or uses to
actually have a teleprompter type app on
their phone can you name drop some of
the other apps that you guys at mommy
brain have and as well as maybe some of
your indie apps just to give people a
sense of like okay this guy has more
than just like one app under his belt
success with and yeah you're right I
mean we've got senators we've got lots
of people using that app and it's you
know it's pretty useful in its it's had
a great amount of success for it so we
also build another app called set lists
which is similar it's kind of a lyric
prompter more for musicians real in
bands and that was actually my original
idea when the iPad came out we all kind
of did a powwow and we said what should
we build for this new thing and I came
up with this idea like you know whenever
I'm performing on stage I can't remember
lyrics you know so it would be nice to
have the lyrics up there and so then we
kind of molded that idea into a standard
kind of teleprompter and build that
first and then after a while we decided
to go ahead and try the setlist app as
well and that's been doing well for us
lately it's been growing quite a bit and
the musicians are gonna give you quite a
bit
and it's it's really helpful so you can
put your chord changes in there you can
also put your you know your lyrics and
instead of it scrolling you know
constantly it's more like a cue card
system where you see one verse at a time
I for one course of the time and you
advance it either with the foot control
or do it with a simple swipe and you
know so that that's not really well for
us
in addition I've got a few apps on my
own I built a timer a little timer app
called Finn
with your French but the idea is
basically when I was giving
presentations I still like to present on
stage so the old teacher and me I was
having to practice a lot and like you
know you have to do it exactly a 45
minute talk or a 30 minute sock I needed
a big giant timer in front of me they
couldn't tell me exactly how much time I
had left and you know when there's 10
minutes left the screen turns you know
green and then you know when it's time
minutes left orange you know that kind
of thing and so I built that and that's
been doing pretty well for me I'd look
better as a solo thing I also have
another one called next to Y which is an
aspect ratio calculator was kind of that
was the first half I felt sort of helped
me when I was doing design work that
that is absolutely impressive I went
there I did go there okay so I wanted to
die yes so I wanted to dive into you
know for our listeners and everyone is
obviously excited about iOS 11 just
because how it is obviously no matter
what a new operating system or updated
operating system for the iOS platform
and really does change how we use the
iPad specifically but I wanted to dig
into the App Store because when I first
saw it I was actually a little
frustrated for developers because I felt
like especially on the screen real
estate of the iPhone I'm like this feels
like it's an app store that has less
discovery but features because of kind
of the cards and it is a cleaner look
but features a way of like you know it
is this mostly gonna be more sponsor
people app developers with money that
are gonna be able to buy placement more
than allowing the discovery to happen
and really give any developers and I
know they have an indie developer
section here and there but it seemed
like there was less discovery I'm
curious as it of
for yourself what are your thoughts with
the facelift of the iOS 11 App Store and
maybe how it might help you or hurt you
yeah you know and talking to a lot of my
indie developer friends a lot of people
have had that same reaction that you've
had and I understand it completely like
you know there is less on the screen at
any given time and so there are fewer
things being featured at once but as a
designer what I also know is that if
you're seeing less fewer things on the
screen that means each thing that's on
the screen is larger and so those larger
features are going to catch people's
attention better I also like the design
in that it's it feels finely like it's
Apple like for me the App Store always
sort of looked like a bargain base then
you know they were cramming as much
stuff in there was just a bunch of icons
and so people didn't have a whole lot to
go on when they're making purchase
decisions and I think that really helped
or hurt rather the the amount of time
that people are spending in there
anymore I love about you I don't go to
the App Store at all anymore unless I am
searching for a specific thing I've
already heard of I think what Apple's
trying to do with this design is to get
people back into a habit of just showing
up you know just like they did with the
Apple retail stores they bucked the
trend yeah everyone was telling them oh
you're gonna you're gonna you know pack
as much product into every square inch
of this storage again an apple so well
no we're gonna have giant ceilings that
like put five products at once you have
these giant you know clean tables with
only four things out on them and people
there were nuts but the Apple Store has
become a place that people hang out and
I think they're trying to do the same
thing with the App Store that they're
trying to make it a place that's why
they're doing all this curated content
they're gonna be writing these detailed
in-depth articles about different kinds
of apps and like you know stories about
developers they're just trying to get
something they're giving people a reason
to show up in the store every day and
then the hope is once you're there
you'll start browsing again a little
more now unfortunately what they don't
seem to have addressed much is the
search and the search is still kind of
at least in the betas that I play that
so far doesn't seem to have improved a
whole lot and so as long as that search
is kind of a problem I think
discoverability is gonna continue to be
a problem so I'm a little worried on
that end but you know that I know that
Apple takes this time and you know
people complain for years and then
suddenly they just one day wake up and
decide
waiting for that but you know I think
the improvements overall are gonna be
good for everyone involved
I know I understand we mean like if
you're a big multi-million dollar
company you're gonna get more you know
even more real estate than you're
already getting the rich get richer but
that's the waste the AppStore is one of
the things we talk about on my podcast
release notes all the time is that it's
an indie developer you really can't rely
on the App Store as a marketing tool you
really got to get people out there on
your own and find you know find your
customers yourself and not rely on Apple
so much yeah you know that's a great
point that you made just at the end of
that um you know it's shame on Brian and
we're gonna talk about it more but a you
know you have this great podcast release
notes that really digs deep into some of
the things that we're touching upon now
but really digs deep into the life of an
indie developer the challenges decisions
that you can make on product from design
standpoint from you know from
functionality standpoint real I mean
that that's some great nitty gritty
stuff in that world and honestly more
than anything I learn a lot from just
listening a few episodes that you guys
have so people that are curious about
app development should definitely check
out release notes and Joe is one of the
voices of that show the thing though
great point is what you just said you
can't rely on the App Store to get your
product out there yeah you really can't
I mean its people and they're you no
matter what you make chances are ten
other people made an app that does a
similar thing and again once they get to
the office or even if they find your app
via search there they don't really have
a whole lot to go on they got a couple
screenshots they're not going to read
your description and they're just gonna
go with the cheapest thing they can find
or you know that's why a lot of us
lately have been moving towards more of
a free kind of download at least so you
can try it out for a little bit you know
Apple did help us with that with the
subscription changes last year where
more of us can kind of you know allow
almost they don't really call it a free
trial but you can kind of have a sort of
a functionality and you can have a
subscription that you know the last 14
days and then shuts down you know
anything that gets people to be able to
try before they buy is a good thing and
you know I really think that that's sort
of where the software game is heading in
general
we really can't count upon it's not the
old days you know it's not like you had
these few small little band of customers
that we're willing to pay 50 bucks for
things they just aren't so instead we
have a ton of people and another one to
pay for hey you know you have to find
those few people who are willing to pay
for a good solution but you know you can
expect them to pay a lot until they've
had a chance to really see to your
product that you're serious well you go
ahead go start do you guys have like a
marketing team like it seems like you're
saying this is a lot has a lot to do
with marketing so as soon as you guys
make an app or you have a marketing team
working with you while you're building
the app or how does that work yeah sort
of our marketing blog posts and we reach
out to you know journalists whenever we
can and you know we try to get the word
out I do talks at conferences all the
time or you know anything that we can do
we've actually done some partnerships
for the teleprompter and one of the
smartest things we did was a bunch of
hardware manufacturers came to us people
that were making sort of mirror
reflector devices hardware for the iPad
or the foot pedal control the Bluetooth
foot pedals for stopping and starting
and stuff like that they they came to us
and they basically said you know what we
have this great hardware we don't really
feel like writing an app do you mind if
we just tell people you know send them
you show them your app when they ask
questions about it and you know maybe
you'd hook us up with those you know a
link on our on your store you know on
your website to battle and so we kind of
do these back and forth and I think we
end up on the better end of that deal
because while they sell a two hundred
dollar piece of hardware for customer
you know when our app is only you know
$20 $25 you know they're actually going
out and doing a lot of marketing that
trade shows that we can't afford to go
to they go to nab and those kinds of
shows and they're there they're showing
every customer our software so that
really helps quite a bit and you know
those kinds of partnerships I think have
been a big thing for us but it's hard
it's really hard to do marketing because
it's the last thing you wanted to do you
know as a developer as a designer you
want to be focusing on your app you want
to be working on it and you know it's
you have to just kind of step on the
side I've heard a couple of smart people
in these out there you know suggesting
that you should be spending like almost
half your time on marketing
if you really want us to see it that
seems like a bummer you know like I
understand like you guys are kind of
like artists you want to put out your
product and be like here it is world and
check it out and you know and then it's
like no one sees me you get crickets you
know so yeah that seems like a like a
struggle in a lot of ways it's easier to
be in business now than it was 20 30
years ago you know prior prior to the
App Store you had to put yourself where
in a box and you had to convince a
retail store a shelf it for you yeah
remember even at the apples are like for
actual apps like actual box software but
maybe 20 30 slots tops like it has to be
shipped yeah shipped to the store and
they used to take like 50% top you know
if you were lucky enough for them to
stock it for you so the 30 percent feels
like a lot to people but it's you know
it's easy to forget how much worse it
well this is back in the day and how
much smaller the audience was really for
apps I mean people were paying for house
that's because it was just this small
Anish of like you know really dedicated
people that wanted to do things with
their computers priorly iPhone yeah I
was one of those people that spend way
too money on those apps if I don't so
Joe I do have another question maybe
just the current state of the App Store
or even for app developers are there
things that Apple has done recently that
you really liked or things that and also
maybe a little bit of both things that
maybe they've done that you that you
you're not really happy about yeah in
the right directions for most things I
mean obviously the technology gets
better every year they give some more
toys more things to play with more
opportunities more great hardware that
inspires people to buy hardware and then
want to go find software for it you know
I think that you know and and over the
years you know they have given us a lot
more stuff they're giving us stats now
about our apps and our sales and how
they're being used they're giving us
better tools for marketing a lot of
people complain when they've recently I
don't know if you talked about on this
show that the ratings prompts the
official ratings drop that they've given
us now instead of everyone writing up
their own solution for like hey you like
the app please rate as five stars they
gave us they gave us a new controller
that people complain about it because
it's not exactly the way I would have
written it but you know I put this thing
in my app
I'm getting you know it my reviews have
improved you know I'm getting more of
them and more of them are five stars it
yeah so I think that you know they do do
these things they just happen much
slower than most of us watch and so
we're impatient and we want to move
forward and you know Apple takes its
time and does things correctly you know
and it's frustrating at the same time I
also I do feel like iOS is still being
hindered a little bit on the
professional side you know the iPad
sales are kind of slumping because yeah
it's still tied to iOS which is really
the iPhones platform and the iPhone is
still more consumer oriented and yeah
they did a lot of nice improvements in
iOS 11 not really diggin you know
working on it on my iPad I love that
they added features only to the iPad
that are not I phone specific I hope
that that continues because really like
we need like the professional software
is where an indie can really you know
make them much better living you're
trying to sell people $1 apps or you
know trying to start a social network
you know without multi-million dollar
back in you know funding kind of stuff
here you know that's not where most of
us want to be it's hard enough to do our
own marketing all I think I want to do
is being hunting down funding right so a
lot of this would prefer to sell ask for
thirty or forty dollars and you know
what these promotional apps you can good
apps you know really nice you know
professional types of artists tools and
things like that you know you can sell
it a higher price and you can target
that smaller audience but the iPad is
seen as a professional device as much
yet as I love it today so the faster
than Apple can keep improving and making
it more of a pro device yeah I mean I've
been a big fan of people that know I've
been a big fan of the iPad from day one
I still love it I write when the new
iPad pro came out and then when iOS 11
was showing I'm like finally they're
giving this product like an actual
identity that makes it different from
iOS not as much as you and I would like
to kind of take it to the next level and
really feel like hey we could maybe one
day actually get an Adobe Photoshop app
but now it's you know other companies
have stepped in to kind of fill that
void with affinity photo but at least it
feels more like a device that can do
more and hopefully that this is they
don't just stop at this I I would be
disappointed though if like in another
two years it's kind of the same as what
we got now because they gave us so much
more stuff yeah the last time they kinda
give us a little bit of iPad stuff yeah
exactly it was in two years the place
right yeah exactly
well look out guys it's true and I
didn't use it all that much yeah it is
kind of janky yeah now the way they
fixed a split screen in the new version
is much better and like having the dock
there and things like that are
definitely gonna make that more useful
to me I'm already using it more than I
ever did but I agree with you I hope
that this isn't like an every two year
kind of improvement thing you know I
know I know the iPhones where they make
their money and they really need to keep
on top of that but at the same time you
know it's the same thing with the you
know recently they announced they're
gonna do this iMac Pro and there we
really kind of invigorating the Mac Pro
program after like five years of that
going nowhere you know I have a feeling
that someone in Apple is kind of waking
up to this idea that like well these Pro
customers are important to us and so
although we make 99% more money on the
iPhone we also have to take care of
these pros as well because that's where
our you know great innovations come from
and guess what when you're making
devices for pros that are nice you don't
have to make sixty billion of them every
month then you can you can put higher
tech stuff in them earlier without
having to worry about the the supply
chain and everything else keeping up
with that so I'm hoping we'll see faster
innovation as a result of that so 27 is
iPad next year that's my baby
yo table like copy table you know the
surface was getting there but we don't
really see that table thing anymore yeah
I get me there get me there I mean Joe
we're gonna ask a couple more questions
for any developers I know there's a lot
of people that listen to our show
they're just basically they love the
Apple ecosystem and the things about it
we like to be a little more balanced and
keep it raw and real with how we feel
about some of the things they do but for
an indie developer or someone who's
curious about that well what are some
maybe a few bullet points that you can
use as guidance for someone who's like
you know what I kind of do want to make
an app I want to try and happen what are
some of those points that you would kind
of say to someone that wants to dig in
it too no matter what age they are yeah
first and foremost realize that you can
do it I used to think that development
was magic you know just like a lot of
people do I
I would watch
developers and like they I say I
designed something I'd say here's what I
want this button to do and like five
minutes later it come back to me and it
was working and I thought wow I don't
know how to do that so that must be
crazy hard to do and then I started
learning development and yeah I really
think with tools like Swift playgrounds
you know i I've run through the
playgrounds actor you know I learned all
my develoment on objective-c but I
figured I wanted to dig into Swift
let me just download this app I know
it's like kind of geared towards kids a
little bit but it'll be fun then
honestly like there is no barrier to
that you can learn how to do this so
that's personal form you want it if you
want it badly enough you're gonna stop
and start a few times if the first
couple of times I've tried developments
I got really frustrated fast and I quit
and then I came back two or three months
later and then I quit but eventually it
does click and eventually things start
happening and it's it's really it's an
amazing feeling when you when you're
working on something for hours you're
trying to solve this problem and then
you realize it was a simple little thing
that you were missing and instead of
being angry at yourself for missing it
for three hours you're just amazed that
it finally works and it never ends with
development is a constant you know fun
thing needs to be able to cope these
computers into it so I say absolutely if
you want to do it you should try it you
should experimental talk to people find
meetups there's meetups all over the
place and every kind of city there's
cocoa heads there's other types of
meetups oh yeah we even started a few of
our own where we just get developers
together and we just talk developers are
incredibly generous people they will
look you know they will talk to you and
explain how they do things until the
cows come home and you know they're more
than happy to share their knowledge
their like any other kind of scientist
and so it's really fun that's you know
they are remarkably approachable once
once you get to meet them and so yeah if
you wanted to do it then the next thing
is like don't have expectations that
you're gonna make a million dollars you
know a lot of people got into app
development thinking that oh this is my
ticket I'm just gonna make it happen
sell it for a dollar and I'm home free
and it doesn't really work you really if
you don't you know make a living that's
fine like a lot of people make software
I made my little aspect ratio popular
because I've wanted to learn how to
develop not because I never think it
would make money and it doesn't make a
whole lot of it makes me eat some money
every month but you know hey that's
important pizza yeah you know got that
ad gives you pizza Louie pizza free
pizza we Joe let's not let's not
undersell that bad that's true that's
true
but if you want to start a business go
learn about business you know and that's
a whole separate set of skills that go
along with you know building an app and
honestly that's the only way to make it
was in India in the long term but you
know that doesn't mean you shouldn't be
playing with apps I mean lots of people
put apps on the store for fun they open
source them they throw them around and
they give them away for free and that's
just that's part of the spirit and
building things and that's that's fine -
maybe you build a tool that you want to
see that you don't see out there in the
world and who cares if anyone buys it as
long as you get to use it
awesome would you recommend that people
get like a graphic design background or
like learn anything because I feel like
that gives you an advantage right it
certainly helped me quite a bit and I
feel like I still to this day care about
those things like whenever I'm working
on a team I've done the contract work
for people whatever I'm working on a
team I always like kind of team up with
the designer right away and I'll be like
hey I'm your best friend because I know
I I know why you care about that being
two pixels to the left instead of
working I want to fix these things I
want these things to look the way I
design them and so you know I think it
does help quite a bit especially when
you're doing using interface builder
which is you know have a visual
graphical way of kind of laying out your
views on an iPhone screen and you know
the more you're using those tools the
more graphic design background easier is
gonna be for you I don't think it's a
requirement but it never hurts I mean a
lot of developers really don't know
anything about design and they go they
get along just fine but I think the ones
that do end up understanding their
designers better and they end up
communicating better with the designers
in the long run awesome well Joe I just
want to say thank you again so much for
your time in a your knowledge can you
talk about release notes a little bit to
someone who may have no idea about it
because I think it's better to hear from
the actual person who's involved in the
show yeah sure sure so it's it's me and
Charles Perry who's another independent
developer we met at a conference one
year and we're just you know chatting
with each other he's one of these really
outgoing gregarious guys I'm one of
these really shy people but he kind of
pulled these but are those guys that
make sure everyone has dinner plans what
do you get oh the coppers like do you
know anybody hey you want to come in
there and we just had a good time I
didn't think anything of it and two
months later he called me or emailed me
and he said hey you know what
certain podcasts I'm like okay why but
he said no I I respect you do and you're
an Indian you've had some success with
with you know Fela prime plus and so we
I want to talk about the business end of
being in India because at that time you
know a lot of people were basically you
go to conferences and all the advice was
just hire a designer and make a nice
icon and you'll make millions it's like
well it's not working out anymore and so
we wanted to talk about what actually is
involved in trying to build a business
and to my surprise I thought we'd get
like 30 episodes in an hour on two
hundred and something we've been doing
this for five years we started a
conference a couple of years ago so
every October we actually do a
conference this year it's in Chicago
it's sold out in like a week which is
amazing to us this year you know so
there are a lot of Indies out there who
want to build their business and so you
know we're doing talks instead of
talking about Swift all our talks are
about marketing or there abouts you know
building teams and communication and
writing and email strategies and things
like that and it's it's grown into its
own kind of community in its thing and
we're really enjoying it that's awesome
Joe Congrats on all that success man
that's that's the power of the Internet
baby
that's right that's power the Internet
so thanks again Joe for hanging with us
everyone check out release notes and you
can follow more of his work there we're
gonna take a quick little moment to say
bye to Joe and then we're gonna come
back and address and answer your
voicemails because you know how we do
this show is all about you and us
together as one thanks a lot Joe we
appreciate it buddy all right thank you
thanks
we're back we are back it just took a
few moments to feel that beat we're
gonna hit you up with the voicemails now
we got three just in the course of like
a day yes just since you see I'm telling
you guys listen the show and you call in
like right after it you have such a
better chance of like getting in totally
okay we're gonna go with it these are
just the voicemails for this week or
just to kind of catch up with you guys
and then again we will return in about
two more weeks with the official show
where it's Beach mi live cool let me
pull the phone number up on the screen
just so if you are listening and you
can't see this number it is
1-866-376-8255 out this just the iPhone
alone already has two very key products
that surround the kind of the ecosystem
of the phone there's a reason why the
Mac has been neglected but now they're
starting to be like Oh
we need to pay attention our pro
customers just like Joe earlier said in
our conversation so it takes them a long
time to kind of what we'd like to use
that word in Silicon Valley pivot and I
think that they've been they've just are
spread too thin with all these different
categories that unless they increase
their their uh you know headcount by
double they aren't gonna be able to keep
up with the demand so we'll see how it
plays out really the next two years if
we can be wowed by this new Mac Pro and
if they'll show love even from a
software development side you know we
talked about the iPad pro hopefully that
it'll see more changes that won't just
get this bump up and then in two years
we see another bump up that's just an
indication of just how thin they're
spread and a lack of focus because if
you look at even something like their
iPhone line what we have the entry-level
model which is a I guess a 6s right now
which is like the cheapest model
available then you have a seven you have
seven plus you know you have multiple
models of the phone in sizes as well so
it's just all those things combined and
that's just for one product line so
we'll see if they can get targeted a
little more focused or you can't do
everything that's the problem and we've
seen that from other companies that just
can't do everything
yeah Jojo said something during the
interview that Apple likes to take their
time and move really slow and get it
right I've never noticed that I've never
noticed that
which like which makes anything he also
followed that up by saying it's very
frustrating yeah but I mean that makes
sense like they do take a very long time
and they want to make it perfect and
make it their their way their perfect
idea perfect yeah so yeah but it is
frustrating oh yeah that's why y'all
listen to the show exact alright next
call hey Brian with for the touch ID for
the new iPhone 8 I think personally it
will be like Apple will incorporate it
into the lock button somehow because if
you notice the lock button is a bit
longer than the iPhone 7 and I think
that's where it's going to go but I
would like to get your opinion on it
love the show
bye thanks for calling in I don't
if it's you know I've we've heard kind
of things like that in the past but at
least based on the current rumors we've
there's no indication that that's what
they're actually going to do I think
it's possible in the future but right
now knowing you know as things have
lined up whether or not we see it in
this version or not I still like the
touch ID but if the face scanning works
as as well as we expect it to or hope it
does
I think people aren't gonna really care
whether there's a touch ID anything
anywhere if this face Kenny works as
well as a you know is believed to well
we'll see about that but I at least for
this Nick's coming iPhone I don't see
them putting it on the on the power but
you know they're you're right there's
space I think also though the thing is
that we've seen kind of fingerprint
sensors in earlier phones from Japan
where you kind of slide your finger on
it it's about the size of a rectangle
and you you honestly would need a little
more real estate on there but again I
just don't expect to see it this time
maybe down the future down the road in
the future it could happen but we'll see
after our podcast yesterday the reaction
in the YouTube comments was pretty big
in regards to the to the facial
recognition and one guy he actually had
some good points rat-rod studios dr our
customs limited I think that's like his
car shop or something he said how would
you unlock the iPhone if you had
sunglasses on or contact lenses or
you're outside in winter with a scarf
and a hat so you're gonna have to like
take all this stuff off him he's got
some valid points though yeah take
enough to remove clothing to unlock your
phone possibly I think based on the
algorithm that psy think though based on
the algorithm finds sunglasses no but if
they're using what they talked about
skin tone facial recognition
potential iris scanning recognition and
movement to that you have a live face
I've got imagine maybe a combination of
let's say X number of data points from
all of those combined is what will
unlock your phone right so maybe you
know find not your glasses but maybe
it's your not your chin or anything or
your cheekbones but if you can see like
your eyes the fact that you're moving
around the fact that you know who knows
how the skin
don't thing is I don't I don't think
it's gonna be like you have to
absolutely have a completely 100% pure
face unlock we don't know what this is
all speculation right which makes it fun
but I think he makes a great point of
like what exactly are the conditions to
do it yeah that was a great Cohen thank
you for that okay let's go to the next
call last call actually hey B Chan Khong
I love the show Lucas I'm from small
town Cedar Rapids Iowa my phone call
this week is in regards my current
situation I have the iPhone 6s plus I'm
on that upgrade your phone every year
program and I was actually a little too
upgraded March but I chose to hold out
for this next iPhone the iPhone X and
I'm starting to get a little concerned
you know I see these these rumors that
it's gonna be delayed till October
November potentially I'm also seeing
that a lot of people have been waiting
to upgrade to this phone and I'm
concerned that I'm gonna wait to upgrade
to the next iPhone and I'm not even be
able to get it till February March
anyways which at that point maybe I
should just get the seven plus now and
then a year from now I can get the
iPhone x16 I'm saying forget whatever
the next one is even so what do you guys
think I should do my wife has no help in
this situation she doesn't she's not
telling me anything so just let me know
what you guys think about it
and remember only you can prevent forest
fires thank you
smokey thank you I could tell you a way
to prevent forest fires you can't call
your wife out on the Apple bike because
if she listens cuz I know she obviously
totally listens to the show all the time
clearly look I I've talked about this
before I a lot of people that are on the
one the every year iPhone replacement or
upgrade program although you're on it
typically from what I've seen and heard
is that even though you're on that plan
doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna
get that new upgraded phone on day one
of the launch yeah like it's been a lot
of people said oh yeah I'm on the
upgrade play
but it it took a week or two before I
even got it I mean it seems like if
you're on the upgrade plan you should
get it right away like you would think
yeah like it's a trophy be like look I'm
on the upgrade plan guys that's like
incentive to sign up buddy you got a j1
buddy would think so you would think so
but uh but now that isn't the case your
second tier yeah you're you're there but
you're your second tier so even so even
if you wade out it doesn't mean you're
gonna get it right off the bat if you do
upgrade it now I don't know if it
actually resets that one-year time
period now I actually don't know the
conditions of the program exactly to the
T so either way if you wait it out you
still may not get the phone when it
comes out right away
yeah and then there's a possibility
they're not gonna have enough in stock
like that's what happened at large yeah
exactly the gross gold one was like gone
like no one could find that and then
they were settling for different colors
they didn't want I unfortunately had to
settle because I don't have they didn't
have rose gold not I'm fine with my
space grey yeah cool so alright I guess
that's gonna do it for now that's it so
look you know what if any of you
complain about the show I'm gonna come
back to you because we didn't even have
to do it you no one's gonna complain
people when you have complain no matter
what yeah you can always have
complainers we're on vacation
I ain't got no complaints I'm soaking up
the Aloha Sun baby oh man I'm so jelly I
know I won't talk about any more so
anyways thanks so much for hanging with
us we will return after our break enjoy
your time at work with your family with
your friends I'm gonna be surfing the
waves baby
oh hello alright we'll see you guys next
time thanks for hanging with us alone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
