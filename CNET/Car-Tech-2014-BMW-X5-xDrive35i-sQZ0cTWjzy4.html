they like the word activity instead of
utility regardless it's now and it's
heavily refreshed third-generation so
let's try this 2014 BMW x5 xdrive35i
count the letters in its name plate and
check the tip now I find this gen 3 car
the best-looking x5 yet because they've
retained the chunky substantial look
that is x5 but they've also sculpted it
better than ever and really giving it a
lot of car like face it really looks a
lot like the most desirable BMW cars on
the front I couldn't say that about an
x5 in the past easy way to spot a gen 3
X 5 is to look at the fenders on both
the front fenders you'll find this kind
of long blade light cutout that looks
right through to the tire they call that
the air curtain it's about managing
airflow from the face of the car across
the face of the wheel with minimal
aerodynamic disruption underneath that
giant panoramic glass roof you'll find
much nicer available rear seats that can
have heating finally fancier upholstery
10 degrees of recline and three inches
of four aft adjustment that's all new
little third row seats are optional but
if you do get those you can't get the
fancy second row seats I just mentioned
now inside our x5 things haven't changed
a lot you're going to recognize the
iDrive interface it's very familiar and
it's mounted in this 10.2 inch ultra
wide screen that is in the current
fashion mounted like so it doesn't go up
and down though it looks like it and
it's a very clear well rendered display
nothing too different there it's not a
touchscreen of course the Germans don't
go for that instead you get the latest
iDrive controller with a bunch of
homerun buttons around it a larger knob
for turn click and kick and it's a
touchpad on top for handwriting
recognition for directional moves or
also for pinch and zoom on your map
level now where they have made some nice
streamlining improvements is in voice
command check it out FM one 102.1
you were listening to 102.1
that is super clean and intuitive I
didn't have to spend any time learning
what it wanted me to say so many other
cars would have you say Radio tuning
mode change to something frequency shoot
me I'm going to grab a knob by then this
is very humanistic similarly clean for
address entry enter address 2 3 5 2nd
Street San Francisco California
processing your input 235 second Street
now I can also get to my destination
through BMW online which is a separate
search utility but it works differently
it takes you to a different voice
recognition platform done in the cloud I
can also go to wiki local to find where
I want to go and that's another
experience and here there's no voice
recognition so I've got multiple ways to
address multiple interfaces to all serve
the same basic idea a finding what I
want to go this is where things like
carplay and android auto are going to
find low hanging fruit clean up this
mess that occurs in so many vehicles
these are not the only guys that do it
wrong abs are via a cabled phone only
not wirelessly Facebook and Twitter are
heavily cleaned up and usable in a
limited way audible books glimpse
location sharing Rhapsody music and tune
in radio streaming are all on the way
meanwhile general bluetooth streaming
handles the rest including the obvious
omission of Pandora
by the way radio includes am/fm and HD
radio
however satellite radio doesn't get in
there unless you let BMW twist your arm
and show you a $2,700 premium package my
x5 will not have satellite radio for
that reason now when I put our car in
reverse you're going to notice all I've
got are sensors front and rear no rear
camera on this car there's even an
around view camera that's optional I get
it but on a car of this price category
they're going to nickel and dime me for
a rear camera that doesn't work with me
of course federal law is going to take
care of that soon enough in the meantime
prepare to get insulted
now here in the engine room is one of
the great engines in manufacturing right
now in fact it's arguably the best
inline six ever made this is BMWs n55
it's an awarded motor the twin power
turbo technology is the first thing you
want to call your attention to it has a
single turbocharger but with to scroll
phases for low and high rpm coupled with
direct injection as is the fashion these
days and BMWs Valvetronic which is a
very sophisticated variable valve
technology that also takes over the
throttle functions in this engine the
numbers 300 horsepower 300 pound feet of
torque it goes out in rear-wheel drive
fashion base on these cars which is new
for this generation but of course we
have all-wheel drive here 0-60 for this
roughly forty eight hundred pound
vehicle is 6.2 seconds that is two
tenths faster than the outgoing vehicle
and by the way a hundred and seventy
pounds lighter on this one as well your
mpg ends up being at 18 27 that's
actually pretty good
it used to be 1623 the year before so
lots of improvements have happened here
in terms of performance and efficiency
and of course a one choice only
automatic transmission but it comes in
two modes the base and a sport automatic
now of course BMWs have this rocker
switch for various drive modes you start
at the bottom at Eco Pro you go to
comfort which is like normal you've got
a sport mode and you've got a Sport Plus
where they're taking the traction
control largely out of the pictures
those are your four ranges and you can
see they affect things like throttle
response shift points it will affect
your adaptive suspension if you option
it and it's also going to affect your
steering feel but of all of these you
might think I'm going to be totally gaga
for Sport Plus or something seen it 100
times what really intrigues me is
actually Eco Pro I'm not normally a big
fan of eco modes because they dumb the
car down too much but this one's
interesting
and of course mutes back the throttle
response softens up your shift points
have been it also tells you to back off
the throttle with an indicator here if
you're goosing it too much it's going to
demand auto start/stop being able which
I'm not a huge fan of it will also
freewheel or decouple the engine from
the drivetrain
when you lift off and Coast it lets the
car glide more and have reduced friction
that's pulling its momentum down it will
choose more efficient routes when you're
under navigation and it will also coach
lift off the throttle as you go into a
corner or into a reduced speed zone
ahead it's quite complex and of course
combines with the regenerative braking
it's on this car as well as older BMW
tricks like using on demand rotating
accessories that only drag on the engine
when they need to and we have electric
power steering so there's no electric
power steering pump being parasitic the
last part of your sport display is here
in the iDrive display which gives you a
power and torque readout not really
useful but kind of put you in more of a
sporting mode and on these
all-wheel-drive cars you have an X Drive
status indicator that will show you how
the power or torque distribution is
being worked around the four wheels I'm
not sure what you're going to do with
that information but it's a nice
animation
now the x5 has all the BMW traits on the
road that you'd expect the power is very
good in this vehicle they've dialed out
a lot of turbo lag with that twin-scroll
twin power technology amazing for a
number of years now because we have the
M Sport Package we have the Sport
Automatic transmission our automatics
are the only choice on this car no dsgs
no manuals and I find it's a very alert
gearbox whether you're on the stick or
on the paddles doing your shifting or
just in sport mode it's on the ball and
the shifts are crisp without being
jarring it's a well-done automatic now
the one deal you make with the devil
when you get a BMW is you're buying a
certain stern ride quality these are
never cosseting cars with the exception
of a few models but basically you're
talking about riding a very firm
underpinning all the time in these
vehicles it's part of the BMW DNA it's
not for everyone to be honest
the other interesting thing is the last
mile app which allows you to go from
when you park to walking to your exact
final destination with guidance and also
taking you back to where you parked your
car now pricing an x5 is like pricing
most premium German cars get a cup of
coffee and pull up a comfortable chair
we're gonna be here a while first of all
the base price with destination and the
most basic interior is 57 5m sport
packages 4,600 bucks 19-inch wheels M
sports steering wheel the sport
automatic transmissions 40 your seats
dynamic handling 3,600 bucks which
includes the rear torque vectoring
technology active roll control and full
adaptive suspension but if you want the
rear air suspension that's 900 more a
lighting package with LED headlights and
automatic high beams that steer is 1,900
driver assistance is 1400 for the rear
camera and a HUD driver assistance Plus
is 1900 for blind spot lane departure
and front crash partial braking and if
you want adaptive cruise and the stop
and go in everyday traffic that's $1200
more and we're not even done yet parking
assistant is five hundred dollars
comfort rear seats kind of a bargain at
five hundred Harmon Kardon surround
sound is 875
I won't even kid you with 4,500 for Bang
&amp;amp; Olufsen night vision with pedestrian
detection is 2600 of tubba the least
useful dollars you'll ever spend and
that requires the cold weather package
for some reason so add
by 54 that skip the $2,200 rear seat
entertainment system which is lame and
you're almost broken out anyway and do
190 bucks for a pair of iPad holders all
inward about 78 - I'm going to skip
another several thousand worth of trim
options take the card just the way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
