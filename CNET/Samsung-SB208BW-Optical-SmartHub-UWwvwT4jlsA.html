today do you know what let's do
something fun
that's what kill bill together on my
iPhone so Kelly come over here sit here
oh come on you're like you know what you
can take this phone to Android and you
can do that too and that's because I
have here the new cool device called the
optical smart hub from Samsung now this
is a optical drive with a Wi-Fi network
built-in which means it can stream
content from a DVD to multiple mobile
devices let's see how it works
all right the movie is now all set sets
to thing to do now first I have to get
the phone connected to the Wi-Fi network
of the Smart Hub and number two I have
to download the apps called mobile Smart
Hub from Samsung with free download and
you see that icon of the DVD press on it
and then you can view the title the
chapter audio sub tire etcetera and of
course you could play the movie on the
phone and Kelly's with me to do that too
right now other than DVDs the Smart Hub
can also stream content store on extra
hard drive like this one here just plug
the drive into the USB port on the back
of the hub and then that's it all you
have on the hard drive with photo video
or music can be streamed to multiple
mobile device on the back of the smart
hub you can find also another USB port
this port here is you to connect the hub
to a computer and use this as a regular
external optical drive there's also a
network port here which is you to
connect the hub to an existing Internet
source such as a park band modem or your
home network this means the mobile
device is connected to the hub via is
Wi-Fi can also get to the Internet
apart from playing back content you can
also use a Smart Hub to backup data of
your mobile devices for example on the
phone here you can choose back up
different type content and chew the back
up either on the connected external hard
drive or on a blank DVD
to find out why it's not a great device
for your PC or non Wi-Fi devices and
other information check out the full
review at sea calm once again my name is
Tom Lowe and this has been the first
look as the Samsung optical smart ha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
