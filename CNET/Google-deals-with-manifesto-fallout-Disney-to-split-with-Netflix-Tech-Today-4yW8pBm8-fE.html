that matter right now this week a memo
called Google's ideological echo chamber
made its way online
it was authored by James d'amour an
engineer at Google in the 10 page
document the more argued that women are
underrepresented in technology partially
due to biological reasons and that quote
we need to also stop assuming that
gender gaps implies sexism d'amour was
then fired and is looking into legal
action against the company Google CEO
sundar pichai wrote a response to the
memo that was published on Google's blog
in it which I said quote portions of the
memo violate our code of conduct and
cross the line by advancing harmful
gender stereotypes in our workplace
google was to hold a company-wide
meeting about diversity on Thursday
August 10th but the meeting was
cancelled because staff were worried
they may face harassment reports say
Pichai canceled the meeting 30 minutes
before was it take place Disney

Pixar films from Netflix this
announcement will affect new releases
starting in 2019 Disney will instead
build its own streaming service Netflix

about keeping Star Wars and Marvel films
after 2019 Disney CEO Bob Iger said
those properties could end up at Netflix
another service or Disney could keep
them for itself Consumer Reports says it
no longer recommends Microsoft Surface
laptops and tablets the issue is poor
reliability according to studies by
Consumer Reports 25% of Microsoft

and says Microsoft's predicted failure
and return rates are much lower than the
25% estimated by Consumer Reports
