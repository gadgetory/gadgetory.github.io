another Kickstarter project but it
quickly got popular got funding and now
it's ready for you to order now I was a
little skeptical of the pea intelligence
I mean it's a smart frying pan that's
supposed to teach me how to cook better
that's a pretty lofty claim but it's
actually a really cool invention now on
the surface the pan telogen looks like
any other pan you might have in your
home it's about 12 inches across with 2
inch high sides and it's covered with a
nonstick coating and it's made of
aluminum but the real magic is right
here the handle contains a Bluetooth
connection that syncs up with an app
that works on either iOS or Android
devices so the pay intelligent uses the
app to tell you what the temperature is
of the food that you're cooking and then
it gives you directions step-by-step on
how to cook certain dishes like salmon
or steak or grilled cheese sandwiches it
what's really cool about the app is that
it will tell you to adjust the
temperature there's pan if it's getting
a little too hot or a little too cool
this way you can keep your pan at a
pretty even temperature which is great
for cooking a variety of foods yeah I
love to cook and I found that the
intelligence make cookie very precise
and even fun now it did get to be a
little annoying when that I've kept
telling me to lower the temperature
raise the temperature over and over
again the heat is still too high but the
end result was always worth all that
nagging and I imagine that the
intelligent would be great for a novice
cook to walk them through some very
basic recipes and eventually teach them
how to be a better cook if an
intelligent is $199 pretty steep for a
frying pan but this isn't just any
frying pan it's a smart frying pan that
will teach you how to cook that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
