much displacement you find in the
cylinders of this 2014 Ford Fiesta this
is the 2014 Ford Fiesta you can see this
big mouth grille which is sort of a
signature item on Ford passenger cars at
this stage in the game
this is Ford's economy car the smallest
car in their lineup and it comes with
the EcoBoost option now you can get the
EcoBoost option in the Fiesta on the
sedan or hatchback format vehicles this
is the sedan body style per se prefer
the hatchback I like the looks a lot
better in the utility but let's see
what's really important about this car
merida the hood here is what makes this
car special this is ford's little one
liter EcoBoost engine so it's only got
three cylinders you don't really find
that in a lot of cars these days one
liter is also particularly tiny EcoBoost
means it has direct injection you hear
the clatter of those injectors right now
that's just a attribute of direct
injection engines it's also got a turbo
that helps bring the power up 223
horsepower 148 pound-feet of torque
which are exceptional numbers for a one
liter engine and those are much more
than the standard 1.6 liter engine you
get in the Fiesta fuel economy is also
up at 32 miles per gallon city forty
five miles per gallon highway so that to
give you about an average of 40 miles
per gallon because you only have three
cylinders that can throw off the balance
but the four cylinder engine you have
two cylinders going up two going down
vice versa and that helps balance the
engine by itself with three cylinders
you have two cylinders going up one
going down then vice versa only one
going up in two going down that can
throw off the balance Ford actually has
done some interesting engineering here
where they have a counterbalance pulley
in here that helps balance that engine
action out they also have some special
engine mounts that help dampen some of
that vibration so you don't really feel
it in the cab is a much now in the cabin
here is standard Ford Fiesta you know
economy car stuff and in the head unit
here we can see we have really the bass
head unit for the Fiesta and even though
MyFord Touch is available in the Fiesta
it's not available with the
so boost engine I'm not really sure why
the head unit is depending on the engine
but in some ways actually like this base
head unit better what I'm not crazy
about are these buttons here sometimes a
little hard to figure out what's going
on so I've got my iPhone plugged into
the USB port down here on the console
now this has the sync system which is
really convenient so if I want to
request a music I can just push the talk
button USB please say a command
play artist Led Zeppelin playing artist
Led Zeppelin this is like got a three
inch screen
pretty small monochrome screen but it's
really all you need for this car since
there's no navigation one thing I really
can't do very well is navigate my
iPhone's music library with this
interface here I also have sync app like
so for example right now I've got Amazon
Cloud Player so I can just hit this TOC
button USB please say a command
mobile apps mobile apps please say a
command
Amazon Cloud Player now it's looking for
that app I've actually got a running on
my phone with the iPhone you actually
have to have the app currently running
on the phone so you sit have to preset
it for that that's why this really works
better with an Android device because
I'm Android device you just have to have
the app somewhere on the phone it
doesn't have to be running and that'll
work over Bluetooth - with the iPhone
you have to be plugged in with the cable
so iPhone not as convenient Android more
convenient now one thing about the
EcoBoost engine is you can only get it
with the manual transmission
I mentioned the power numbers of this
car certainly more than enough for a car
like this but it's a little bit
different I mean this kind of shows the
difference when you have a very low
displacement like this car that that
power comes on at higher engine revs so
you it becomes a little bit tricky to
drive you're going up the hill right now
and this is where can have a little bit
of difficulty I stopped right here on
the hill nice thing about star count
Hill hold so I can just take my foot off
the brake and I won't roll back but then
I try to start
and I gotta get those rubs up at
starting a lug and then it gets those
revs up and then it gets the power but
stuff does happen when I turn the wheel
you know there's a satisfying amount of
happy to it it's well tuned that and the
handling together really make this car
suitable for its purpose is your basic
economical transportation with the 1
liter engine now pace price forward se
is 15 580 add 995 for the EcoBoost
option and you end up with a total of 16
650 for this car now there is really no
CNET style because you can't get my port
touch or any of the upgraded electronics
in the car you have to go with the bass
head unit so that is basically CNET
style or the Ford Fiesta EcoBoost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
