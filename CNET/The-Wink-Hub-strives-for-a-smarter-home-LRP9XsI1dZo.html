appliances here with a review of the
wink hub so this hub can translate Wi-Fi
Bluetooth ZigBee z-wave and Lutron clear
connect products other hubs like the
revolve hub Insteon smart things the
Lowe's iris hub they all do something
similar but what sets this one apart is
really the price it's only $79 and
through Labor Day it's only $49 hubs
like revolve do the same thing but cost
upwards of three hundred dollars which
is a huge difference when you consider
that this can do the same thing for so
much less while some hubs are limited in
terms of their protocols and the brands
they can work with this one has a wide
number of protocols and can work with a
bunch of different brands so basically I
just wanted to take things we had around
the office that were wink app enabled
and wink hub enabled and see how they
all work together in the wink app the
quirky arrows air conditioner and the
Dropcam don't actually need the hub to
operate but they can be operated in the
wing cap the Lutron dimmer the pico
remote and the kiddo
smoke and carbon monoxide detector I'll
use the hub but you can also control
them through the app so I paired
everything on the app alternating
between a nexus 7 tablet and my iPhone 5
just to see how it work on Android and
iOS platforms so I paired all of these
devices with varying degrees of success
the Dropcam and the Kida smoke alarm
worked extremely well it was fast I had
no issues at all the quirky arrows air
conditioner took about 20 tries to pair
at the right way and I actually had to
call customer service to figure out how
to pair the Lutron dimmer and the Pico
remote basically you go through a list
and select the product you want to pair
and then it walks you through step by
step what you need to do I found this to
be a little bit glitchy though sometimes
the app would stop it wouldn't advance
beyond a certain point even though I had
done everything the way I was supposed
to but for the most part it worked after
a few tries you can also create rules
within the app so I could say if the
Dropcam detects motion then these lights
turn on or the air conditioner turns on
or I can receive an
or a push notification so when you
factor in the growing number of third
party product integrations and the price
of this wink hub especially through
Labor Day only $50
I think it's among the best whole home
automation hubs we've come across
