amongst RC hobbyists and as the sport
continues to grow in popularity so do
pro circuits the drone racing league or
DRL is trying to take the sport to the
next level with awesome looking race
track designs innovative tech and some
of the coolest broadcast equipment we've
ever seen this is dr s first official
season and we got to go to their second
qualifying event level 2 la pocalypse
set in a real abandoned shopping mall
near los angeles DRL CEO and founder
nicholas herbert Chesky gave us a
walking tour of the enormous
post-apocalyptic track this is a very
cool setting for a drone race because it
allows us to use the full
three-dimensional elements of racing so
the drones go up they go down they come
around and those drones aren't just
flying up down and through simple hoops
DRL worked with Hollywood special
effects company legacy effects create a
one-of-a-kind environment their
experience working on films like
Jurassic world Ironman and Pacific Rim
really shows in this elaborate course
design not only does dr i'll have to
consider how pilots from all over the
world will fly through the track but
also how spectators would be able to see
the drones which travel up to 80 miles
an hour at times do this they borrow a
cable system called the bat cam which
follows along and even gets ahead of the
action so the back cam is a cable cam
that runs over the length of the course
it can go 100 miles an hour you know you
got a 100 mile an hour camera chasing an
80 mile an hour drone so it's a it's
pretty exciting when they're both going
full speed since racers require constant
video signal from the drones fpv camera
to see where their quadcopter is going
at all times
DRL had to create a lot of the tech they
use the drum racing league has designed
and built our own radio frequency
equipment from the ground up and it
allows us to put on race courses on a
scale that's never been seen before each
drone is also built from the ground up
by DRL this is our second model drone
it's called the racer - it's all carbon
fiber and it's designed for speed and
maneuverability but also for visibility
for the audience you'll see it's covered
in these LED lights that when they're on
are brightly lit and each in a different
colors you know which pilot is flying
which drone DRL provides its own drones
for pilots because of that racers can
push the limits of their quadcopter and
compete on true pilot skill as opposed
to technical enhancements
ro is taking chances we want to go as
fast as week
and you know get that adrenaline rush up
so you need to do so as we live for us
pilots we often say to the pilots if
you're not crashing you're not making
party night watching drone races feels
like you're in a science-fiction film
and if a race comes to your area get a
ticket you won't be disappointed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
