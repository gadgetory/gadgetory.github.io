stage here at cnet's CES coverage 2013
CES we've got so much going on here at
the show and we just did our best of CES
finalists unveiling among the finalists
in there in the car tech category is
some new innovation coming from Ford's I
want to talk a little bit more about
that because I'm the car guy I'm the car
tech guy one of our car tech team and
Julius marks wiki does too Julius
welcome thanks for being here thank you
thank you for having me you're the head
of the Ford SYNC AppLink section of
Ford's technology explain what that is
for folks that maybe are not doing apps
in their car yet fantastic thank you
Brian and thank you for the nomination
we're extremely excited your app link is
technology that lives on a smartphone
and inside of our vehicles and it
enables your in vehicle controls through
voice or through steering wheel to
control the smartphone applications that
you already have on your iPhone or
Android device and even blackberry if
you still have a blackberry yeah that's
right you still got some black great
support there um here's the thing is
this what we call in the tech biz a HMI
connection you're making the letting the
buttons on the physical part of the dash
control the phone app and get my eyes
where they should be exactly so one of
the things that we always say is keep
your hands on the wheel and your eyes on
the road yeah we know that our customers
are two times more likely to pick up
their phone while driving if they're in
vehicle technology doesn't meet their
needs so what's really important for us
is to make sure that the technology in
the car meets their needs and if you
don't do your job right you are any
automaker in this kind of integration of
apps in the dash they don't give you a
lot of time before they go grab the
phone again exactly exactly so it's
really as no bears they forget this once
you get the phone pick a very very
important for us to to focus you know
focus the the use of voice inside of the
vehicle right so you control these
applications and that hang up on a big
monitor that's static and large and auto
optimized exactly exactly you up before
we get into the really deep part of this
let's go it's sort of the really
accessible part which easier you rolled
out some more apps what are some of the
new ones you've got supported in your
cars sure well in addition to the
fantastic apps that we have today such
as Pandora stitcher to
in I heart I Heart Radio or iheart auto
as their as they're called now yeah we
launched a number of new applications
glimpse for example you know the
application that lets you share your
location with your friends and family so
you no longer have to respond to that
text message that says hey where are you
you can just glimpse your location
straight from the vehicle voice
activated I can say send a glympse to
Brian Cooley I call that overshare calm
but that's just me that's just me not
everybody has to be on the same page
yeah what's another one you implemented
well so another great example aha radio
30,000 streams of contents right all
voice activated voice enabled so you can
say play my weather station it'll give
you your localized weather and then it
can give you your social feeds and you
can listen to internet radio or news or
music and then some other fantastic news
apps for example a kaliki which reads
magazine content to you human read voice
same with USA Today the magazine era of
the newspaper every day digitized into
voice human read for you now all voice
activates are converting content that
might be media-rich into audio right
you're not displaying a simple version
of the USA Today on the screen or any
exactly it's okay it's all voice enabled
it's read to you in voice you hear a
human read to you for example today's
news stories or today's money stories
yeah and all voice activated and you can
use the steering wheel controls to skip
through content Wall Street Journal live
for example same thing all of the Wall
Street Journal radio content provided to
you you know you skip back and forth
between stories fantastic about some of
this audio content you're doing more and
more we are bringing in terrestrial
radio stations through various apps here
and folks I think sometimes say okay
wait a minute I got a radio in the car
it works real well and it's real easy
volume am/fm presets we don't how to use
it why the complication of adding radio
station apps yeah well you know the
radio stations are starting to see this
move into digital right and content is
no longer you know you send it and you
forget it content is now you know they
digitize it they tag it they store it so
you can bring it up later yeah so one of
the things that we're seeing is on
demand radio on demand interviews
morning shows you know you may miss your
favorite morning show that day so you're
going to want to hear that later
you know later in the afternoon for
example so you can bring up that content
with your voice from from some of these
radio applications like w RI f you can
access you know interviews and and their
morning show every day just if you
missed it right yes and change the world
of radio broadcasters because they're
used to having their local market to
themselves and not having competition
from stations hundreds of thousands of
miles away but now you can listen to a
New York station in Detroit absolutely
absolutely you know and I'm a Chicago
guy so I like sometimes I like listening
to my Chicago stations in Detroit so and
now you can enable that it's fantastic
now let's move to the future those are
some of the new apps you've got a really
big thing you announced that is less
sort of you know gettable by the
consumer but it's huge underlying tech
as you've opened up your cars and your
sync app technology to developers decode
all that for us oh it's a well what
we've done is we've launched what's
called the Ford developer program you
can go to developer for calm and access
all sorts of resources then that
effectively give you the ability to you
know just deploy test develop software
that works inside these vehicles so the
pandora's the all the apps that we're
talking about will give you the SDK they
have it's there it's on your developers
kit software development kit absolutely
documentation sample code online tips
and tricks a block blog forums I mean
and most importantly for developers that
are there to support you so we have an
entire team of people that are that are
helping developers now through this
developer program this ecosystem you're
creating that's the interesting part you
know folks the the development
communities that have really fostered
well are because the companies behind a
Google and their Android or Apple it's
not just because they've exposed all
this technology developers need but some
companies do a particularly good job of
working with developers having actual
bodies at their company that say yes
we'll help you get your app to work when
you're stuck or optimizer to do whatever
there's still a lot of high touch in the
world of bringing developers because you
guys are up against iOS and Android
primarily well here's what's amazing
about the for developer program is that
it doesn't actually require you to learn
anything about the automobile we give
you libraries for your Android and
iPhone applications that's how Apple Inc
works so
they kind of translate them to Ford you
compatible you drop in this library and
you have AP is we've wrapped services so
for example the voice service you want
to say something to the driver with our
text to speech engine it's the API is
called speak and you issue a speak
command and you give us the text you
want us to speak to you yeah and so it's
a fantastic it's a fantastic way because
I don't have to learn something specific
for the vehicle I can drop this library
and most of our developers are kind of
like a bunch of macros right that help
them get things done in a short cut
within your system in wrapping up this
idea what's the vision let's say one
year from now we talk to you about how
is it going with developers developing
apps that will then pair from they never
leave the phone they're always on the
phone but they're integrated with the
car in a rich way what do you hope will
be the goal you have a little be a Ford
app store well definitely definitely not
afford app store we want customers to
follow the same trends they're doing
today which is downloading from the
apple app store from google play so no
new no new stores right we're going to
help categorize we're going to show
where applications are available yeah
but at the end of the day you're going
to use your phone and you're going to
download from the store that you've
already downloaded for the world has
downloaded 55 plus billion applications
you're not going to reinvent the wheel
and get into the app delivery and sales
business okay got it all right this very
interesting stuff you know we will check
yeah I'm gonna hold you to this a year
from now come back here and show us how
I would love to be back I want to know
what the what apps are going to be
coming up in the next week is this will
be real this year right yeah okay so
we'll see what some developers have done
to develop for Ford fly another car
developer for calm absolute ideas thanks
