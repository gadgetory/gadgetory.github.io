because the industry is treated the
prepaid market as a dumping ground for
phones you couldn't pay me to use but
they also take a PR hit every time
Walter White needs to make phone call to
take care of some unsavory business but
things have changed instead of being the
last refuge of the desperate prepaid
phones that recently become a great
choice for those who are both tech savvy
and money savvy I'm Donald Bell and this
top five I'm counting down the best
reasons to ditch your contract and go
with a prepaid plan starting off at
number five
Cash Money how many times is a cell
phone bill overdrafted your checking
account
it's brutal not only are you reminded of
how much you're overpaying for your
phone but now you have an overdraft fee
to pay on top of it prepaid phones keep
things real simple you pay upfront for
what you get and if you want to pay by
cash check or credit card that's up to
you cash payment is also a way to kill
off any paper trail so whether you're a
part-time pimp or maybe just live with
an apple fanatic and you want to keep
your secret Android phone off the books
just walk into your local prepaid
carrier and make it rain at number four
no credit checks maybe the real reason
you want to keep this phone off your
credit card is because you can't be
trusted with one anymore
by going prepaid so long as you've got
the money upfront you're good to go
now there are some exceptions if you're
not buying your phone hardware upfront
but having it broken down into monthly
payments well then yeah they're going to
check your credit but if you can pay
upfront for your phone and your plan
there's nothing the man can do to shut
you down coming in at number three
service when you need it and money in
your pocket when you don't not everybody
needs a 4G smartphone twelve months out
of the year so whether you're heading
away to the Cayman Islands or maybe a
couple months on Rikers Island you can
rest assured that you're not on the hook
for a phone you don't need take a month
to try your luck at messenger pigeons or
smoke signals if it doesn't work out you
can just pick right up where you left
off reason number two to go prepaid
painless upgrades
want to upgrade to that latest phone go
buy it carrier doesn't support it change
your carrier if prepaid turns out not to
be your thing just toss it aside and go
with a standard postpaid contract plan
the point is whether you're fickle or
maybe you've been burned by an awful
phone or a ruthless carrier going
prepaid gives you the ultimate freedom
to change your mind now before I get to
the number one reason to get prepaid
cell phone service a try let's consider
some reasons why it might not be right
for you you're often dealing with fewer
store locations fewer phones to choose
from especially when it comes to hero
phones like the galaxy s4 less coverage
and most of all higher upfront cost
there are no subsidies so you pay the
real price for your phone for a good
smartphone that could be $500 upfront or
more kind of sucks but it may all be
worth it when you account for our number
one reason to go prepaid lower lifetime
cost we ran the numbers on what it would
cost to have the Samsung Galaxy s3 on
two-year contract with Verizon compared
to prepaid with metro pcs and for the
same two years the total savings is a
little over a thousand dollars it's not
chump change now is the metro pcs
Network as fast and robust as Verizon's
probably not is it worth the extra
thousand dollars and the shackles of a
two-year contract well that's up to you
so there you go five reasons to at least
consider going with a prepaid cell phone
plan for more analysis check out our
senior editor Jessica dual courts post
on scene at dialed in blog called
prepaid or post paid the fight for your
cell phone dollars more top buys like
