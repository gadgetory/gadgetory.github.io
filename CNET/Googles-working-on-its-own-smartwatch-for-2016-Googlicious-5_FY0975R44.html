Google issues for everything google we
can pack inside of a show and yes the
craze is all about Pokemon go right now
at least if you're in the u.s. new
zealand or australia with launches in
europe and japan coming soon but wait
hold on guys okay just making sure my
egg has hatched now according to similar
web only two days after its release on
july eighth pokemon go was already
installed on over five percent of
android devices in the US if that
doesn't seem like a lot think again
because that's already more installs
then tinder has on US based android
phones and we're all swipe and write for
pokemon go plus sixty percent of the
people who are using it daily means
three percent of the entire US Android
population is also using it daily now
the latest data shows that pokemon go is
expected to have more daily active users
than twitter by the time you see this
video but like any great thing there's
also some downsides most people are
setting it up with their google account
but Adam reef has found it could be a
huge security risk because pokemons go
has full access to your google account
including reading and sending emails as
you accessing your google drive docs
looking at your search and maps
navigation history accessing your
private photos and more now some of you
may not care and say take over my life
Pokemon go it's not like they're really
trying to take over your data but access
like that from any app is rare and it's
something you should be aware of it's
enough where some people are refusing to
download the game and if you want to you
can go to your Google security page you
can select Pokemon go and remove to
revoke all access now most cases the
game still works after this but for
others it doesn't so your experience may
vary now in a little bit of catch-up
from our hiatus last week android police
has posted a render of what the next
Nexus phones will look like based on
their sources they claim there will be
no camera hump it will be entirely flesh
and there will be a gentle curve on the
edges of the backside of the phone both
phones will have aluminum body's not
polycarbonate and the g logo may or may
not exist on this final design the code
names for the two phones have been come
as Marlon for the 5.5 inch phone and
sailfish for the smaller five incher but
we still don't know their final official
names expected release date and how much
they'll cost now we've also heard
rumblings that Google is working to
control the hardware and software just
like Apple for a future Nexus phone but
Android police reports that Google is
building two of their own android wear
smartwatches with Google assistant
integration the two watches will
possibly be Nexus branded with the
targeted release sometime after the new
Nexus phones are announced the report
also says one will be larger sporty-er
and full-featured with LTE and gps
connectivity that one is known as
angelfish the second one will be smaller
in size without mobile data and gps and
is known internally as swordfish both
watches are expected to have circular
displays and will not feature that ugly
flat tire interface google might be
looking for a signature Android wear
watch to be in the same conversation as
the Apple watch or gear s2 so we'll see
how this all comes together and the
Android role is waiting to see Samsung
released the new note 7 and here Steve
hems offer gives us the first real look
of the phone that backs up a lot of the
renders we've seen but this time it's
photos of what's believed to be an
actual prototype of the note 7 rumored
specs include a five point eight inch
qhd display snapdragon 820 three for the
US market or an Exynos 88-90
internationally six gigs of RAM and 32
gigs of internal storage with a microSD
slot for expansion plus a larger battery
now August second is still believed to
be the official date for an announcement
with an edge version of the note 7 being
a possibility as well and a new report
from the information says YouTube is
making progress on an online TV service
that won't require a cable subscription
content partners that are firmly
expected to be included are ABC CBS and
ESPN but Google is still in negotiations
with NBC Viacom and Fox now as far back
as may the unplug service was rumored to
cost under 35 dollars per month another
aspect of this service would include
topic-specific youtube channels that
would be loaded with things like home
improvement videos that could take place
of TV networks like HD TV Google's TV
package is expected to launch in the
next six to nine months the report also
says youtube bread
hasn't taken off the way they had hoped
for with trial subscription is now being
extended from 30 days to four months to
attract more customers yikes and google
also confirm its recent acquisition a
video on broadcasting platform on Votto
not to be confused with javi Otto I am a
fan of yours have been ever since you
were at the helm of avi outdoor you know
a viata yes avi Otto my a yachtie is
there any other a bientot like I said
not to be confused now on Votto is a
fully automated platform for media
encoding editing and publishing it also
has software for live streaming
broadcast and its current customers
include nbc/universal CBS fox sports and
others google has not said how it
specifically plans to integrate a novato
service but it could potentially play
into its upcoming TV one alright that's
going to do for this week you can email
us at Google issues at cnet com or to me
