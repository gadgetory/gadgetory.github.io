it's got touch instruments you can plug
in a guitar and play real instruments if
you want but it's got touch instruments
that I think are gonna be a huge hit
with our users guitar amps and effects
eight-track recording and mixing over
250 loops you can add to your songs you
can email files around of your song to
anybody and it's compatible with the Mac
version so if you want to start
something on your iPad and finish it on
the Mac no problem a launch GarageBand
and the first thing you see is an
instrument browser so these are all the
touch instruments Steve just mentioned
and you can just swipe to tap through
them and it's incredible they turn the
iPad itself you know musical instrument
that you can play wherever you go now go
ahead and bring up a keyboard to start
showing this off and you can see this
beautiful grand piano comes up and it
fills the display and the keyboards not
just a grand piano I can tap on that
icon right in the middle there and you
can see all the sounds that are built in
there are organs
electric piano clavinet look at this a
whole bunch of great synthesizers that
are really really fun to play well iPad
has an accelerometer built in and we use
that to measure the force that my finger
strikes the display so GarageBand knows
if I tap something really soft or really
hard and we use that throughout the app
and that lates lets us create these
instruments that are incredibly
expressive and fun to play now this one
is set up in a way that when I tap a key
and I slide my finger up and down the
rest of the keys it's gonna glide
between the notes it won't play the
individual notes and we've added a blue
dot that's gonna follow my finger so you
can see exactly what I'm doing so I can
tap a note and slide the note up
alright boys stuff like that
pretty cool huh a lot of these smart
instruments have this autoplay dial and
I can just go ahead and dial up a
pattern the strings fade away now I have
these big bars so the only decision I
make is which chord do I want to play
and look what happens with one touch of
a finger when it's happened one of these
chords
let's choose any chord
and that cool the next thing is
recording let's say we we have an idea
we want to capture it so we can hear it
later recording and GarageBand for iPad
it's incredibly simple you can see right
at the top of the screen that bright red
button that's in every touch instrument
so all we have to do is tap on it we'll
get a count in I'll just play the part
again
all right you can see that now in the
music timeline up here we can see the
area in green that shows me where my
recording is gone and I can go ahead and
play it back
sounds just like I played it so you can
tell really easy to do a recording so
that's just a quick look at GarageBand
for iPad it turns your iPad into a
complete recording studio and a
collection of these incredible touch
instruments and we just can't wait to
hear all the creative things that people
are going to do once they get this in
their hands
