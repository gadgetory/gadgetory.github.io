that matter right now
Qualcomm and Apple are still engaged in
a legal spat over patents Qualcomm filed
a request with the US International
Trade Commission to ban the import and
sale of certain AI phones including the
iphone 8 and 10 that use Intel's modem
this would affect some iPhones that run
on AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile networks phones
that run on Verizon and Sprint would not
be included in the ban because they used
Qualcomm's modem
Qualcomm is seeking the ban because it
says these models of iPhones infringe on
Qualcomm's patents contents of a hard
drive belonging to a division of the NSA
have made their way online over 100
gigabytes of data from an army
intelligence project codenamed red disk
were on a public Amazon Web Services
storage server while the disk image was
unlisted it was available for anyone to
download and it was not
password-protected the project contained
within red disk outlines a way to share
intelligence in the battlefield it was
developed in 2013 but it was never fully
deployed in the field cosmonaut anton
shkaplerov says his team found living
bacteria on the surface of the Russian
segment of the International Space
Station
he says the bacteria come from outer
space because they were not present at
the launch of the ISS module however
these claims have not been confirmed and
have been met with skepticism it is
possible the bacteria could have
originated from Earth some Earthborn
bacteria are capable surviving even in
space
