the top tech news of the day and all the
other crap we want to throw in I'm Roger
Cheng now Malford ring so the reviews
are in and critics are decidedly neutral
the iphone 7 is out Devlin 7 plus it's
not a lot huge enthusiasm I think a lot
of people are you know they sort of say
the disclaimer that this is the best
iPhone that's never been made which of
course it has to be because it's the
newest iPhone they think it's a worthy
upgrade if you're looking for an upgrade
but you don't get this phone what do you
think of the sort of summary of the the
reviews that came in I think neutral is
about to describe all of it because
that's that's really what the upgrade
was um you know for them to say this is
the best iphone that we've ever had well
again you know it's not like they're
going to go on stage and just say is
it's not as good as well remember that
iphone 4 that was our peak and base is
okay basically you know it neutral is
exactly what the iphone 7 deserves as
its review you know it's faster as it
should be you know it is it did
everything that was it was expected to
be but it's done nothing to go above and
beyond which yep where i'll be were
definitely you look at competition out
there you look at the design though hate
to bring up the galaxy note 7 because it
does blow up with the tendency to
explode but look at the design that
phone and it's clear that apples
competitors have not not only caught up
but it really exceeded in some levels
sort of apples aesthetic advantaged
right yeah that being said though I will
say that these 7 plus um I really feel
like that's where the seven should have
won the dual cameras are a big advantage
but the fact is that you know for me to
have to get this giant phone to get that
kind of really cool feature it's kind of
a downer for me I know we know but your
your hand issues it's it's cool well no
but I also really like the camera right
right no it's better that mean that was
the premise of the article I wrote last
week right but basically if you want the
latest &amp;amp; Grace an apple you've got to
pay that step of thing you've got a
drawer happy this gigantic phone for a
lot of people that's that's a real
hang-up I think a lot of probably the
biggest hang-up still is the headphone
jack I think it's a controversy that
won't die
and in a lot of the reviews I think
folks were kind of lukewarm they didn't
think that the upgrade to iphone 7 was
really worth losing the headphone jack
yeah i agree with that i was eligible to
update to the seven and i just said i'm
not going to do it because I first of
all I spent a lot of money my headphones
already right and then for me to do that
and then I mean I know people have made
the argument you can get the adapter but
yeah but then it gets I'm you know with
me and phones it's always been about
optimizing like space yeah I pocket and
then for you to carry one more thing
which again one more thing to lose which
you know if you're the type of person
that is always replacing your headphones
or you know always losing them now it's
like another thing for you to lose and
then yeah then there's the argument of
basically well what if I want to urge my
phone and listen to music at the same
time well then that song was not going
to work fortunately they have this other
dongle that is gonna be living the
dongle life that's just weird uncles
everywhere the dongle world we're just
living in it that's right exactly you
brought you brought the point like those
dolls are actually did look large fix
the third-party manufacturers have come
out with a couple they look kind of
annoying large your point of like having
a few things as possible in your pocket
like having two or three extra dongles
just not the greatest experience it's
completely pointless I it's I I mean I
understand that these you know these
headphone jacks are probably going to go
away at some point as well as you know
things get better but the thing is like
I don't think now's the time to kill it
off I mean kudos to Apple for trying to
be the vanguard right in this but their
courageous let's salute the courage for
now look at me that's Apple that's our
mo they've done this in the past they
kind of moved they push the industry
forward and I will I do think that the
others will fall we're going to lose
headphone jacks everywhere so anyways
for more about Apple in the iphone 7
check us out at seen it I'm Roger Cheng
I'm outer ring thanks for listening and
that's a cut audio recording let's go to
the chat room all right questions
comments I mean evil first of all I want
to reiterate my passionate hatred for
the dongle yes I will not be living this
dongle life so I'm just curious like
would it not be that annoying to just
leave the dongle
your headphone like leave it as the part
of your headphone I will still like more
and what am I going to do gaff tape it
to it which i think is the only solution
for me cuz i will lose it it's still the
same amount of space and people lose
headphones like very frequently they do
yes and then consider this also you know
how your headphones already get like
really tangled in your pockets yeah
think about that with the dango that's
another not I believe see that has a
how-to on how to tie up your earphones
about tangler Lemire but is that does
that include the dongle no that's true
but i think the dongle yeah I hope
because it's another are how two people
need a meeting on this how to tie up the
dongle without well then if you're wired
well then did you see this yesterday
where it was basically i think garmin or
some other third-party company was
selling basically a cord to tie your own
i think it's a pain yeah it was a is the
wire connector yeah and it's just go
from chewy wireless headphones to back
to and you know if only there were some
kind of you know device that had a wire
to to keep him together but where would
we find that all right we got a question
from mr. Allen he wants to know why
would one need the 258 gigabyte isn't it
just gonna kill your battery uh that's
an interesting question i don't think
storage actually kills your battery and
it doesn't affect don't you're fifty six
gigs of storage is it's not Ram it's not
processing power it's just it's the
amount of space you have to put in
photos videos the reason why you'd want
to 256 gig iphone which actually to me
seems excessive at this point but if
you're shooting a lot of 4k video in
particular shooting a lot of high
resolution photos that adds up right
you're going to need him you need that
extra space well yeah if you're
considering the iphone 7 plus as you
know the photographer's a phone you know
you're going to be taking a lot of
photos on it and it's itchy i mean
considering that the iphone 7 plus or
any iphone for that matter doesn't have
expandable memory yeah i mean that's a
big that's a big feature of it I mean
it's definitely a premium like I have a
128 gig iphone 6s plus and I find that
that's more than enough to meet my needs
but I don't I don't take a huge amount
of videos you have 128 yeah oh my god oh
yeah stepped it up although
now it's like the mid-tier that's the
middle the road iphone which I love it
but the part about is like you can at
least splorch when it comes to you know
how many photos do I want to take yes as
opposed to us with you know 32 gays or
16 or one note 16 is the minimum swell
60 is gone now yeah so even with 32 gigs
I feel like if we have to budget it yeah
you serve the planetary like oh I have
to make out the police of apps today cuz
I'm gonna take a couple of photos that's
not an experience you on your phone so
that's actually kind of a perfect segue
into Dante's question he says how good
is the iphone 7 camera which we can
demonstrate for you demonstrate thanks
take a look our photographer James
Martin he was able to to snap some
photos on I 7 on an iphone 7 plus plus
vs. an iphone 6s plus you should check
out cnet we've got a nice site that
shows you a side-by-side comparison
scroll so you can see here for from
these photos to see the quality the
iphone 6s plus vs. the iphone 7 plus as
far as resolution picture quality goes
and here this is you know this is a
low-light photos slow like additions and
the seven plus definitely shines here
right like you see more colors it's a
bit more detailed than the success plus
oh no yeah it's definitely better for
low light and you know in my opinion I
think that's very important considering
you know you want to take a picture of
your friends at a party and things
unless it's a day well I know I know for
you in the club you got yeah yeah yeah I
don't need to use flash photography any
matically and just awful never use flash
but see how it performs in broad
daylight it's negligible right I would
say so personally yeah I honestly feel
like some of the the colors on the 6s
are maybe richer more vibrant to sense
but that could also just be over
exposure I do think it's just personal
preference but it does sort of show you
that in certain cases the gap between
the two just visit as wide as Apple
would like you to think it is in
fairness say can we switch it to
comparing it with the galaxy s7 that's
possible sure let's do that for our
android fans out there absolutely a good
point so here's the iphone 7 as we had
just previously looked at plus 7 plus
excuse me big difference
you're right it looks about the same and
this is the comparison there's a pretty
I don't know what do you guys think in
the chat as far as like explicitly tako
take a all of your your brand loyalties
out of this let's look at the subject
eyes I played towards the seven plus
like it feel like this better color
there but I don't know i'm not i
definitely by no means an expert this is
still a great feature I'm really glad
the Jains did this this was yeah I mean
it's really great just for me being the
guy who pushes buttons and isn't the
tech expert this actually helps me a lot
as where I'm going because I've been an
iphone user for some time and the
headphone things kind of making me
reconsider my life choices mmm so maybe
i can start being a photographer instead
if if that's case you should wait around
Google's gonna have their deflector
phone if you if you don't necessarily
want to Samsung it doesn't have to be an
apple samsung world I'm actually really
looking forward to that pixel for the
pixel thing yeah because they haven't I
think right here although I gotta say
that there's a blatant what we've seen
it looks really ugly there's an
absolutely blatant advantage to the
galaxy 7 look how much crisper
everything is versus the iphone nice all
the glass okay hey darker darks yoga
class sure and I'm glad we have these
different conditions to shoot into yep
this with a cloudy sky here and all that
yeah great work James that was really
cool so I wonder what everyone's saying
in the chat Oh for those preach asking
about the waterproof and to an extent
he's asking if you can take it in the
shower I don't know if we can really
endorse that I probably wouldn't share
with its why would you have your phone
in the shower anyway cuz in case you
need to get your Pokemon go on shower
what's there I don't know no look for
one look a poly world let's make it
clear that this phone is not waterproof
waterproof by the way the definition of
waterproof is something that is
completely impervious to water this is a
water resistant phone resistant ip67
which means it believe it could handle
being underwater one meter one meter for
30 minutes 30 minutes and weed through
hours and a fish tank
okay and it came out fine okay so I mean
sorry about that so I would say I mean I
don't think there's any risk and shower
with the phone aside from the fact that
that seems that could get messy
especially if you factor soap and
shampoo but I don't think it's going to
destroy the phone I think you drop your
phone in the toilet that's fine but i
would go swimming with this thing yeah
but you can if you are why again yeah
why would you take your phone in the
wall intentionally intentionally to be
fair I I've got any dragazine I've gone
kayaking and you know canoeing a lot
where I always leave my phone behind but
I always think you know I wish I were
here so i could take this cool photo
true true although if you went kayak I
never sent that shower but if you
dropped your phone while kayaking I feel
like you'd probably screwed either way
like if it fell down there and then I go
white water condition that just well if
it flows down the river like I'm gonna
come baby sit down I don't it's heavy
enough it's gonna sink right I would
think so I would still resisting though
maybe I can grab it like quickly before
it's truly if you had the instincts or
reflexes of a ninja you do this would
you try it out we we good yes you're
getting in some dangerous territory here
yeah I don't well we're putting way too
much emphasis on what we should not do
with the phone I think that kind of goes
without all right what moving on I mean
well for one zaid wants to know what's a
day today it's a tuesday at number 13
thanks for coming all the way to youtube
to find out the day today roald dahl's
birthday there you go oh yeah i had
david says I have Samsung s7 edge and
play pokemon in the shower sometimes
that's all right it happens you can not
too far off David what did you call in
the shower uh-oh Pokemon wise oh come on
let's make that clear yeah we actually
our iPhone videos are out today all the
Apple videos are up on cnet com so they
want to take a loser global coverage
spent the whole weekend and mr. Scott
Stein Anthony by the way says please
discuss the iphone not including an
AMOLED screen oh good catch ya that is
it that is a good comment that one of
the things that Samsung and definite
advantage over right now is screen
quality AMOLED screen has crisper colors
for blacks a higher resolution actually
that's qhd i believe the than the iphone
which is over lower I mean it's still
good looking screen and at that size
it's really hard to tell but it's good
point like apple doesn't have as an
embrace amyloid yet I'm going to refer
to one of our cnet reviews where about
the iphone 7 we're on the release date
wars basically look like how many how
many people actually have their iphone
screen brightness all the way completely
up i think that i didn't have phone is
as bright as it needs to be that's true
I fact I well because I'm often in a
dark room like praying that my kids
sleeping I have my phone's brightness
all the way down to the lowest setting I
wish I could go alone yeah even on my on
my android phones i have a screen dimmer
app just to make it even like even
darker yeah oh yeah fenelon they should
have some kind of LEDs going to make a
go the other way but it's not just about
brightness right AMOLED screens like the
the screen resolutions a little bit
that's a better argument yet me for sure
and i'm hoping i think that the rumor is
the next iphone that that they will
start corporal gamma was getting the
rumor mill started now yeah well you're
in advance let's go jose says I believe
the matte black color is a better color
versus the black I agree to agree just
in general bed because who would want to
risk fingerprint smudges in scrabble
disclosure I've already ordered by my
black iphone you got in jet black or
just black matte black not the jet black
yeah we're same black a lot but I agree
it's fingerprint we've already got
scratches on our jet black test model oh
really yeah i mean it's it's interesting
the apple even says it on its site
they've never really done that it just
goes like micro brazzers will show up
I'm like well that was they call Micro
abrasions I know it's a it's a nice
textured a fingerprint yeah no no micro
operations sounds like a really bad like
Ed endo just scratches out there I
thought there anything right yeah you
guys want to start on electronica band
called microbe regions if I played any
instruments I would love to do that come
on everyone talented it although
unfortunately it would just start to see
that band we called micro brazen it's
not with your micro abrasions do that or
I always liked the term shaft rededges
what's that jargon for champ that those
are the well this is bill I think two
models ago the kind of like the shiny
edge polished edge of the iphone oh yeah
yeah i think i have one yep spurred
edges that was like for a while everyone
was really obsessed about shepherd craig
wants to know if anyone's tested the IE
earpods yet which until I want to just
say like and this is I'm going to your
butts yeah an idiot because I've been
calling him earbuds for the last two
weeks right because apparently I really
like the Disney movie about the golden
retriever so yeah somebody should just
go ahead and call me out on that in the
chat here I think Scott's tried out
there bears already a video on fact
Scott was the subject of a beam he was
basically on the front page of reddit is
his mug with those air pods as an
example of why you should be wearing ear
pods uh you know their look their ugly
we get that the general gist is there
good headphones as far as Bluetooth
wireless headphones go function wise
sound sound wise so I find just as good
or as mediocre as your standard airpot
absolutely they're not any better right
but there are a hundred seventy bucks
that's nope yeah for hundreds of dollars
you can get better headphones for this
you should expect a better audio quality
the only advantage that air pods have is
that as i think w one chip the the chip
that basically lets a pair with an
iphone much easier I thought yes it does
do that there's own pad and that's the
only advantage it has over all those
other bluetooth headphones are out there
well they've also been touting their
like microphone feature on it which
right know how if it's as good as they
say it it's acceptable yeah from what we
found out you can see more in the video
that's up on cnet yeah goes into better
detail we can't really show it with
sound on this but if you can check out
the video you get a little bit of a demo
of how that sounds and works through and
there there again they're they're fine
but I don't think there's anyone in this
worldly things that they are the most
stunning new design out there no you
know cautious good question about when
iOS
and will come out or what else actually
be stable enough for us to update mhm
just a reminder iOS 10 comes out today
and we believe it should be going live
about half an hour if history repeats
itself so on one o'clock our time ten
o'clock eastern or pacific i wouldn't i
wouldn't upgrade to iOS 10 now i think
the last couple of times people
operating early they ended up in
unintentionally breaking their phone or
losing connectivity I'd wait for the
bugs to kind of shake out see what what
issues pop up in you know in a couple
days brave into new world of iOS 10 I'm
anxious to see what the cutoff point is
though for like bit you know people who
have older model yeah yeah you know i'm
still using a 5s i mean i might be
prompted to jump onto my six if it's not
compatible when I think it will be
compatible but it's just gonna like run
slower that's what I mean yeah yeah I
want to shout out to old time freedom
also as an audio engineer I also want a
traditional headphone jack just that one
out there all right and after that we're
just gonna let them Duke it out in the
chat for a while because I think we've
pretty much said that they're all there
is to be said uh end of the day both you
give a one to 10 rating on our new apple
endeavor I would say if you just bought
an iphone last year I would say it's a
five if you are up for an upgrade it's a
seven or eight it's a logical upgrade if
your phone's more than two years old but
other than that well sure do you like me
who needs to have the newest greatest
all the time you should probably save
your money wait until the 2017 iphone
that's the one that's gonna blow you
away hopefully hopefully I'm going to
give it a six which was the passing
grade for my high school which is better
really that it passes it passes but a
bit you know it doesn't stunned me or
anything you know I'm not gonna put on
my fridge but it passes oh my gosh all
right we should wrap it up there alright
awesome well if you like everything you
saw or heard here checks out on cnet our
podcast is also available on itunes
