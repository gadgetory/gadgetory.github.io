should you buy physical or digital
copies of games well hey everybody
what's going on my name is Jeff Bakalar
welcome to no sorry
the CNET debate show where I argue with
friends and colleagues over three rounds
of dead serious debate joining me today
the one the only Abby Russell from Giant
Bomb hello that's me I've come prepared
I have notes and I'm ready to debate I'm
here to win I want to be the first away
champion of no sorry
well it's good I switched sides this
week because everybody thought I was
rigging the show and I'm not I'm
switching slides just to show you I'm
not rigging it I don't know how that
proof is not rigging it but that's what
I'm doing
joining us today to our right the judge
also from Giant Bomb
mr. Vinny Caravela hello then hi I'm
here to be the impartial judge in all of
these hot topics great thank you for
being believable okay we flipped a coin
backstage to see who would start first
Abby is going to begin as soon as we
hear the first topic from mr. Caravela
furnace topic is video games physical
media where you can pick them up in the
old brick-and-mortar store order them
online well did you know where you get
the convenience of getting it at home
you have 90 seconds on the clock
take it away great so I'm starting with
some physical games so my one of my
favorite things about physical games is
that they're very smart physical games
are a good boss I would say they have a
well-shaped head looks good with glasses
on or without oh oh my gosh I'm so sorry
this is my Vinny is good note not my
physical games is good no so sorry about
that Vinny um can we reset the clock
reset the clock how bad happens it
happens oh okay anyway back in it
physical games what's good about
physical games is a lot of times you can
find them cheaper they're on sale you
cannot use gift cards it's much easier
to you know find them at a lower cost I
would say also you can resell them you
could buy them used so it's just like
you know more bang for your buck right
sure
also you own this item this is not a
thing that is going to be lost in the
ether once you die you could pass it
down to your family you could start a
collection also you know it's sometimes
you get this nice reversible art with
your games you know you can flip out the
thing it's like a physical thing it
looks nice on the shelf sometimes it'll
come with like an insert that's like a
poster or even like a map in the game or
even like a nice book that's that's very
luxe it's very nice to speak a little
bit can I speak for you just a little
bit ok my name is Abby Russell oh my god
I hate the environment I hate it the
environment is garbage and that's what
physical games make more of garbage we
don't need these these empty vessels
being shipped all over the world what do
they do they're useless there's no point
to them this does have a bunch of data
that's not even the final version of the
game you have to download that as soon
as you pop in the disc why am i buying a
physical piece of media if all it is is
just the rights to play a game save the
environment go digital that's what I'm
here to say why in a million years do I
need to collect physical pieces of junk
when I could just download them and live
my life the way it's meant to be so
we're not gonna rebuttal
I just don't think we have time for it
ok fine all right Vinnie I'm sorry
Vinnie okay what do you think you want
to buy some stuff what do you what do
you think buddy Abby gets immediately
one point for the weird mid-atlantic
accent strategic tactic it was very good
very good I liked it a lot Jeff did a
terrible job arguing why we don't need
physical goods in our lives so Abby I'm
gonna give you another two points which
put you at 3 and Jeff a 2
well why am I only getting more points
the bad argument I mean listen I
understand Abby hates the environment
that's an important topic to talk about
I mean we can do bad environment versus
a good environment up there for that but
we're not here for that argument three
points the Abby Russell all right you're
poison Jeff masculine all right three
two two can't argue with the judge
that's fine I will be starting this
round Vinnie what is the topic please
the next topic is an internet classic
boy they love this one
it's it's dogs or cats which one which
one is it gonna be Jeff and Abby you
have 90 seconds to take this old
chestnut and run it out okay cats are
the most selfish animals in the entire
world cats won't give up about you
whatsoever they only care about heat and
food if you if you're in trouble you
have your story but a cat saving its
owners like if you're in trouble you're
on the for you like help help oh I can't
just wait for you to die and eat you a
dog a dog with dial nine-one-one
drive you to the hospital and then pay
all your bills for you dogs are man's
best friend for a reason
because we love them and they love us
back and cats are just selfish animals
and they don't care about anybody but
themselves
that's simple great my turn so as we all
know cats are pretty great first of all
they're soft as hell I mean what softer
than a cat truly nothing they're also
very small so you can have them in your
bed they're not gonna take over the
entire thing but still be warm and comfy
while in your bed and you know you make
the argument that maybe they're selfish
maybe they're too independent but I say
that's a good thing you know
cats can basically take care of
themselves you don't have to take them
out twice a day or more you don't have
to train them you don't have to you know
constantly have a needy thing at your
feet
am i right Jeff no they're great also if
it's an outdoor cat you basically have
to do jack shit for it I'm just saying
if it's an outdoor cat it's not yours
cats come prepackaged with razors in
their hands that's not cool but if the
cat bites you or molls you that's
because with it and if a cat if a dog
does that then you're probably gonna get
hurt real bad anyway one of the best
things about cats is the drool stays in
their mouths oh no there's something
lovable about dog drool okay it's smelly
it's wet it's a key just like Vinnie who
won that round my friend the top one
Abbi made some very good points about
cats and jelly and some very good points
about dogs
unfortunately cast basically are just
waiting to eat you when you fall asleep
so Jeff Bakalar gets four points and
advocates one
we're just waiting yeah because cats are
just waiting they're like it's like she
can do that
the judge will kill you for bias all
right final round the score six to four
this is a close one I'm in the lead only
by two points whole this last topic I
just don't know Vinnie Caravela what is
it so what we all want to know finally
to end this hot topic is in a fight who
would win a bat or a knife
okay that was a conversation that can
never make it to air ever ever again
burn the footage Binney what is our
safety final topic please all right
last topic is Halloween we need to take
the best eerie game each of you pick a
game you have 90 seconds to debate it go
okay so I will start obviously the
answer is PT playable trailer is the
condensed version of that it is a free
game that came out there was a lot of
lore around it people didn't even know
what this game was when it came out it
created an entire culture of people just
trying to figure out how to play this
game
it is so simplistic and its simplicity
makes it so realistic looking and so
viscerally scary and through all of that
through its simplicity it still manages
to be very complex hard to solve but the
community that came around it did solve
it and it's still incredibly scary I
think this is one of the best games I
think it's a crime that silent hill's
was cancelled but despite that back to
spite the fact that this was only a
teaser game a demo game it is truly
incredible I think the best scary game I
have ever played probably will ever play
and it's so hard to find now because
they delete it from the store but you
can't find it you can't play it and
that's what adds to how scary it is it's
hard to find that is it creates the
lower I I respect that answer I fully
agree with almost everything you said
but I'm going to say that the scariest
video game and best video game is
Resident Evil 4 because that game was
the first one that really launched that
entire franchise into a much more like
hyper hyper realistic sort of tone with
the camera over like the third person to
the side and the enemy design was like
drooling eyeballs and all the disgusting
things that would come out of people's
necks and stuff like that it was scary
on a level that I just was not expecting
and the gameplay in that game is
obviously fantastic such a creepy sense
of wasn't just monsters just like the
atmosphere and that that feeling of doom
good work Jeff well played however this
shakes out you and I just compete
awesome glad to be here Vinnie Caravela
how's it shake out ooh this was a tough
one
I do like Resident Evil 4
but PT is definitely a scarier game to
play
yeah look perhaps but is it the better
scary is it a better scary game yes by
four points scarier more points carry
one point for Jeff Bakalar Abby Russell
takes four points also prove Abby wrong
go find a copy of Beatty it's the
scariest game you can't do it it was it
was a damn pleasure thank you I'm so
happy to be the new nope sorry King I'll
be back next week with a new guest
that's right but seriously I'm more than
happy to lose to you this was a great
debate that's the final score 8 to 7
Abby takes it what does she win oh that
came out fast a black eye you were a
life-size Ironman thank you so much you
are the iron Queen there you go I can
see nothing okay
we're just gonna make you wear that for
the rest of the workday thanks so much
