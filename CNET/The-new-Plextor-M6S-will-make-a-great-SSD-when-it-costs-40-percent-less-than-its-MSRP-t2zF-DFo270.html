only m6s or state drive from plextor you
know is the internal start device that
can use inside a computer to replace a
regular hard drive like this one right
here this plextor here come in the 2.5
inch standard SSD internal drive and
that mean you can fit in virtually all
application where a regular hard drive
of the same standard work now over you
can see it has SATA port right here it
support the latest SI TI is sickly bit
per second but we work with all previous
standards of SATA now plextor has been
known or at least wanted to be known as
the maker of the luxurious SSD just like
acura and Lixus in cars but this new
drive here is very much a Honda Civic
now 41 is the first SSD that flex oil
prices must lower than previous drive it
come in three capacity 128 gigabyte 256
gigabyte and 512 megabyte that cost 140
250 and 500 dollars respectively and
that means it's mostly cost less than a
dollar per gigabyte note that that
doesn't make it the most affordable
drive on the market just the most
affordable from plextor expect the
street price to be lower in fact a lot
lower if this dry here is to be
successful and that because of the
second reason why I would not compare
this one to perform on car the
performance in my testing it is actually
one of the slowest among the recent SSD
I've review it's not slow just the
slowest among many other drive but don't
worry if you use this one here to
replace your hard drive which is is main
purpose you will still see a world of
difference in performing game it's just
that you can get faster SSD now in the
market for actually a lot cheaper that's
that unless you can get this new drive
here for less than 50 cent per gigabyte
or $125 or so for this 256 gigabyte you
will not get yourself a good deal now
for more this drive here check out my
flu
review etsy.com if you wonder if blixt
oh it's out of the premium SSD market
the answer is no it now actually focuses
on the new PCI Express base SSD such as
this m6e right here this is a totally
new internal storage device and only
works in certain desktop computer but I
might still review it anyway if you ask
me nicely and repeatedly and that's
because I'm double 0 and this has been
the first look at the am sick s so stay
dry public store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
