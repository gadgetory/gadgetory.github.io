currently streaming live on two phones
with two different apps it's an
evolutionary change in the way we view
content on the one hand I've got meerkat
and on the other periscope now let's
compare the two both live streaming apps
only work on iphones at least for now
you can do this spontaneously or you can
schedule it for a future date using
meerkat you can broadcast yourself and
notify those following you right away or
you can see the live broadcast of those
you follow on twitter and view it
immediately you can see how many people
are watching you can like the string and
make comments if no one you know is
streaming any live video you'll see a
mostly blank page and once a stream is
no longer live there is a way to save to
the broadcaster's camera roll but your
audience on meerkat will be out of left
there are also some major differences
between meerkat and periscope with
periscope now available and backed by
Twitter's enormous audience there's a
huge influx of new video streams both
from those you know and those who don't
it features three videos at the top and
a giant list of other videos from around
the world it's a lot like channel
surfing and with so many options you'll
likely find a lot more streams you'll
enjoy like meerkat you can like videos
using hearts and make comments but with
periscope broadcasters can post where
they are located using GPS showing you
exactly where the activity is happening
and follow along turn by turn these live
streams will also be viewable even after
it's no longer live meerkat may have
started the revolution the periscope is
set to take over that offers more
features more ways to get connected and
more people that are part of the Twitter
community the sky's the limit with these
live streaming apps the way we
experience events happening all over the
world from a very voyeuristic point of
view will change dramatically may be
addictive it may be mundane or maybe a
complete game changer
