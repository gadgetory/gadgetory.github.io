the man from uncle Guy Ritchie's movie
reboot of the classic Cold War spy
series is soon to hit cinemas one man
who's already seen it is suave
undercover agent the man from cnet
himself it's rich trend home and I rich
hello double agent double age oh no not
for something on that ah triple agent
Triplett so is the film any good yeah I
liked it it's a kind of breezy playful
pastiche of 60 spy movies it's nowhere
near as serious as all the spine moves
we've seen in previous years so it's a
it's it's really kind of fun it brings
to mind James Bond but it also it also
brings to my late Harry Palmer as well
another kind of classic 60 spice so yeah
I enjoy watching the trailers it
definitely looks like there's a lot of
style coming to the forefront here how
does style play into the movie well it's
easily one of the best dressed movies of
the year if not for quite some time I
mean right from the lead to an heir with
Henry Cavill in his it's three-piece
suit as Napoleon solo and then iliya
Corey Arkin is the Russian agent who has
a different a different look there's all
these kind of 60s mod styles great mini
dresses and chic outfits so it looks
absolutely fantastic you could say that
that it's a bit style over substance
it's very very glossy and the plot isn't
really that much to speak of but it's a
real treat for a retro mod 60s fans
how's the action in it what does it
bring to the action movie table it kind
of approaches each action scene instead
of saying okay this is a car chase and
showing you a car chase with the kind of
conventions that we've seen before it
tries to do something a little bit
different so it's more of a game of
cat-and-mouse than it is a sort of tire
squealing you know smashing crashing
kind of car chase there's quite a few
action set-pieces actually which are
deliberately played for for laughs and
for comedy and done in a slightly
different way which put me kind of in
mind of the the study off-kilter way
that they made the Ipcress file back in
the 60s with that with Michael Caine so
it's so it's a little bit different to
your sort of your standard action-movie
it's quite it's quite breezy and playful
and quite fun with it okay now with
Mission Impossible we've got another
bond coming up at Kingsman and if it
feels like spy movies are back in
fashion yeah absolutely well it's
interesting that that mission apostle
rogue nation is another 60s reboot so
it's an old TV show Kingsman is was was
a very kind of again a very playful very
stylish movie and I think we're starting
to see with
to sort of the idea of the gentleman spy
the dashing spite here which is
interesting because we've kind of
finally learned that when we've already
know always known that spying is a bit
sordid a bit tawdry but now since Edward
Snowden we've kind of learned that it's
not only really sore there's also really
banal so it's kind of interesting to her
to see that we're taking solace in these
so these fun dashing two-fisted
gentleman spies again so would you
recommend people go see it I think if
you're a fan of 60 spy movies then it
will hark back to the sort of the dip
the movies you might watch on a Sunday
afternoon like I say it is a bit in a
bit lightweight but yeah definitely
stylish and qualified okay well thank
you we've got more of Rich's review
which I heartily recommend you can find
that and loads more at cnet com not now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
