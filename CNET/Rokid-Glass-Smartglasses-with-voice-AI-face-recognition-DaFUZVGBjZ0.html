2018 if you look closely a lot of
companies making smart glasses are also
dabbling in voice and AI to broken glass
is made by a Chinese company broken that
focuses on AI and a particular in this
case voice and visual layout broken
glass is a symbol display in one eye
voice assistant and gesture controls
it's supposed to be able to allow you to
control and access things better the
camera that's built in
according to roken will also do facial
recognition and will be able to
recognize characters and items on paper
without markers now here the crowded Las
Vegas convention hall you can't get the
boys out of work we did see the facial
recognition demo briefly and the
displaying role Lafitte
awkward on my face but the idea is that
maybe this design will get shrunken out
of it it'll work with prescription
lenses it is wide enough that it can fit
on my nose right now the idea here is
very similar to what you see in musics
is play which has Amazon Alexa does
voice AI makes sense with smart glasses
and smart glasses even work for average
people when will that happen right now
it seems like there's a lot of
experimentation trying to figure out how
Boyce can help but of course they're not
going to easily be able to grab controls
and swiping may not be so much fun here
CES 2018 AR is largely an experiment in
progress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
