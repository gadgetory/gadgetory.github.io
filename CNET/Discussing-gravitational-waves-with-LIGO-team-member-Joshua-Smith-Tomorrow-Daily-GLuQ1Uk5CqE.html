toys Mattel announced at the new york
toy fair and talk about charging
electronics as you walk with your shoe
soles we also have a great guest helping
a step through the gigantic science news
that happened this week about
gravitational waves lastly we answer
your questions about whether or not
title will sink or swim haha was a
hilarious pun do a back at her Hackett
and also tell you what we're into its to
our daily greetings citizens of the
internet welcome to tomorrow daily
domestique talk show in the known
universe I'm Ashley skema and i'm jeff
cannata and today's thursday so we're
deep diving as some of the headlines we
talked about this week where we got
first get out your swim caps let's talk
about metallica toy fair because i
thought this was a really big deal this
is a really big deal well toys are very
big deals this is like these are new
high-tech toy 21st century tech toys uh
firstly look we'll discuss Barbie's
dream house because Barbie Barbie's
dream house I always really thought I
had it a little better than Barbie
because i was like i have a working
smartphone it's not just a plastic no I
have uhhh i have like moving legs i got
working knees all those great things
imagining this this thought happening
like about two weeks ago yeah playing on
the barbie this is when I was 30 years
old little bit not this is very recent
uh so now mattel showed off a smart
dream house this is the new hello I
think it's like hello Barbie Dreamhouse
yeah Barbies gots a smart home as any up
and coming young urban professional
would yes she's connected to the
Internet of Things now the smart home is
now connected to Skynet and the world
will never be the same does this mean
that smart home has arrived is this
think that kids are playing in a smart
home they expect their appliances to be
smart right i think so i think this is a
really interesting kind of fair weather
kind of flag towards mass adoption of
smart home technology and Internet for
tiny bar be missed she have a tiny Alexa
there you go Alexis her actual for it's
an actual person though it's like it
hasn't and has it has an Amazon echo
built into the doll named alexa
cool using theirs okay so here's the
controversy surrounding there's actually
a controversy I was doing some research
and apparently before there was a hello
Barbie that you could do talk to you
talk to it right and this is in the same
I believe in the same line as a hello
Barbie Dreamhouse okay a lot of parents
are really concerned that privacy issues
your your kids are going to get bands
you're being listened being doctrine
ated into a culture of zero privacy
we're being listened to it sit there
listening your kid the house is
listening for command so it is that a
privacy issue is that a thing that
parents should be concerned about I
don't know I don't have kids like we are
the worst judges about I think maybe the
fact that the dreamhouse says do you
tell us your parents also security
number yeah yeah good barbie dreamhouse
starts asking for your parents personal
information or mommy's pin mommy's a
maiden name it's like this terrible yeah
Regulus things but I think this is a
really interesting concept because yes
that that is a thing that I think people
should especially with the Apple news
this week of them saying no to the FBI
and protecting their users privacy
that's what they say they're doing there
this is the fight of the 21st century to
me it's is private digital privacy this
is a big deal yeah and it's made its way
all the way into toys that's it's not
insignificant no I I'm not particularly
alarmed about the toys but I think
you're right that it is representative
of a larger discussion that is how much
stuff in our house do you want listening
to you and who's listening and do we
have any kind of control over what's
being recorded I have an Alexa I have an
xbox one I'm not particularly worried
about that stuff but I can understand
the idea behind it yeah the idea and the
concern behind it does can make sense
there are some reasonable argument to be
made in that whole thing okay so move
let's briefly touch on the thing maker
which used to be I really love
researching this because this used to
actually be a toy in the 60s that I I
was not in fact aware of because I was
not a child of the 60s I was
non-existent um this was a it almost was
like remember the creepy crawly ovens
do I your own creepy crawlies that was
in the 90s I didn't have any ovens when
I was for some goop in there and then
you would you would put them in a little
like you don't have easy bake oven thing
and then we pull them out you got these
like sort of gel bugs poison you're
alone as always a little bugs they look
like gummy worms but they were actual
like there was yeah you don't want to
eat them have been really bad but thing
okay so thing maker now is a 3d printer
for kids this is I think this is a
representative of the idea that three
printers are going to be so inexpensive
that we're all going to have them and
that's awesome yeah it is awesome hey
this is what it can be 300 bucks yeah so
300 otters and you'll be able to 3d
print things I think you're gonna be
able to 3d print food this is not food
though this is not food no this is just
plastic toys and they actually worked
with Autodesk which no is it very
complicated software to create a
simplified version for kids that's also
have an app on iOS and Android will
they'll drag and drop and say okay well
this is what I want my toy to look like
and then BOOM thing maker prints it out
I mean there's there's an argument to be
made that they are literally creating
things that will put themselves out of
business you know if you can just create
your own toys why do you need Mattel to
create them well at some point I think
you would you know in the future let's I
mean let's think about the possibilities
in the future you go on to your Mattel
app yeah you find a Barbie that you
really like you customize it exactly the
way you want in tone eyes hair whatever
and you press a button and your 2050
thing maker and in 30-40 years from now
much sooner print out a full bar be that
is customed what you want or a toy that
is exactly what you want and you pay
Mattel for those design for the design I
am I am a hundred percent in agreement
that this is where the future is headed
I I'm convinced that in the future the
economy will be an economy of ideas that
all you're paying for is the design
there'll be people that can design
chairs that can people that can design
toys of people I can design clothes and
I will be able to have all the
manufacturing done in my own home
because I push it with you know but by
the puzzle filaments and different types
of you know metal and plastics and you
know you have a thing that you did puts
the hair in for it
what do you buy the idea of the thing
you might resign in the idea the
blueprint of the idea and then you print
it out right there I'm convinced that's
the way that's the way the economy is
going to be soon we think sooner than
you think I said I think it'll take a
long time for people to jump on that
bandwagon but I do think there will be
people sort of like the ones who are
like oh my car runs on ethanol or
foreign oil or trash or whatever it's
like that there'll be people like that
well we just have to get to the point
where 3d printers get to the point where
we they indistinguishable for something
you'd buy that in the store very not
there yet quite area it's how the
quality is not there yet um okay so next
story let's talk about is them I really
love this the shoe sole that can create
like generate store like harvest and
store energy so yeah kinetic energy
right it's kind of so it's um it
actually uses what's called a bubbler
method and there's a lot of science
behind this method but it's non
mechanical parts so it's actually taking
the energy that you the water is going
for that you're creating like as you
walk and harvesting it and then storing
it into it has a little tiny generator
yeah there you go energy generator
inside a shoe sole and then and then
it's got a little battery it puts all
the energy into that here's here's how
this is cool first of all everybody
hates charging their phone-charging
their devices of all kinds everybody
thinks it's a pain try to find an outlet
try to my phone is low battery at the
worst time be it advocates for getting
up and doing and going and walking and
being active and not sitting around all
day trail so you get benefits from
actually moving through your life so you
combine that with sort of a fitness
tracker that you said you need 2,000
steps today but also because you need to
charge your phone twenty percent battery
that's a pretty grace like tell me on my
Fitbit how many steps I need to charge
my battery to thank you percent or
whatever I need to I need to charge my
phone and make a call I'm gonna run down
to the down the block real quick take a
quick take awake job the Hyrule I really
like they talk about a little bit more a
University of wisconsin-madison talks a
little bit the team that worked on this
are I believe they are electrical
engineers their engineers who worked on
this and they said you know the
applications for military would be
really amazing because you could have
some
soldier charging a lot of different
devices that they need while they're out
in the field not having to find a place
to actually plug them in up down and
give me twenty percent battery life
because I need some battery for my phone
and and then the other part that I
thought was the most interesting the
potential of installing a Wi-Fi hotspot
in your shoe and so what would happen is
the energy that you create would power
this hotspot which means your phone
would never be disconnecting and
reconnecting to Wi-Fi and cell phone
towers there hypothetically extending
the life of your battery because that's
one of the things that kills your
battery the most it's constant
connection to those towers uh up to end
up to ten times your smartphone's
current battery life like you'd be able
to just extend it out because you'd have
Wi-Fi on you all the time you'd always
be connected to one network you never
have to switch a lot of towers you know
it was a very own issues hypothetical
kind of scenario that i thought was
really weird and cool we got a lot of
feedback on this story actually we'll
wrote in and said charger shoes plus
backpack battery / dock for drone plus
drone plus hololens equals HUD vision
with map I like that's a hole he's got a
whole set up is that whole set up ready
to go the 12-step program that ends in
you being completely digitally and
completely digitally to that it Ricky
wrote in and said kinetic charging
please smiley face um and there is
actually a kinetic charging device that
came out was a Kickstarter while ago
called ampe move I don't know if you
guys have seen this this is it right
here it's a little device though that
you actually wear on your body and then
as you run and stuff it's it's an
external battery pack that charges based
on motion so their watches for decades
that do this yeah because watches need
so little you know just regular analog
watches need so little emotion it's like
it stores that and then uses it to watch
it never needs a battery those like
citizen eco-drive of course of course
and then Dustin Rodin said forget the
fancy back to the future two shoes of
Power laces this is 2016 we need shoes
to power our phones that's right and our
laces and our Power laces because we
need Power laces um okay so that is it
for our headlines yeah we do have a very
interesting asked ed we will we will
keep it keep it short kept it real what
but I thought this was a really good
question and actually I'd like to expand
at hey TD to include any questions you
guys might have we might make it a
little segment like everyone segments
answer your questions on the show so use
that hashtag hey TD and then ask us
something like like blowing Ronnie wrote
in to us and said do you think title
will be a success even Kanye can't
convince me to convert from Spotify it's
it's a tough space right now the
streaming music space it it feels very
crowded and it's only getting more
crowded so it's hard to get people
people are creatures of habit but I
think ultimately doesn't everything come
down to price features and ease of use I
think so but also I think that there is
there is an intangible that is very
difficult for companies like title to
grasp these are all artists that have
kind of come together and created this
streaming service and that's all well
and good and I appreciate their kind of
efforts there but if people aren't using
your service in the first place you're
not making it compelling enough to use
in the first place what's the value at
what's the thing you're doing that no
one else can get and creativity it's the
exclusivity so Kanye is like life of
Pablo only going to be on title I'm
never never never putting it on Apple
laughs laughs so he went crazy this
weekend which is decided to one day one
of the reasons they say that his album
is one of the most bootleg over half a
million pirated the life of Pablo in
less than a week so that's not
necessarily a good thing guys like
exclusivity not necessarily great maybe
a week of exclusivity two weeks you say
for the first month and then it'll come
out on other streaming platforms yeah
that's a toilet it's a tough sell to try
to force people into it by saying the
only place you can get it is here yeah I
think the way that people want to accept
those things is you go well you can get
it anywhere but here is lower price or
its value add what value what's the
thing we're offering that no one else is
doing here's here's my advice to you
title if you're watching which JZ huge
fan of the show I know you are um here's
my suggestion you Apple music is a mess
I left our do and I had to go to apple
music I i am trying out Spotify right
now and I'm not really sure how I feel
about it yeah I'm trying out Apple music
because it's native to the iphone
experience and it's
terrible it's so counterintuitive it's
so unlike a lot of software Apple like
Apple oh it's so frustrating because
Apple sometimes ships this like really
half-baked software like iTunes you mean
like iTunes on the piece of garbage like
Apple maps like Siri when they launched
all these products that they have not
traditionally done a great job of good
software at launch and the thing is is
Apple music is so counterintuitive and
so unlike apples design ethos which is
it just works it just it doesn't just
work you have to really look for certain
things there it's not easy to use it's
very confusing you have to go into the
itunes store to buy stuff you have to
leave Apple music it's very weird and so
my suggestion is title if you want to
survive you have to make a great you
have to make a product that's better
than everybody else you can't make it
just as good right it can't be just as
good it has to be heads and shoulders
better than everyone else and you can't
just have two or three artists releasing
exclusive albums you've got to get so
many artists on board to say I'm only
going to release it on title because
this is the place where my artistry is
appreciated and the artists will be paid
so the short answer your question is no
we don't think it's yeah I don't think
it's going to survive so on that note
we're going to take a quick break we
want you to watch this amazing video I
guess it took up more than a year or two
design and get done it's called star
cart I don't know if you didn't yeah
combo of star wars and programs amazing
stuff and then when we come back we will
have Josh Smith the director of a
gravitational wave physics and astronomy
Center at cal state university fullerton
to talk about gravitational waves in the
discovery that science has made last
week so stick around its tomorrow daily
some huge science news this week some of
Einstein's oldest unproven theories have
been proven true but it's pretty dense
stuff so we got an awesome guest to come
help us unpack this news today we do
from cal state university fullerton we
have the director of gravitational wave
physics and astronomy center joshua
smith hello thank you can we call you
can we tell you Joshy prefer Josh please
call me Josh awesome Josh this is as
Jeff said very dense stuff but again
proving some theories Einstein had about
ripples in space-time that are over a
hundred years old this is the theory of
relativity right the theory we know of
general relativity and that's right so a
hundred years ago a hundred years ago
Einstein told us that gravity works
differently than Newton said so Newton
said that you would have a force between
two objects based on their masses and
Einstein said gravity works by curving
space and time right but with a curved
space-time he said that if you had
masses that accelerated kind of moved
around like this they should also make
ripples in space and time that would
carry the information out they showed
out yeah we've never seen them before
that's right he said theoretically it
should happen we've never seen them
before and the reason we'd never seen
them before is because they're so small
right absolutely so in Einstein's
original paper he said if you put in the
equation and you calculate what the
amplitude is it's practically vanishing
for any numbers that you put in but at
the time 100 years ago Einstein didn't
think about two black holes going around
each other in space he was he was you
know hundred years ago that wasn't a
known system so basically the idea is
that there's stuff that has mass in the
universe that mass causes ripples in in
gravity yep and because black holes have
so much mass we're actually able to
measure their waves their gravitational
a very tiny tiny movement yeah so
actually the black holes have so much
mass and they're going around each other
so fast so they're going around each
other so fast it's a fraction of the
speed of light
the black holes that we saw were a
billion light years away so if you were
there the waves would be really really
strong surf um yeah they would get on a
surfboard which answers one of our
viewer questions they said can you in
fact surf on gray if you were there a
billion years ago I think being a
billion years ago being close enough to
surf on the on the gravitational waves
from the black holes would be very bad
for your health oh okay you could do it
on it but you could do it and then die
kind of like pixel surfing here we go
yeah sure so what a gravitational wave
is actually space-time changing so
you're you're actually things are
actually moving closer to you or farther
away from you yes that's amazing the
space and time between objects changes
as the gravitation wave passes and
that's how we measure it so we build a
giant it's called interferometer the
laser interferometer gravitational-wave
Observatory that looks at the difference
between distances and mirrors with laser
beams so it makes a very accurate
measurement of that distance and the
distance changes as a wave passes by but
the change is so tiny on earth that it
took a hundred years to develop the
technology to be able to make that
attacked that I'm talking like the size
of what I like oh it's like the diameter
of a hydrogen atom right about a
thousandth of the diameter of a proton
more like it so Wow so we're talking
about 10 to the minus 19 meters which
seems like an impossible number it does
but we've played we've we've worked on
lots of areas of technology to make that
possible and it is possible and that's
where how do we measure that small of a
distance it a billion light years away
so using the lasers and the mirrors we
make that accurate measurement and there
are a lot of things you have to overcome
one of them is just the mirrors
themselves have atoms in them that
jiggle around atoms and molecules yeah
it turns out if you try to make a
measurement with a very small amount of
laser light in a very small area the
atoms will jiggle too much so you have
to make a measurement with a big laser
spot to average over the statistical
jiggling of them so they averaged 20 so
you can measure the true see I have
atoms that jiggle too I can relate yeah
we all we all do um so one of the things
that I thought was really interesting
was uh one of the videos online they
sort of talked about
how they actually attempted to measure
for this back in the 60s and 70s and did
not have the technology at and also
built small like you were saying it
didn't quite work so right LIGO now is
two different locations and the actual
length of each because it's a
perpendicular series of tunnels right
exactly and so the this perpendicular
series of tunnels are five kilometers
long four kilometers two and a half
miles two and a half miles long so we're
looking at a two and a half mile long
tube for each of these lasers two lasers
/ Lego a / observatory and that's for
like redundancy redken shrimp yeah well
so the the two observatories is for
redundancy to check each other because
you wouldn't want a local disturbance to
be measured at one and then not have a
way to tell that it was local right so
by having two widely separated detectors
and by the way we want to build more we
want to build one in India there's one
coming online in Italy and there's one
in Germany oh wow with multiple
detections on widely separated fronts
you can tell that it wasn't a local
disturbance right that it wasn't an
anomaly or something that was like you
can confirm that this actually is a
definable measurement that happened in
two different places and it's okay go
ahead and another thing we can do is we
can match what we measure to the
predictions using Einstein's equations
so you can use Einstein's equations to
solve what you think the system should
look like into this case two black holes
that are 30 times the mass of the Sun
going around each other and that gives a
waveform prediction for what you should
expect and you can match that against
what you really see to gain confidence
that what you saw came in fact from that
type of cyst I see okay so what does
this mean this means I was right and
this is sort of the last bit of his
theory that hadn't been observationally
proven proven right so there are it is
challenging to test at different aspects
of Einstein's theory and I'm not sure
that you can say that this is the last
bit that's been proven because what
we'll do is we'll continue to test the
theory with more and more accuracy and
look for any small deviations that we
see between his theory of gravity and
what we actually observe for scientists
it's exciting if you see deviations
because that means something is wrong
and maybe we can we can get a deeper
understanding by figuring that out
everybody wants a sign to be wrong no
know what that guys always right 100
year
he was right I mean that's crazy yeah
it's very it's so unbelievable it's an
amazing thing does this have practical
application going forward for scientists
so one thing one thing that I think is
pretty interesting is that this opens up
a new way to observe the universe
everything that we've seen about the
universe so far the majority of it has
been through light and light has
different different forms so you can
have radio and x-rays and visible light
and gamma rays this is an entirely
different spectrum than that this is
measuring gravity from gravity not from
electrons jiggling around but from mass
is moving so this opens up a totally new
way to look at the universe and we
expect to see not only black holes but
things like neutron stars or exploding
stars or possibly some remnants of the
Big Bang so that that's one thing that
it gives us but another is technology so
in order to solve a lot of the problems
like quantum mechanics and things like
that that we needed to overcome we had
to build technology that's going to push
forward in areas of technology that
aren't related to gravitational waves
back and and that's a you know that's a
give and take because we also use the
technology that's developed in other
areas to refine our instruments right ok
so you compensate for my jiggling atoms
yes well that's really the goal for Jeff
jiggling atoms um so one of the we have
a couple of questions from viewers and
also I just really quickly want to thank
John Strickland from forward-thinking
yeah he sent us a really nice primer on
gravitational waves he's working on a
two-part episode about gravitational
waves i highly recommend you check that
out when it's released and thank you
again John for for helping us learn a
little bit more before we got to talk to
Josh okay so Stefan asked what unit of
measurement or medium do we measure
gravitational waves with so
gravitational waves have an amplitude
like the amplitude of the wave okay
something that's called strain and
strain is the amount of stretch that you
get for a given length so the reason
that the arms of Lago are so long is
because that that means the longer you
make the arm the longer the motion
happens because of the strain it's a
it's a fractional change so if you make
the arms really long you get a bigger
change okay so the amplitude of
gravitational waves is in strain and
then I guess you can say we measure it
in in the dimensions of meters and our
instrument
another to the negative 11 10 to the
minus 19 or 19 you could also say that
we measure it as light because the
instrument is set up so that it's kind
of a trap for gravitational waves they
come in and if they move the arms back
and forth it causes a little bit of
light to come out of what we call the
dark port that's normally dark and that
little bit of light encodes the
gravitation wave signal as photons and
that's what we measure an admiral ackbar
of gravitational waves to yell it's a
trap in gravitational waves as they come
in I like it here Arnold also asked us
one of our viewers is it possible to
harness the waves for energy FTL
propulsion or time travel esque
application so let's talk a little bit
with that being said asked let's talk a
little bit about the fact that I like as
I understand it and correct me if I'm
wrong this is sort of like getting a new
sense so we let's say like we have these
five senses and all of a sudden we get a
new sense and we say okay I don't really
necessarily know exactly what this is
going to be used for but I know that my
that I'll never be the same again is
that sort of kind of the you put that so
beautifully I don't know how to improve
on it okay well okay good okay I'm glad
so I so time trouble can we do it that's
the question so that being said like
there was no specific application that
you were looking for just specifically
to confirm gravitational waves and from
here go forward to find potential uses
for the knowledge of gravitational time
yeah so I think just really want for the
time I mean can you blame me no I can't
I think the initial application is just
that we can see the universe in this new
way and we can do astronomy there is the
technological benefits for building
something like this but I think having
opened up a new sense for Humanity is a
is a nice application on its own so I
don't know about time travel Jeff not
sure if we're going to not sure if we're
gonna get you there from this okay but i
do think as Kip Thorne said this allows
us to understand Einstein's theory a
little bit better and Einstein's theory
is probably a good place for to start in
your in your garage as you build your
your time well the reason that I know
that this isn't gonna be the thing that
gets us there is because future me
didn't just show up to give me a high
five or did he maybe you
our future you and you're just putting
up a front I gotta say if so I've aged
well you have um well okay so last I
think I think let me see if I have any
other I've we had so we had a lot of
questions come in I well it's a very
dense topic I understand is you know I
was all excited as a fan of science you
know I read all the articles that come
out you see the big headline we did it
we discovered them and you go okay well
but what does that mean and how does
that you know how is that accomplished
so John asked specifically how is this
different from the data we first thought
the bicep2 telescope uncovered back in
2014 and could gravitational astronomy
tell us more about the origins of the
universe which you did mention you did
potentially maybe yeah I said he's a
smart guy that's a great question so the
original bicep2 results were looking at
we're looking at twisting that was
imparted in space-time from the birth of
the universe in the Big Bang and so the
idea was that there were gravitational
waves at the Big Bang and they imparted
some twisting on space-time and as that
space-time grew it stretched out and we
could look for that with our telescopes
at the South Pole I'm not involved in
that project but that's my understanding
our project measured directly
gravitational waves coming from a source
of two black holes and we expect that
we're going to measure other things like
exploding stars or neutron stars so I
think the the difference is that we're
kind of for one thing we're in a
different frequency range so we're in a
frequency range where things are moving
around quite fast and what we hope that
we've done is opened up a field of
gravitational wave astronomy where other
projects will join including ones like
something called pulse our timing where
they look at spinning pulsars a type of
stars and they look at those and they
use those as the timing to measure the
gravitational waves that pass between
them and that's a much lower frequency
and so all of those frequencies together
bicep2 and related projects and pulsar
timing and interferometers in space for
example called Lisa and LIGO will span
the whole spectrum like we do with with
light so we can we can see a lot of
really see a lot of different things how
do you know where to look how did you
guys know where to find the two to two
black holes so our instruments act a
little bit more like a microphone than
they
a telescope they they're arranged on the
earth and the waves kind of bathed them
the earth doesn't block wave so they
come through both instruments and from
the from the timing and a little bit
more information we can tell roughly
where they came from about so this came
from the southern sky but we didn't have
to point at it we could tell by
reconstructing the waves as they hit
them oh wow so it's a little bit like a
microphone so different about
gravitational waves right is that they
don't impact things they just move
through things right well it's a it's a
there's a duality there's this wave
particle duality as well so so we
measure them clearly as a wave but there
is an Associated particle we think
called the graviton yeah so we don't
know so similar to light a super awesome
Banda that I'm stramit on rock by the
way out of time say my new band um let's
lastly talk a little bit about cal state
fullerton's role in this you guys did
some very interesting things to be able
to help everybody visualize exactly what
this discovery is yes so I'm really
proud of cal state fullerton's role we
have undergraduate students who are
learning relativity at the same time
that they're doing some of this work and
we have graduate students and three
professors and we yes so our students
created visualizations simulations of
the two black holes we were among the
first actually the first to look at the
exact parameters of the black holes that
we detected on super computers at Cal
State Fullerton ran simulations to see
the black hole's merge and then created
visualizations along with collaborators
in the simulating extreme space x
collaboration another yeah just anything
that I could be a part of the temple is
that I would be into and we had the we
had the privilege also to be very
closely involved with writing the paper
that announced the discovery you were
one of the lead editors on is one of the
six editors on the paper right right and
so that was a that was a great privilege
because a thousand people were authors
on the paper and there was a lot of
input and a lot of the words and the
thoughts and the measurements came from
people across the collaboration and we
tried to work to make a you know a
legible compelling cohesive story out of
a hell of an email chain it was right
exactly you're absolutely right there
this is awesome thank you so much I
think it's shed some light
no in any form the light wants to take
ya on this shed light and waves yeah on
this very dense a topic I it it's so big
and so important important that it's
hard for us sometimes i think is as
people just kind of you know reading the
news to wrap our brains around it's sort
of that thing where you really start
thinking about the universe and then
your head hurts after a while uh i
really love that you came down here and
talk to us a little bit about it thank
you so much uh if if anybody wanted to
learn more about the project what would
they searched for on google well
gravitational waves will get you a lot
of the way you can go to like org or a
lot of our scientific calc i geo lig o
jogo was its name and a lot of our
scientific results are posted there and
we work hard to make science summaries
of all of our scientific papers so that
people can access them at the pub you
know the public can access them and if
people still have questions after that
we work really hard to answer any emails
that we get about them and we have kind
of a whole troop of people that are
answering emails right now ah i was
awesome awesome yeah Josh thank you so
much for being here we got more tomorrow
daily coming at us we do we have a we
have a delightful video as we go to
break of boiling an iphone and cran wax
so check this out and we'll be right
back equally important to what we just
been talking about and I love the smell
of fresh brand new crayons let's go
ahead and do this is the brightness all
the way up yet okay whoa whoa
welcome back to the show that was
amazing informative so rad all the best
things I can't even have enough
adjectives to describe how great that
was uh are you ready to talk about some
crowdfunding let's do it back in her
hack it here's a question for you an
answer for you sat on your couch while
playing say I don't know rise of the
Tomb Raider you thought yourself I wish
my couch was moving along with the game
heck yeah okay so Emerson by that I mean
not really yeah hey I mean it yeah maybe
okay so let's talk about Emerson so I
saw this it's got 26 days to go on
Kickstarter they wanted ninety-five
thousand dollars they've they've passed
that they got immerse it immerse it in
version but your assist like you're
sitting on a couch so this is the idea
it is a oh look at them go it is a
plug-and-play a device that you put
underneath your couch it will move and
vibrate I can have very sudden moves
they can have subtle moves it can pitch
roll heave there's apparently
intelligent vibrations adjustable
intensity and they're saying this is the
ultimate movie and gaming experience and
it's actually gotten some really good
it's d-box it's at home d by it is it's
like it's just like going to a 4-d
theater there's amazing so I kind of
love this are you well I I love the idea
behind it I know so few people are gonna
be happy they gave money to this Eileen
my producer I'm usually not the cynical
one but my goodness does this look like
it's going to be a disappointment to
everyone people are gonna get it be like
this is super it's gonna be yeah it's
gonna vibrate a little bit probably it's
gonna be like what you know what's it on
your phone and I'll call you when the
exciting parts happen supposedly they're
saying like this is what they're saying
on the actual website they're like
software translates move emotions into
perfect movements of vibrations get you
immersed in the most appropriate manner
yeah it's for your body what VR is for
your brain that's also quote from their
Kickstarter I'd love that to be true I
so skeptical so super skeptic I'd love
to try it if you're listening and you
want us to try it I'll give it a shot we
I mean
tribe we did try it at CES not
specifically cnet tried it out really do
you like it if you go over to our if you
look up immerse it mi mmer SI t on cnet
com you can check out our video a little
first line now I have to find out if if
if we as a company liked it because I'm
very skeptical there are there are many
ya sera sera test the serious how much
is it okay let's talk about price if you
want just vibration if you don't want
already have it on your phone to shake
around yeah and you don't want to play
your iPad or your surface underneath
your couch cushion and sit on it um you
can get immerse it vibration for about
to hire bucks wow that's the vibration
Wow okay it does have to does it require
support from the the thing you're
watching does it have to how does it
know when to vibrate you based on what
you're watching I think it's saying that
like basically it's compatible with the
game consoles they said it was
compatible with our like all of them
right now like all of the you know xbox
360 xbox one like their it's compatible
if you want an actual motion an inverse
it motion which is the whole kit and
caboodle pack I can you around on your
couch the the cheapest early bird
available currently is 700 know what 700
and no seven hundred and no dollars 700
000 I'm not bad you know yes okay um you
know for 700 on't think I go away for
300 I'd be gonna come with the dang
couch well that's see that's the thing i
have a sectional couch i can't even use
this cuz my couch is too big it's like a
giant 10-seat sectional so there's no
way i could ever actually use this I'd
have to buy a separate couch
specifically made for this particular
application this is bad idea jeans you
think so emerson immerse it I'm sorry
thumbs down from the old Jeff Meister oh
I thumbs down bummer all right uh I say
I say don't might say dome go to a 40
movie theater yeah or you know your
tricks in watch the movie it's fine do
it for scare tactics I don't know it's
or somebody with it that would be I
don't know if that's worth 7 1st century
whoopee cushion okay so now that we've
talked about back in Hackett are you
ready to talk about what we're into
let's do it right into it i'm into
Helldivers i just want to get right in
it was free this month on PSN right yeah
PlayStation Plus had it for free
crossplay I believe its playstation 3
playstation 4 and Vita I didn't get this
on PC it is so much fun it is a
combination of Starship Troopers uh-huh
Diablo it's a kind of that combo so it's
a town game and you can all play
together and there's Friendly Fires you
can accidentally kill your friends twin
stick shooter right happens a lot yeah
twin stick shooter you can you choose
your loadout right before you go into
each mission you can play you can fight
against cyborgs bugs or illuminate and
it is so fun you go into these missions
and it'll say okay here's your objective
you got to go oh yeah that's the other
thing the ship that comes to get you the
dropship that games to take you out of
the mission if you are under it when it
lands it will kill you like that'll make
your couch shake ya little boy if you
play this game with the immerse it you'd
be having a great time yeah this is so
much fun and it's a blast to meet other
people because you can play multiplayer
either locally or online so me and my
husband have been playing with other
like my friend Mike and then you know my
brother from a different place agent
it's so fun i got to get in on this i
just downloaded it so i got to get on up
in it yes on Helldivers it's great okay
what are you into my into it is a movie
and it might at first glance seem like a
real political movie but I urge anybody
watching this regardless of what your
political stance is to give it a shot
imageshack it's the new film from
Michael Moore so he's a polarizing
figure but this one is called where to
invade next I think it's actually not a
very good title it's a it's a clever
idea he's quote-unquote invading
countries by himself but I think it
conjures sort of a dialogue about the
military-industrial complex which is not
what the movie is about at all he's just
going to different countries some
European countries in North African
countries and just seeing how they a pro
some of the problems that we have here
in America and it's fascinating some of
the solutions that other countries have
come up with some of the ideas they've
taken from us and expanded upon the
things that he just sort of shows in
practice all around the world are really
inspiring and really interesting it's
not a polemic it's not preachy it's not
doesn't feel like a Michael Marmot
Michael more money I mean I think a lot
of people are turned off by that I
really urge anybody watching this if you
have this movie playing near you go see
it it will open your mind it reminded me
of when I was 17 it was the first time I
ever went overseas I never traveled that
far away from home and it just opens
your mind it opens your mind you realize
that the whole world isn't like your
little part of a little space right and
this movie is the filmic equivalent of
that and I really if you have ever heard
anything I've said on the show and taken
my advice and been happy do this I
guarantee you'll laugh you'll enjoy even
if you think you hate Michael Moore is
it on Netflix it is not yet but it's in
it's in theaters right now okay so you
can go see it in theaters I'm sure it'll
be on netflix at some point where to
invade next by michael moore if it it's
an amazing movie and it's so funny and
fun and we'll get you talking my wife
and I've been talking about it ever
since because it just has such
interesting ideas I will watch it on
your recommendation please do I trust
you yeah I trust you um okay that's
we've done everything except our
favorite part of the show which is
photographer all about you
yes then you took this photo with your
iphone 6 plus and honestly just it's a
little rainy today and I missing I want
to go to there I would like to go to
there uh which is easily photo it's
really how joyous they are fully like
Logan will move it to the full screen
producer Logan will give us the full
screen it is so crisp and clear i love
it too yes or else and say i took this
picture back in August when I was in
California photo was taken with my
iphone 6 plus in the photo it's monica
on the right and destiny to the left you
have my full permission to use it this
is a photo if you take it with your
iphone it's a little dangerous cuz that
wave hits a little hard your phone goes
tumbling into the ocean I was having no
phone great maybe she had a yea yea
smita the bold phone tog refer bonus or
something maybe ok I mean really lovely
photo if you want to be our phone tog
refer of the day and have your photo
featured on our show it's easy are you I
do is send it in to tomorrow at cnet com
make sure you tell us what device you
took it on give us a little story about
why you took it and give us permission
use it on the show yes permission is
always great if you like the show you
want to see us continue to do this
please share it with somebody that you
like or don't like I don't know you want
to share with a friend of me I don't
care you are our entire marketing budget
you are yes please be evangelical get
crazy about it tell pass out flyers
their hometown support 7 number tomorrow
daily com that's it's the easiest way to
find the show it's easiest way to get to
it we highly recommend that you do that
yes and that is it for the show today
we'll be back next week with a brand new
docket of science facts meeting science
fiction and all the cool stuff in
between that we like to talk about but
until then be good humans
