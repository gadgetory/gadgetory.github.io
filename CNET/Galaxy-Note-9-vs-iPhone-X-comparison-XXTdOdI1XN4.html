over as the flagship Galaxy phone of
2018 and with a starting price of 999
dollars it competes at the same level as
Apple's own thousand dollar flagship the
iPhone 10 here's how they stack up the
most obvious difference is of course the
size the massive 6.4 inch screen on the
note 9 makes the 5.8 inch iPhone 10 look
tiny in this shot the note has an AMOLED
screen with a slightly higher pixel
density than the iPhones OLED screen
you'll also notice Samsung has not given
into the knotch trend with the note 9
and the bezels on the top and bottom of
the phone look thicker than on the
iPhone 10 but the bezels on the sides
are definitely slimmer and appear to be
spilling over the edge of that curved
display the more pronounced curve though
also means that you have more glass
exposed than on the iPhone 10 which has
a thicker steel frame the note 9 also
kept the fingerprint scanner on the back
of the phone this time under the camera
it also has an iris and facial
recognition unlock option while the
iPhone 10 can only be unlocked using
face ID and a passcode which uses the
depth sensing camera on the front
side-by-side you can also see that dual
camera on the note lies nearly flush
with the back of the phone in fact it's
barely noticeable next to the obvious
bump from that dual camera on the iPhone
10 both have a dual 12 megapixel camera
one wide and one telephoto lens for
portrait mode and optical zoom but the
note 9 has a dual aperture similar to
that of the s9 that can adapt to
different lighting conditions which we
noticed was especially helpful in
low-light conditions as you can see in
this comparison with the s9 samsung also
says it's trained the camera to optimize
results based on the subjects with
artificial intelligence which could
result in even better shots than on the
s9 and the front camera on the note is 8
megapixels compared to 7 on the iPhone
and on the bottom of the phones you can
also see two things that set the note
aside the headphone jack and the s-pen
Samsung stylus adds a level of
productivity to the phone that the 10
doesn't have this s-pen has bluetooth
connectivity and remote
control features now both the iPhone and
the note have the same starting price of
999 dollars but the note offers double
the amount of storage at this price a
hundred and twenty eight geeks versus 64
gigs on the iPhone and a larger 4000
milliamp per hour battery and these are
just the specs we still have a lot more
comparing to do in the coming weeks so
