I have many times actually friends used
to be my second language and for that
reason I'm both thrill and perplex to
review this 5 big nass pro formula c
today well I'm thrilled because let's
see the French company and I'm perplexed
because of that blue thingy that is
staring at you right now as far as I
know friends a happy country folks have
free health care and most importantly
having multiple lovers or a mover it's
considered trendy even when you're
married especially when you're married
so it's hard not to be happy really
so why the blue well I guess that's
because this device here is made
specifically for the ears market so
let's see what this friends infused
device has to offer America well it is a
NASA verb meaning is desired to be
connected to a network and provide
storage to the entire network many
computer at a time on the back here in
series have two gigabit ethernet ports
it is only one port to work but it can
do both at the same time for either load
balancing or fieldset purpose so how
much storage can this one provide a lot
it comes with five libraries and each
Bay can host a hard drive of up to 40 by
meaning you can have up to 20 terabyte
but the good thing is that you don't
have to go overboard and get all 5 4
terabyte drives up front and that
because the server come with let's see
simply rate configuration a special rate
that allows for increasing the amount of
storage dynamically that mean you can
start out with small hard drives say one
day by each and later on can replace
them with larger drives it's actually
very easy to replace the hard drive as
long as if we place one at a time and
you can even do that when the server is
still working you can call this level of
flexibility committing the French Way
you see you first commit to one type of
hard drives and later on when you can
afford it you commit to larger and
faster drives and that's great because
you know what
you only need to invest into one of
these and not two and save the money for
something elekid TV that's because you
want to have more to go home to than
just too glaring blue balls and a small
TV
now if somehow 20 bar is still not
enough you can add more story to the
server view is USB port on the back two
of them USB 3.0 and the ER 2 USB 2.0 now
apart from the massive capacity the
server here also come with a very nice
web interface that you can use to
Meneses features such as media streaming
or biker unfortunately the five big Nass
pro doesn't come with many feature but
to make up for that it's very fast in my
testing in fact it were the fastest 5
ans servers on the market so how much
did this server cost well as you can get
the hard drive yourself the server
itself costs only 500 dollars you can
also get it with 10 ter by 420 ter by
preloaded for 1,100 or $2,000
respectively it's quite hefty but I
think is worth it to find out more on
how what it is you have to read the
phone with us a.com and when you're
there make sure you follow me on Twitter
Facebook or Google+ it's definitely
worth it that you do because it's good
for you and it's even better for me
it's a win-win by the way the blue ball
here it can be turned off and that's
exactly what I'm going to do and that's
because I am don't know and this has
been the first look at the five big nass
pro for merci au revoir a la pushing for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
