next Android I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your scene at update some of
Microsoft's biggest productivity apps
will be pre-loaded on select Android
devices later this year that includes
skype onedrive for storage OneNote and
other office apps like Word Excel and
PowerPoint Microsoft made agreements
with several device makers including
Samsung and Dell hey if Microsoft can't
get you to buy a Windows Phone it'll
bring windows apps to your Android phone
or tablet in some cases it's a pretty
good value when it includes a year trial
of office 365 worth a hundred dollars
this could also help encourage more
Android users to upgrade to Windows 10
on PCs when it comes out this summer
Microsoft has taken a slightly different
approach to software you get windows for
free in hopes that you'll start paying
for subscriptions to office and other
services but a Microsoft executive has
said that any device for the screen less
than 10 inches like a phone will not
have to pay for office but let's say you
don't want more pre-installed apps on
your devices and I don't blame you
there's so much bloatware that you can't
delete these days but screenshots posted
on a developers forum show that the new
Samsung Galaxy s6 phones will let you
uninstall or disable some preloaded
samsung and google apps these are apps
you couldn't previously delete in
settings like s health s voice YouTube
gmail even the Google Play App Store can
be deleted if for some strange reason
you wanted to do that in other news

feature that no other video streaming
device has a way to use it in a hotel
room when you're connecting to Wi-Fi in
a place like a hotel or dorm you are
forced to visit another website to

use a device like the chromecast or Roku
