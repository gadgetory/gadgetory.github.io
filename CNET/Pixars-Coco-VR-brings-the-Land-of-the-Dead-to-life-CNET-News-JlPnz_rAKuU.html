your wait is over Pixar is the gold
standard of animation on the big screen
but it has never brought its stories to
life in virtual reality before until now
Pixar's first VR is set in the world of
Coco its upcoming film you can take
journeys with people that you can't take
in real life and I think you create
special kinds of memories that you can't
otherwise journalists got a preview in
New York the experience takes you into
Coco's glimmering land of the dead where
we got to dress our skeletons and paint
our kolakozhi ends we rode a train
through the Pixar metropolis of the Dead
you can even take a picture of yourself
and a friend as skeletons in VR at a
photo booth my CNN colleague and our
resident VR addict Scott Stein compares
it to virtual Disneyland because you're
entering this world that feels like a
ride that's yet to be built where you
enter this whole world of Coco and it
even has this entry world where you know
we were setting up at first putting on
costumes realizing we could take off our
heads thrown our heads back and forth
and then it invites you down this
doorway and you enter into the expanse
of space and that's where we started to
feel like you know almost like a mini
theme park Pixar's films set a high bar
so going into this first attempt at
Bieber I was bracing myself to be
disappointed but I wasn't when an
elevator lifts me above the town square
to get a full view of the land of the
dead I felt like I was living inside a
big star movie here are stepping it
effects our film it wasn't the perfect
one to do it because the visuals are
stunning but in addition to that you're
also able to experience things on this
that you can't in the film we both had
fun exploring the land of the dead for
these Easter eggs you can watch a
deleted scene and explore concept art
for the movie it's like DVD extras but
on steroids you can explore the land of
the dead yourself starting today on an
oculus rift VR headset but even if you
don't have a $400 headset you can still
check it out
Disney is offering sneak peeks at some
Disney stores and movie theaters now
until the film's release on November
20 seconds a version will also be
available for gear VR when the movie
opens I spoke to Pixar and they said
this is only the beginning the company
says it is just starting to crawl when
it comes to the art but those are the
baby steps before it can walk and then
run now that's something worth losing
your head over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
