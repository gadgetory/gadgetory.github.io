joining me is Bryant all senior editor
for Cena thanks for being with us no
problem so you are going to San Diego
this week for comic-con yeah I'm going
to a place that will be very sweaty and
smelly but it'll be great you know
comic-con over 200,000 people will
descend on San Diego downtown San Diego
for everything geek pop culture TV shows
movies comic books okay animation it's
it's every almost lost me by opening
with the sweaty stuff that's I want to
inform you what's the most important
thing yeah yeah a version of what's
going to happen so let's give people an
idea because you've been going for a few
years now um it's not just for people
who are comic book fans and it's not
just folks who were you know publishing
comic books that are there it's much
more than that yeah it started its roots
come from it used to be a small comic
book show but now it has become a
mainstream event probably within the
last five years where it's not just
comic books we're talking about movies
TV shows anything that touches kind of
the sci-fi fantasy realm you know
medieval times type things so Game of
Thrones a popular series you'll see
stuff like that at comic-con stuff like
iron man marvel comics you'll see that
stuff at comic-con but you also see kind
of some of these new upcoming chosen now
a lot of media companies are using as a
launch pad to showcase and preview and
try and generate buzz because all
eyeballs are on it's not just kind of
what they might used to call in the past
a geek convention it's a mainstream
convention okay not just for like Star
Trek fans no not anymore but there's
still plenty of them there okay so give
us an idea of what you're excited about
for this year because you have an idea
of what you want to check out and make
sure you don't miss yeah I think a lot
of times what makes comic-con unique is
it's really a convention that's made for
fans for the consumer who love stuff so
although you might have to wait in line
for three or four hours or maybe even a
day if you like Twilight yikes which I
do know I don't haha I would never I
would never I would never go to those
but you know the vampire phenomenas is
really huge but I'm just excited to see
a lot of times it's also about
collectibles kind of they have a lot of
rare toys and collectibles and yes grown
men's still collect toys but also a
chance to sit at these panels and see
cast members
an opportune that you never get a chance
to you're not blocked by media because
someone like your me would have to wait
in line the same amount of time as a fan
something really make it successful
there is no privileges that are afforded
to press members unless you have a real
exclusive in you're going to have to
wait in line just like everyone else to
cover these events so it's really one of
those few conventions where the wall has
been taken down and you really do get a
lot more direct access than you ever
could before the panels that you're
going to this year targeted Game of
Thrones for sure because now that the
season is off everyone's like just
dieting at anything they can write iron
man 3 I definitely want to see also the
hobbit peter jackson's movie the you
know these are for use for films that
are not coming out this year yeah
typically about film comes out they show
stuff that will come out in about a year
or two even yeah so Batman is hot right
now spider-man is hot we won't see
anything like that at comic-con this is
all stuff that we'll see in a couple
years that's awesome yeah it's gonna be
fun I mean I can't wait to Gaza and and
why is this still irrelevant I mean you
kind of told us but like why does it
matter on the broader scale I think this
is really the epicenter of pop culture
right now you know you you have a lot of
different things going on we've seen how
comic book movies in sci-fi and kind of
geek culture has started to take over
mainstream culture and this is really
where it starts so if everyone likes to
get the information first to be on the
end if you want to be on the end
comic-con is one of those places to go
so it's really where everything is is
kind of popping a bubbling all right
well I'm not going so I won't bring you
back something exactly spider-man mask
pack your deodorant if it's gonna be yes
sweaty math yes yes it's a very 200,000
people very sweaty brian Tong thanks so
much right for inside scoop I'm Sumi das
