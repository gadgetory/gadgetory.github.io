welcome to the Alpha bite it's all the
good stuff and bad stuff inside the
world of Apple I've said that 145 times
and sure feels a little like deja vu but
so will this story Apple has lost
another iphone in a bar now according to
cnet exclusive sources say the latest
iPhone prototype went missing in San
Francisco in late July and may have been
sold on craigslist for two hundred
dollars and apples attempts to find the
device have been unsuccessful details of
the device are still unclear such as
what version of iOS it was running and
even what it looks like but this time
the iphone was lost at a mexican
restaurant and bar called cava 22 known
for their tequila and shrimp lime
ceviche yummy and sparking Apple to
contact San Francisco police saying the
device was priceless so you would think
the guys why don't you just use Find My
iPhone well the big a trace the phone to
a home which then led them to a man who
had been at cava 22 that night San
Francisco Police and Apple investigators
were given permission to search the home
but found nothing then before leaving
the house Cena sources say an apple
employee offered the man money for the
phone no questions asked but the man
continued to deny he had any knowledge
of the phone so the lesson of the day my
friends blame it on the alcohol and keep
them away from the bars you crazy
alcoholics now one time is bad enough
but twice that's a bad apple so the
apple byte crew decided you know what
we're not going to sit here and do
nothing we're going to do whatever it
takes to find the missing iphone
no missing iphone missing an iphone i
really want to find him wait have you
seen this iphone missing i fall have you
seen have you seen
have you seen this
we'll keep trying Tim Cook you can count
on us all right now we still don't have
any real confirmation for the look of
the next-gen iphone but Apple might have
slipped a tiny bit when they revealed an
icon for the iPhone in details for their
new iCloud photo stream feature it
definitely looks unlike any other iphone
icon Apple's used and proportionately
it's a wider iphone screen with a
thinner top and bottom section macrumors
even enlarge the icon next to their
designer layouts from their earlier
renders an apple is known to be precise
with their icon artwork so just think
about this we're talking about an icon
for design hints you guys are into it
just as much as I am alright the
Cupertino kids recently released the
iTunes Match beta service to developers
only so we put together a little sneak
peek for what you can expect to see
iTunes Match is Apple service for 2499 a
year and you can turn on iTunes Match by
going into the store menu it matches
your own personal music collection with
the same tracks on iTunes and then
upload your remaining songs that can't
be matched to the iCloud and allows you
to listen to your entire collection
anytime on your iOS devices plus you'll
also be able to use this service with up
to 10 iOS devices and computers total
and a maximum file those can be
computers now once the iTunes Match
service completes you'll be able to
either stream tracks to your computer by
playing them or click on the download
icon to store them locally once they're
downloaded the icon goes away and the
size of the file changes from stream to
a physical file size now also here i
have my iphone running the latest
developers build and i'll go into my
settings then music and i can turn on
iTunes Match on my phone now jump into
the music app and just like in itunes
you'll see your tracks with the cloud
icon next to each one now I can select a
track and it will initially take some
time to download it as a streaming and
it might also be intermittent because
the first play basically behaves as if
it's a streaming track but once it
downloads it will remain on your phone
and you can also click on the cloud icon
to download all your tracks locally also
if you choose to download entire album
click on download all
instead so there's your first look at
the iTunes Match beta it's still a
little inconsistent playing through
songs cleanly on their first play I've
had to jump around tracks randomly but
overall the service is pretty solid and
delivers on its promise of giving you
access to your entire collection on
multiple devices and we'll wait to see
the final product this fall thanks mr.
Tong now Apple has also released a batch
of updates including the latest iOS beta
7 xcode developer preview itunes and
Apple TV software betas as we get closer
to the fall release now a few weeks ago
ebay was set on fire with an auction for
a prototype macbook pro with a 3g
antenna that was bid up to seventy
thousand dollars before being pulled at
the request of Apple after all the
publicity Apple has now requested that
the laptop be returned it features a
magsafe antenna and a sim card slot and
the current owner Carl frega pick up the
Machine off someone on craigslist who
knew craigslist the official home for
Apple prototypes and naughty hookups an
iPod Touch freaks there have been plenty
of you asking about the next gen model
just wait it out through September for
Apple's annual ipod refresh but new
parts from Macotakara and others
allegedly show white colored parts
including the front cover for the ipod
touch and a tapered headphone jack
that's white I know I just made a few
you grown men weep like Justin Bieber
fans all right onto the quick bites and
cool product releases out for the mac
platform my favorite virtualization
product parallels 7 is dropping this
week it allows you to run windows and
the mac OS together side by side
bringing new speed improvements lion
integration and the ability to access
your computer from the mobile app now at
79 99 or 49 99 for the upgrade and I'm
jealous of my Europeans with El gatos
announcement of the ITV mobile ipad to
TV tuner dongle that brings live TV /
digital video broadcast transmission now
it's about 166 US dollars and won't be
coming to the US yet which I don't like
but I also don't like the name of the
company el gato which translates to cat
and for all of you that don't like touch
screens or have press-on nails that are
way too long again the way help could be
on the way thanks to Derek for sending
this article my way but jingyang has a
concept
with this smart keyboard that's a
physical keyboard with magnets that
connects to an iphone mind blown now I
love it and the keys would even glow
through the cover thanks to the iphones
backlight plus his animation skills are
pretty sweet now it's not real yet but
please make this happen alright guys
it's going to do it for this we show
some of your comments questions and
criticisms with the alpha-beta cnet com
I'm Brian tom thanks for watching we'll
see you guys next week for another bite
of the Apple the iphone have you seen me
sir have you seen another man Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
