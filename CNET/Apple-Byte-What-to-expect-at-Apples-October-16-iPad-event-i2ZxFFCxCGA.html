the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple it's official
apple released their invitation to the
press for their next keynote on October
the 16th that's a thursday with the
title it's been way too long now the
event will take place at the town hall
auditorium on apple's campus so it won't
be anything close to the massive set up
for the iphone 6 and Apple watch so
what's on tap for the event well we're
expecting new iPad Air's minis and
possibly an ipad pro mention or sneak
peek at the very least I mean that's the
product I'm most excited about if it
happens now I know I also might be the
only one so we're also expecting some
speed bumps to the Mac line
unfortunately no broadwell chipset
sightings just yet and could the retina
display imax make an appearance well
we'll see but if there is one product
that hasn't been updated in ages that
fits this title the best it's the mac
mini but you're not going to hold an
event just for a Mac Mini or would you
now the title could also be referring to
the fact that it's been way too long for
Apple to fix the widespread Bluetooth
connectivity issues in iOS 8 that has
prevented people from pairing their
phones to their car audio systems that
still hasn't been fixed now it could be
referring to that I don't know so let's
talk about all those iPads were
expecting to see Vietnamese blog tint a
has posted pictures and a video of what
they claim is the ipad air 2 showing a
thinner overall design touch ID
capability and a curiously missing mute
switch it may look almost exactly the
same but there's two holes next to the
camera one on the back side and one on
the side where the mute hold switch used
to be you'll also notice speaker holes
at the bottom are now a single row
instead of two rows of holes now it's a
little strange that the mute lock
screens which would be completely
removed just to make a thinner product
because Apple would never make something
super thin while sacrificing battery
life just to make it super thin right so
yeah we'll see what happens next week
Thursday now we aren't hearing any
updated rumors surrounding max but didja
x is now reporting that quanta computer
has begun production on Apple's ultra
slim 12-inch MacBook and is looking to
ramp up its efforts in November but
don't get ahead of yourselves the report
says the notebooks will not be ready for
the holiday season and that's a Bad
Santa see you didn't see that one coming
Kris Kringle now their supply chain
sources say component makers are having
issues with the newer ultra slim chassis
that's thinner than the current 13-inch
and 11 inch macbook airs and they also
claim the 12 inch macbook air will come
with a touch-enabled retina display that
sounds like a real stretch there but
again these are rumors all right the
coop town kids have released the second
gold master candidate for OS 10 to
developers getting us closer to the
official release we haven't seen any
major changes but most likely under the
hood bug fixes this time around apple
also released the second beta for iOS
8.1 and developer Hamza said has found
the Apple pay setup screen in the
passbook app we're expecting the
software update for Apple pay to arrive
with the release of iOS 8.1 by the end
of the month in we might even get the
green light from Apple at the keynote as
well and do you believe the children are
our future I believe change
teach us well according to a piper
jaffray survey sampling about 7,200
teens sixty-seven percent of them
currently own an apple smartphone up
from 61 percent in the spring and
seventy-three percent expected to buy
one as their next smartphone and Android
dropped five points in their survey over
the same period of time but what about
all the hype for the Apple watch well
when asked if they were interested in
buying the SmartWatch only sixteen
percent of teens said they were
interested now that's not much so yes
there is some hope young people aren't
brainwashed by everything apples trying
to sell them oh hey right yeah what's up
Mitch did you know that a new iPad for
all you want my didn't cost you money
yeah I don't care I am just going to buy
it whatever it costs alright guys just a
reminder our apple byte exclusive design
