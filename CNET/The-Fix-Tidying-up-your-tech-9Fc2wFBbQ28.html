the show about do-it-yourself tech and
how to's I'm Sharon Profis and I'm Eric
Franklin this week it's all about spring
it cleaning that's right we're clearing
out the clutter think old computers
collecting dust and managing tons and
tons of emails yeah we have a lot of
tips for you and it all starts with
making more free space on your smart
phone you know what I hate
we were just about ready to download a
new app on your phone but you just don't
have enough space to do so what's even
worse is that you don't even know what's
picking up room on your phone or you do
know what's taking up room but you're
just not ready to get rid of your
favorite apps for songs I'm gonna show
you a few ways to free up space on your
phone on iPhones using iOS 7 you'll want
to go into settings tap general tap
usage and from here you can see how much
space is available in your phone how
much is being used and after a few
moments of calculation you'll get a
breakdown of how much storage each app
has taken up so from here you can see
every app installed on your phone and
you can decide which ones you're gonna
keep and which ones you're gonna get rid
of for example I was in Spain a few
months ago but I'm really not using my
spanish-language app as much as I'd like
to so I'm gonna get rid of it and here's
how you do that
so go back to your home screen find the
app do a long tap on it until it starts
dancing you get this little X icon tap
the X then tap delete and then tap
remove to confirm and then click the
home button after you're done
another thing that takes up tons of room
on your phone music but the great thing
is that you don't even need these songs
stored on your phone in order to listen
to him as long as you have an internet
connection you can delete any song you
want and then stream it that takes up
zero space for photos you'll want to
back them up first
by connecting your phone to your
computer so on androids pretty much the
exact same process if you have a lot of
music or photos on your phone deleting
those will give you a lot more space so
how do you figure out what's taking up
space on your phone well you go into
settings tap storage and then you'll see
the total space how much space you have
available and you'll see how much apps
are taken up so if I tap on apps
I'll get a list of all the apps
installed in my phone I can tap on one
and get a little bit more information
and also uninstall from here one of the
cool things about having an Android
device is that you can download a file
manager one of the best is ES File
Explorer which allows you to better
organize an access to files and apps on
your phone so those are some quick and
easy tips on how to free up space in
your phone so the next time you won't
have to scramble we want to make room
for that latest greatest app you notice
something you probably want to do every
few months depending on how many apps
you're downloading and music as well and
what's great about it is that it means
you don't have to rely so much on cloud
storage services you can all be saved on
your phone alright it's time for a quick
break and when we come back we'll show
you how to clear out your junk mail and
organize your inbox
you
welcome back if your email inbox is
getting out of hand with unorganized
messages and junk mail it's time for a
little cleanup yeah here are a few tips
and tricks on exactly how to do that
if you've signed up for a bunch of
newsletters and shopping sites you
probably have dozens of emails coming in
daily once and for all here are a few
tips to help you organize your inbox and
keep it clean first unsubscribe from any
unnecessary marketing emails my favorite
way to do this is to head to your inbox
and search for unsubscribe then open up
one of those marketing emails or
newsletters scroll all the way to the
bottom where it's probably hidden hit
unsubscribe and then it'll take you to
the website to complete the process
as an alternative you can use a service
like unrolled dot mean it's designed to
automatically gather all of the
newsletters and emails you're signed up
for and help you unsubscribe from them
in one fell swoop so does all the heavy
lifting for you so I had to unroll dot
me log in with your email select the
mailers you don't want to receive
anymore
and you're free from any future junk
once you're clear of all the junk the
next step is to organize your inbox one
of the best ways to do this is by using
filters with them you can make any
emails from a specific sender
automatically labeled sent to a folder
archived or even forwarded to another
account I'm using Gmail but this feature
is available for most email services to
get started I'm going to make all of the
emails from my friends sent to a friend
label so I'll select a few emails then
I'll go up to the more tab and select
filter messages like this then in this
screen I click create filter with this
search and here I decide what I want to
do in this case I want to apply a label
so I'll check that box hit new label
call it friends create and now anytime I
get emails from those people they'll
automatically be labeled as friends
another way I keep my inbox really clean
is by using shortcuts
it helps me sort through new emails
really quickly and helps me reach inbox
zero at the end of each day which means
my inbox is empty here are some of my
favorites you can use J&amp;amp;K to scroll
through your emails if you want to
select an email click X then from there
you can hit e to archive the email l to
apply a label or hit pound to delete it
so those are just a few tips to help you
keep your inbox really clean and
organized so that you can focus on the
emails that are really most important
and you know the best part about
clearing out all of your messages is
that if you have the Gmail app on your
smart phone and you reach inbox zero
it'll tell you to go enjoy your day
that's nice yeah I love it it's like a
little reward it is you know I'm an old
PC guy so if you have an old piece
see sitting around your house taking up
space we're gonna show you exactly how
to get rid of it while protecting your
most important files in a time where
everyone seems to be getting by with
their smartphones and their laptops and
their tablets the age of the home
desktop computer seems to be coming to
an end that's it I know it can be hard
to let these things go I mean I probably
have all my important files on this
thing backed up to a cloud somewhere my
photos are on Flickr my documents are on
Google and my music is stored on at
least three different music services
somewhere but there's something
comforting about having my files nearby
even on an old clunker like this so how
about we compromise I'm gonna show you
one of the best methods I've found so
far for backing up all your documents
and files on your old desktop computer
and clearing out some space in your home
decluttering your desk and putting this
thing out of this misery alright now
before we get started let me be really
clear about what I'm doing here I'm not
making a backup of a vital computer that
I use every day that's a whole other
project what I'm talking about is a
computer you haven't used in years maybe
even decades you're tempted to just get
rid of it but there might be some files
on there that you want to reference
later on but you don't have the time to
go sort through it all and figure it out
so here's what I recommend
we're gonna migrate the data over from
this computer onto a network attached
storage drive in this case we're using
the WD my cloud a two terabyte drive
here that I'm working with for 150 bucks
the other competitors out there like the
Seagate central but the WD mikroc a more
highly recommended by Cena and once you
set this up it's gonna pull over all the
data all the files from your home
computer and move them onto the drive
and it's gonna organize them
automatically and when you're done
instead of the files being on some
portable hard drive that you're gonna
misplace the files are gonna live on
your home Wi-Fi network where you can
access them at any time from any
computer even a phone or tablet and from
anywhere in the world
first step is you're going to find your
home's Wi-Fi router and make sure that
the my cloud is plugged in nearby
because this thing actually plugs into
your router and not directly to your
computer you're gonna take the included
Ethernet cable plug it into the my cloud
and plug the other end into your router
on a free Ethernet port and you're good
to go next you're going to head over
the computer that you're backing up and
Club WD comm / setup /wd my cloud from
here you're gonna download the setup
software run it and then watch it find
the my cloud storage drive on your home
network using the software you can be
prompted to plug in your name and email
address in order to personalize this and
then when you get to the end you're
going to be prompted to download an
additional desktop application and the
WD smart wear application which is pc
only the desktop app lets you transfer
files manually just like a standard hard
drive the smart wear app though is the
secret sauce that automatically
organizes all your content before
transferring it over to the my cloud
it's PC only though so Mac users are
gonna have to either embrace the chaos
or organize manually since this is a PC
I'm gonna use the smart wear application
to create a one-time backup of my
computer it's gonna graph out all the
different kinds of media it's gonna move
over and it's a lot of stuff you do just
as well to let this thing run overnight
alright now once everything's
transferred over it's time to jump on to
your preferred laptop computer tablet or
smartphone and check to make sure that
everything is transferred over that's
important to you you can download the my
cloud application for Mac or PC or iOS
or Android open it up noodle around and
make sure everything important is there
finally before getting rid of your old
computer you're gonna want to make sure
to clear all of your personal
information off of it before handing it
off now to do that you can dig up your
old installation this for your computer
if you still have them and do a full
format and reinstallation of the
software or you can dig up a copy of
Derek's boot and nuke online and burn it
to a CD our that's another way to go if
you feel an extra geek geek or you can
find a recycling center that will
destroy your hard disk as part of the
recycling process so there you go that's
how to give your old desktop PC new life
on a network attached storage drive
giving you some extra peace of mind and
look at this some extra room on your
desk
that's it for this week's show
hopefully with some of those tips your
tech is filling a queen and refreshed
