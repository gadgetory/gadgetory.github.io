2014 and drones right now are all the
rage right so course here at the biggest
tech show we're seeing a lot of them
here is one called the phantom 2 it's a
new model that just came out and what it
does is you know it has the usual you
know you control yourself you can fly it
around but it has a attachment on the
bottom where you can put your own GoPro
camera in here the idea is that this is
great for aerial video so it's able to
kind of stabilize it as it flies around
your video is not going to be too shaky
it's going to keep things stable and you
could use it for filming sporting events
from way up high perhaps places in
nature that you can't really get to one
of the guys here said someone already
used it to film a marriage proposal from
way up high so there's a lot of
different creative things you can do
with it this will cost eight hundred and
seventy dollars but there's another
version that comes with a camera already
in it it's the phantom 2 vision now that
one is something that you can control
the camera from a smartphone or a tablet
like Android or iOS and that one's a
little more expensive at twelve hundred
dollars and it's been out since October
Christina this is your first look at the
phantom 2 here at CES 2014</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
