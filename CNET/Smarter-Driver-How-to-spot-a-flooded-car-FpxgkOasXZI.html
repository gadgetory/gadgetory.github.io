Northern California we don't even know
what rain looks like anymore but many of
you have been getting plenty of it and
torrential floods so the idea of being
weary about a flooded car is still very
relevant except for us the problem with
a flooded car is that you never really
dry it out at least not in terms of the
effect of water getting into orifices
and systems that were never supposed to
see water and that water is often salty
that raises hell with metal corrosion
and damage to electronics and wiring a
reputable car dealer should not be
selling a flooded car without clearly
disclosing that a private party seller
has shall we say more leeway to forget
or claim they didn't know so here are
some tips and tricks you can use to find
out if the car you're looking at never
took the big dip now when you get into a
car that you're considering buying and
wondering about flood damage just give
it a sniff you can't mistake that mildew
smell and it's almost impossible to get
out of a vehicle when it's been flooded
now it's possible to get a little mildew
odor because you had clogged drain tubes
up in the sunroof or in the well of a
convertible but assume the worst and go
hunting
second look and I don't mean just at the
floor mat or under the floor mat if you
can try and get a peek under the carpet
that's the harder part to conceal when
there was once flood damage it can be
tough a lot of modern cars really seal
these carpets down but give it a look
you might find someplace to get under
there and third feel feel around up
above the glove box inside that little
whale down in the seat tracks and rails
as well what you're looking for is
little traces of mud that might get on
your hands I mean how else would it get
up there certainly at this height
now there are two sites you can check to
get a car's flood history the National
motor vehicle title information system
is a federal database that includes
flood information now only about thirty
five states fully report into it the
rest either don't or don't fully that
opens loopholes for title washing that's
when a car passes through the DMV of a
state that doesn't fully report the
nature of a flooded car flags like water
damage total loss or salvage title then
drop off the car's history also check
the National Insurance Crime Bureau site
it's run by the insurance industry they
report in all cases where claims have
been attached to a car that was flooded
or some other way totaled both are free
to check and both as you can see will
have some holes in their data
it pays to double-check the databases
that are out there as well as your own
senses and your gut to make sure you're
not plunking down good money for a car
that got irrecoverably wet
