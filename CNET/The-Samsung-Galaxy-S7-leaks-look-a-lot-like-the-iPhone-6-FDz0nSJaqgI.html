Google licious we have all the latest
galaxy s7 news but first it's a big week
for alphabet the parent company of
Google as it has passed Apple as the
most valuable company in the world after
a stellar earnings report now Monday's
after-hours trading pushed alphabets
market cap to 560 billion dollars with
apples standing at 535 so why is this a
big deal well the last time Google was
more valuable than Apple was in February
of 2010 when they were both less than
200 billion dollars so Google has passed
up Apple financially but according to a
report from the information the googs is
taking a page from Apple and planning to
take more control of the design of its
Nexus smartphone acting more like Apple
does with its iPhone currently their
phones are built in partnership with
manufacturers like motorola and HTC but
the Nexus line has lost its consistency
by rotating different manufacturers each
time also google is getting even more
serious about virtual reality after
recode reports the googs is shuttling
current employees around to create a
dedicated design team around google vr
google doesn't have a reputation for
being really a high-end design company
for hardware but they know how important
it is to vr and they are looking to
change that now we talked about goog
starting to build a team last week but
that focus is accelerated especially
after Apple through their name into the
mix of companies working in the VR space
also Google secretive Google X Division
has been rebranded with a new logo and a
new website that you guys can all check
out at solve for x com so if you look
around you'll see some of the amazing
stuff they're working on like Project
lunes Wi-Fi balloons or project wings
their self flying vehicles for
delivering goods to hard-to-reach areas
of the world it also revealed a couple
of graduated projects that we weren't
too familiar with like G cam which aim
to improve mobile photography and
project watch which later became Android
wear it also confirmed that project aura
does indeed exist for the google glass
team and it's rumored to head mounted
audio based devices all right FCC
documents reveal that in addition to
Mountain View California and Austin
Texas
Google is bringing its self-driving car
project to form or unnamed cities ann
arbor michigan could be one of those
after a large self driving test track
that recreates real life street
situations open last year so expect to
see more of these guys on the road they
have this cool glowing blue light at
night because i've seen them all right
onto big samsung news in the korean tech
giant has officially announced their
next samsung unpacked event on februari
the 21st we fully expect to see the next
Samsung Galaxy s7 and s7 edge you know
these two phones that were leaked out by
Evan blast that clearly show what we can
expect in a design on the s7 that looks
a how do we put it very iphone 6 ish the
teaser for the event features a guy
wearing the gear VR so we might see some
new developments for content at the
event as well now the galaxy s7 is
expected to bring a 5.2 inch screen
Snapdragon 820 processor with four gigs
of ram and a lowered 12 megapixel camera
compared to last year's 16 but we know
megapixels isn't the only thing that
matters plus the s7 edge will stick with
its curved edges and a 5.5 inch screen
alright we might see this at Samsung's
event but most likely at Mobile World
Congress according to Sam Mobile's
report Samsung's previously rumoured
gear 360 camera rig is a 360 degree vr
camera set up featuring 2 180 degree
lenses its own battery packs and storage
and connects to your phone via bluetooth
this thing is perfect for user created
gear VR content I can't wait to try it
out and really it's truly great to see
how this platform continues to mature so
rapidly alright that's going to do it
for this week you can email us at google
issues at cnet com or tweet me at brian
Tong thanks for watching we'll see you
guys next time for some more of that
