really rolling I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update a new Star Wars
trailer is here and sci-fi geeks are
giddy with excitement Star Wars The
Force awakens arrives this Christmas and
the second teaser trailer gives us a
glimpse of new characters familiar
voices and lots of action
the trailers also introduced a new
rolling droid called bb-8 this is a real
Rollie robot prop created with
technology from the company Sparrow
the world saw bb-8 live in action on
stage during a presentation at Star Wars
Celebration in Anaheim California and
during his adorable brief appearance
Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy
said the technology behind this droid
was possible because of a company
discovered by Walt Disney President Bob
Iger fortune reporters confirmed it was
Sphero a start-up tech company that
Disney invested in the company is known
for making the Bluetooth connected
robotic ball toys that are controlled by
a smartphone app the Sphero 2.0 is a
hundred and thirty dollars and it lights
up plays games or you can get creative
and how you want to mess with your pets
can you imagine if Sphero makes a mini
version of bb-8 it could be the biggest
Christmas must-have toy ever but if you
want a little bb-8 in your life right
now you can find them as an emoji on
twitter the social network created
custom emojis when you use certain
hashtags so if you type hashtag bb-8
without the - you'll get a little droid
or you can go classic with hashtag c-3po
and if you're feeling bad use hashtag
stormtrooper and in news that is
actually happening in real space the
international space station is getting
its first espresso machine the SpaceX
Dragon capsule arrived Friday morning to
the space station with more than two
tons of cargo among the supplies are
food science gear and an espresso
machine called the ISS press o Italy
Space Agency helped make it possible and
it's all for Italian astronaut captain
Samantha Christopher Eddy who has been
stuck with instant coffee since she
arrived in November engineers worked
with the Lavazza Coffee Company to
design a machine that can work in a
weightless zero-g environment I hope
they have little space food with
Scotties to go with it but I guess the
crumbs would be a nightmare that's your
