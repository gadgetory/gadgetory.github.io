Android phone the Samsung Galaxy S 9 and
Google pixel two are probably on your
list of considerations that's no
surprise the galaxy s 9 is a powerful
and elegant machine that sits at the top
of its class it's also pricey at about
720 to 800 dollars depending on the
carrier meanwhile the pixel 2 is a champ
in itself with a best-in-show camera and
a lower price tag that starts at six
hundred and forty nine dollars so which
one should you buy we've stacked these
two powerhouses against one another to
see which one comes out on top
what's great about these phones are that
both are water-resistant but I was never
a huge fan of the pixel twos design
though I love its pocketable 5-inch size
it's thick bezels and matte finish on an
aluminum back feels dated and cheap it
also doesn't have a headphone jack
whereas the galaxy s 9 does and it's a
deal-breaker for many meanwhile the
Galaxy S 9 has a sharper edge to edge
curved screen it's glass encasing is
sleek and elegant even though I kind of
hate how much it collects fingerprints
so easily
overall I have to hand it to the Galaxy
S 9 and it's polish looks for this round
we've already doped deep into a camera
comparison between these two phones
which I highly recommend you watch for
even more info but if you want the TLDR
here's a lowdown the Galaxy S 9 has a
fantastic camera and excels at taking
noise-free photos like when you're
taking pictures of the sky or a
low-light night shot but the pixel twos
camera is exceptional and is our pick
for this category
it's hdr+ enhanced feature Atlas you
just click the shutter and take a great
shot even with tricky lining portrait
mode on both the rear and front facing
cameras are smoother and looked better
lastly we're super impressed with its
video stabilization capabilities which
is one of the best if not the best on
any phone available both phones run
Android Oreo but the pixel 2 will
receive updates from Google as soon as
they're available the pixel 2 also has
the Google assistant digital voices
system while the galaxy s 9 has both
assistant and Samsung's own fix V voice
both assistant and fix feed can do the
basics fine including setting reminders
and checking the weather but Bixby can
handle complex multi-step commands like
posting your latest photo on Instagram
with a dictated caption assistant on the
other hand taps into Google's vast
search database and can look up queries
through continued conversation it's also
faster when looking up answers where as
big speed takes a beat or two longer
both platforms can also look up visual
items like identify landmarks or scan
barcodes via google lens and Bixby
vision also keep in mind that galaxy s 9
has iris scanning for security too
I gotta say though that this rounds a
toss-up personally I prefer assistant
because of its speed and I like the
pixel twos more streamlined and refined
user experience but when it comes to
quote-unquote doing more the Galaxy S
nine definitely has more options
equipped with Qualcomm's latest
snapdragon 845 chipset the Galaxy S nine
is smooth and lightning quick and it
comfortably beats the pixel 2 in our
benchmark tests but just because a pixel
2 has last year's processor it doesn't
mean it's not zippy and responsive
itself when it comes to day-to-day usage
I didn't discern any difference in speed
between the two the galaxy s 9s battery
is only a little bigger than the pixel 2
yet its battery life is impressive in
our lab tests for continuous video
playback on airplane mode the galaxy s 9
ran in lengthy 15 hours and 30 minutes
the pixel 2 meanwhile lasted 13 hours
and 28 minutes in addition the Galaxy S
9 has wireless charging similar to
previous Galaxy phone while this isn't
exactly a make-or-break feature for me
it's one more convenience that the s9
has that the pixel doesn't so while the
pixel 2 is as reliable a phone as any
the galaxy s 9 is faster and has a
longer lasting battery to boot
because I love the ease of which I can
take a great photo with little effort
I personally lean towards the pixel - I
also like its minimalistic interface
pocketable size and slightly lower price
tag but what's objectively the better
phone I have to say is a galaxy s 9 with
its smooth looks fast processor and
long-lasting battery it edged out the
pixel - in more categories this all
makes sense since it's the newer and
more expensive phone whatever fun you
choose you'll surely be satisfied with
both lastly if you don't need a new
phone right away note that Google is
expected to launch the pixel 3 in
October and the next big Samsung phone
is assumed to be the Galaxy Note 9 which
is due out for release in August</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
