welcome to Google ishes it's all the
Google that we can pack inside of a show
now Google is taking on the universe
with the recent announcement of five
winners that will be sharing 5.25
million dollars for their milestone
achievements in Google Lunar XPrize
contests now the final goal of this
contest is to take a robot to the moon a
20 million dollar grand prize will be
given to the team that's able to land a
robot on the moon that can move more
than 500 meters and it must also stream
video from the surface of that moon now
the three categories of achievement that
companies were recently rewarded for
we're imaging mobility and landing
technology and you guys can find out
more about the contest and the companies
competing at the link below and it's
just another way that Google is pushing
people to think big all right we've
shown you plenty with Google's Project
are a modular smartphone but have you
seen the blocks SmartWatch platform
that's really a me to create a modular
SmartWatch of their own while blocks
unveiled their plans a few months ago
and now the latest reports claim Google
may be interested in working with the
blocks team to bring the best of both
companies modular ideas together to work
in harmony blocks take on the modular
SmartWatch was featured on Intel's CES
booth and they showcased how each module
or link of the SmartWatch could act as a
battery SIM card slot gps unit or more
and also having a single development
community for both devices really make
sense and also give them the best chance
to survive long term as well ok Google
Fiber is likely making its next
expansion into North Carolina both
Charlotte and Raleigh Durham have been
listed as potential candidates there has
been no official announcement but google
is planning three separate announcements
in the area next week and we highly
doubt it will be the unveiling of the
nexus 7 phone or maybe it could be now
up to this point google fiber's gigabit
network exists in provo utah Austin
Texas and Kansas City Missouri you know
the home of the 100 times faster Wi-Fi
at starbucks alright sticking to
networking a recent report from the
information claims that Google is
launching its own cellular network where
they will sell plans directly to
customers and manage their calls and
data just like a carrier now they won't
be building their own infrastructure but
they'll accomplish this by buying
wholesale access to sprint and
t-mobile's network similar to companies
like boost mobile or Cricket Wireless
the specific details remain unclear but
we will keep you guys all updated and in
some gadget news new leaked photos off
the purported kima that's the HTC One m9
model with its rounded metal body design
it looks very similar to the ma but the
power button has now moved to the right
side of the device while the volume
rocker has been moved lower as well we
expect a 5-inch 1080p display 20.7
megapixel rear camera and eight core
Snapdragon 810 processor and three gigs
of RAM but official details are expected
at Mobile World Congress in March and
Google's $99 Nexus player has been
available on their own Google Play
website for some time but it's expected
to hit walmart store shelves and new
eggs online store so you can go and get
it there and no we didn't forget about
HP's recent announcement for their new
Pro slate 12 that includes a 12 inch
screen but it's also the first tablet to
be built with Gorilla Glass 4 the latest
glass tech from the company that's
supposed to be stronger and offers
better drop protection now the HP pro
slate will also include a duet pen that
will act as a regular stylist and a
writing utensil as well specs include a
1600 x 1200 resolution snapdragon 800
processor 2 gigs of RAM and 32 gigs of
expandable flash storage starting at
five hundred and sixty nine dollars but
they'll also be offering a smaller pro
slate 8 inch model that starts at 449
alright that's going to do it for this
week's show you can always email us at
Google Isha's at cnet com or tweet me at

catch you guys next time for some more
of that Google ishes
