the fujitsu stand in Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona and fujitsu is
showing up a concept for unlocking your
phone using iris scanning now why
exactly would you want iris scanning
well there are a few reasons first of
all you don't have to remember a whole
load of complicated passwords or a
pattern for unlocking the screen it also
means that you don't actually have to
use your finger at all of course we're
fingerprint scanning if your finger is
too wet or of course if you're wearing
gloves but you won't be able to unlock
your phone very easily but by using iris
scanning all you need to do is point it
towards your face and let the phone do
the work now right now you can see on
the top of the phone there is a unit
that contains an infrared infrared laser
and an infrared camera to pick it up now
this is only a concept but sometime
later in 2015 there will be a consumer
foam that actually combines these camera
inside the phone itself now as it's a
concept for software isn't final on this
phone even so it did seem very easy to
set up with my own eyes and it does
unlock extremely quickly and I could
definitely see this being very handy if
I'm walking out in the cold of my gloves
on fujitsu did advise me to keep my
glasses off when registering my iris but
I did find it with my glasses on it was
still able to recognize me and let me
into the phone which is good to know as
a glasses wearer fujitsu hasn't said
exactly when we're going to see this
inside one of its consumer phones or how
much it will cost or what it will look
like so we can only really dream at the
sort of device will finally see with
iris scanning technology inside but I'm
certainly looking forward to giving it a
proper go later in the year I'm Andrew
Hoyle for cnet's and this is fujitsu
iris scanning unlock concept
