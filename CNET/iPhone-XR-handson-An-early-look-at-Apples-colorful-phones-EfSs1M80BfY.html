am in New York City on this chilly day
where Apple invited us to come play
around with the iPhone 10 our before it
goes on sale so let's check it out I
can't help but get excited when I see
all of the colors I mean look how bright
and happy they are you got a blue a
coral a yellow man I guess I'm feeling
the coral today you know it's kind of my
jam I guess going on right now but I
just love it when I see wish more
gadgets came in colors honestly there's
also white and black you know if you
don't want a color and there's also hot
product red so it's the same kind of
shade I guess have red that you've seen
in other iPhones but you know what I
want to play with the color ones because
that's more fun it's got possessed so
with the 10r you're not getting those
metallic colors like the gold silver
space grey but you know what candy
colors are kind of fun and maybe you
need a little fun in your life it's all
I'm saying okay all right let's get a
closer look here at this lovely little
blue
I like how they really took the aluminum
on the side and matched it with the blue
on this glass backing so that's a fun
little effect there kind of looks pretty
sleek so it's like a metallic aluminum
blue now in your other like iPhone
tennis models it's not aluminum it's
steel but you know it still has a pretty
good feel about it now the screen is
gonna be different than you have in the
other new models with the tennis because
those are Oh loads the screen on the
front that's LCD it feels like my iphone
time it doesn't feel much different in
terms of response time it's very quick
the 10r might have a little bit more of
a barrier like a bezel showing then say
something like last year's I
found 10 it's just a little just so
slight though but look this is even
bigger ever so slightly than the iPhone
10 this one's mine you know what let's
have a little bit of an iPhone party
let's look at some of the sizes so we
could see where this lines up I've got a
few of my iPhone friends along ok so
this is the 8 and the 8 plus I think if
you're upgrading to the iPhone 10 are
you're probably in the 8 zone or older
but if you're curious this is the iPhone
10 this is my phone this is the 10 are
and this is the 10s max so these are the
two new ones this year and you can see
the iPhone 10 are just kind of fits in
that little sweet spot like the little
Goldilocks of all the newer phones you
know just not too big not too small so
it just kind of looks happy and right so
on top here you're getting the same true
depth camera as was in the iPhone 10 or
the newer iPhone 10s but on the back now
that's where there's something a little
different the new phones all have two
cameras this one has one but you're
still gonna get some of the same really
cool effects like portrait mode so let's
take a few in selfie mode you're gonna
get a lot of cool effects you can do
portrait mode and there I just took a
portrait and I'm in edit mode able to
change the depth in real time so I can
make it really clear in the background
oh I made it all blurry there so you're
also going to be able to get some cool
lighting effects right here you can
change one studio light contour light
stage light as you may be getting with
last year's model but you know what if
you're upgrading to the iPhone 10 art
you probably don't have last year's
model you probably have something like
the 8 or the 7 and you're really
thinking about having that extra new
experience this is where you're gonna
get that and what's cool is that you can
edit a photo I'm so goofy in that photo
but
you know what that's what I do he just
change the background real-time and then
go back and change it again same with
the lighting which is pretty cool let's
see how it looks with the back camera
I'm ready for my close-up oh I am such a
nerd but here you can see even with the
back camera we have one camera on the
back but we get to do all the cool
effects like having to change the depth
the lighting you get about three
lighting choices contour studio and
natural so why would you get a ten are
when there's a 10 s out there for one
it's cheaper it starts at about seven
hundred and fifty dollars so you're not
paint a thousand dollars for phony or
getting a lot of the same features in
fact most of the features that matter
all the cool camera effects so you could
think of it as kind of like a tennis for
less one thing you're not getting is 3d
touch instead you're gonna have feel
like this little haptic feedback if you
want to use with the camera shortcut on
the front but honestly I'm not gonna
miss that because I don't really use 3d
touch but you just press any feel a
little vibration they call it half dick
feedback so that feels this more or less
the same as you get any in the other
models
it is going on sale Friday October 19th
and it hits stores on the 26th so we'll
have to see more later when it comes out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
