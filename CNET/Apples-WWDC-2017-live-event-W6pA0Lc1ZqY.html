pre-show of WWDC 2017 we're an hour
before the actual pre-show this is where
we talk about everything possible we're
gonna set a few pieces of business in
order meaning how can you reach us how

the show the number right down here one
eight eight eight nine hundred see T
white Chuck I just saved the number now
John Kim is on the phone lines be nice
to him if you don't know John Kim he
helps produce so much of our content our

skits as a air pods the music video so
um he's running this phones for us so be
nice tell John um Seth say nice things
when you first Colin like John you're a
great guy just lists throw him off yes
no idea what we're doing here exactly

WWDC we also have a few other pieces of
business um before we get into the meat
of the show let's all hold these up this
is the big WWDC 2017 big bingo card how
or can you play this game alright so we
have a link set up for you it's so easy
it's a tiny Earl or tiny URL backslash
Earl tiny Earl backslash WWDC 2 0 1 7
it's like the easiest you can do this is
a randomly generated bingo card that we
have created and if you win I could have
our lovely friends here show off some of
the goodies we have 14 prizes ranging
from spec cases both sizes for iPhone 7
and 7 plus also how about some Belkin
are these Thunderbolt lightning
lightning cables oh we all need those
there let's do it let's do product is
you want that you want that okay so play
the game the best way to let us know if
you've won is using the hashtag see net
live once we go we have to do this one
the keynote starts whenever you hear any
of these terms or see them announce exit
on your card and then you could through
the website you can actually hit a hit
hit the square no you know it'll it'll
use that once you do that then you are
good to go
and so you can screenshot it send it to
us and then we'll just pick like the top
14 people and give out prizes it's gonna
be real good like that gonna be fun it's
gonna be fun
okay um now let's talk about what's
going on outside the show let's get a
sneak peak this is not exactly live live
at the moment but this is just taking a
few minutes ago the exterior of WWDC
happening in the San Jose Convention
Center ladies what do you guys think
about them bringing it over to San Jose
this year yeah name a how do you feel
about that it's too far away it's so fun
yeah it's more of a logistical thing I
mean who cares where they do it sir by
far by far with a 40 40 minute drive for
ya Facebook did f8 down there this year
so I think they're trying it
keep it in the Silicon Valley I think
for the attendees I look I went to San
Jose State University that is blocks
away from the college that I attended
but come on there's so much more to do
in San Francisco then there isn't a I
feel bad for all the people who flew in
for this and ended up in sorry no
offense
all right um I didn't realize how crazy
all want to talk about WWDC 2007 - the
lines are completely filled lit up y'all
leg
yo lit a F ok that's the first time last
time we're gonna say that on this
podcast I don't know about that I don't
know about that now that you said that I
might use it a few more times okay so um
we know a lot of things we're gonna see
obviously WWDC a revamp to the operating
systems but ladies let's just kind of go
around in a circle I would love to hear
from you what you guys hope personally
what you guys want to see I'll start
with whatever you guys want to go uh I
don't mind starting why don't you I did
have to change my headphones because why
yeah exactly what you just heard um I I
want to see a refresh of the MacBook Air
I think it's ridiculous that Apple just
kind of put it on the back burner I know
it's a favorite for a lot of people um
who use the air to get through college
and have a lot of allegiance to it so I
want to see a refresh on the MacBook Air
um even if it's just minor just keep it
alive and I have to say I'm most excited
for Apple to finally get in the Smart
speaker game good lord
gosh I mean it's so sad and we can talk
about this more but they set the stage
with Siri years before anybody else did
a personal assistant and then they just
kind of ignored it and let Amazon and
Google walk all over them so I want to
see a smart speaker that I might
actually want to buy okay miss Lexie I'm
excited about iPads no actually I'm not
come on I'm excited about iPad y'all
come on I'm the iPad loser guy who loves
that
there's a market and there's no time
okay your that your that's the five
percent market time I'm the tablet
naysay oh yeah however I'm excited like
Sharon says about Siri I really want to
see some excitement in the series space
I want to see how they're going to
answer Google especially after i/o this
year that they announced a lot of
interesting stuff around the assistant
and artificial intelligence specifically
now I also want to know where Apple's
going to go with augmented reality
reality right so they are really really
behind in this space in terms of what
we've seen pretty much see nothing from
Apple so I want to know if they're going
to be working on a standalone headset
are they working on a hololens are they
working on something integrated with the
iphone like what are we going to see in
terms of the implementation of those two
cameras on the seven plus like what are
we going to see I want to see some
augmented reality I want to see some
mixed reality it's something fun
something crazy you know I quite
honestly for me this is probably the
most exciting potential keynote we've
seen in a long time and the reason why I
say that is because we actually don't
know too much look we know everything
about the iPhone we really do we know
about 80 percent of the new iPhone
that's coming out in September but here
at WWDC we really don't have any real
meat and potatoes when we're talking
about what they're going to do with iOS
11 what are they going to do with iOS 11
for the iPad there's some little nuggets
and we'll talk about those later what's
going to happen to Mac OS what's gonna
happen at evos what's gonna happen to
watch us like we don't really know know
and then in addition to that obviously
like you said you know we've talked
about on the Apple byte ad nauseam about
just how they need to say I don't want
to see a Siri the way syria's it needs
to be a whole new Siri if it new if it
wants to compete with what is out there
don't give us oh we added more third
party partners don't give me
oh we added a few more hooks to this
information it has to be significantly
smarter it has to be a different system
so with this this came from the
acquisition that Apple had a years ago
of the company that uh basically now has
viv the smart assistant which is
integrated into Samsung's bixby which we
haven't seen Apple acquired you know
Siri and made it their own but they have
like you said they haven't done anything
significant to it since its launch in
what was that was it around
mm and old this is 2011 before s in the
forest yeah so 2011 so you know we're
waiting to see that I just think though
along a long time yeah all more all the
time that's like that's she's
Millennials in in the tech world so um
I'm just want to see to me this WWDC
means a lot more than even an iPhone
keynote I think this is going to set the
stage of where Apple is going to fall in
line with artificial intelligence voice
assistance and where their platform is
going to be able to either compete or
kind of feel like a nice try you guys
are still behind this is I think the
lots of writing on this rap will just
the future of it because we felt they've
been behind for the past couple years I
think this year is where you need to
show us that you're either caught up or
doing something even better
yeah tell me tell all those people
waiting for the note this summer that
they shouldn't leave their iPhone tell
everyone ready to upgrade that they
shouldn't get the s8 so I I think that
to your point Siri can't just be like
Siri 2.0 it needs to be true artificial
intelligence right now we have a fixed
set of questions and the answers that
you can ask Siri it doesn't feel like
you're really having a natural
conversation it feels very Forrest and
calculated so if Apple can actually not
just improve Siri in a superficial way
but actually make it like oh wow now I
really feel like this is the future of
artificial intelligence I think they can
keep a lot of people around for a bit
longer
absolutely okay so let's go hit the
phone lines we have look the keynote
starts at 10:00 a.m. we Pacific time we
have 50 minutes to hang out with you all
we're gonna be friends we're gonna take
your phone calls I'm going to talk more
because we want the show to be all about
you as well so let's hit up our friend
Matthew out in Detroit Matthew can you
hear us welcome to Cena alive hello
what's up man so this morning I read on
nine-to-five Mac wait wait did you read
on i-25 Mackey read on CNET comm I'm
just kidding I'm messing with you see on
CNET via nine-to-five Mac I'm just
playing with you go ahead yeah that an
app was actually leaked was leaked on to
the App Store named file yes sir
does this mean that for iOS they might
be introducing a file browser yeah
Apple's an act like they just invented a
file system I'm sure of it
yeah there's been a lot of I don't know
how much you've been following along
right yeah of course not
they there were renderings out of from a
group named Mac stories showing an
actual finder navigation system that
could potentially be brought to the iPad
that the thing here is that this showed
up as an iPad app only so not for iOS 11
as a whole but just for the iPad which
would you know be a huge help but the
system needs more than that for the iPad
but this is one of those things that I'm
quite honestly excited to see if they
have some level of file navigation that
shows us that the iPad is more than just
a large screen iPhone something that
androids had but I also read oh yes that
the the in one of their like support
apps a name was leaked that was
drag-and-drop for the iPad Oh drag and
drop we'll see I think I think that if
if this is the case I mean this is going
to help the pro feel more pro but again
I look I I need Apple to really impress
us with the iPad pro I'm the number one
like iPad really yeah
you know I think it has to go more than
that but I think it's you know look
Apple needs to show us some more than
just steps in the right direction right
we we need to be like dang that software
is so significantly different that now
it feels like this is a machine that
could potentially replace my laptop
which is what they kind of try and talk
like it will but it's not on the level
of the surface obviously not even close
from a functionality standpoint but
we'll see we'll see it but I think it's
really interesting and we have a shot up
there kind of with that what that leak
looks like so Matthew thank you for the
information my friend you are a part of
CNET live whoo thank 5:00 I had to say
all I want to be able to do is download
a zip folder and open it on my funds if

l word what's that oh what happen again
don't read it let's get more calls we're
gonna go out to Ottawa with our friend
Chris welcome to see that live what's up
what do you want to talk about today
Chris poutine man Chris Chris okay here
we go yeah eating something wait eating
what specifically it's on that it's
early in the morning ah can keep that
lunch time out here I was gonna say man
it's early for pizza out here but I see
what you I see where you're at a quick
question about pizza have this debate
all the time when they make Hawaiian
pizza do pineapple should pineapple be
put on a pizza or not this is a this is
a sure what do you think uh that depends
if you want to be fancy or not it's got
to be pepperoni to us you want to be
basic you want to be mate you want to be
a basic yeah I just ask one more thing
about pizza do you
call it the cheese pizza or a plain
pizza
uh we call it setting you have pepperoni
P Philip to be popular here you might
have heard of this pizza called
pepperoni all right Chris let's get your
quest we're just having fun with your
welcome to show what's going on I'm good
I was wondering since every WGC is
usually software-based we're looking at
some possible hardware software or
hardware updates what would be your most
favorite hardware update product well
are you saying in their current existing
line or just what would be my favorite
product to see I well mine would be the
series speaker that I'm quite interested
about what would yours be well I think
that whenever look Apple hasn't and
people like got on me for this Apple
hasn't released really a truly new
product in about two years like the
Apple watch is just outside of tears but
literally the hardware that we've seen
from Apple at this point is Apple pencil
and air pods
okay and air pods really really good not
great looks kind of funky still not
gonna lie but this is Apple's new this
could be a new piece of hardware a new
platform look I have an echo I have a
home I really am curious to see how much
better Apple can do than that of course
it's going to have their ecosystem hooks
I don't subscribe to Apple music so that
doesn't that's not compelling enough for
me but the Siri speaker is gonna tell us
how Apple is just thinking about this
space so that's what I'm most excited
about I don't know if you ladies have
any other chime ins MacBook Air with
Retina screen this from like five years
ago you said this is you know single
Apple live show we do oh my MacBook Air
Retina screen it's not gonna happen it's
not gonna happen I need to just be a
taste with that and make yourself happy
that's happening right yeah Chris what
were you gonna say buddies it bought all
their expensive hardware update yeah I
never know yeah it's look this is one of
the few WWDC s where I think I want to
see a lot more hardware Apple has
actually kind of almost
banked up to this this whole first half
of the year we haven't seen any
basically new hardware so we're waiting
for Mac
pros iPads Apple watch iPhone iMac Mac
Pro Series speaker we're going to get
loaded in this back end of the year this
is just the start and to the MacBook
thing we're potentially expecting to see
MacBooks and MacBook Pros getting
upgraded that MacBook Air though is kind
of up in the air I mean I think they'll
keep it around it's their most
affordable MacBook but we'll see if they
do anything to it today I hope they do I
hope they do I'm hoping you know that
the sales of the MacBook Air are still
very strong so for them to just ignore
that would be money leaving money on the
table uh uh uh hmm I just want to see
the series speaker that's all I want I
hope that's a rumor that actually comes
true and uh you know because it's
finally a new product from Apple we
haven't seen anything new
oh hello hey Chris um we'll have a share
and finish up her thoughts and then uh
but thank you for calling we really
appreciate that okay yeah thank you so
much uh so it sounds like we have a
Skype call coming in but TLDR we haven't
seen anything really new and exciting
since the air pods or the watch so give
us something to give you our money or
give us something that we can make
videos for so that we can get more views
and we can still keep doing this show
thank you all right got stein is calling
us on the line OOP we don't have your
video Scott Scott right now you look
like a white rather icon do not see me
at all I have a tie let's see yeah no
yeah this is like a bad Verizon

always loves to give us a live look
inside Scott um thank you for joining us
you do look beautifuller let Lily go
away from all right so Scotty 2 hotty

great video guys I think the stream
either went really up or really down I'm
not sure but Scott tell us uh kinda
hanging in there tell it tell us about
you know
just with the scene set it for us over
there at the San Jose Convention Center
so pretty pretty calm and smooth so far
a lot of people but we're getting in
here it feels it feels pretty spacious
so man froze its okay he's gonna come
back god fan with their in other years I
actually feel like it was like close oh
okay well you know it's a lot of flop
you know what you do is the cutest video
went away to if we can message if we can
message him and see if we can just get
him on a pure call let's just try that
in a bit but if not it's okay landline
oh no he's still trying it's okay let's
just wrap this up all right Scotty yeah
it's just mad but it's gonna be a battle
so call us back on the phone line will
reach out to you oh yeah okay let's just
kill the call for now okay it's like
Chinese guys love you but we had to let
you go anyway so we'll see we can catch
back up with Scott let's go back to the
phone lines and hear what y'all want to
hear we've got Jordan from San Antonio
home of the Spurs who are highly respect
for the record Jordan just to let you
know what's up welcome to seen alive
actually not first fan I just live here
oh oh oh third family so yeah just like
we just had to support the team me you
got right down here you got stun uh my
question is is that you know you have we
have WWDC it's early this year it wasn't
supposed to be like this early we're
expecting to be nobody have it like
later on which I've noticed I was
feeling WD BGC 2016 just happened and
you know and we see the integration I
was asking you what kind of integration
do you hope to see this year for the
iPad and what kinda Gration do you hope
to see but they're obviously not going
to bring or they might bring what should
be a surprise to all of us well I think
that if they want this look the iPad has
an opportunity to when you talk about Oh
what are they doing in the creative
space that is leaving pros out you know
out there to figure out other solutions
I mean if there's a way I know there's
third-party software that does it but in
Apple's own ecosystem to have the iPad
truly act like a second screen
or some sort of drawing tablet that can
complement the Mac OS if they can get
some of those hooks with those
third-party companies like Adobe to work
with it more effectively like that like
a true companion I think that's one way
to be like look our iPad pro is more
than a large screen phone that happens
to have split screen I think that's one
way that they can work on some of this
integration with the iPad tablet or the
iPad platform as a tablet to the Mac
platform again kind of trading more
hooks with the ecosystem if we see that
I don't know again what I just described
probably appeals to a very small segment
of the Apple user base but to me that's
okay I think those are the people that
they've forgotten that have been the
most passionate about their up about
their brand because we know that the
general consumer in general loves Apple
stuff and just buys whatever like they
don't even know what a smart speaker is
when an Apple comes out with their smart
speaker that's what they're going to
think is the smart speaker so I just
think that if we have more for the
diehards the people that are actually
using these tools is a day-to-day basis
as a pro that's some of the type of
stuff that I love to see and that's
that's the thing is that people who are
really like Apple we and we have we have
to use these devices for certain things
we have to go out here but I mean for
example myself I went out and I had to
go by surface because that's it's going
to work for me you know and we I'm
looking for something that the iPad pro
will bring because like you said and
I've been hearing you say every single
time that I watch all your shows all you
say is that the iPad is just the large
screen is just a large screen iPhone and
you know and we're just looking for
something more and I think we haven't
got that I think that was okay when it
first came out right but I think that
the product has to mature over time and
it hasn't yeah and investing is that
Apple I think is lacking from innovation
right now and you know that's something
that hopefully they bring with iOS 11
and we hopefully bring some type of
hybrid or something close to a hybrid
with Mac OS and iOS for the iPad because
it's something we're obviously missing
in the iPad
Jordan you want to be on the show next I
mean you could just Jordan if I get sick
I know I know I got my Jordan you know
on my bench ready to step up six-man of
year right there baby I'm gonna make a
lower third firm rule
Jordan Jordan Jordan Jordan on the phone
lower third
but Jordan what do you think it since
you know we're talking shop with you
what about the series speaker does that
I mean where are you at with that so
I've seen the echo and I've seen the the
Google home and you know as an app
person you know I tried to not you know
look at what Google has because you know
you gotta stay true to your guests oil
but uh you know I've seen Apple just do
these things and they need to do
something new they um you know it's a
little annoying seeing them just copy
off everyone when they need to be
starting something they're you know they
did really well with the computers back
back way back before and they did
something revolutionary with the iPhone
and which Android caught on to but you
know that everything that they've been
doing the watches and you know and and
the speaker they're just trying to do it
better and I just think that some of
these other companies are doing a whole
lot better so Kisan a new prop oh yeah
it's gonna be something new that we're
seeing of course hopefully do something
great with that but of course Google did
that before to you so well you know our
Apple Apple likes to wait let everybody
else give a new product category a try
they did this with tablets and then they
like to Pam come in and then own it and
really define the category and have a
flagship product in that category so I
think that in many ways Google felt like
they needed to get in early and just
assert themselves there even if they
weren't ready with Google home and Alexa
did a better job but still they came in
very early so Apple now they I get the
sense that there is enough awareness of
smart speakers that Apple feels like
this is probably the right time to come
in and set the tone so hopefully we'll
see some I know so don't forget apple
has the Bates integration and so what I
do is talk about is talk about how the
audio quality is say that with Lexi are
you being sarcastic or oh look I'm not
I'm not a huge fan of the Beats Audio
but I know a lot of people are and that
has huge pooling powers now you gotta
get that
exactly so that's a huge I could draw
carving especially because the audio
from the echo and the home is not that
good I mean there's talk about that
Cortana speaker as well that has like
the Harman Kardon or like audio but we
haven't seen actually hurt we haven't
heard that I shouldn't say we've seen it
we haven't heard it so there's a lot of
potential for Apple to really pull out
all the stops you know they have all the
content with Apple music they have all
that stuff going on with all the
musicians around beats so that could be
a huge straw card especially with people
to like I don't know what a smart
speakers but hey it sounds good yeah and
dr. Dre is advertising it and you know
why not why don't I buy this it's got
Series series in my phone I know what
Siri does oh why not
and great points Lexi I think we we also
should just not underestimate a lot of
people that just literally don't even
understand what the home assistant
speaker is right Amazon echo has about
seventy percent of that market right now
which is huge
I don't know how much Apple can take
away from it but we'll see you know
again this is just kind of showing us
the breadcrumbs of how they're thinking
towards the future so we'll check that
out now it looks like we have Scott
Steinbach on our phone line and so we're
gonna we're gonna see we're gonna see if
Scott is here and clear this is all
audio we don't need a play around with
that Skype with that bad signal to San
Jose Convention Center Apple Apple
Scotty what's up pop Brian thank you for
joining us a via phone this time yeah
we're doing it old school so Scott oh we
were asking you earlier if you could
kind of I know we can't see it as much
just we still have the standard stage at
WWDC but maybe set the scene of how it
might differ a little bit from San
Francisco if not that's okay too
yeah so um one sir I mean so many
auditoriums look alike you know
auditorium differentiation is stuff it
is they're all blending together for me
but it is um there's plenty of room
actually things have been very calm
going in there's there's a lot of more
importantly a lot of waiting room huge
amount of area when we first came in
maybe even a little more than Moscone so
I thought that actually it seemed very
calm coming in and we sat down there
even powerstrips
so that's a nice thing it's not a few
you never know if they're going to be
power strips or not when you're working
there's the there's the animated screen
there's a lot of like that same a stuff
that's on that's out on on the front
images of people walking around kind of
like you know avatar type art in almost
I think it's like reminds me of like at
Google i/o where they had animated stuff
it will animated dancing figures on the
screen here yard animated dancing things
on screen hey Scott uh your you
obviously cover Apple a whole bunch what
do you want what do you want to see from
them at this WWDC we've been talking
about it how because we haven't had too
many leaks in general over all that this
this is one of the more exciting WWDC s
and also just kind of them showing off
how they're thinking about the home
assistant and ritual you know augmented
reality and things that what is your
feeling about this keynote overall and
what we should expect here what you're
excited about
yeah so I mean they have so many
platforms now when you think about it we
used to just talk about iOS and Mac but
there's also a OS for the iPad which I
think really needs to be addressed a lot
more like how does that thing as the
iPad become something that we can use
more for work and also I'm so curious
well what's gonna happen with Apple
watch there's Apple TV and then there's
series and rumors of the speakers so
basically I want like synthesis I want I
want to see how they can talk about how
all these works together in a in a way
that makes sense so it doesn't feel too
fragmented and you're just getting into
features and each individual platform I
think that's going to be the goal of
Siri has to be something when you're in
your home and you're saying like hey
Siri or you're saying ok Google how do
you know which thing is listening or how
things handoff from one to the other and
I think that's like that's the challenge
or like where does the watch fit into
that so that's what I want to see I'm
always curious about AR - and if there's
um you know if there is anything related
they are like what type is it is a
Pokemon go level AR is this like Google
tango say they are is this like leading
up the song and put on your head no
probably not but you know what I think
that smart cameras are really becoming a
thing this year like Google ends
the ability to identify things using a
camera lens and computer vision and
ái so I feel like Apple will probably
have something in that territory too
that will assist people with cameras I
look forward to hearing news about that
yeah I you know we're all here nodding
our heads listening you about just how
do they tie all this stuff together I
mean they have the ecosystem advantage
from a standpoint of people that have
typically been in Apple's ecosystem stay
locked in there and can they elevate
that even more you know we this is this
is the opportunity to show us finally
I'm curious how the Apple watch fits
into this because you know they made
such a hard push for it and it's good
ish I wouldn't even say it's very good I
think it's good ish if you're an Apple
user yeah but beyond that um how much
can it really do more than you know
homekit is like one of those things
where you can use it to a certain degree
on your watch but people have found that
just speaking it speak talk in your
smart home is a lot more effective than
tapping anything yeah and so we'll see
how they get all those hooks in it
should be a wrist remote that works with
other things in your home and that's
where Apple watch could fit in so yeah
they need to sort of explain that and
then you know Siri looks differently on
Apple TV versus the phone versus the
watch it does some things and that's it
doesn't do other so that's the other
thing is like cleaning up and connecting
and making clear once you have a couple
of these things you realize oh it
doesn't work quite the same here or this
isn't quite the same so that's I hope
there's a cleaner connection between how
all these products fit together all
right Scott sorry we couldn't get you on
video my man but we appreciate your call
and everything get to it a you'll be on
site with a slew of our CNET staffers
covering everything inside with our live
blog as well and uh we'll look for your
coverage buddy yeah thanks well you will
hear that air pod that's probably the
only thing you won't hear about that is
true but you'll be wearing them so we
can always count on them wearing them
I'm wearing them now
we're looking forward to the next scott
stein meme picture of you on the air
pods oh good the infamous scott stein if
you might have even seen it about even
huh i'll try to wear them as much as
possible an awkward situation yes all
right thanks God we appreciate your work
man thank all right good
I love his point about
making a cohesive experience across all
of the devices people shouldn't have to
memorize what Siri can do on the Apple
TV versus their phone versus their watch
it should be easy in the sunset you can
expect the same experience no matter
where you go it should be easy and it
should also be a seamless thing so you
can as you saying carry across
functionality so you can pick up where
you left off if you are on your Apple TV
and then have that history available on
your smart speaker on your watch on your
phone I mean it's funny I had this exact
problem last night with Spotify it's
kind of the convey the experience didn't
continue over so I was listening on my
mobile and then I went over to my
desktop and then I couldn't access my
listening history a basic thing good
basic human need we need this like food
water and oxygen so a spotter and
Spotify pick up are you absolutely so if
Apple can do something like that and
have the continuity going then you know
I think there on the echo does that
great you know like you hear a good song
that comes on a radio station you just
go to your app you see it right there
you can replay it rewind it it works
awesome hey do you work for Amazon a
beach oh no but I just yeah I was just
listening to Amazon music all day the
other thing that I'm and we'll get back
to more of the calls that Scott and to
your point is that because Siri doesn't
work the same on all devices you
actually use it less and what you know
you actually use it less I don't use
Siri on my Apple TV pretty much at all
unless I accidentally press the button
thinking it was the menu button I
literally that's literally when it pops
I'm like oh yeah they're Siri on so that
is one of those things right consistency
across the bar alright let's jump on the
calls I just a little reminder 9:36 a.m.
Pacific time right now the keynote is
expected at 10:00 a.m. we're expecting a
lot of great stuff we're gonna get to
more your calls and we'll talk more shop
about what we expect to see at Apple we
have this young gentleman from Berkeley
Samuel waiting patiently for a Samuel
what's up welcome to seen alive all
right so I know you guys think that the
arms that you guys are gonna have this
mysterious party is gonna come out but
you guys know what you guys think of a
price oh yeah
I had a guest price but I let the ladies
jump in here what do you think okay okay
that's a tough one I I don't think
they're going to announce a price at all
others right yeah I think though when it
if they're going to have to obviously
feel out the market see how the reaction
is if they're going to price it if
they're going to Dupre they going to tag
premium beats technology or something
like that I think it's Apple so there
will be a premium price tag especially
if they're gonna put beats on it I think
it's gonna jack up the price a little
more I wouldn't know I kind of yeah if I
was gonna guess I again don't think
they're going to announce a price during
the keynote however if I'm gonna guess
I'm gonna say $5.99 oh I don't think
it'll say what is that was like the big
addition over your shoulder is that the
series fingers holding ceiling-mounted
series speakers there's being home
installation I'm gonna walk around my
house oh yeah oh you like my series
speaker y'all let's turn that dial up
all right Sharon Brian oh oh sure
speaker oh okay I'm I'm thinking 249
that's that's that's this money price
yeah cuz look also right now mark it is
yeah goggle uh Amazon echo is 179 yeah
Google home is at 149 yeah so funny 920
summary out so apples gonna go to 29 -
for AMI - 49ers any price don't forget
Amazon echo dot $40 and when it's on
sale yeah dirty yo that's like a
thousand potential Oh premium audio
premium audio I'm so I'm like on this
series speaker on my shoulder y'all this
is height the Siri boom box I think
that's what they should knock it up
sorry boombox boombox I'm gonna stop
that there's children walking really
yeah I mean they have to really overhaul
theory though to even make it water so
that's the swing Samuel are you are you
like fed up with this you want a real
Syria want a real Syria now where you at
man yes yeah what what about what about
if the series speaker was an added
feature that came with an over-the-air
update well actually it's not over there
but an update to your Apple TV I was go
I get it it's for me well I have an
Apple TV there you go so I think we need
to dancing like that
all right Samuel dot is the TV thanks
for calling man he's like yo I have that
I'm 12 years old dad what do you boy you
done with your life share is the sky
black on Apple TV dad I got apple TV son
all right let's do let's go to our buddy
Calvin in Los Angeles or Louisiana it
says LA so I guess you're SoCal what's
up Calvin hey what's going on what's
going on hey you know what I was calling
uh to talk to you guys about that room
let's do it my brother Anthony and I
we're talking about how it'd be great if
they actually put pro applications on it
something like Final Cut Pro and we're
not stuff like that because it seems
like they're just putting Crowe on these
products just so you know I cry suck
okay hold on hold on
is this Calvin and Anthony the brothers
the brothers oh come on Bryan what's the
background here these are loyal
listeners they like to debate each other
they're brothers that like to fight
about tech cullinan right Dave a message
in the middle of an argument well yeah
they need a show man these bros need a
show that's what I'm saying you know
Calvin Oh with the iPad pro you're
you're preachin man this is exactly what
we're talking about I don't the thing
about it is I don't know if they're
gonna put final chapter on I mean they
could because it's basically like iMovie
deluxe uh-oh I said that I sorry I said
that out loud but they do look they need
more Pro apps from the start even when
they dropped the iPad pro the whole
thing was like this to be compelling if
they release logic like a foreign an
iPad pro that's a pro
if they release Final Cut Pro they still
haven't done that so maybe they'll make
us happy but we'll see about that I love
what you're thinking though that's what
they need to do it seems like a purpose
Pro you know really doing well like
Microsoft doing well with you know that
whole things but I don't know man we'll
see what I think the only reason that
people aren't completely flocking to the
surface pro yes some people have their
hang-ups with Windows being
quote-unquote less secure but look the
surface pro is a superior product right
now if you ignore ecosystem it just is
and so people have to admit that I mean
it's beast and it can run those apps so
look we'll see what Apple does I hope
I'm hoping as an iPad pro fan that they
do the same thing so thanks for calling
Calvin tell your brother we said what's
up all right cool take care ABT real
quick can you set up the live block as
it is happening now the live vlog m so
right now we have our editors inside our
live blog will complement this live
stream we do need a so if you go out to
cnet.com basically on our front page

they sent him there not me oh right
that's why but that's exactly what so
you guys can follow along in our live
blog just to also be clear we have our
pre-show like normal many of you know
this we have our post show during the
actual keynote apple streams it on their
own they will not let us rebroadcast it
so we will kind of do our talk shop that
complements it you can hang with us in
if you want to sometimes we take calls
during the actual show when they get to
some of the boring stuff that moves so
so we'll see well then we then we don't
know Jase you're saying we don't have a
phone person so chat us tweet us you
know live us send us your videos on
Twitter and we'll play them back um yeah
just make sure you know send them sent
us okay video I mean
yeah I'll let I'll let Sharon filter
through those no no Sharon Sharon can
filter through the videos I'm not gonna
filter through those videos all right
let's go to Memphis and talk to Louise
Louise what's up welcome to see that
live how you doing doing good doing good
welcome to the show what's up what's on
your mind I want an axe about the Apple
TV I know early reports were stating
that they were talking about a 4k model
or going to another edition how you got
three anything else about that thing I
don't think we're gonna see an Apple TV
here today I think we will see TV os I
think we might see the actual Amazon TV
app on the Apple TV a lot of people been
waiting for that I don't expect us to
see actual new hardware for the Apple TV
yet I could be wrong again you know we
don't always know everything although we
know everything out of a new Apple TV
like you said the 4k capability that
would be that would be the hook um so
we'll see but I don't I don't think
we'll see anything hardware wise today
Amazon Prime supports 4k video Netflix
certain shows support 4k but if it's not
there it'll be sometime during their
September event typically when we
actually see an Apple TV Hardware Apple
goes for the mass-market though most
people don't have 4k TVs and I would
argue that a lot of people don't really
even know what it is or what the
benefits are that's true and all three
people that do have 4k TVs they're
thinking about bandwidth right right and
then not necessarily going to be
choosing a 4k stream over a regular
1080p if they don't have the internet
burn I mean I I do agree with you ladies
to a certain extent I do also feel
though like out of any you know
obviously it's what for Kay's arguably
been out to consumer at least two or
three years now I think a lot more
people now 4k is just a feature on the
TV that they're buying now also gamers
gamers are really where everyone is
getting 4k TVs because these consoles
are supporting them so I think that was
the right time to at least throw out a
4k product from Apple but we'll see
we'll see you know why you don't you
wanna for keeps I want a 4k TV
I want a 4k TV however
TV's got so good like five or six years
ago that anyone who bought their a TV
between 2000 and 2010 I don't think
they're necessarily rushing to replace
it even if it's 4k even if there's three
day on it only becomes you all set terms
one you okay into the kirby jump 3d you
want the D right Steve the day Steve
Steven doesn't want the D alright 3d
that is uh Lois sorry about that that
completely went in a different direction
you still there with us my man yeah
throwing up in his mouth like even a
space dr have a said you think this
something that they go with cuz you see
more these different companies trying to
low these devices up for future proofing
and you know apple still at 1080p yeah
you know what i think you're you're on
the money if we do see something i
expected to be sometime in September
when they do the Apple TV the thing
about it also is with HDR okay well is
that the thing about it is with Apple TV
4k HDR these are basically companion you
know features that are on TVs these days
so it's it's going to happen I just
don't think it's going to happen today
but you're right on the money an HDR
there's not a lot of content to be
honest right now your game is the big
one but in terms of other content you're
going to be watching HDR is everything
on the ground and there's also different
implementations of it and it's hard for
people to kind of understand what it is
without seeing it it's really hard to
explain HDR when you see it you go side
by side with a non HDR and an HDR image
you go oh wow that makes such a huge
difference but trying to explain it it's
like well it's a higher dynamic range
which means you're gonna see basically
more color bandwidth than you get more
detail and you know highlights and
shadow detail people like I don't
understand what that means and it's
ironic because there's more awareness
around 4k but it's HDR like you say that
actually has a visible effect for most
people yeah you're you're really only
gonna see the benefits in in 4k if you
have a TV that's bigger than 65 inches
quite honestly right so at least yeah uh
yeah so anyways thanks so much for
calling Louise we appreciate it thanks
for hanging out the Cecina live i the
thing is that I've been dying I have a
a Panasonic Plasma from like five six
years ago I've been dying to get a HDR
4k TV but I'm not going to pull the
trigger they're way more affordable this
year I mean that's your specifically
Vizio TCL they're putting out 4k HDR tvs
that are around basically thousand
fourteen hundred bucks and they're
greatly that's you kind of got a jump on
that well I'm gonna fuke I lost you
forever
Oh Aleksey yeah miss Lexie I didn't know
that's about that's a decent-sized yell
bro from 4k benefits of 42 inches she
knows HDR but it's HD it's not H oh I
wish no no I'm just saying I wish I
waited I wish I waited because H I could
have I could have out yeah but
then I decided no it's way too much so I
thought well I'll get at least one of
the features that I was interests and it
was look it was a TV wanted anyways and
it happened at how 4k that's the point
is a thing yet I love how Shan was like
oh and it had HDR and I did it did it
not for 350 now is it didn't did it my
bad alright Beach can we throw the phone
line up on the on the bottom again if
you guys and gals want to call phone
lines are still completely locked and
loaded every time someone hangs up
someone calls in one eight eight eight
nine hundred cien et you guys and gals
are awesome I do want to talk about a
few things just maybe some of the other
rumblings or rumors we haven't even
talked about it directly at this keynote
we are expecting and most likely based
on the rumors seen the first launch of
the ten point five inch iPad pro right
this has been a product that we at least
in the rumor mills thinner bezels just
slightly larger than the nine point
seven inch iPad we swear hoping and
possibly going to see that here at the
keynote also rumblings even as far back
as a year ago talked about the Apple
pencil will we see a new Apple pencil to
complement the new Apple iPad pro I mean
we've done a music video about that that
we might show later in the show
really it's very have you seen this you
know about this at all um I heard about
it shared is not famous well um while we
talk about and take other phone calls
I'll kindly asked even beat him to find
locate that video and in order to
educate her about the finer things in
I really need a music video you really
need one all right let's get let's go to
the phone line to see who's been waiting
the longest right now oh my goodness
Brayden from the NYC here at 40 minutes
good Brayden what's up man welcome to
seen alive well yeah I was wondering if
you guys have a idea is if I know that
like the echo they have the skills where
you can play the games and you can
enable all this other stuff do you think
that this Apple speaker will do it I
think that the thing about we have to
remember on Apple is Apple is very
controlling and who they allow to be
their partners Siri came out six years
ago they started just recently like this
year adding third party partners with
Siri integration okay and what did the
Amazon echo do they made their API open
instantly available people started
building stuff like I found stuff like
calm ocean sounds to go to sleep from a
dude that just put it out there like the
amazing ability to just open up the
platform can lead to great things and
sometimes not so great things but also
that accessibility helped the echo to
explode and just be more useful beyond
the direct partnerships they had I think
Apple is gonna be just as controlling on
this I don't expect them I'm maybe
they'll surprise us again I always like
to say that to be an optimist about like
a MacBook Air with a Retina Display yeah
maybe they'll surprise us heart please
right well I mean it's WWDC the whole
point I mean traditionally is to
introduce something new a platform or
hardware or both and allow the worldwide
developers to prepare to develop for it
so I mean I agree I think it's going to
be much more restrictive than Amazon and
you won't get random ocean sounds from
I've got off the shore of Antarctica it
helps me sleep it helps me shoot for
sure but it's going to be 399 from the
Apple Store wait wait the series what's
gonna be doing oh yeah
those ocean sounds what comes it will
cost me I'm gonna stay on my act what is
it a hundred billion dollars husband
spent or they paid out seventy billion
to developers which means Apple
themselves based on their 70/30 yeah
revenue split made thirty billion
dollars off of apps up to this point
since they launched the App Store
seventy billion so that's they created
and they created it's a platform for
people to make me yeah I mean then Apple
has said time and time again that their
services business I'm not sure if that
includes the App Store and associated
and it's definitely Apple music iCloud
things like that if they spun that off
and it's on to its own company it would
be a fortune 500 Oh
which is huge its massive so they've got
a lot of revenue in these businesses
these other side businesses of course
they want developers to be making sure
that there are going to be applications
and to your point Brian let's be an
optimist about it maybe maybe that's
well that's why I was very happy so yeah
Rayden that's that's where I'd it sounds
like you're actually pretty curious
about the series speaker though right
yeah I am I actually haven't had a
mazanik oh now and I have no excuse Mart
light you know a lot of smaller
smart-home stuff and I was just
interested in seeing their integrate all
this we will we will see it was smart
speaker comes out like I would put money
on Phillips you being supported because
Apple has sold those light bulbs stores
for years yeah yeah so you're all set
and yeah all right thanks so much for
calling Braden appreciate it man thank
you I think the other thing is that when
we talk about developers developers
conference homekit was announced in 2014
is what I had last read and they didn't
really do too much with it like quite
honestly it was like it was just there
they're like we're gonna create a he new
thing to make using your devices easy
this is when smart home appliances or
you know light bulbs sly switches we're
just starting to come together and
everyone thought I remember the
headlines Apple is going to make your
home easier to use when it's if they've
never they've never made it truly truly
easy it's better but come on again they
need that if they want it to make it
better they need this every speaker
that's a start yeah but other come
kind of ahead of ahead of them on that I
just that whole dream of an easily
automated Apple home never came to be
and it still hasn't and it may not right
away but we'll see what happens today
it's it's just one of those things where
you look back now and like oh they they
had Siri in 2011 they had a home kit in
2014 those are the two leading platforms
right now that are the hottest spaces
and they didn't work on it and part of
it is that they are spread so thin they
have so many things going on and let's
be real they put all their passion to
the Apple watch that was a directive
from Tim Cook and it's a goodish product
but they ignored that other stuff and
now they're trying to play catch-up a
little bit so we'll see if they can make
another jump i it's a different company
than it was before so you have to also
acknowledge that and not pretend like
it's something that you know it's not
but we're always hopeful optimistic
optimistic cautiously cautiously
optimistic a Beecham do we were able to
locate that iPad pro video at all oh yes
I do have we were able to locate okay so
what is this your iPad pro song right
yes so so this is our gem sources don't
oh I just want to preface this Apple has
been lacking on the second lap all has
been lacking on their commercials um you
know just not as inventive as I like on
the iPad Pro and so yes people like this
is so old but we've been sitting on this
for a long time because I was hoping
they'd announce an iPad pro and like
March but they did but let's just let's
just let it speak for itself just for a
few seconds right one herself it's a
standalone one yes oh maybe IP oh it's
only 30 seconds I have an iPad
oh I pair crawl I have a pistol I have
an Apple epistle i pair bro Oh Apple
pencil iPad pro oh the cringe is on 100
that's gonna be in my head throughout
the entire Kean right now well I'm gonna
have Stephen keep that handy because
when they announced the iPad pro they'll
have will have a promotional video for
it I'm speechless
I'm sorry I know the cringe was that
pretty high pretty high pretty high
that's that's that's what we got paid
for that I just want to let y'all know
probably all haters we got paid for that
snot my I'm a sad soul okay let's go
over to the phone lines
gaben Orlando welcome to see that lipo
he's he probably list in the video still
probably enjoying it if you are
everyone's been actually really good by
turning on the volume and just waiting
for the call Gabe what's up welcome to
seen alive hi um so my question for you
is so I remember when the iPad pro was
first released
and I remember the surface pro was out
and they had Windows on it so I was like
I wanted to know why would I want to
know if ever this is just your opinion
with Apple ever put I don't know even a
different version like of Mac OS X on an
iPad pro you're talking about the dream
yeah the big elusive dream that I
believe Apple has hinted that it's not
going to happen I think that everyone
kind of wants to know is i OS and Mac OS
going to come closer and closer together
to be this one Universal platform allow
Windows 10 and you know how you can
basically transfer from one device to
another docking for example like a
surface book where it suddenly becomes a
tablet and you have the full
functionality Windows 10 just slightly
different interface tweaks I don't think
exactly I really don't think it's it's
going to happen I'm pretty pretty sure
that Apple has time and time again
kind of given enough hint saying that
they are two separate entities and even
though they might visually come together
a little more that I don't think they're
going to merge into that Universal OS it
may be where we're looking for I think
the other thing that really tells you
all you need to know is that at the
latest earnings report Tim Cook outright
said the iPad pro is not a replacement
for a laptop and so by just throwing
that quote out there he clearly sees
them as separate products he clearly
doesn't feel like that the iPad pro
deserves or should get some of the
functionality that a laptop has which is
kind of blows your mind like it do give
us something we saw earlier for those
you who may be tuned in later that Apple
leaked out a files app specifically for
the iPad pro that which looks like some
sort of file navigation system that we
might see here now today but that's
still not good enough and like to Lexi's
Point and really to Tim Cook's point I
don't think they're ever going to do it
at least in the next two years I mean
this is the chance to do with the
surface Pro's banal for so long I've
been looking at thing I'm like dude
giving some of that on the iPad pro just
something right and we got asked we got
split screen drag so they can either
choose to surprise us and delight us or
they can choose to kind of have us go
really you guys still haven't done much
we'll see maybe they they'll find some
middles middle ground but cautiously
optomistic is the key word first day um
I also wanted it like cuz yeah I don't
know I thought maybe they would do
probably not likely but do you think
they would ever come out with like a
touch screen MacBook Pro did you hear
did you hear Steven Beecham laughing
about Stevens ha ha ha ha Steven talk to
me about that no they're they're totally
against it they see that the you know
the trackpad on the on their laptops
they see that as the touch screen and
they've come out against it like they
don't see a future for that so you mean
even though I constantly try to tap my
screen my kids do too they always try to
scroll my screen my yeah you know and
that's the future of an Apple user you
know like children who are who are all
using touchscreens on a regular basis
now guys that's what the touch bar is
for
don't get me started on so realistic and
logical wait hold on hold on let me do
you have your thermos is the Apple
kool-aid in your thermos oh yeah I just
wanted to check I think there's actual
Apple kool-aid in her drink there's more
juice guys but yeah the touch bar I'm
not gonna poop on it more than I have
because everyone like gets mad when I
get a little overly critical but come on
it that I have not heard okay for
example you just got this new MacBook
Pro recently you've had it for a few
weeks
how much better or more frustrating or
where do you stand with this touch bar
the touch bar is not as frustrating as I
thought it would be however I do miss
the function buttons and I do miss the
ability to easily tap through and change
my volume or mute or whatever I want to
do however which is a very basic
function very basic functionality that I
would hope that there would be an easy
way to access however I've kind of been
a surprised in my day to day application
application usage there hasn't really
been a situation where the touch bar has
kind of got it wrong I have to say like
I'm in a music app and my volume and
controls are everything are up there I'm
doing some other kind of editing and
then the right controls where I need
them to be I I think it's not as it's
honestly not as disjointed as I thought
it was just say you like it Lexi because
it's not necessary because it's not good
right it doesn't it but because it's
there and now this is the only way yeah
that's all you have to use it you're
happy and touch bar now so I have to
live with this and there's not going to
be any going back I don't think they're
gonna suddenly reverse and go oh you
know what we're gonna put function
buttons back Inuk my favorite part is
the emoji no yeah here's hater
I just think that look and also this
comes from a different perspective we
have some of us have these MacBook Pros
for work but I'm just telling you if I
had to put my own money down on it
I want a 15-inch new MacBook Pro with a
physical bar on the top I think the fact
that it doesn't have haptic feedback on
it is weird it just feel it feels it
feels weird without any type of haptic
feedback when it's on a keyboard which
are used to some sort of tactile
response I think that's one way they can
improve it but again
it's disconcerting to know that sure I
get why they put the touch bar only in
the 15 and they let the 13 have one that
doesn't have one and I think it's like a
200 or $300 price difference
give me one that's $300 that doesn't
have a touch bar but that would be an
admission by Apple that it's not as
necessary or what what desired by their
consumer base you know that I think
there's a lot of times where they aren't
hearing there they're different like
before these that tell us what we wanted
before we knew we wanted it I know it
sounds very corny but it is true now
they're not even listening to what we
want use it directed the touchscreens a
different Apple yeah totally like what
how can you do this to us
that is a different that is a different
type of company that isn't even
listening to what their consumers want
and still believing that we can show you
what you want when everyone is saying
not really it's a different thinking but
how much of this is concerned that they
don't want to cannibalize existing
markets like bringing together the Mac
and the iPad would essentially kill the
iPad so they it's time to admit that
Apple has a redundancy problem yes we
don't need all three or four or five
product types we need I mean what we
really need is basically like a surface
laptop yeah exactly it has the best of
all worlds and then you can get rid of
the iPad that's yeah that that started
how many three four four five years ago
yeah okay just want to put that okay um
Beechum houses a keynote started yet has
started I mean they're just doing like
flyover shots of the crown stone okay
okay one hasn't really begun yet so what
we'll wait and do guys and gals is that
once the keynote starts we're gonna
switch over again we cannot stream that
if you guys want to go watch it
somewhere else we totally understand we
have our post show which we will be
taking calls on let me just bang through
some of these calls now once the keynote
starts and our team is live blogging
inside we're gonna transition with a
little play-by-play and talk about it as
the show is happening but we won't be
able to watch it directly so let's just
get into here thanks Gabe for calling I
did hang up on you because we were
talking let's go to Chuck in Philly
what up Chuck welcome to show package
chat but thanks a lot oh I'm sorry I
didn't write that that's okay
going to college in August he wants a
MacBook Pro and I hear the new ones are
going to have the KB Lake chips yes they
probably won't be they will be announced
maybe today but won't be out until who
knows when October November December
so do you wait for one you just buy
what's currently available here's here's
what my take on it I think you actually
not only do you wait for it it's going
to come sooner than you think and the
reason why is that um Apple people that
were ordering recent new MacBook Pros
for some reason their shipping dates got
pushed out to weeks and which is
actually not normal it's not like
they're running out of it and my hunch
is that these new new new MacBook Pros
with the kb lake processors will most
likely be available within the next
month so I think I would just sit tight
and no matter what don't get the earlier
gen even if it you know that you said
it's for someone who's going back to
school yeah starting in late August
early can I make a suggestion I would we
suggest that you wait until you see
benchmarks because early benchmarks on
PCs have shown that there isn't a
significant improvement in battery life
nor does it significantly improve speed
so if that's the case on the MacBook
then what you might find yourself doing
is waiting for that new laptop to come
out and then getting the last version at
a nice discount whether it's refurbished
or otherwise um you again like I think
that if the benchmarks are what they've
shown for the PCs you won't be that
impressed by the cable ache processor KB
Lake will give you a little boost but
it's more about battery life right
you're probably getting about an hour a
little more than that more battery life
out of it but you know for me I'm just
at the school about if they're just
announce it I'm gonna get them in
general I'm going to get the new one
unless it's a touch bar MacBook Pro I'd
be like give me one that doesn't have a
touch bar on it Oh interesting idea to
save a few dollars since my last year of
college was four thousand dollars at my
son's this year will be seventy two
thousand dollars so I congratulate
congratulations you've won thank you
very much thank you so much for calling
appreciate it
yeah times have change y'all dang 72
whoa all right let's go
- if I have this correct eaten in
Alabama what's up Eton oh my god it just
has to be the best that we've ever DC
ever academi I've actually talking to
you Oh what am i man we're talking to
you
we're talking to you oh you're not
talking about the baby
I am currently watching the live stream
on my iPhone yes you know it's real Dave
Dave DC 2017 has officially kicked off
but my question to you guys was um my
friend Darrell Chandra is texting me as
we speak and we're having it I guess a
disagreement about a refresh of the iPod
product line oh wait wait did you just
are we going prehistoric age right now
are we going back we really are they
could give up on on hesitation to give
up on the product - let it die yeah I'm
always fanatical all Apple products
though I think there's still a market
present well you didn't how about this I
will tell you there's always a market
for any Apple product but if you want to
go Apple's not gonna put any more money
into the iPod there's gonna keep the
ones that they have really eBay is going
to be the next market for the iPods and
everything that we have plays music
shout-out to Darrell also you know cuz
he's your boy but um I think that if
you're a fan of Apple products sometimes
you gotta let things go - like if you
love something let it go you know and
maybe maybe it comes back to you on eBay
you don't I mean it's like like so you
know what I'm stoked I you know you're
here talking to us and we're excited for
WWDC but iPods Apple hasn't even
included it in their earnings for at
least the past two years now I believe
so we probably won't see it but um thank
you so much for kama man we appreciate
thanks for me bars you know everyone
that argument all right all right
shoutout to Darrell okay so we're we're
gonna jump over to the live blog right
now there are people that are on the
phone lines if you want to wait and
there's opportunities for us to get you
within the keynote we will but right now
we're gonna jump over our live blog and
see photos if you want to jump over to
Apple stream it's all good
yeah you got it timed out it's all good
we're hanging out with you so right now
they're just showing a general video it
looks like some sort of a sketch of
Scott signs describing it as bordering
on a Silicon Valley feel but it's
showing up an Apple data center looks
like there's Russian words in the
background some sort of like they're in
a different country somewhere in this
video how to ask you I'm gonna stay away
from any Russia comments a period for
fear of any kind of backlash for fear of
Stephen Beecham talking about specific
type of news thang news bad news this is
all real news this is all real alright
so I think they're playing up on a fun
thing with a world with no apps and why
apps are important the apps is shutting
down
why WWDC is here for there for you and
for the apps that's what we do without
apps that's true though I would be okay
without me enjoying my life well how
would you even get from point A to point
B bruh I don't know I mean how do we be
printing up pieces of paper you mean you
mean like this like this oh yeah quest
while they're playing this while they're
playing this promo video real quick
before they start the keynote our
keynote bingo starts now so if you see
or hear them say any of these terms or
talk about them we have great ones like
it's always a classic Craig federighi
hair Force One Phil Schiller's voice
cracking the word tremendous someone
taking a picture with their iPad just
things like that dark mode a rumor thing
in Iowa's 11 so if you want to
participate once you get five in a row
any direction screen cap it and send it
to us hashtag seen it live and we've got
gifts for you spec cases and Belkin
lightning cables we got 14 prizes so you
all could be winners and I better not
see this stuff on eBay I'm gonna track
you down oh my god I will track I will
hunt you down alright um it looks like
Tim is on stage and says welcome to WWDC
it's great to be back in San Jose the
heart of Silicon Valley and right down
the street from Apple and our new campus
shard Timken our reporter on site one of
our many reporters that says it's been
15 years since WWDC
has been in San Jose this is going to be
according to cook the best and biggest
WWDC ever are we going to get a one more
thing that would be fun they they've
killed that but sometimes I think
bringing it back they didn't do with
this right they did it one time yeah
they didn't the watch alright they did
with the watch it was like I didn't see
that one coming remember this is the
optimist WWD alright so i got a heart we
got hurt for something cops cautiously
optimistic right that's right cautiously
cautiously so uh yeah they're setting up
the stage here I'm still like I said
before earlier ladies I'm super excited
about this WWDC I think we could see
week this is Apple's chance to actually
wow us one of the few times it's a huge
potential here and I hope that they
really step up to the mark and something
exciting happens yeah that is out of the
ordinary it is something that the rumors
weren't pointing to that it's a product
that truly makes us go yeah okay Apple
is actually I'm going to be innovating
rather than just following and making
like a very good product but something
that is you know two three years behind
the competition so crossing my fingers
there's gonna be something good and
something exciting here well they did
say biggest and best so it's it's always
it's always this is one of the bingo
spots actually it does not occupied Tim
Cook yeah but mark off Tim Cook on your
bingo card do you do X oh yeah you can
do whatever you want could you swirly
sign didn't say good morning he didn't I
know that screwed me I expected one
maybe someone else might say good
morning but every key note he has he has
said good morning they're talking about
just how many developers are registered
for WWDC 16 million registered
developers of those 16 million 5300
attendees there's a there's a lottery
system to actually even get into WWDC so
it's there's never a guarantee
um I do also want to remind you that the
center spot here which is a free spot on
our bingo card is Warriors up to Oh make
sure you mark that Warriors up to oh
just in case you hear that Warriors up
to 0-2 so they always start with I
always find that Apple starts with the
heartwarming story when they open the
keynote or anything and this time it
turns out that they
is a ten-year-old coda in the audience
we started coding when he was six and he
already has five apps in the absolute
what are we doing with wasted guys oh my
god but a skunk shriek in my hair and
some kids developing five apps
my kids are collecting snails outside
dude honestly your kids are badass cuz
they're interacting with nature
yeah I'm trying to give them stop
killing animals Wow
I'm just kidding I'm kidding yo y'all
kidding joke joke not not totally not
true they totally not killing snails
totally not true there's a smush to
collect them now alright Tim Cook is a
transitioning over and saying let's turn
our attention to four incredible
platforms which is uniquely expressed
and designed for the best experiences
for where they were uh flash up on the
screen TV OS watch OS Mac OS or luckless
watch chuckles watch shows TiVo's iOS is
Mickey we've seen the platform's forward
that's why the developer conference is
so important we have a lot to talk today
about today and I do mean a lot six
important announcements to share with
you this morning
dang that way we can already cross off
TV OS watch OS oh my finger caught god
you're right yeah we can we can't bingo
bingo baby
I'm a kind of Mac OS 10.13 though which
one you said watch OS watch OS TV OS we
got that marked off oh ooh I'm close I
don't even tell me
come on Amazon video Apple TV hey you
know what the TV OS is our first thing
they're doing right now they might see
it we just launched the support from a
handful of video channels there's now 50
partners integrated into the TV app
these are Tim Cook's words on stage man
Beach if you win this right out the gate
again hashtag see not live with a
winning card yeah I mean I might kiss
you but don't donate my parmesan is
coming to the TV app and all Apple TVs
did you literally get 500 Brian I'll see
your friends 10.5 inch iPad pro is what
I need
ooh well that's a that's an iOS that's
at the very end of the keynote man good
luck with that that's not gonna happen
so prime video provides a wealth of
great content some great original
content like transparent Mozart in the
jungle and so much more
we're pleased to welcome Amazon to Apple
TV this has been one of the big holes
and the story was that basically Jeff
Bezos and Tim Cook sat down in a room
and just like let's just do this damn
thing grinded it out from the top and
now we have Amazon on the Apple TV that
was reported by recode maybe about a few
weeks ago
he's already jumping over he's all
you'll hear a lot more about TV OS later
this year sorry I'll have happy it what
let's talk about hey I'm keeping let's
talk about the Apple watch all right
like yeah that was it TV OS so number
one selling Smart Watch by far evil
Hey Ya Ya Ya button I never really sales
Figgis or we just have to take their
word for it I think that we can I see
way I see way more Apple watches what I
did before I I would I think once
they've got to the second gen in the
first gen was so much cheaper a lot more
people bottom like for like Black Friday
and stuff like that um Tim Cook is
saying Apple watch is designed to help
you live a healthier life we know
there's a lot of stories of Apple really
beefing up their team potentially having
a way for the sensors in the future
Apple watch designs to incorporate being
able to measure blood sugar levels and
more I don't think we'll see that today
because that could be its own event I
could be wrong but they are going to
tout about watch OS and last year's WWDC
watch who has significantly changed to a
version of the OS that I felt was
appropriate to it it was kind of an
admission that their first run was a
little misguided and just not up to
snuff I do like watch O's are we add
Watchers what is stress
yeah well just race C's Quatro mijo
let's start with Apple watch faces
they're going
in two quick ways to glance and
information so new watch faces coming
here we go the new watch there will be a
new watch face powered by Siri
intelligence ok this is this is what
we're hoping for and talking about is
that predictive artificial intelligence
that hopefully they take beyond the
watch I know they've tried to introduce
it to the iPhone but I don't have you
guys noticed the proactive Siri feature
I mean I don't notice a me in your
notifications yeah with directions right
like you should leave now for your next
meeting yeah thanks I have because
there's heavy traffic right but it's now
just a notification rather than
necessarily something that I actively
have to search for and that's that's in
I mean it's it's useful however when I'm
clearly not in the vicinity of what it's
not intelligent about it I'm not in the
vicinity of where my meeting is I'm not
in my usual space for example I'm at the
airport and it's like you should get to
the office now you have a meeting I'm
like I'm knowing near the office I'm not
where I normally am this day every day
maybe don't give me that notification
cuz I'm not gonna head to the office for
that meeting right I'm missing that one
right glanceable information has been a
big kind of hole in Apple's operating
system we know that Google has they know
a lot about us and they've kind of
mastered that but they're showing off
screenshots of how as your schedule goes
along this glanceable information will
show up of course they're throwing in
their little breather like hey take a
minute to breathe like you know show me
where I need to go Thanks my brain does
that formula sunset yeah
hey what time on meditation be tuned
with more meditation and attitude like
that would exist you like the sunset
though notification tells you when the
sun's going down
yeah off you know oh yeah it only
matters when it matters to you right it
only met I know when the sun's gonna go
down and my golf round that's good
this is throughout the day whenever you
raise your wrist the face will
dynamically update with information for
you there's a kaleidoscope watch face
with a trippy psychedelic animation that
might be even more psychedelic depending
on what you're doing that night my task
really
and of it I mean I'm wondering how this
is going to affect battery life all this
all these proactive notification well to
me it's like when you lift it up your
Apple watching how the cool jellyfish
like I was totally okay with that I was
like I'm okay with the jellyfish because
it looks dope right so and it affected
too much joy story characters yes more
animated watch faces right yep this is
why don't like so 15 years ago yeah yeah
when was the last every story quite
honestly oh this is a missed opportunity
should have been putting out chars faces
cars the movie is coming yeah missed
opportunity come on you guys you want to
I need a new marketing director are you
tired of Phil Schiller's voice cracking
all the time
are you tired come on roll out with seen
that live alright let's just do this
already they want to talk about Activity
one of the most frequently used apps on
the watch you might start off each day
with some inspiration they're going to
introduce monthly challenges in the
activity watch to motivate you they're
all achievable because they're based on
your real history so this is again kind
of proactive intelligence and kind of
showing this in two ways glanceable
information as well as within the
activity app so step in the right
direction I think this is subtle stuff
that you'll actually end up in joined
but not be like I can't I got this Apple
watch for its predictive intelligence
you know it's one things that needs that
should just be there yeah here's a
question that are so are you guys using
Apple devices in any way for to motivate
you to be more fit or they just is it
just more of a companion to how you live
your life well I I don't own an Apple
watch I think if I did have an Apple
watch I might be more motivated to use
it as a tool to help workouts to help
actually motivate me in that respect at
the moment I don't do I don't use my
iPhone for that either I mean only
because it's it's bulky I don't know
when I'm trying to run or something with
it it's it's not really something that I
want to be carrying and constantly
looking at and to track my workout goals
if I had to watch perhaps maybe I would
do that and I wouldn't have the need to
carry the phone at all yeah but you know
I
I still just I just don't want exercise
with a tool I just wanted as my music
machine but just to something to listen
to music through and that's all I want
to use it for and maybe a timer and
that's it I don't really want it to
motivate me for my workout goals and
just for like get off your lazy like I
don't need the phone or the watch to
tell me that I can decide myself away
like right exactly sure has it helped
you or motivated you to be like in the
long run not even just like oh no I
tried taking it to the gym a few times
and it was just so much work and I was
that person like yeah for instance I
took it once into a class and I was that
person who was like haha you know and
it's embarrassing be it just doesn't
really add I'm like I'm doing all this
work distracting myself getting out of
my headspace not burning as much just so
that I can track it to what end I'm
already doing the work so what's what's
the real benefit I'm not sure it sounds
like Apple right now is trying to
address some of that I also felt like it
just wasn't matching the results weren't
matching with what I did not not
necessarily calories because that's so
honestly hard to measure it's going to
take a long time before we can actually
accurately measure calorie burn but even
the time the you know the heart rate I
just it felt truly inaccurate which is
ridiculous no I I agree you know even
though they did a test out in like UCSF
about how the Apple watch has some of
the most accurate heart beat you know
heart rate sensing from a step
standpoint from a movement standpoint
it's highly inaccurate I've taken it on
hikes I wore a Fitbit uh on the same
wrist I look at the distance that this
hike is supposed to be yeah the Fitbit
will be like within 1.1 of a mile the
Apple watch will be like a mile off you
know yeah and for so I don't trust it as
much right and I know that there's
supposed to be a way not as opposed to
there's a way to condition it to learn
yourselves like it shouldn't even need
that yeah like it's it's supposed to be
smart enough to be able to do that so
look the whole Apple watch platform that
their time out here with health and
motivation they're talking about how not
only can it incorporate workouts it'll
be able to talk to some of the fitness
equipment at your gym back and forth
like data exchange between the two to
show your readout on the
screens of the workout fitness equipment
as well as the phone I'm sorry as well
as the watch I know people do desire
that but I've never felt personally that
this is me personally that the Apple
watch is actually made me work out more
I think its biggest effect is people
that are unaware of how inactive they
are it might motivate them to walk a
little more but not come it's a
companion for people that already
workout people say oh yeah I like that
if you're already there but it hasn't
been like I've never seen my Apple watch
said oh I should go workout today
right it's never been it's never
happened it's not inspired it's never
happened I mean you know any what Sharon
said like I see people like that at the
gym and they're busy you know they're
busy with their phone like aunt like
graphs and like paperwork and stuff I'm
like I'm sitting there lifting and I'm
like I like they're they're too busy
over there so that's kind of funny
they're also showing off a new a new
dock for the Apple watch that can
basically sit vertically as well from
what I believe what we're what we're
what we're looking at here they're
showing a demo obviously of some of the
functionality that they're talking about
they're showing a real live demo so the
activity coaching but from what I read
here um it looks like there's a new dock
another new dog oh sorry a new dock
meaning there's the dock that was was
landscape when you swipe through apps
right a new dock functionality on the
phone right now that's right not not a
physical doc I'm sorry about that that's
what happens when we don't actually
watch the a keynote we have a bingo
someone got a bingo so we got him
somebody's gonna be going out live okay
hold on let me let me get let me get
this pulled up for you guys
just so we can uh shout out to Li what
about texting I live is this our first
one winner chicken dinner
yeah looks like it hold on let me scroll
down here to most uh where's sorry I'm
getting there we got we got a we got a
diagonal one from top right to shirts
filled worse the before used to be like
most recent oh this was Twitter's
changed it to the ones that they want
you to see bad seriously i sweet I'm
gonna get onto TweetDeck that's
sequential okay well but it looks like
we have a winner I put in hashtag Cena
alive and I used to be able to just be
like most recent yeah well laser I feel
like you anyway look what
okay oh so it's Diddy tag Bryant on it
okay let's go here all right if you guys
really care about this and you want to
see your your board on the big screen
just do at Bryant ah yeah Lee Waterman
congratulations you are first winner I'm
gonna pick out this really cool pink
case for you with flowers I'm just
kidding we'll figure it out okay I'll
mark all that but the bingo card is real
bingo card is real here it's seen that
live yeah music I'm gonna start just
people might be hurting themselves that
they watch that all right all right so
someone say good morning I don't I never
heard it did someone say good morning
someone say they say good morning I
never heard that did he say the trusses
oh we have to trust hmm there there was
the best we've ever been there's been
like four people it's kind of see the
thing is that there's kind of sometimes
loose interpretations forever right yeah
but good morning we didn't hear it well
we did we would yeah that's fine yeah
I'm gonna believe them trust we trust
mine so their time out watch oh s four
is a great update it'll be available in
fall Tim Cook is coming up on stage the
Developer Preview is available today
it'll be a free upgrade for everyone
across all watches this fall
bottom line watch os4 gets a little
smarter more predictive and helps you
with activity stuff
but that's it nothing that would compel
you to be like what about the Toy Story
watch face alright Linda's not doing as
well
let's not forget the bear the headline
was buried in there I'm sorry I'm sorry
really apologize guys and gals all right
the Mac it looks like the Mac is next up
finally they're jamming through this
stuff which means you know why it's cuz
a lot of hardware stuff coming yeah so
yeah it kind of in a weird way it
probably might be a little disappointing
if they don't focus enough font or if
there's not enough software stuff I
think they might be saving a good chunk
of time for something new yeah you went
ten save the best for last
oh that's a great song by the way
Vanessa Williams oh yeah yeah totally
oh so Kay oh no keep jamming out
it's okay Craig federighi is on stage
Craig Harris Air Force one market on
your bingo card hair Force One let's
talk about okay not yet
they didn't say um uh yeah Mac Craig
federighi yeah he's like he said let's
talk about our current release of Mac OS
Sierra or what we like to call my close
Sierra I need like a classical guitar go
but I mean that's really nothing yeah
you mean a classical or stereotypical I
mean depends on classic it's a classical
guitar type of guitar true I just don't
want all my peeps watching me like
that's racist
that's racist oh the new Matt Goss Mac
OS is called hi no it's not of course oh
really
hi is that for real hi Sierra there's a
photo oh yeah yeah I'm telling ya that's
right Matt goes hi guys Sierra
this is hang on amazing oh this I
actually love it this is it okay so
Shara's just tweeted this point we
talked to the guys and we said this
might be misconstrued but they assured
us this name is fully baked oh sorry
California that's our California it's it
you know legalized this is Apple going
to introduce an apple vape yeah yes it's
a smart play time with Siri final all
are smart vapors out there represented
like yes no it's an Apple pencil vapor
yeah Apple pencil of a pope
each was like yeah okay okay we save
that we're getting we're getting crazy
here already well looky so also by
saying MCOs Mac OS hi Sierra it's not a
significant upgrade right this is going
to be even smaller incremental stuff you
won't see any major new revamps of
features or UI so that also kind of
indicates that they're gonna start off a
little bit with severe safari so I can I
talk right now
but safari is a serene browsing
experience did they really say that oh
yeah it's a card serene we should have
had that on the finger cuts I'm sorry I
didn't think they were bad warranty to
use the word serene in a keynote
described sorry courage or an idiot
serenity now feasts it's like the breed
a pizza here we go this is the best
feature here we now have autoplay
blocking Oh No that's coming to Firefox
- I'm sorry y'all I'm a fan of that the
first I want to keep my job I want to
keep my job but I'm a fan of that I just
I wonder how it works can you opt-in if
you're into that thing I would argue
that gainers it's just check mark check
bug check mark right it's absolutely
it's a check mark because I think that
people are actually getting used to Otto
playing videos although I understand
that for your data connection
it's Bad News Bears I'm gonna say I
ain't not even on Facebook Facebook in I
mean yeah that's Facebook a difference I
expect in a Facebook but it's just like
you know I'm not the biggest fan let's
just put it that way but I get it and
you know what here's the thing
advertisers are gonna have to be more
creative now as more at autoplay
blockers there or guess what just make
awesome content so people don't care
about the ad aspects like seriously
that's all that's how you do it like the
Apple penned video that should autoplay
I think we might if we haven't already
lost half of our viewers we might if we
auto play that crap but I love making it
we might we might um they actually have
more viewers now than we have oh hell
yeah oh no it just oh that's a down
slope no no no just take down when they
showed Brian's face again um collapse
about Mac OS are a little half-hearted
here according to char tip canoes inside
the room a addition to talking about
Safari you there's privacy but your
browsing history is your own so it's not
about blocking ads the web behaves like
it always has Craig federighi is really
just trying to sell us on this
intelligent tracking prevention you know
a lot of people use the
does or desktop the native Mail app for
Mac's so it sounds like there are a lot
of welcome yeah improvements here like
the split view with the compose window
on the right that's very convenient oh
that's interesting
instead of it popping up on top yeah all
right that's that's they also said a
storage space required for mail up to
35% less they're improving faces here
this looks like they're transitioning
over to photos they're going through
this pretty fast facial recognition in
Apple's Photos app they've improved that
when you put efforts into naming people
it's now synchronized automatically
across your devices that's interesting
Felicity but we say conversions I want
to see how affected this is because
Apple photos traditionally has been
really bad at facial recognition it has
at least three instances of me as
separate before oh it has me with no
glasses me with sunglasses and me with
glasses wait wait are you sure I'm three
different people are you sure the phone
is just not detecting that you exist in
the multiverse well it's interesting
because in this picture of the people
there's a girl like blowing a bubble
like a you know bubblegum like how can
it tell how can it read her face based
on the with the bubble in front the eyes
man oh wait where you be chubby Joe the
eyes why are you why are you even
questioning Apple faces technology why
would you question this is amazing that
they would put that behind with these
really really good at it
oh my god guys what printed photo books
oh my god guys Google did this this year
hold on I need I need a remind I need
you to rewind that Apple did that with
iPhoto
oh yes back in maybe arguably 2007 but I
think I think three thousand seventeen
is the resurgence of photo vocalises
girls done it and now apples like haha
guess what we did
everything is cyclical is pegged pants Z
cavariccis
what come on a start I got you bro yeah
z cavalry she coming back
peggy ole pants there's a startup called
chat books that i would say has a
brought back the printed photo book you
laugh but they have like 40 million
dollars in funding man no i there's a
laven of z camera oh i was like
what there's nothing funny about chat
box just look him up
Zeke every to like insane it was like
these like my old like baggy slash
tapered pants that everyone wanted and
the trend might have lasted a year when
you were like in fifth or sixth grade
like harem it was like there's a big
deal
um sixty four-bit top to bottom security
with built-in crash protection native
encryption instant file and directory
cloning there's breaking down how ultra
responsive it is this is stuff that's
happening obviously in the background I
really find it interesting that the
thing that I didn't like when Google
announced photo books recently is that
it was so impersonal like oh the
algorithm does it all for you
it's like you can edit it before you get
a file you can you can but like the
basically with the press of the button
it made the photo book and I don't know
I'm sorry there's a part of me that
likes to like choose the photos myself
even you know I mean how are you are you
all about the IR you say personal
information sure yes I am because I
still haven't printed any not a single
wedding photo from three years ago
if Google is like I got this I would buy
ten different books well this thing they
got it I got this well maybe maybe you
should do your first like my wedding my
friend I'm a millennial yeah I need it
all done for me it's in the cloud it's
in the cloud share know whereabouts in
the cloud
um h.265 high efficiency video coding
will also be a part of this so that's
going to help with graphics overall
graphics GPU performance API for high
performance graphics is metal they
introduced that a while ago a few WWDC s
as well but h.265 2h two five six new
standard saves up to 40% with better
compression and this is also part of
write HD to 4k to 4k HDR
you need better compression to handle
these large files as well as for your
video editors yeah I'm I'm wondering
what we'll see if
yeah we won't see any MacPro stuffy I
mean nothing tells us that we will but
MacPro either end of the year or early
next year since they just started it
they decided to just start that project
earlier this year it's so sad
so yeah the newest Maxie says they
didn't define which ones yet get the
hardware acceleration for new h.265
videos it'll be interesting to see that
their new version of metal 2 graphics
engine a great opposition's tremendous
ap is ten times better draw call
throughput thank God
it's it you know it's always interesting
though no matter what yeah developers
that one let's put it that way
the Mac will never be a go-to gaming
platform and they you know it's okay I
know that yeah they know that okay it's
alright I was got Starcraft on it they
brought back Starcraft that was badass
we got a couple more bingos I do leave
yeah oh my goodness
have you seen all these new ones I'm
just getting old it on TweetDeck oh your
tween tech art fan we got all of our ban
Wynkoop are they are they putting my
more than night guys guys if you want
ping Brian you want to be a part of the
big show you got to put out Bryant on
its who can show it off I got Jimmy
Shafer up in here we got Sammy Jacob
Asadi
we got Hamza juicer week C star Oh got
the bingo I'm black copying people yeah
hurry all you said as reference I was 11
really they did to iOS 11 yet they said
iOS but not iOS 11 that isn't that that
didn't count towards their bingo win
though
oh you're right yeah it doesn't matter
yeah it's it wasn't part of the five
across wow Steven really getting
specific there yeah rules rules baby
you're looking out you're looking out
for sorrow
thanks you did someone take a picture
with the iPad I'm sorry that's all these
days so what you need to police this for
real all right all I need is augmented
reality cool so I'm not gonna win oh
I've kind of lost track of I you know
Dan Ackerman um makes a great point
remember VR and AR are make
reality apps and app development require
very very heavy-duty GPU power and it's
an area that Apple is getting very
seriously into they've built out an
entire team they've had they have
hundreds of engineers working on their
new AR platform which we probably won't
we might hear some about but not in
depth there's been plenty of stories
that Apple is working on some sort of an
AR type of glasses but it still a ways
out so for them to be competitive with
what is happening and how things are
changing because look it's not gonna
happen this year it's not gonna happen
in three years it might happen in three
years but there's going to be a point
where the phone is we wait we won't even
eat our phones there will be a point not
anytime soon soon but you know whether
it's our watch our glasses that'll be
the new phone there's gonna be a point
where are we implanted into our face oh
my god it's gonna take a while for
glasses to become mainstream really and
it's going to be acceptable because we
saw the backlash against Google glass
spectacles we really they didn't sell
that many at all they're sold at less
than a hundred thousand units oh really
yeah so that's what they it is that well
I mean their marketing campaign really
shot in the foot they've made a lot of
hype but then it made them really
difficult to access obviously and so
when the I when the company went public
and the IPO came out they had sales
figures and then in like the last two
quarters basically since they were were
tracking sales it was less than a
hundred thousand I was like ninety six
thousand or something hey bro uh can you
go to my screen real quick here Steve
yep
the guy corner from NYC said de Brian's
Hong really bring up Z cavariccis
hahaha wait a minute those are cute I
would wear the ones in the middle I'll
bring it on taking you back I'm taking
you back those are back man they are
everything's coming back I told you
cyclical pigpen pay peg pick your pants
all right high sierra available today
for developers public beta in june you
know what's also interesting though
about the um oh no my brain literally
just farted yeah oh the the augmented
reality glasses
thanks for the fart sound effect i
appreciate that uh if there's it sounds
kooky but if there's any space where
apple can surprise us like you said
google glass look
horrible and they they were trying to
sell a beta product which was not what
it was you know Google learning from
their mistakes
snapchat glasses not so great let's say
in two years Apple drops it an actual
pair of glasses that not only look
stylish but can do things we care about
they might be the company that might be
there next thing like I could see it
right how things have lined up no one's
really mastered it yet hololens awesome
but still too big I'm not
yeah hololens um magically we don't know
where they're really at with that maybe
that's looking down the line somewhere
that Apple could actually make a dent
and be like oh thanks I got it they got
us back again
and I don't know but I'm saying just how
things are lined up yeah it's early and
there's a lot of other companies doing a
our glasses that are really quite
exciting and quite good but these are
really for applications that are
industrial they use foreign governments
and they're not useful for consumers at
all like you're not going to drop three
and a half thousand dollars on a pair of
AR glasses that you can't do anything
with because there's no consumer
application right so Apple could
possibly get that yeah while we're
hanging out and talking it looks like
they're talking about new hardware for
the iMac they're jumping over to max
this is a we did not expect to see IMAX
itself but they're going to be putting
in the best Mac displays ever 500 nits
measure brightness 43 percent brighter
10 bit did the rain 1 billion colors
they will be loaded with the seventh gen
Intel Core KB Lake processors this is a
lot of people asked about IMAX and we
didn't expect to see them here today but
KB Lake is coming to the iMac family the
21.5 inch will get up to 32 gigs larger
size can have up to 64 gigs of memory
fusion drive is standard on all
configurations and solid-state drive
options up to 50% faster and 2 terabytes
ooh
iMac lovers are going to love this and
look USB ports at the back not USB see
or do they have both giving up oh yeah
yeah but but they're not going exactly
Sibley USB seems interesting to see good
is an interesting thing to USB see hey
you guys still tuning in okay second oh
no we're just checking with still e
we're still there oh we don't
hi max Clyde it wasn't on the radar
which is great this is do we talk about
surprises
we don't surprise you um and they're
time out the faster graphics up to 80
percent faster performance the
entry-level iMac will get an Intel iris
plus graphics chip let's see what they
talk about the higher-end one that
there's a 21.5 inch iMac with a retina
4k display it's also going to be moving
over to discreet graphics AMD ready
Radeon Pro it there's a type of it's
Radeon not radio but you know they're
typing ly fast radio Pro Radeon pro 5
555 and 560 new system is three times
faster graphics and lastly their 27-inch
iMac Radeon Pro of 570 and 575 yeah up
to eight gigs of VRAM 5k display as
usual on the large screen 27-inch iMac
and it was great yeah the discreet
graphics is a big day yes and also on an
iMac yeah on an iMac is huge deal and
also talking about the direct quote is a
great platform for VR content creation
uh-oh
yeah bad very sure make sure what the is
that an oculus next to it or what would
be our I've I've I've I've Aviva Aviva
vive um Industrial Light Magic's John
Knoll is coming to stage to talk about
how the power of the new iMac will aid
in this process he says I've always done
my art and development on a Mac this is
interesting because you know right now
people for the most part people aren't
using Mac's for this type of production
content I don't know if there are too
late in the game where you're gonna see
people yeah I know they use Mac's for
you know for design for graphics um you
know even the graphics and for the video
games but actual building VR stuff other
than you know you're wrapping up your
360 videos and whatnot it's not like the
professional industry is saying the Mac
is the platform to choose for VR content
creation I haven't heard that yet no
it's right up there with Mac's not being
the best platform for playing games yep
yeah but I would I mean is there a
correlation between now if max can
handle VR production does this also mean
that they may be able to hand
handle games a little bit better than
they have true mm-hmm it just depends if
developers exact job on board I'm on
board that's true well the discrete
graphics is definitely gonna help a lot
there and we're seeing some actual VR
demos on stage looks like it looks like
they're saying that this HTC vive rig is
actually for the first time all powered
by a Mac that's awesome
oh that's they're only showing vibe
hardware there's no mention of oculus or
any other VR brand right now but they
did say that it is being all powered by
a Mac I think earlier they did talk
about unity and unreal but I don't know
if oculus was name checked there no I
didn't see oculus I did see unity in
unreal
have you guys tried the Star Wars demo
for the vibe oh it is amazing it's
incredible and if they can get that
going on an iMac
that's huge she beat him and I spent a
lot of time with each other so I'll say
things that he's heard five times and
he'll say things that I've heard five
times like that it's a true III didn't
want to fake and be like oh no tell me
more about it
yeah all right so they're showing a demo
of um on stage of her in a virtual world
being run it's a looks like it just it's
some Star Wars I don't know what planet
there looks like um Vader Darth Vader's
uh headquarter his home base yeah where
he recharges you can see his tower in
the background okay great so all you
need now is to buy a new iMac so you can
enjoy VR this is a VRS problem you have
to have so much equipment and it's so
expensive to get it off the ground
that's but I mean is this is this demo
necessarily targeted towards hey now you
can do VR oh is it more like hey
developers hey Studios right yes all
right
we now have support and it's gonna be
easy to do it and it's gonna be actually
functional right they're throwing in TIE
fighter there she's she's basically in
this virtual world and throwing in
iconic Star Wars vehicles ships Darth
Vader and having fun playing with it fun
this is the demo time man let me see if
anyone wow that's pretty cool guys looks
like he's in Hawaii Darth Vader's in
Hawaii right now well since our on the
Mac I'm just gonna take this call real
fast hopefully Aaron is ready to roll
from Indianapolis Aaron I know that
you're watching the keynote and you're
hanging with us we're gonna take your
call real quick what's up welcome seen
alive uh how y'all doing today doing
great
what's up nothin less'n just watching
the keynote right now and actually on
like a little iPhone 6 so yeah but
anyways I'm just curious about our if
that was going to bring great bass
coming to the iPhone I hope so I hope so
but guess what that would be so cool
they didn't show it in Mac in their demo
Mac OS they never mentioned it there at
all to me that's a psycho feature that
should be on both Mac OS and iOS and
because they didn't put it there it may
not but maybe they'll surprise maybe
they decided for some reason only make
it mobile and which would be really bad
to you so yeah but we'll see so we just
wanted to jump in real quick since
they're just kind of hanging out with VR
right now but thanks for calling we
appreciate you waiting so long yeah no
problem I I've been watching you guys to
show since the beginning I've been an
apple I've been an Apple fan first for
so long and I love you guys were two
even individually and stuff like that
and uh Alexis should be the next series
voices are out showing their voice is
amazing so yes hey hey Aaron I can't
help you but give her her Twitter handle
but not phone number Twitter handle I
know
oh it's okay I'm single for a long time
it's alright
hey bro single mingle love yourself love
yourself right exactly exactly awesome
alright thanks so much man thanks for
calling
alright problem all right we will get
back into this keynote here um again
they're kind of just going over the
specs of the matte IMAX the 21.5 inch
entry-level starts at 1099 the 21.5 inch
4k starts at $12.99 and
they have we have not seen the
announcement of the high-end uh Mac yet
oh here we go $17.99 for the iMac retina
5k 27 inch okay you know it's not as
high as I thought it would be yeah you
know what it is though once you load it
right like more ram you'll throw up
another you know six seven hundred bucks
and on there also it looks like we're
going total Mac refresh KB Lake is also
coming to the MacBooks so get ready you
can also mark your bingo card I mean I
like it we have 14 winners for our bingo
card so you have a pretty high chance of
a single we got a lot of bingo has
already happening I can see them all all
right um so just for your record
according to Shara Apple cuts the price
of the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro
from - $12.99 which is $200 less than it
used to be that's a much more reasonable
price and a great entries for students
13-inch with again a physical physical
barbar Bunga yeah yeah function function
keys volume brightness that makes so
much more sense thank you oh yeah
for coming to your senses Apple okay
so originally $14.99 now $12.99 for the
non touch MacBook Pro non touch bar
MacBook Pro it's good I would recommend
that highly already yeah that makes me
wonder what if anything is going to
happen with the MacBook Air because now
those two are getting a little close
more than just the regular old MacBook
right where is that gonna fit into I
mean this that's the 12 inch that's the
super skinny the Super Max getting you
on the gold when it comes in the gold
finishes well it's so beautiful it's
just not powerful enough for me to
actually give it a shot it's so light
though is it is lighter than it's a
beauty no doubt no doubt
oh it's called the iMac pro iMac oh man
wait what is that exactly - hang on yet
another product yes I know
online so to your point more redundancy
yeah so is this well we don't know
exactly because we're not listing this
but are they saying this is separate
from the iMac 5k this is a its own beast
yes it is a different thing you'll first
notice it's the same great design as our
27-inch iMac but it's seriously AB a -
space grey finish oh that's cool
that is cool Scott sign sense it's an
iMac but badass alright looks like
they're gonna jump into the video right
now it's cool because the information
that we get inside actually comes out
before the actual yeah we go just before
so we just get it a few moments before
so we can talk about it and you guys can
all watch it which is why you could do
both so they have they showed a mouse
that was like Space Gray is this space
great this one I think this one is yes
that is space grace that new MacBook Pro
that you're rubbing and like bragging
about no I've already scratch it is
quite scrub it is it's fair I don't know
how it got scratched but it just did
wonder if you can bump it out so they're
talking about performance into this new
iMac pro the team had to rethink the
thermal architecture it's greater the
increase greater than an 80% increase in
cooling capacity will ship with an 8
core Intel Xeon processor Oh daddy like
run bro I got I bought I bought the
first iMac uh the new 27-inch iMac I was
crying when they released the 5k display
like a little I think wait hours around
this and I'm like you Jeff but this iMac
Pro in this piece I have a prole I have
an iMac I'm gonna stop iMac pro oh just
move it on the nightshirt Sharon this
this is a brain this is a worm in your
brain that will not leave for the next
week it hurts it does hurt um it's also
going to ship with a freaking 10 core
Xeon processor model if you want Wow
and AMD's Radeon Vega graphics and a
cool little swirly animation that looks
cool up to 18 cores ok they kind of went
crazy though 16 gigs of VRAM video Ram
I told him all right so is this to tide
us over until the Mac Pro comes out
probably 18 core zealand processor that
since I want to see a side-by-side
comparison of this versatile Pro yeah
here's the thing right the garbage they
they this the the fact that this exists
is because they wanted to ignore the Mac
Pro race was the replacement basically
saying for them not doing any updates
the Mac Pro this is better than the pro
then the Pro is gone why do we need the
prize all those poor people that well
the reason why is because there's still
a lot of use I want to customize
external cards video cards audio cards
and different wanted to configure
options other than that mmm-hmm so this
is the thing I think the pro the power
on this is like damn this is sick but
then you're like well I don't most
people that need this much power need
more expandability yeah so it's it's
gonna catch me it's a little lot it's a
little it's a tweener
it's a tweener but I think that someone
like me who kind of got over the fact
that a Mac Pro isn't gonna exist in the
way that I wanted to would be answered
in this but then now that but are you
gonna wait a year plus for the new Mac
Pro you'll get this I think some people
gonna buy this actually exactly plus
it's Oh first time ever 1080p FaceTime
camera 1080p
FaceTime camera give me four eight years
was um you could change the settings
yeah I can just put a piece of scotch
tape over the power of this iMac you
could theoretically hook up to 5k
displays and to raid arrays for the hard
drive so it has it looks like on the
back here for standard USB and then for
Thunderbolt so there again this is the
iMac Pro this is again it you know
exactly what Apple is thinking for the
longest time and why they were ignoring
the Mac Pro which is kind of sad it is
you know they come out with this okay
that's it it makes it kind of like for
people that are pro users they're like
exactly it's a stab okay what about
talking crosswise I really want to know
if we kid it out fully to the extent
that we can make it I want raisi as
possible whoa we got the press oh you're
the beat you to it I'm gonna wait hold
on $17.99 was the iMac pride am I
looking at it is it like $24.99 starting
no I think it's gonna be thirty seven
ninety-nine
what is it a no four nine nine nine oh I
just want doodoo in my pants that's not
gonna happen
that's quite a bit okay available in
December and that's the configuration
with the 5k display the eight core not
even that's the minimum goes that's the
eight core cool that's just the eight
core minimal entry 32 gigs memory one
terabyte essence one caribou yeah
tanking right like Ethernet this is five
grand and we're gonna put a to this the
look I'm not here to hate but I'm gonna
this doesn't make sense for most people
that's the point yeah there's an
honorable thing its foot game is it's
for people that I do your developer
developers intensive applications right
and that's so Dan and Dan Ackerman says
that this is actually a good price for
what you're getting he reviews gaming
laptops that cost more or as my oh yes
I'm not yelling that makes sense alright
alright it's a steal oh hey I'm I I
think it's cool I the Space Gray to make
it pro dude this is like if a company is
buying it for you oh yeah oh
I go by this with my own money mm-hmm I
mean me ya know I'm gonna enroll in
school just so I can get that discount I
mean for you young people that want this
it's time to go ramen dinner ramen
breakfast Robin lunch yeah you had a few
spices a lot a meal the chicken cost
money that togarashi little flavoring
about mana a little Orochi
that costs money that's not a bad point
there the student discount 10% for
serious you enroll in the three units
okay it's gonna cost you a couple
hundred dollars you save five hundred
let's go let's go let's get let's get

drawer so absolutely accessible right
there at the bottom of the screen this
is gonna be interesting
look a lot of this stuff is going to
hint because of the form factor of the
new iPhone will change and most likely
not have any type of physical home
button we've got to see some sort of
hints to that here getting people ready
getting that is actually kind of useful
when I'm afraid when I do like swipes
it's gonna be a problem yeah okay all
right iCloud looks like the big story
with mess
is that messages in iCloud will now be
synchronized when you sign into the
service I'm pretty sure they already are
I thought yeah I'm thinking it takes a
little while but it does sync huh I mean
I don't know if there are maybe are they
over viewing yeah we were not oh end
they stay in sync maybe that's the
difference oh so it's not loading it
back loaded yes most likely and also
like live syncing B yeah and when there
is a delay in which you haven't signed
into a device for a long time it has the
last history rather than the most
current messages maybe that's what
they're referring you're real talk the
real talk be careful what you put on
your iMessage uh real talk be careful
what devices you sign into with your
iTunes account real talk
live syncing everybody real talk turn it
off clear your photos immediately I'm
like I like uh yeah last we will talk
2-step authentication hey Beecher why is
your face red Beecham's not even in this
conversation his face is red not when I
was homesick on Friday and someone
logged into my computer at my desk and I
got a notification on my phone I'm like
what what happened I wanted like call
someone to be someone on my computer but
then I was just like just forget it
whatever ah but at least they give you a
notification of that I guess but if you
have messages pulled up as an app but I
thought I'd turn it off it might have
been like some update sometimes you have
to turn that stuff off I'm telling you
to step authentication people do it okay
here's the big thing started jump in
Apple is now offering pay to pay
person-to-person payments Apple now Bank
Apple you know Apple Wallet Apple pay
yeah didn't completely take off so who
said I think I use Apple pay a lot
actually is an untapped market there and
it's really this is really a part of
Apple's big push into obviously p2p
payments is huge but they really want to
kind of replace banks eventually I want
to see it happening I can see it happen
well the cool thing is you can do it
directly in the message out well I want
to know if it's like venmo where it
holds your money in this virtual account
you have to cash out of I hate that that
that seems to mean you'd like it to just
transfer directly to what - I wonder you
just log into your bank account that's
how I don't know maybe yours much
differently you have to enforce it out
yeah yes I wonder though if that's a
function that is agreed on with like the
banks it's like there's someone that's
putting that roadblock that you still
have to physically move it from this
platform into our bank like for whatever
reason right now yeah is there any way
to finance right other than working
directly to your bank square lets you do
it do you like to be like 50 cents okay
but it is what you did well that's gonna
be interesting to see how thank you baby
works well I'm okay with just doing it
myself I gotta pay 50 cents I mean it's
worth it so next up here we go they're
going to talk about Siri more than 375
million active devices use it monthly
being baked into the messages app okay
hold on I think they're jumping out how
many times it said baked today yeah
they're making it a big upgrade to it
that's Siri voice we're used we've used
deep learning to make it more natural so
employees I want to know what Siri
sounds like now Siri has a great new
visual interface as well we'll pry it up
provide follow-up answers with just a
tap that's a classic Google feature oh
yeah follow up answers and translation
which is also another classic Google
feature yes coming in strong translation
and entering that interesting
interesante they can transition
initially English to Chinese French
German and Spanish right now Siri
translation is in beta according to this
Scott Steinman he puts beta in
parenthesis Sirikit can down new more
than ever with iOS 11 you can do task
management in OmniFocus as third-party
app connections bring up a QR code and
WeChat Siri not only understands your
voice it understands the context we've
heard this before from other company so
we're gonna try and figure out what more
can do that again they need to play more
catch-up than I don't think they're
going to come out with some
groundbreaking thing they see
smarter play catch up yeah help help us
make a calendar appointment based on
something we booked on the web Google
does that or just automatically does
that yeah have it you know what's clear
though is that when you have the Google
app on the Google assistant now an
iPhone it it goes into your email and it
says your package is being shipped and
it gets the notification to you before
you get the email
oh that's I happen to be no like creepy
so it's using the tracking so ladies
just a quick thing I'm assuming we'll
see a lot more in the series speaker but
that's all they talked about Siri that's
it they're jumping over to camera
already which is kind of interesting so
we'll still have like theoretically an
hour to go oh just an hour I want more
time with you don't you want more time
with me so anyway so you know back to
keynote so next to the camera our
customers now take one trillion photos
per year take a lot of video oh
interesting it looks like they're doing
rolling out a new image format for
basically compressing your images so
they take up less space but still have
the same quality presumably it'll be
interesting it's cost good HEV C for
videos
hei F for photos so everyone who for
some reason bought a 16 gigabyte iPhone
yeah even though we the three of us here
we told you not to do this I start
please you'll be happy we worked for
this website called Sina at least if you
don't listen to anything we say just
don't get the 16 gig iPhone just don't
do that no it's not needed uh-oh okay
here we go this is something interesting
now so they're talking about depth
information and this is what I was
talking about with the dual cameras on
the 7 plus yeah it's got to be something
extra here so they're starting to hint
at capturing the depth from the two
cameras with the depth API oh the depth
API okay well so for now Scott's saying
the depth API will allow the dual lens
portrait mode to roll out to other apps
not just for
that's cool and that was hopefully
something that it's expected however
well I want to see more they're also
they're also talking about with iOS 11
you can take low-light photographs using
HDR so sorry even more so low light
while using that high dynamic range
that's interested in our how well that's
alright yeah see you in the pudding
right like HDR now is really generally
only full like in his bright situation
so you have enough light in order to
take a couple of different exposures at
once so if you're in low light
keeping that stable is gonna be a tricky
job without a tripod I'm not gonna hate
no but it sounds almost made up it's
like I'm you know you go like oh we just
you know we turn on the HDR while it's
low light like oh how does that work
you're not gonna get a camera shaking
yeah it's gonna I don't see me
interesting I believe it though there I
believe it I believe it I just like to
mess with them so it sounds like
portrait is coming to movies as well as
life so motifs perhaps okay now this is
all hinting that and maybe it was
obvious already but if it wasn't before
it is now that all of the next iPhones
will have dual cameras yeah just type in
iPhone 8 camera you'll see every you'll
see every image possible what do we
think of also like the move to portrait
vertical video so they're talking about
you can now watch the effect in portrait
mode why are we moving towards vertical
video here beautiful two things that's
how we're just doing it now I think it
sounds ridiculous but people do not want
to rotate their phone are lame I will
not rotate my phone I will not rotate my
phone I will not rotate my phone oh it
has a lot to do with so social media I
believe and YouTube's doing that now to
where you can go full screen with though
no with an upright phone it's just it's
just following consumers behaviors you
know true whether we like it or not I
don't want to admit that's the case cuz
it makes me sad it makes me it hurts me
inside someone that likes to take photos
that and watch video I think we should
see yeah yeah now I think we should just
mess with people in the understand what
they're doing we're gonna do the next
live show in vertical video
and you're gonna be pissed we should
know we should have beach and put some
light I don't know how it even do it you
know we could cast just like just like a
title cart no and so yeah we just could
put blinders on both sides to be like
this be like this dude I want that
should we go do that when you go to the
movie theater you're gonna be like oh oh
my god it's so wide and then everybody
will go back to movie theaters again
that's true it's a conspiracy they're
doing by doing they're doing a new a
control center update now this looks
interesting it looks like a lot of stuff
is going on I don't know if you have a
screen of this Beecham but it looks like
there's a music player
there's your utilities it's almost like
widget II widget style
it looks Center is such a mess yeah I
keep you know what I keep deafening
myself every time I'm listening to music
and I'm trying to access something from
the control center slapping across and
then accidentally swiping all the way
totally I do that all the time contain
this control center does not look it
looks more jumbled like I see the big
panels with that thing right there that
shot right there yeah that right there
yeah the eyes just glaze over when I why
can't the music player just be a
rectangle that is a cross a strength a
strip instead of like a box in the
corner without swiping it's too much
thing user interface design is something
that Apple usually gets very right but
looking at that is very confusing
fumbling all over themselves with the
Apple watch though so to me he's right
in line
damn hashtag real talk um the you you
can 3d touch the control center to go
directly into them for more detail like
it'll pop them up that's what we saw
when Wyatt Wyatt goes into the large
screens like do you know how many people
I I just love doing this showing people
3d touch for the first time no they have
it I'm like push it in like oh wow God
like I was I am still am I was all about
3d touch but it's like people don't know
slash use it and it's you know part of
moving things forward is changing the
behavior of how people do things right
now people are comfortable using at
least in the US long long ago in Asia
it's already been done using their
phones as wallets right that is taken
time for people to get used to that
a view this whole 3d touch thing it
because not all apps can use it it's not
truly again consistent like people don't
use it don't know where to use it when
to use it the only time I use 3d touch
to two main things when a message
notification pops up
I can push right into it right so it
doesn't take over my screen anymore and
then Shazam I don't want to open this
damn I'm like oh it's just like Lissa
peek and pop on a Shazam and then just
pick and pop pick and pop that's the
phone they called it pick it up yeah so
when I go like this think about like a
pop big aha Vica pick up a pop OH
where's Pikachu oh I thought we were
gonna see something rude endo related Oh
still come um how many of you use
memories I look at that crap all the
time yeah all the time
memories have you ever not really that
often well you know I'm gonna I'm gonna
say just try looking at it you know
maybe try once a month and I think
you'll end up using it more than you
think
probably like I probably cuz I have
nieces and nephews and you know let me
milady go out like to some cool place
and then I look I'm like I'm not like
saving the video but I'm looking at him
yeah right are ya I'm looking at him why
me Brian
I thought you didn't want Google and
Apple to curate these things forever you
are the number one photobook is
different photo books is different
that's like hard to me if it's virtual
it's okay well it's like a video sure
because I'm lazy for sure yeah like I'm
not gonna edit a video of like what
happened in my yeah at the winery or
something but if it's a book like some
like if I gave you a gift as a book yeah
and you knew that I just pressed one
button to make it that's like heartless
that is heartless
there's no soul in that where's that
which is the damn soul fair enough
that's a good that's all I'm saying all
right but I agree your point was
actually well made I just needed take it
to the next level I love watching these
like after a vacation or a little trip
or something these are a lot of fun to
watch I would say if you have kids yes
yeah I've slammed on looks like thank
God or food your food or bird shots
those are my babies
yeah
yeah Google was doing this a long time
ago though but Apple is doing it too
it's pretty much exactly the same almost
down to the font and the music seriously
yeah because they can yeah I mean the
Facebook ripped off snapchat in five
different ways this is just the new
internet this works the new norm
everything's gonna be the same not
proprietary live stream from everywhere
that's true and it looks like they've
also ripped off boomerang because there
was a factory you can loop and reverse
give them gifs as you and this is why
you haven't heard a mention of the
oculus because Facebook is Apple's one
of Apple's biggest competitors so I mean
yeah they're just gonna rip off their
features one by one exactly other quick
things um they didn't go into it too
in-depth but they said let's talk about
stickers and I immediately kept
scrolling nothing on stickers map maps
has a mail mode in the new maps detailed
floor oh sorry Malmo carries sorry yeah
detailed floor plans of malls we let you
browse by floor malls in Boston Chicago
and Hong Kong um can we get this for the
CES convention please oh yeah can we get
this for the CNET office yeah yes please
well this is something that Google Maps
does yeah indoor indoor mapping is been
a thing that people talk about for a
while but now you know Apple Maps let me
let me speculate a little bit here
specky let's gets Becky a are this is
lame Robert that's true
there we go that's all integration I
like it they're also talking about
kobold sharra just mentioned carplay
real real briefly so people have had
been asking us on the podcast a lot
about you know what's going on with
carplay and it's so going on with hey
what is going on we wanted to bring the
same level of safety to everyone who
doesn't have one of the kinds of cars
that has carplay okay here's what's
going on with carplay either you are you
have purchased a new car that happens to
be carplay compatible in the last couple
years and you have it or you don't
that's all that's why we haven't heard
much about it because I mean I don't
know anybody using I don't know anyone
as in the car this is no car I was in a
rental car with carplay in it and it was
still weird to use like you're still
touching in it still you just want to
get your phone out and do exactly the
same thing as you don't want to do on
the screen it's not as efficient as they
would like I just want to be able to
mirror my phone that's all yeah because
using your phone exactly the way you
would when you're not driving while you
are driving is a very safe idea oh wait
wait hold on you make a point
wait well so here's the thing in carplay
they did add a feature called do not
disturb while driving so that you won't
be I guess alerted retracted by
notifications that you no matter what
are going to press even though yes once
in a while you do that while you're
driving I'm sorry it happens it is not
safe don't do I don't recommend it but
one thing I find interesting is that
with Android Androids car platform the
phone when you plug it in basically
becomes completely useless and stuff is
done on the screen and we're right now
in carplay your i your iphone plugging
the system you could still use it like
it's still active which is very
distracting right but you know yeah so
um this do not disturb mode is maybe a
way that they are addressing it but it
works to say you know it's working the
same stop sign is saying it I wonder how
well it works with the Apple watch is it
the same does it talk to it we'll see oh
that's a good question I'm going to move
on a home kit now uh announced in 2014
for the record there's always a market
section there's a long time ago
there's oh is something happening about
speakers there's one here's here's the
setup yeah here it is one category
really close to our heart that we wanted
to add to home kit that's speakers ah I
just want to see your price I want to
see when it's available I want to see
what it looks like
rumors have said Oh Jimmy groom storage
can I know the joke was they're gonna
repurpose the Mac Pro shells them into
the speaker that's exactly how I
imagined change it so it's a fabric
grill Bravo
Oh totally that's totally I mean they
they got to do something with all that
extra mess
yeah and it's not a speaker it's it's
talking about controlling speakers with
airplay - yeah turning up volume through
a new airplay protocol which gives more
finite control over that on a single
panel oh can you airplay to multiple
speakers that aren't necessarily the
same brand it says right here multiple
room audio supporting iOS 11 that's
great there you go thank you very much
you're willing to 'the was never able to
overcome this challenge so it makes
sense for airplay to tackle it
wow that's great hmm do I have any
airplay speakest but if you buy beats oh
here's that here's a nice thing they
just added now your Apple TV can be
played too from an iOS device or Mac
anywhere in the home so you're able to
from what it looks like
your Apple TV can be seen on any like on
your Mac screen on your iOS screen so
that wasn't the case before no like I
couldn't mirror a you mirror from your
macbook to your Apple TV but what if
from what I'm reading what if you wanted
to mirror your Apple TV and have that
sit back experience like at your Haute
you know yeah on your computer screen
like an Apple TV talking your Apple TV
to your MacBook screen oh like in a
different room of your house would you
want that I think it's kind of cool
actually
I'd want that as long as you can have
multiple instances of Apple TV yeah like
it's like different different videos
from different rooms right yeah the
multi audio right Chris jumps in here
multi-room audio control is going to be
a major crowd-pleaser right now just go
by oh yeah please make this a reality oh
yeah by the end of this keynote I'm like
seven thousand dollars deep drop five
grand on it I'm mad yeah we should maybe
do something like that like what do I
want from the keynote and just keep on
adding have a running total I'm telling
it's just like alright Apple music time
I'll be pumped guys mm-hm they now have
27 million customers I don't it doesn't
look like those are
I'm not sure if those are paid yeah
looks like paid subscribers as of
December earlier that our last year
Apple had over 20 million so they moved
up to 27 million if I recall use Spotify
it 50 or 60 million 50 million last time
I checked yeah combined 50 million pains
yes correct that's not combined so yeah
the total of all Spotify users is higher
Yeah right okay
Apple music they're talking about this
and Phil Schiller is going to be coming
up to stage with their kind of new
revamps to Apple music you know what I
really want to that sucks
it totally sucks yeah I really want to
say just a better-looking iTunes device
clean I change you got everything they
just break it out make it clean up make
it seamless make Apple music look better
yeah it's not that hot don't be that hot
though it is
I'm it is it's hard it takes we've seen
this historically over a span of six to
ten years it's hard clearly Jilla oh but
we can't tell if his voice cracks I know
yes so I'm please tweet us and let us
know I'm just gonna mark it cuz I
guarantee you it happens once it's on
the bingo card for a reason it really is
just gets excited guy he really does oh
we have a reference to Pokemon bad with
people in Hong Kong playing Pokemon go
still so ya know I've seen people
playing I don't I hope you have they
still going oh
[Laughter]
yeah yeah scott stein said pink pokemons
go bingo card checked off we do not put
on the bingo diet on here but maybe it's
on his 1 maybe yeah he won his own
personal one that has just tears on it
he's had he had I Mac Pro $4,999 you
really didn't want to check that box off
so Apple is highlighting the fact that
their App Store is a trusted and safe
place for all users we know that this
past year has been a very tumultuous one
when it comes to vulnerabilities and
hacks so Apple this is Apple's chance to
reassure everyone that they've had their
App Store locked down for a long time
here's the thing that developers are
most likely going to cheer about we
can't listen in faster app review times
a majority of apps are now reviewed
under 24 hours most in one to two hours
that's pretty good cuz that's a while
ago a while ago for developers I mean
they were complaining like they didn't
hear anything for like days yeah and
they're like what's going on with my app
so so I wonder good I know how big that
team is or if they have robots doing it
now that's a lot of apps to approve it
is we've been one to two hours yeah but
hey 100 billion dollars in revenue
they've got to invest in it that's where
that's where their income is so Scott
Stein is chiming in that this is a
really fast paced keynote I would agree
it's like one more thing it looks like
they're now doing phased releases so
when you submit an app you can choose if
you want it to be phased in over time so
you don't overload your infrastructure
and your servers all at once so you know
when there's a big release to an app
this is actually quite useful yep it you
know everyone's like slamming especially
in this new iOS update or something like
that is probably the most common thing I
can think about it's just not like being
slammed so everyone's trying to get at
the same time so if you're a developer
and you want your app to go out not
everyone is going to be hitting your
servers at the same time so hopefully
would reduce load and make a better
experience and I think that's a smart
think developers would hopefully react
well to that this is also interesting
they're going to do a complete redesign
to the App Store complete it starts with
a brand new tab called two-day guys it
looks like Apple music yeah came to that
yes yes you know what's harder about
this look at how look at that that
redesign I'm ever paid for that top spot
paid a lot of money because you're
literally looking at one freaking app
yeah oh
they showed injustice to dope I'm all
about that anything like so now it's
like oh we're games were an injustice to
dope no but look it from a Content
standpoint if the today tab you see one
app that's got let's do do real
experience yeah hey no you're right
though that's a that's a money spot
right there it is and that's you know
there there has to be something about
the organic nature of finding stuff that
surfaces the top that's not going to be
like Oh top downloaded based on major
XYZ Monument Valley is a known thing you
know injustice too is a known thing all
these things are showing Airbnb I've
never heard of that app but like it's
like out you know I I like getting
exposed to stuff that like you may not
have known about or just show me more
than one tile exact like come on it's an
app store oh no it is the app store like
the one app store once done you're not
gonna you're not buying death Road to
Canada down here I don't know I really
don't need 99 credits under the section
of prep for zombies zombie apocalypse
alright is part of the app review
process I can make up my own app
category alright Wow
oh I just it looks too much like Apple
me they were like you spend more time
I'm just I'm just saying this doesn't
this isn't compelling though for me to
like click around it's one tile exactly
I go in and I go I'm not interested in
this top app I'm not gonna scroll by how
many times you want to scroll you yeah
you might because you're like wait
that's only one what else is there so
you're like well I'm here like you can
scroll sideways on see like there's two
rows that you can even scroll through on
the colonel
you'll do that but it's further down
it's buried underneath that top slot
right there which is the today which is
probably going to be things like yo-yo
okay how many apps can I find from here
like I can find apps on apps okay apps
on apps I got one app one it's called
App Store for a reason yeah some like we
said I would say I would argue though
that if you use snapchat or Instagram
stories or anything like that you might
already be accustomed to one thing at a
time and then diving into the experience
more so maybe they're taking a page out
of that design book but even sap shots
of branded content you can look at a lot
of different things that's true yeah
yeah like it's all about a mrs. Joe mom
is still big blocks lately snapchats
interface sucks we bring hotties really
Wow like after two three years using it
you're still wondering where's but but
you're still using it ish no yes
oh man okay well that's the App Store
like I have to say you know justjust
going back to money spent on the App
Store and whatnot I have definitely over
the years become more comfortable
spending more money really yeah on
digital goods like apps I think that if
they offer enough utility I mean you
know we spend art so much of our time on
our phones so why not invest in that
time I'm kind of interesting because
we're talking about the app experience
on the App Store I'm very much a person
that I go in I kind of I've read about
an app somewhere else and I'll going to
download that one specific app and I
generally weren't spend time exploring
and seeing what else is out there
because I don't like the experience of
just aimlessly browsing you know I
wasn't exploring sorry this is gonna
make me even less to turn right to go
and die and find you I should just
acquire product because they have it
figured
yeah what's the first thing you do when
you go to app store I usually go to top
free look at the list free right and see
what there is I just go to injustice -
yeah where are you searching whatever
you want I just I just do that top free
is like Facebook YouTube um the record
I'm not not being paid by injustice - or
Warner Brothers for the record emotion -
yeah damn amazing game okay on to the
next why hold on
I do have 20 bucks with the from Warner
Bros in my pocket right now okay okay so
yeah I don't know that that app store
thing as a developer who's trying to get
your app discovered I think you're
probably even more frustrated when you
see that interface right now yeah oh
yeah it's funnier I just wrote exactly
what I said I only head to the App Store
to download apps I already know I want
and he's wondering how many people
actually use it to discover new apps oh
but they do did you know you ever wanted
Angry Birds I did it no I and and me was
a bad experiment to take part of it so
it looks like they're wrapping up they
really spent a lot of time out of
everything again it's for developers
this is a developer school on the App
Store I I'm I wanna I'm actually really
curious I don't know if we have any
developers that are watching this right
now with us um will prompt it but at the
end of the show I want to hear what
developers thought think about this yeah
cuz they're the ones that are gonna be
the most affected by this I'm really
curious so I'll throw out a tweet also
just to see if people can let us know
what they think about that alright
federighi is back
herefore is one back on stage alright so
yay let's talk about machine learning
there we go
getting smart here we go this is what we
want this is what we've been asking for
it's the way that we will get a cohesive
consistent experience across platforms
but let's see how else to use it don't
let us down
yeah please don't make this like don't
make it another redesigned apps to all
these machine learning has helped us
redesign App Store the surface exactly
what content you want for that one
my goodness okay so we have machine
learning powering face tracking
detection this is you know Google
launched or announced Google lense
at Google i/o last month and that's very
much also machine learning what can what
can we get out of this photo and how can
we tie it to things that we know so your
face is one of those things that can be
recognized and identified so what is
Apple doing with this I don't know but
it sounds like they have they're
announcing an API which will allow
developers to use it however they like
so bring on the space swap apps yeah
yeah here's the thing when I see all
this stuff is like honestly and they'll
have to prove it to us with how they
apply it is that believin better than
Google at doing these things you're
better at snapchat yeah seriously like
then this is again you know companies
have certain wheelhouses that they're
experts in and no matter what you can't
be an expert in everything I think
that's been proven you just can't be an
expert in everything so with this
technology they have it's more about how
they use it within a platform but is it
actually when it comes down to us the
end-user is it actually better than
what's out there exactly and just
quickly I know they're diving into a on
right now but I want to know how this
processing is done because I know Apple
in the past has made a big deal about
all this processing is done on camera or
the facial recognition to power like
grouping faces together in photos yeah
is this now being opened up to
developers I'm going to sit on a cloud
somewhere or is it still gonna be on
device would love to know about if it's
on device we need a new chip yes it's
you know remember that Apple announced
the motion coprocessor because they were
really leaning into health so if they
are leaning into AR and machine learning
and AI and so on
give us a chip so that we're not killing
our battery life and that everything
runs more smoothly well I'll tell you
smartypants that they are actually
developing according to many reports an
actual AI base chip for exactly what
you're asking for to save battery power
and throw all that onto the chip well
I'm trying to say is showing an round of
applause
this round of applause um they are when
we talk about AR they are announcing AR
kit which will have developer tools for
AR apps and additional tools so this is
their first foray into outright saying
we are we are putting we have home kit
we got AR kit yeah we got Sirikit all
the kids les Google's was named
something very similar to Wright was in
a VR kit or something oh just a couple
weeks ago I don't I could be totally
wrong but so they're showing kind of
like a demo an iPhone using a camera and
how it can identify different things not
only that it can add objects like
putting a coffee cup onto a table it's
kind of funny how this is stuff that you
know we've seen but the Apple audience
isn't maybe necessarily as familiar like
yeah yeah yeah right lens with the demos
that blew everyone's mind playing
Minecraft on a table yeah you've seen
this at Facebook's developer conference
you know a couple of weeks ago as well
this is you know you this is basically
what he's showing now is kind of like
snapchat esque you can do 3d objects in
your world I was talking about how the
shadows can be moved around though and
reflecting based on where you put the
object and the lighting is changing
accordingly and again it's okay look to
me whether they're not on the cutting
edge or not Apple has so much power the
fact that all these iPhones
however hundreds of millions of phones
are in people's hands a developer has
been wanting these tools so they can
make stuff to make money on Apple's
platform so whether it happened two
three years ago or whether it's
happening now and this is a necessity
for not only moving the technology
forward but to have these developers
make some more make their living by
doing these new things yeah yeah yeah it
doesn't mess I mean it matters but it in
in this world it doesn't matter that
whole ends came out first and that we
saw extremely impressive demos of
playing Minecraft on your coffee table
it matters that now Apple is doing it
because link to this point right Scott
sine just wrote here Apple boasting this
will be the largest AR platform
the world which could make it soar and
that's the thing right smartwatches
although they haven't completely taken
off who has sold the most amount of
smartwatches Apple right and so that's
all the most thank you Apple right so
they're using that muscle that they have
to to push this stuff out a little you
know quote-unquote mainstream although
again we are insulated by this tech
bubble world we like seeing our expose
this like three years ago that we like
always yeah we're like whatever but it
it makes it has ripples beyond just our
little like bubble yeah this is
interesting because if you think about
like the other technologies in this
space that are for consumers like google
tango you need a specific fine yes and
this is the the point is now anyone with
an iPhone 7 plus I'm assuming this is
the demo is on a 7 plus it looks like
I'm assuming anything with two cameras
is going to be capable of doing this
which is it's not even going to be
something that you need to think about
all I need to buy a look a are enabled
phone your own will be a are enabled as
is yeah and so you have access to all
this functionality whether or not you
know it or not
yeah and that's that's gonna be that's
kind of going to be that killer feature
that's why you know we are frustrated
when Apple isn't the most innovative but
the power there platform allows them to
delay things hold them off and put them
out the way they want and then sometimes
push it forward like Apple pay out of
all I don't know what the numbers are I
know people aren't constantly you know
doing mobile payments but if I see which
one people are arguably the most
comfortable with in their brand cachet
name it's most likely Apple pay I know
samsung pay is way more versatile works
on my old school credit card terminals
but I don't see or hear people talking
about Samsung pay unless they're really
into tech and then re that they're going
to be able to use that
what's your that is the best time yeah
yeah yeah it's ironic because Samsung
has the absolute best yes
mobile payments highly you don't need
the the credit card reader doesn't have
to be compatible so it yeah you're right
it's the power of the brand so now
what's going to happen is because again
this is a Developers Conference because
developers know
now they have an easy road to get there
AR there VR apps out there to millions
and millions of people that's who
they're going to develop for true that
they're showing some demo on on the
stream now it looks like it kind of
looks like some sort of game enact
reenactment I think it's this is
something about is this Peter Jackson's
you production company yes we not AR
they're doing a demo where they're
basically laying down a 3d game map on
it by the table moving around and
watching the interactions there see like
this is see why people's this is a
moment where people brains can't be
blood they're doing this through an iPad
without a head gear right there this is
another mind blowing this is it haven't
seen AR before and they don't actually
I'm actually quite surprised that
Apple's called it AR because there's a
lot of confusion about it you know it
hasn't really crossed over as a term at
the same time I think we would be making
fun of them if they didn't call it a
that's true I think it's expecting them
to call it something oh how about
they'll call they are they'll just call
it Apple reality
Apple reality all for Apple right don't
blow your mind Apple reality oh man I
have one single request
I want tamagotchi to come back in AR
tamagotchi was pretty happy that was
pretty fun it brought out the worst in
so many people yeah like serious like
how much they care about a living I just
like ritual water and diet like not
clean it up not feed it and like I did
that I'm a bad person obviously hey of Z
cavariccis could come back tamagotchi
come back oh my god with your Sims I
want to live with my sins i'ma go
outside to meet some people sharing I
that's the best advice I can give to you
right now should but I love you better
people firstly hang out with a better
world
[Laughter]
are they still showing off the demo
right yeah looks like team cookies back
on stage and then the actual demo is a
little slower than our live blog so
stream sir yes so check this out
we're at 11:40 it's been an hour and 40
minutes into the keynote we got about
roughly I don't know if they plan to
make this at one end at 12:30 I don't
know but a interesting ly enough at this
time looks like Scott sign says iPad
time now let's see let's see this iPad
time you guys are honestly you guys are
the biggest fans of tablets or not yes
or no it's kind of just like a thing is
that yeah it's it to me it's not a
Productivity device it's like if I'm on
a plane and I want to watch a movie and
I know that they in flight experience is
not gonna be satisfactory I'll bring a
tablet oh that's pretty much the only
time I'll ever have one on me yeah can I
could I suggest you ladies into getting
into reading comics alright I heard
there are comics but you know who don't
like necessarily yeah what hey I I think
how about this real quick before we go
on the iPad top 5 comics go well I could
give you the top ten but comics don't
have to be superhero based Marvel EDC
comics there's independent stuff that it
will blow your mind I read a lot of
comics there's a lot of stuff in here
but you don't don't think like why do I
got to read about Superman like
characters you've never heard of that
have intricate grown-up mature stories
that are like mind-blowing that's cool
look up saga saga saga it's a night game
of it from you actually I would I would
if you would give it a shot I want to
hear what you did you legit yeah yeah
it's a mix of Star Wars meets Game of
Thrones meets real me oh and Juliet Oh
literally that up best way to mix that
up yeah it's been out for now I think
maybe six years but it's it's
mind-blowing okay let's get back let's
get this you know but for all y'all
watching the UH Villette know saga from
Image Comics Brian cave on Fiona staples
Thapa cream of the crop right there but
there's so many more this is not a
comics podcast I've had protein to it
iPad pro is weld you for a good upgrade
Tim Cook says when we introduced the
iPad pro just eighteen months ago it
completely redefined what you can do
with an iPad sorry about that dress um
service Pro um anyways there's two
models to buy today the 13-inch
twelve point nine into nine point seven
nine point seven is the most popular
today today we're going to introduce an
all new iPad pro thank you
here we go mark it out ten point five
inch Retina display
is the first iPad pro they said with a
ten point five inch Retina display looks
like an iPad pro it weirdly um let me
see here
I think we're little oh yeah we're a
little bit behind but you can tell
there's another picture of each I'm up
higher that's a black trim yeah you can
tell the bezels there are significantly
smaller and they're talking about how
they're been able they've been able to
reduce the borders while still keeping
it at one pound is that how much it
weighs currently um it's roughly roughly
try to keep it around a pound okay I
think when they wrote when they released
the updated iPad like they kind of went
backwards um that that iPad actually
started way more like it was a nine
point seven inch so they kind of went
backwards it's like their cheapest most
affordable iPad got it they've done a
lot with the line which is very
confusing and hard to just explain in
five words which yeah tells you
everything weighs just a pound it's the
first iPad that can a full screen
keyboard on the display as well as a
smart keyboard
I'm trying to figure out oh so you've
got it's just a standard with keyboard
right but then you still have your
add-on physical keyboard it also looks
like the keyboard yeah okay
I mean twelve point nine inch had more
than enough space for that
so HDR we were talking about that
earlier today is coming to the iPad pro
excellent 600 nits of brightness um are
they talking about all the iPads are
just this they're talking about just a
ten point nine ten point five inch would
okay - yeah true tone display wide color
gamut ultra low reflectivity so this is
for looks like twelve point nine and ten
point five is that correct I just need a
they're showing two iPads there on
screen yeah it looks like it I think
those are the two ones but that looks
the size difference of that image yeah
they're talking about automatic
basically they're bringing up the fact
that the ten point five inch has the
same display as the twelve point nine
that's what that's what I'm gathering
here they're not saying that they're
releasing a brand new twelve point nine
inch iPad pro yet all right so the
pencil well it's not getting an update
but it's being better supported with
just 20 milliseconds latency you know
that's a lot that's even better there
they had a 50 millisecond latency which
was best in the industry 20 milliseconds
that's ridiculous that's pretty awesome
actually
it really feels almost like you are
writing on paper like a pencil iPad you
did it hold on we'll just wait for this
product announcement to be finished then
we'll go we go there well thank you know
their role
I have an iPad Oh God oh I pay a role
okay that's all they're people um they
this so there's a display enhancing
technology called Pro motion all the
motion all of your motion content on
your screens will be smoother and more
responsive so um promotion also assists
the Apple pencil so this is basically
recognizing how the screen works and
that is 18 in the pencils 20 millisecond
latency
that's hot that is hot but again this is
not anything interface changing its
performance changing okay um well rhyme
aches a good point he says here that
Apple is focusing on 4k and HDR
uh they're applying it to everything
except for the Apple TV
yeah that's September I'm going to bring
up a crazy thought yes please give us an
actual TV why not
maybe that's what we're waiting for here
well I think that man you much like
Apple realized it was a little create a
lot crazier to be ambitious about let's
make our own car in a few years yeah
which they completely scrapped then the
dynamics of the TV industry although
more similar to computers and monitors
still not that easy just to jump in and
just get into when you have a lot of
these factories that have already
manufacturing places that have already
cut deals inventory levels with
Samsung LG Sony F sharp
they have a hard time getting glass for
their iPhone exactly yeah so let alone
getting panels for TVs so that it looks
like this 10.5 inch will be powered by
the a 10x chip 6 cores 12 cores EPU 30%
faster cpu performance um let's see what
else they have here graphics performance
500 times faster I don't know what they
were comparing that any original I come
on a full of course is gonna be a
hotwife as possible just like natural
progression technology
500 times they're gonna show off a pro
at photo editing app called infinity
photo Oh interest not infinity blade but
an affinity for remember the game they
always do baby blade we got infinity
photo now visit I think this is um a
third-party company
yeah competitor ash Hewson of cereth
okay is here to talk about a pro photo
editing that sounds like a game of
thrones name I mean if you're if you are
into Lightroom or you know Photoshop
whatever same company uh but it I think
that over the past few years we've seen
a lot more competitors in the space
which makes me so happy yes at some
point it's either you paid five hundred
dollars or you didn't I just remember
the first time I saw a third-party app
that gave control over curves and levels
I was like that wasn't that was not
Photoshop it was like oh my gosh I'm not
like I no longer tied into the addo yeah
Chris system it was just so cool and yes
almost as good as doing it on a desktop
I mean come on yeah especially if you're
all you're doing is editing it for
Instagram web use seriously you know
some people like and a lot of time doing
that point I've got my own professional
IG filter Pro oh yeah it's called Shauna
she just takes my pictures spices alike
she's my IG Pro it's like I don't got
time to do this she's like oh wait
Shelby I can tell when use a filter you
need to customize it yeah if you can do
yeah you can tell you can tell she's
like oh you use the filter here let me
do this and I'm like wow that really
looks way better than mine you were
probably still using like hefa from 2000
my god Brian that's the spirit X Pro - I
thought that was the coolest filter when
I first came I'm like oh my god it makes
my photos look like dude yeah it's the
worst filter ever I know when you look
back at some of the photos investor
Graham K Madeleine thank god this is
interesting yeah we thought it was great
I know but like it was so bad now
there's now a hide tool seek an archival
of like driving that one no it's like I
want to keep it because it's like I made
the sushi look like garbage with ex-pro
to that because we had crappier yeah
yeah green screens of crappy cameras so
we took point moss the fact that it was
such a bad photo in the first place make
it look even worse yeah this is pretty
crazy they're showing off with this app
using again these are tools that a lot
quite honestly not a lot of people are
exposed to that's kind of the problem
right like so what he's showing is how
much like in Photoshop he's literally
completely outlining Johnny Depp Jack
Sparrow and a building this kind of
Pirates of the Caribbean a la movie
poster slash photoshopping slash image
doing some interesting stuff with hair
mapping and mas I don't know I'm a very
trim I'm not gonna lie I'm a check out
infinity photo once I get a new iPad
after mine was stolen aka loss aka
stolen still to be determined like my
iPad pro and my pencil to the pencil oh
it was all in the case that's my stuff
you know I would if I was in tennis I
got my ear pods stolen your your ear
pods ear like yeah stolen from me yes uh
you know at some point I was entering
TSA security that's all I was exiting
I don't know ma'am well when did you
lose them and mark that's funny I found
a pair of March you won all the way to
the air just lost this it's called lost
and found
lost my ear pods guys I didn't honestly
didn't even bother filing a report
because I know someone snatched them and
there's no lockdown on air pods yeah
yeah yeah yeah yes I mean how can they
um so they're so this cool infinity
photo app I'm honestly would like to
check it out available today they're
also talking about battery claims and
the cameras for this new 10.5 inch iPad
pro a 12 megapixel camera rear 7
megapixel FaceTime front-facing camera
we don't need a good camera on the back
it's just gonna encourage people make
cars we will take photos on the iPad oh
stop wait please we've talked about this
for years and it's not getting any
better
don't encourage view I don't I don't
understand why a lot of companies use to
take pictures you know let it like I
went to the I went to the doctor the
other day and the nurse like took a
picture me for their for their records
or whatever it's used an iPad yeah yeah
did you so did you like you know they
know I ain't having that company
personal Oh sir uh can you give me Tim
coughs here let me let me take the iPad
pro while you do that weird weird
awkward all right um ooh dongle time yes
so here's one of the most unknown things
about the iPad pro so they're talking
about they're going to be supporting
fast charging have great USB 3 charging
charters if you buy this has happened
with the original iPad pro you can buy a
USB C charger and it charges the Apple
iPad pro 2 half times faster but you see
how to tip right there why did I I mean
I've been looking out for like a year
then like seriously but it does cost you
but it literally charged it like boom
otherwise you wait like six seven hours
you're like this sucks slower process
relining so yeah it supports the faster
charging through the USB see connection
but so that's actually they never that's
yeah they never really promoted that
they should that's the selling
like they're not gonna give us wireless
charging but they can give us fast
charging lines or USB C on Android
phones in the pixel come on
they also surely they also surely won't
bundle that with the iPad pro they gonna
make you buy that and how much is that I
think it was like AI think the kit with
the cord and the charger I think it ends
up being spent like 80 bucks you know it
seriously spent about 70 80 bucks just
to get that yeah come on plus the $100
pencil oh yeah
plus the $5,000 iMac Pro come on so it
so I'm I'm honestly confused here hmm
because we're not watching this and I we
can't hear this and this sounds dumb did
they actually update the iPad pro 12
point 9 inch as well or they're just
showing them side by side oh can we
different it can anyone tweet me that
the implication is that they're phasing
it out that would be yes someone let us
know can someone just tweet me I guess
that there because they're showing the
pricing of the ten point five inch they
look like they're putting it
side-by-side with the twelve point nine
but are they doing anything different is
the twelve point nine getting any is
that actually a new twelve point nine
yeah it's a few fresh with those
features that yes okay about this how
much a boy I need to know this
immediately because I need a new iPad
pro this is Hall that's this is
basically completely purely selfish room
there there's nothing that's purely
selfish all right looks like there's
some specific I I pad page speeches in
iOS 11 here we go here we go whoa all
right that app switcher is yeah I need a
compatibility chart for iOS 11 here whoa
okay okay so much like the desktop right
you can see like a bird's eye view of
your apps it looks like they're getting
that with the app switcher drag-and-drop
like our gentleman who called in is
coming to the iPad nice I can drag
images you can drag text it's a drag
fest the traffic thanks Craig federighi
and they have that new app that they
quote unquote accidentally launched
today called files it's a universal file
system
you can do nested folders spring loading
this is very Mac this is very Mac OS
type of stuff being brought to the iPad
queue every Android owner ever like you
suckers don't even have had this for
ever really literally prefer Android day
one pretty much uh you know one thing
you guys have also had is multi-user
support Oh like that Apple still refuses
to do most likely to sell more iPads so
jerk this is a D move we talked about
this Beecham yeah yeah okay so it that's
it's starting to feel a little bit more
laptop like mm-hmm
will is it good enough to replace a
laptop not we don't know yet probably
not I mean it's getting very close as a
user who is a hardcore iPad pro user I'm
happy to see this stuff but I don't
think it anyone says I gotta get a iPad
pro because of this exactly that's the
thing because you're in the market for
an iPad pro I mean you're not gonna go
out and go well I'll buy this and then
not buy a MacBook right you're not gonna
be doing that you're gonna be going I
need this and potentially a desktop or a
laptop right it's not gonna be this is
my one and only machine I mean that's
the thing I got a spec it out because
the surface pro has so many more options
but it's also way more expensive because
it is a laptop tablet hybrid it's you
know you can get an entry-level twelve
point nine inch iPad pro for around like
eleven hundred you know if I was going
to get a surface pro I'm not gonna buy
the entry-level $14.99 one I want you
know the faster processors I want more
hard drive space and it ends up being
like around twenty five hundred three
thousand dollar machine for what I'd
wanted that and that's also like a price
consideration like yeah yeah it would
really need to be my primary computer
laptop if that's how much I was going to
drop on it so getting closer though I
mean they're obviously trying a little
bit harder to compete with Microsoft
Microsoft you know is this year more
than ever is taking matters into its own
hands a developer creating its own
laptop so apples probably feeling the
heat a little bit
I mean I think it's again if you're a
user of this stuff I think you're happy
and I mean I'm happy when I look at this
up but I still know the surface probe
it's just so bad so so it is and the
keyboard is so much better oh my gosh
yes it is very tactile it's got great
feedback on it the iPad pro keyboard is
embarrassing yeah
I'm sorry it's like you're like
basically typing on this table mat yeah
and it's like clunk it just feels dirty
and I return this to it you don't I
returned it right away and I was like
you know I'll buy it and just to use it
but I was like no this sucks this sucks
I don't know I realistically though the
people that are looking at this are most
likely as we've said time time again
already in the Apple acres yes they're
not really even knowing that there is an
alternative out there the surface
variety and they're probably alike
windows what's that I don't want to I
don't like I've did Windows that's years
and years ago I decided that Mac OS and
iOS and that ecosystem is where I want
to be and so why do I want to go back to
Windows there's a lot of residual damage
there I'm sure for people that kind of
grew up with this and then they they're
just like they've gone over to the Apple
side and even though we know there's
alternatives they don't even want to
know because they're so tired Apple this
isn't about acquiring new customers not
saral this is about retaining and
keeping that brand loyalty really valid
yeah and making it very aspirational you
know what I also when you talked about
kind of like some damage from like
previous generations what I find
interesting is that my niece's who are
13 no 14 and turning 14 11 shout out to
Jen and Calissa Olay yeah they're their
generation is actually more impressed
with what Google's doing yeah they talk
about like Oh Google's way better at
xyzt there I they say without me without
me getting into their heads Apple's
behind Google's doing cool stuff
I think the Google pixels up cooler
phone than the Apple iPhone right now
and that's and I'm like is this just
what you guys think are your friends
saying this stuff and they're that
younger generation thinks Google is but
you know that those teeny Bob they think
that Google's coolers doing more things
now she still has an iPhone right right
but she thinks that Google is actually
doing better more exciting things and I
wonder when you talk about
that generational transition of oh
there's going to be a generation that
feels like Oh Apple just isn't
innovating and other companies are it
takes time to slide up but that that
type of thinking will exist I mean we
feel it all the time so yeah you know
we're so funny because we old that's
always saying I was like you know we're
all because you've just dropped in
teenyboppers as I do and they listening
as a generational reference so you know
everything it's so true
the generational thing is huge I mean
just look at the success of snapchat for
example and you know for our generation
you know I used to act out a lot but
it's still confusing and I still don't
think I 100% get it right whereas like I
see people that are you know school age
you know like early 20s just so
naturally doing it I go out to concerts
and I just see people using snapchat
primarily and then switching over to
Instagram yeah Facebook primarily going
snapchat for us to share those immediate
moments and then switch back to another
platform even if I get it
it doesn't mean I want to use it and I
think that's partially a generational
thing yes I totally get it but I don't
want to use it it's all the time brands
are - that's where the people are you
want to communicate with ah like if
everyone I knew was on snapchat i would
use snapchat exclusively but then not
well I mean I'm still using my space in
a friend afraid you know Friendster
yeah I might your top eight and why are
you top a Brian come on I have to see
I'll have to see the latest updates I'll
have to check that and okay so Derek
they're also talking about on the iPad
pro uh marking up marking up like
documents so this is a thing can you
believe this is the thing where the iPad
pro didn't have the capabilities to mark
up right and they had a pencil like on
launch so they're talking about that as
well in the iPad pro there's also a
built-in document scanner so goodbye to
at least a dozen House that musing the
camera basically using the camera that's
boiling heaven or it it's goodbye all
those Microsoft I mean I use PDFs can
throw damn yeah they're all gotten
really you say is that how they
advertise it
PDFs get a pro Oh quite the app sure
PDFs got a prop trying to make something
extremely boring really honest leave
that out I don't want to check out this
app but sometimes in these shows we come
up with ad campaigns for companies
indirectly they want to use it what are
you using uh Lexi to scan your PDS I use
PDFs can a pro you like for shizzle my
nizzle
it's like Snoop Dogg will be the actual
face of that TV commercial fine
I would jump on it you can thank Cena
alive later all right guys everybody
like yeah Snoop Dogg gets money out of
it they get money out of it oh there's a
new keyboard what called the flick
keyboard mm-hmm did you also see this
that their time out um I don't know it
harkens back to the Newton there's
basically a handwriting functionality
that smooths out the curves that makes
your hand that will help to make your
handwriting more legible on the iPad pro
I that's kind of cool yeah I want to say
this in action my goal I was gonna why
are we wanting to keep handwriting why
don't we want to just convert straight
to text I mean that there's things I
mean I've already cold call me call me
devil's advocate here but I don't quite
know if if I'm gonna write somebody had
I'm probably gonna write it true because
they don't want to convert it to text
there is evidence that handwriting helps
you retain come into memory that's
exactly what I wanted you to leave but
we don't know if if you and also need it
too you also need to be reading it back
in your own handwriting yeah oh oh like
the way you see it the way that you
wrote it helps also in write in other
words should they just convert it to
type touch yeah well I mean I actually
want to see my notes the same way I
wrote them ya know I think about what I
think about it yep when I want to search
when I want to do a ctrl F you know when
I want to find something quickly and I'm
like I know I wrote it down somewhere
but what page was that I don't remember
I did I draw a star next to it like how
hold up is OCR what if it's smart enough
to well it when it reads it it actually
underlined as the card is there to such
like well then I'm interested I'm
nothing like that new iPad those new
iPad pro customers
exactly you can have but you can replace
what was that app called again sure what
was it called you can replace you give
you have Scanner Pro I love it I love it
well yeah
so Apple has also I mean if you've
noticed been investing a lot in its
Notes app it improved it so much so
adding OCR which is something that
Evernote has which means that you can
search your handwritten documents would
be huge please please that's something
that it would make me excited yes it
makes me interested in it I mean as an
iPad pro user this is all pretty sweet
yeah I'm doing um as a past hi a former
sorry mama
okay okay we don't we're not supposed to
agree on everything I know the wound is
still fresh but oh yeah I'm with you I
love it but I love it
I've had feel my face when I'm with you
down
send the house on fire yeah isn't it fun
we have those to refer to yeah thanks
for pulling right up and you guys were
actually singing enjoying it not
cringing this is this is progress last
cringy when you were in that video I
believe I think I was in the bossing
somewhere yes yeah getting sloshed in
the bar
aka see that studio lots of apple juice
apple juice was exchanged so uh they're
summarizing up here right now we're
really excited about what we're doing
with the iPad this year and really
excited about iOS 11 this year the files
app was absolutely necessary for all of
these new functions I mean you can
handwrite and scan but not save these
documents it would be ridiculous so I'm
also just for doing the obvious thing
I'm also I'm also just feeling like they
have put they finally made it people at
least are interested in the iPad pencil
or the Apple pencil so confirm actually
more worthwhile like it you pay 99 bucks
for this stylus I mean pencil but it's
like they actually added a lot of
functionality that can help make it more
useful as also the response of time is
that's pretty much like you won't even
feel that now yeah 20 milliseconds
you're not going to reveal that just
have a curiosity can you use a
third-party stylus with the iPad pro not
obviously to get a bunch of the same
functionality but just for the basic
tasks of drawing and sketching and
things like that you can but it won't be
nearly as precise so that um app gosh
what was it the one that originally
create open paper here they've had a
stylus for years yeah I had a lot of
jokes that I didn't want to go into so
I'm just gonna leave that with you
moving right on up there I just so many
opportunities thoughtful and I want to
be respectful some once in a while
but I had to let you know that I wasn't
gonna be respectful but that I chose to
be respected in a way you just ruined it
because he's not going oh you didn't
hear the joke
in fact trust me inside voice
alright it looks like they're showing a
video
now of the iPad pro to my five inch
promotional video people using it in
public
um and so we're gonna let them enjoy
that okay one more thing what's up no I
mean okay back on stage dynamo fee Oh
oh man I need to change this video card
out one last thing that's gonna be the
next one last thing it's got to be the
series speaker this got to be decision
yeah what else is live they've been
hinting out it the whole time exactly I
said it's the biggest ever come on don't
let us down Oh love you so turn our
attention to music what listen you're
getting your boom box yes yes beats
boombox
Eureka 499 series speaker yeah if it
looked like a boom box that might
actually be cool seriously this is
really embarrassing sometimes it's cool
sometimes it's not that alright um
they're saying today the iPhone has
become the best portable music player in
the world it's even better when it's
paired with Apple music really come on
no sorry I shouldn't use those gestures
here you now have 40 million songs in
your pocket I can't help myself
sometimes is ridiculous oh whatever
music oh yeah we have such a great
portable music experience but what about
our home our home well here's what's
interesting they're positioning it more
as a music device right now not a smart
speaker yeah as they intro this beats
integration it's all about that right
Apple knows the obvious which is that
most people although many many more
people are adopting smart home devices
more people listen to music and honestly
very good points when I have the Google
home out even though it's sitting in my
drawer now but when I did have it out it
was really only to play music and listen
write headlines news headlines on
podcast is really the prime yeah okay
and set timers and check the way they
have music in podcast a today we have
the technology so apple says a like we
did with portable music we want to
reinvent home music Phil Schiller's
backup stage to talk about this
I have some interesting points that we
can follow up about this because Phil
Schiller had some really interesting
comments slamming both the echo and the
home just a couple weeks ago in general
so here we go let's let's hear what you
did it again there are certainly a lot
of companies hard at work making
products to enjoy music at home but none
of them have nailed it yet
I mean if I would say Amazon would not
call it a primary it's if it's about
sound quality if it's about sound
quality 100% agree yeah if it's about
sound quality but is it there um so he
said the team has been working on a
breakthrough home speaker yeah remember
one appaled
released that big home speaker they did
before it was like a three hundred
dollar speaker it was an apple really it
was a big one
I can't remember the name of it I mean
it was back in the old school days so oh
it needs to rock the house free from
distortion what am I telling you guys
you rock the house it's gonna have this
massive sub in it and it's gonna be able
to rock but just just the bass does
amaze just the face we don't need
anything else in the music it's also
they say secondly it needs to be
spatially aware it's going to fit in
different rooms in our home like every
speaker yes every speaker ever made like
a yeah like it can't be the size of my
room third they say it needs a
musicologist I'm sorry oh thank you a
great degree that you can yet
this means that dr. Dre and I mean I'm
gonna come out and be like what's the
professor where's that don't we need a
toxicology you know guys we almost
forgot about Dre we're we're we've been
working on the speaker for the late for
later this year but we wanted to give
you a sneak peek of it this morning
we're gonna start showing a video of the
speaker close-up don't tell me it's just
a promo teaser video Oh with something
like covered okay hold on um we're gonna
give it a few moments to see guys it has
a name it's called Hong Kong Oh God
Atlantica speaker it looks like the
macro fabric-covered no no do I win the
bingo Josh are you in the bingo of life
that's amazing I recover
oh no that look at the video is even
showing the curves here it's it it's a
suit it's like the UE you a boom yes
well it is a broom I wonder how big it
is right now it looks like the metal
seven inches tall Oh sharra how about in
a seamless mesh oh I'm still gonna try
it out I ain't gonna lie I mean I might
be alright though I want to try it I
want to hear this so called sound
quality is supposedly better yeah I want
different colors that doesn't go with my
you know with your way anybody they laid
out they might offer later colors
additionally later it has a sari here
I'm gonna jump you it has a big woofer a
four inch woofer that is forward-facing
so better better deeper bass fuller
sound as we turn up the volume it's free
from distortion I thought they didn't
even have one on on hand so how do they
it's mine it's packed with speakers and
microphones there is an a8 processor
chip inside perhaps the biggest brain in
a speaker I think that's a really cool
point how they can use their older
processors from their phones that can
handle so much and put it in these you
know I don't want to call a lower entry
device but just maybe not a
sophisticated device yeah but still have
all that power that that is interesting
that they can take all those returned
iPhones in a but that shit's here
recycle thi Bessie do you guys see any
buns on it I haven't seen it yet yeah I
mean this is great there's no mention of
Syrian in it yet either is not not not
yet way they're setting it up they've
got talking about the microphones
they're talking about you know echo
cancellation things that are hopefully
going to be useful for some sort of
voice integration the thing the thing
that I love is I just want to see
everyone's you know because Twitter is a
bunch of it's white-hot steaks that are
just completely ridiculous
oh there's white also I just can't wait
to see what people are saying about the
design cuz you know it's just like it
says there
murdered right now it's a joke as a joke
oh I was gonna say because I actually
think that of all the ways they could
have gone this is not offensive that oh
no I actually actually like it tonight
it's it's subtle it's just that it looks
you know like one of their products that
is pretty much you know it looks like
the Mac Pro so when and we've seen a lot
of this actually historically an apple
recently where their design yes to be
cohesive with the message of what
they've done the past right it's not I
don't want to say risk-taking but it's
not like you've when was the last ap
product that you said that design is
amazing I don't think we've seen
anything like that just the iPhone
problem right iPhone um let me think
about oh the iMac that very thin I mean
yeah that was that was good but you know
so this just kind of stays in line with
what they've had before it's it's cool I
mean it's not it's hard to make
something that's elegant but not ugly
but still also neutral and generic I
think especially for the home yeah
exactly and like to their point and
we're talking about a device that was
going to be able to fit into any room in
the house like I could see that in a
bathroom I could see that in a kitchen
and it's inoffensive and it doesn't look
like an air freshener yes sitting renews
it is that what the air freshener that
the Google home looks like yeah like it
it's straight up looks like a Glade
plugin yeah oh yeah absolutely
hmm I would say that of all the smart
speaker designs that echo dot is
probably my favorite but definitely does
not have the sound quality yeah that it
has the right right now it has the you
know pretty tinny yeah but you have the
ability to pull your tooth plug it in so
it depends if your primary function if
your primary use case for this is as a
smart connected speaker then you're
gonna probably want the dot unless
they're going to come out and say I'm
appliance yeah we saw heard that theory
this is really interesting because based
on the sensors it has and we'll see the
thing is like okay how how much does
this really matter I I guess it does
matter a lot but we'll have to test it
in different environments intelligently
and automatically it detects the space
it's in it uses that information to
change the sound maybe whether it's high
vaulted ceilings yeah
sealians a more narrow space versus a
wider open space or maybe there's things
that could be obstructed I don't know
it'll be interesting to see how that
helps them it shoots and beams in
different directions the audio so yeah
it's room aware for space and sound
they're saying if you love one you
should see what it's like when you set
up - hold on wait today is this a new
technology we've never heard before that
surround sound called Sonos he's like
you could put one on your left side yeah
one on your right side yeah technically
that is stereo surround Oh surround 5.1
4.1 sound stereo 2.1 okay our two
pointers don't don't hate on me all
right
man they are really focusing on the
music so okay so here it is as you see
those magic words haze Siri as you say
those magic words hey Siri it can help
serve up music so yes there is Siri yes
there is a glowing top much like Google
home or even Alexa although it's going
to be a little bit more like that I go
like EULA that looks cool that cool
locks cool from the top it's like a no
bun it's like an egg it's like a
futuristic nest like with a blue egg in
it you know so here's the question you
know here's the question is it only for
use with Apple music because that is
implied alien songs - what's your ear
playing it they're playing something to
it
yeah but not natively not natively
saying hey Siri play me something
something on Spotify this is like the
Google Maps conundrum where it's like I
don't want to use Apple Maps I don't use
enjoy and I have a subscription I want
to give you X amount of dollars for this
speaker but I don't want to be again
tied into an app that I don't like it
doesn't have the music I want on it yep
that glow that glowing thingy on the top
does does look kind of fun but you'll
never see it because it's on and it's
integrated the third 8-bit but you won't
actually see the glowing ring already
it's like hey for eye candy guys I'm
gonna show you this really cool glowing
top you'll never see in person well and
that that's why you know part of Google
homes design is clever because it's
slanted yeah so you can kind of glance
across the room to make sure
she's hearing they're also saying it has
a great and hope helpful home assistant
we talked about its music hook so you
can say things like play this song by
you know the normal stuff that were used
to play beats 1 radio play I'm poppy so
that stuff is there but they're talking
about how it is also grateful and
helpful as a home assistant we'll wait
and see in a few moments how much it
knows but like you said when the caller
came in earlier about obviously there's
going to be Philips integration
typically we mow Belkin Wemo platform is
one of the first ones that is compatible
what are some of the other ones like
Honeywell nest oh yeah those are some of
the core guys are always there any
cameras so it sounds like it's we don't
know how limited or complete the Siri
experience are you interested yep all of
the features available so I'm going to
guess home kit is also available from a
brief look at that list it looks like
it's pretty much the Syria that we know
and don't love that much on the phone
just accessible through the speaker yeah
and Dan Ackerman makes a great point
from CNET is it not the full Siri or is
this just a list of predetermined skills
that's unclear because they aren't
talking about and again when we talk
about a predetermined list think appletv
predetermined list of what you can do
not the full Siri yeah and so that
that's interesting to see as well you
can say are the lights on turn the
temperature 273 degrees as they're kind
of going through some of the smart stuff
this is a screenshot that someone should
take of all these kind of different
commands that are on there text Erik
meet me at the Kabuki theater at 7:00 is
one of them set a three-minute timers on
there how long will it take to drive to
Tahoe so a lot of the stuff that were
used to seeing but clearly integrated
with your Apple ecosystem what we don't
necessarily have is the power of Google
so the reason why you know I think
despite Alexa's integration with way
more devices Google home as a day-to-day
assistant is a lot more helpful because
it has the knowledge graph of Google so
Apple I mean man I I don't know how
they'll make up for that
gap in knowledge literally and it might
take some time if they're rolling out
you know a new AI platform and you smart
write your own learning platform that
takes time to build their own library of
that stuff they can't just also just
take what you know google has exactly
been curious for god knows how many
years so again it's like would you
rather have a seamless integrated Apple
home or would you rather sacrifice a
little bit of that integration to have a
more probably like innovative and
advanced smarter speaker you know
talking a lot about encryption um so
it's never listening to you yeah you
know when you're when you're not when
when you haven't said hey Siri it's not
listening to you all your the what
you're saying is encrypted it's all
local it looks like when they say local
recognition I don't know how much is
actually being sent and being processed
by servers versus just specifically just
by E of your device is private too so
that's pretty cool home pod pricing 349
3 that's actually in me dad's now now I
will argue that if this is truly like an
amazing speaker true yeah
then and that's how much you would be
paying anyway touch the edge but really
good Bluetooth speaker for example you
would not find that out of the ordinary
in the Bluetooth speaker market for a
really good quality one but given the
functionality with Siri appears at the
moment to be somewhat limited yeah it's
a lot of cash especially if you can get
as you said Sharon a dot for like what
don't litter your head oh well you can
know every room a connector house and if
you Ori yeah yeah and if you already
have Bluetooth speakers lying around you
can already hook them on yeah and get a
better quality audio in it but you know
what it is about making these smart
speakers really easy to use and
understand and for a family of Apple
users I think it's hard to make the leap
and figure out how their current devices
integrate with Google more election
totally it's just to know that oh it's
all under one hood it's all in this
ecosystem of it that I think we just can
never you can never underestimate
to make the power of an ecosystem you
just can't and you know when when we
look at this because we know the
landscape of what's happening just
generally in tech it always it always
comes back to what your ecosystem oh
yeah you know and so there there it is
here as well just the power like there
will be plenty of people that will buy
this because they want it to work they
want to know know that it's going to
work here's a question though do you
think the explanation that Apple has
given it well basis based on what we've
read in the blog do you think that was
enough to make people understand what a
connected speaker is compared to seeing
a demo from the ads from Amazon and echo
or the Google home for example well I
think that's why they focused on it as a
music player as a music yeah speaker
which I mean that's that's actually a
big gamble for them because they're
really hoping that enough people want a
connected music speaker right as opposed
to just a smart assistant speaker at
home and and then it's like oh and by
the way Siri also works I think there's
a gamble the big myths here that I'm
really feeling and seen here WWDC is
look they like you said they didn't
they're not necessarily focusing on the
smart aspects of Siri did we really
learn that Siri is that much better than
it was before today where we that's
that's the biggest takeaway for me right
now yeah that's the biggest opportunity
for them to show us that like the
virtual assistant artificial
intelligence this is what our vision of
it is moving forward there's there was
nothing like oh my god but so we did get
a few things just to touch on the new
voice which we haven't heard yet maybe
it's better and the conversation feature
so you can continue the conversation but
is she smart her but is she smart I
don't think she is I died I again
look I can't I always have two premises
I can't make Siri okay I'm not that
smart
so people like do okay why don't you
make a better Siri how many times I've
heard crap like that what did you make
an iPhone okay yeah why don't you make
one you can't make one either you can't
make one so again though that's at a
Developers Conference that's the type of
stuff that I thought I'd hear a little
more because it tells you how much
smarter
is Apple's iPhone I think the most
exciting at least from a moving forward
thing is what they did with the iPad pro
in iOS 11 I think those some of those
features stand out the most but yeah I
don't I don't think they made it exactly
better at all
well from a developer's standpoint as
well like you're gonna see this new
product this harm pod right and then
you're going what do I do with this as a
developer why I put it in my phone but I
can't develop anything for it
like what where is that that disconnect
was huge for me yeah a Developers
Conference where you're focusing on you
know they're talking about things you
know hardware improvements that are
going to make things like VR or reality
on Macs gaming discrete graphics things
that are actually interesting to
developers who are making applications
for the platform and then you go I and
here's something you can put in your
house that you can't make anything for
it
right I think maybe it's very early for
them yes it is and you know I'm never
gonna complain when a company shows us
shows us something early but again you
know whether this home pod is that great
or not I don't doubt that it's probably
the best sounding home speaker cuz
really the you know they're they aren't
that great sounding yet I actually don't
doubt that but again it's the brains
underneath this stuff I don't I don't
know if Apple got smarter there they are
products company but man you just know
when you see what every other company is
doing from an AI standpoint I didn't
feel like we're moving that much or the
Apple didn't make that much of a jump
that I was hoping for not enough to
warrant this is the best WWDC ever this
is the most stuff that we were ever
going to show you I mean it is the most
stuff yeah not maybe not the best stuff
is this the best most stuff is that oh
is that a best most yeah okay so it
looks like apples wrapping up we're
gonna keep the phone lines open let's
just hang here for me like 15 20 minutes
to talk a little bit talk a little bit
of shop if you guys and gals want to
call us I'm sorry there were some people
that were waiting on the line the until
keynote and finally gave up because it's
hard I get it but you can call us the
phone number there right there one eight
eight eight nine hundred see and eighty
two six three eight oh he's gonna take
these calls hot oh we're going to take
these calls hot so if
you're calling just hang on but the
lines are filling up we're gonna take
about five and then we'll talk a little
more wrap this up but welcome - here we
go welcome to CNET live please tell us
your name and where you're from and I
know people that are calling and are
wondering are they talking to you well
I'm talking to you so just say hi hi yes
who is this is Jim from Minnesota what's
up Jim from Minnesota welcome to the
show I'm guessing you saw the keynote
along with us is that correct yes I did
i watch the whole time with you guys yes
you are a beast I love that uh so you
called to talk listen let's hear what's
on your mind I mean the key no just
wrapped up wrapped up what sticks out
things you liked just lay it on us
um I kind of disappointed from a
developer standpoint let us know why
it's please um so I'm disappointed
because I first I don't like the store
because a lot of small developers won't
get a chance to be noticed right away
that's a huge thing for me because it is
a huge selling point for Apple to market
that product hunt is your new best
friend yeah but like exactly speaking
the Jim Lee exactly that's what the
first thing I saw I'm like how our
developers gonna get seen it's so much
they've narrowed that that funnel that
pipe I would it let's jump over to the
home pod I'm the Mac Pro I'm sorry the
home pod fabric Mac Pro what it would it
as a developer I mean they didn't give
us enough but what did you think of that
um I didn't really I honestly I didn't
like it that much I mean they obviously
haven't spoke about giving any
developers any development things to use
I developed on the Amazon echo I um they
let us you know have that right away and
they said there's a bunch of different
applications you can do this is the
ecosystem this is how it's going to work
and then they said something new is
going to be coming very quickly
following after which was really really
nice with Apple I haven't heard anything
from them obviously they don't even have
the hardware in place right now they're
just showing you what this is going to
be but I don't think they're even making
it currently I think they're going to
make adjustments to it
but honestly at home for personal use
I'm using like what a $45 Amazon echo
dot with a so nose play 5 generation to
like that's all I need it can hear me
across the room it plays amazing sound I
just think that the price point this is
currently set at it's just not worth it
their their business here you the series
a big thing they're basically just like
wait wait if you haven't yet purchased a
smart speaker wait for us we're coming
to worry
yeah the I mean Amazon has done a
fantastic job with their AI like I can
ask my echo dot a bunch of different
things it can actually go out there can
find things there's apps being made now
where's the echo dot eventually is going
to be able to you'll be able to like
tell a wireless camera if you detect
motion the echo dot will respond to you
and say hey there's motion in this place
it's going to work forward and backwards
but right now you just have a list of
things you can say to Siri and every
single time you say something it didn't
get that it didn't understand it's just
really it's awful well this is a gym
thanks so much we're going to jump
through the calls but thanks so much for
the inside I love your perspective as a
developer you know it's funny when
you're like oh they didn't really tell
us much about Siri and it's you know how
we can use it as a developer and we're
like yeah it's a developers conference
maybe maybe yeah I just want to be clear
I I'm very excited for Apple to create
its own smart speaker and enter the race
for sure it's a matter of like it's the
context of the show and and the amount
of catching up or not catching up they
did during that announcement so in and
calling it a music just basically a
speaker but you were okay with that one
they fir cuz of the positioning of it
right no I understand it from a business
perspective why they would do that that
makes sense but it's not we know that we
as tech experts know that that's not
what they're creating here they are
creating a smart speaker so yeah it must
have been very disappointing for
developer
is to not get access to it yes and they
will eventually have one quick question
yes you got to cut you out go ahead I
just wanted to know to everybody who's
listening do you think Apple had a wall
of just random names that they threw
darts at when they named all their
products uh-huh it's well well well
first of all you know that first of all
the dart wall there's half of the room
that all had eyes on it okay like I
blank I this and then and then the other
in naming that home pod the other half
just had pot at the end because they're
like well the iPod is our history it's
our music product we have to keep the
pod somehow in there that's not a pod
that's a speaker but okay we'll call it
a pod and then they had all these other
names on it right but let's let's all
get guess a sound pod was probably one
of them music pod boombox smart pot Jim
you want to throw your name in the head
you want to throw out a name with pot at
the end ooh I would just say the pod pod
pod Quattro I have a prole I have a pod
oh wait why am i doing yes catchy hey
it's engrained in hey Jim thanks so much
for calling we appreciate that all right
and thanks for watching
awesome all right we're gonna jump over
again we're gonna kind of keep on
getting through some of these calls and
just see where you guys are at I'm gonna
take on this call welcome to the show
name where you're from and let us know
what you want to talk about what's up
brother what's up hey ladies hi hello
who's this how are you doing oh I'm just
talking about that home power situation
yeah child through a throwback vessel
you know how we used to have phone calls
all right Amazon is doing the same thing
everybody is doing right back to the 90s
that's always going on right now the
grace time is a really nice nineties
kids are running things right now oh
it's true ya know what's happening was
truly happening is that they're really
really trying to introduce something
because what's happening is on dock
Podcast on that situation what they
trying to do is like grat learn you know
machine learning trying to grab people
in so they can analyze everything we're
going on first and about 325 is it 325
three here that 349 price range is for
people that can afford that range yep
that they can do a lot of learn machine
learning and all that type of situation
right now for that stuff that's what
they're trying to accomplish right now
all right doc their main goal yeah are
you a customer are you someone that how
does how about this does that appeal to
you or not you know as a consumer
whether your application or not you saw
what they just announced does that
product right now as it stands appeal to
you like would you buy it or you're more
on the fence or you're like no no it's
not that I won't buy it is just that it
appeals for somebody that is looking for
more towards you know somebody is you
know certain amount of income and
they're looking for either flexibility
they're looking for you know somebody
that can basically touch you know like
alright I could just talk to my speaker
I'm good just kind of like the Amazon
echo yeah but the Amazon echo has a
learning and I think they throw in they
have some form of more machine learning
then you know and apples trying to get
into it but they haven't there's a lot
of they have a lot of wealth and they
people are aware of that of their wealth
and that's what's happening and they're
going into that motion of saying we have
to first introduce the audio aspect and
the microphone inside the speaker itself
for the whole pie and that's the first
thing they need to do in order to get
the you know the machine learning first
yeah well you know what density but you
guys know you guys are aware of it yeah
we and we'll see we'll see where it goes
I think that thanks so much for calling
I think it's it's a great point of like
yeah Apple prices it at a certain point
specifically because they try to cater
to a specific audience purely based on
their price point they've always done
that quite honestly they've been a
little more um actually more competitive
in general but still not you know
competitive what the rest of the market
is putting out there so I you know even
there Apple watch they drop the price
you know to make it a little more
affordable I think what is it at 229
which I think the Apple watch - 248
launching the original one came out of
like 349 and I'm like and that's like
come on are you serious and so they're
aware of it but at the same time when a
new product and it's a new platform that
comes out they like to price it high
they like to appeal to basically their
high-end users which tend to have more
disposable income and they're they're
not they're not bashful about at all
they've never been so thanks for calling
we appreciate that I'm gonna take in the
next line welcome to seeing that live
this is Brian Sharon and Lexi welcome to
show what's up where you what's your
name are you from
hey I'm Justin I'm actually from Canada
Oh Canada
what up Justin welcome to the show when
you want to talk about um I don't want
to say some real quick I was actually
really disappointed with majority of the
show i I thought there would have been a
whole bunch of updates to the OS there
was barely anything for developers
there's barely anything for consumers
Maps barely even has showcase yeah I
agree with you you know when we were
talking about earlier in the show they
were speeding 3-2 through things that
felt like they were speeding through
things it was and we knew that they had
a lot to announce it felt like they were
showing off a few features that
consumers like you mean might might or
might not care about but it didn't cater
to the developers and I'm not asking
them to get into a nitty gritty like
session about Swift and coding and and
whatnot but I don't know if they and
maybe these workshops on the side a lot
of times after the keynote it's the
workshops that happened behind the
scenes that appealed to developers and
teach them about these hooks I don't
know if that's going to answer any
questions specifically about the home
pod they're there I'm most like it will
not have any type of workshops off the
side about the home pod you know and
when there's new hardware you want to
know how you can develop for it are you
I I'm an iPad pro user did you like any
of that stuff they were showing off with
a pencil you're like it just not for me
because you don't use an iPad pro um
personally I don't use the pen myself
but one thing that stood out for me is
that I absolutely loved with
or filing system mm-hmm and again that
was the only thing that really stood out
for me really all right well I think
that we can count your vote as a
disappointed WWDC keynote viewer is that
correct that is absolutely correct
all right thanks so much for college as
we appreciate all right thank you I'll
be sure some thank you okay we're gonna
jump in here let's try and get this call
here welcome to see that live welcome to
the crew you're on what's up hello hey
yeah I'm fine
hello what's your name where you from
yeah I'm come on yeah my name is Antone
Colin vapor yeah I'm calling from India
Bangalore India Wow also if you turn the
volume on your computer down and just
talk to us through the phone then you'll
be able to talk to us like real-time
what do you want to talk about after
this kena so I'm talking about a
consumer point of view it's a real
disappointing for me as I was really
expecting a lot more changes in the is
11 as it marks the 10th at it marks a
tenth anniversary for applo so I was
expecting a lot of changes in a and
again to face in iOS 11 oh you wanted to
see maybe a new design yeah a new design
a new interface does a lot there was a
huge rumor of dark mode and yes yes many
many people are waiting for dark mode
but it didn't came out so I was actually
waiting for dark mode till the last
moment but it didn't came out so that's
real disappointing and and of course new
new interface new new iPhone design
because it's basically the same same
interface since six to seven years now
and there's not a huge and there's not
there's not huge amount of changes it
has been done yet
so I was thinking about some new overall
new changes but settings came out
there's a very very little change that
has been done from iOS 10 511 so that's
the thing
they're talking about the VAR project
and so those things are also a little is
similar to the project tango and the
proactive theory thing is also similar
to Google now that is now two years old
thing so it is not anything that much
noon is apart from the MacBook Pro and
all but there's nothing on new
innovative tech innovative what about
what about the $4,999 ironman a crier I
mean can't we all get around that can't
we all just dig into our wallets and
just come up with 4900 honestly I think
that for video AR VR professionals I
would think that this show is very
exciting for them they're you know so
but for the general consumer base
besides a smart speaker I think you made
some great points there I mean talking
about kind of the interface design and
the lack of options that we've been
thinking about wanting a lot for a long
time such as dark mode I mean I mean
just interested to know like urine I'm
assuming you're tied into the Apple
ecosystem quite deeply like is this
making you more or less excited for an
upcoming hardware release like the
iPhone later on this year are you going
to be thinking about upgrading knowing
that it's gonna look like iOS 11 except
the outsides gonna be different well
actually he would answer if I didn't
accidentally drop this whole time I
don't want to interrupt you I wanted you
to continue on with the question and
then I would break the news to you the
next so um we're sorry but yeah so he
won't be angry no that's an email and on
and on that note yeah
on that note everybody uh we have to run
there are so many more you guys that
guys and gals that called we're sorry
that we can't get all the lines are
still full but we're going to wrap
things up here at Cena
live make sure you go to our break downs
we have people inside the WWDC keynote
that will have first looks at videos of
whatever they're showing us over there
maybe there's a
home pod behind glass I don't think it's
behind glass I can see people tweeting
they touch it is also stations for some
video you I don't even know so anyways
