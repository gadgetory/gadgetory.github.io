intelligent interface that reimagines
the user explodable user experience
Bixby understands context it knows
what's happening on your screen which
allows you to seamlessly move between
voice and touch let me show you what I
mean
let's say my friend Cindy is meeting me
for lunch and I have to tell her my
location all I have to do is open up
Maps press the convenient bixby button
on the side of the phone and say capture
this and send to Cindy Bigsby
understands when I say capture this
that's context awareness now let's say I
have multiple Cindy's in my phone Oh
Bigsby smart enough to know when it
needs more information and it will let
me choose which what I mean then I can
finish up with touch by selecting the
right person typing in the message and
sending it off the whole time I move
seamlessly between voice and touch with
Bixby we've built intelligence into the
camera so it understands what we're
seeing and thanks to our partners you
can search for images learn about
landmarks shop online and even translate
languages now whenever I come back to
New York I love looking for new
restaurants data so this past weekend I
was roaming around some old
neighborhoods and I came across the
Flatiron Building I pulled out my camera
and Bixby recognized it but it also gave
me some great options for dining nearby
let's take another example shopping
online shopping if you see something you
want to buy just point the camera at it
and Bixby will find it from one of our
partners with voice and vision Bixby
helps you get things done in an easy
do it away but Bixby also learns and
adapts to your routine to anticipate
what you need when you swipe to the
right on the home screen Bixby takes you
to a contextual personalized page that
shows you the information you use from
the apps you use on in one convenient
place you'll see a series of cards for
native apps like email and gallery and
third-party apps like Facebook and
Oberer and fixme will organize these
cards based on where you are and what
time it is in the morning you might see
news and weather and at night your alarm
and step count and the more you use it
the more it learns so let's say I take
uber most days to work in the morning
Bixby will start placing the uber card
at the very top of the stock picks
peoplesupport native apps and
third-party apps like google play music
just think for example you might be able
to play any song from Google's catalogue
using just your voice or access your
music library with a swipe to the right
or even set a reminder for when a new
album drops now let's talk about some
other ways that Samsung helps you in
your life Samsung has been committed to
the Internet of Things from the very
