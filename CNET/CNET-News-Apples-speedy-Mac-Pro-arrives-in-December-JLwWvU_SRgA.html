matte pro as you know we gave a sneak
peek at our developer conference this
June and it's not a stretch to say
people have been blown away by this
incredible new design it's anodized
aluminum enclosure with diamond cut
chamfered edges so many innovations like
the cooling system that is a single fan
the previous generation had 8 fans in it
or the innovation of the unified thermal
core at its center it is a computer that
packs an incredible amount of power into
something that's one eighth the volume
of the previous generation that's simply
remarkable it is our vision of the
future of the pro desktop and today we'd
like to tell you even more about it so
inside this new generation Mac Pro is
the fastest processor we've ever put in
a Mac a new generation intel xeon e5
comes in 4 6 8 or 12 core designs 30
megabyte l3 caches superfast buses a pci
express generation 3 bus inside it is
the fastest memory we have ever put in a
Mac 1866 megahertz ddr3 ECC memory on a
broad for channel controller massive
bandwidth and up to 64 gigabytes inside
probably one of the most remarkable
things about this machine the team set a
goal to have a breakthrough in graphics
it's the first Mac that comes standard
with dual workstation graphics AMD
firepro d300 d500 or d700 graphics fast
buses huge amount of vram up to 12
gigabytes over half a terabyte of
bandwidth to it and up to seven
teraflops of compute power that's power
that can be used both for graphics as
well as for compute intensive tasks
using the opencl technology that Craig
mentioned earlier
storage inside is to all flash based
simply put you cannot put a hard drive
in anymore that's as fast as this flash
this pcie-based generation of flash is
ten times faster than a hard drive if we
put one in 1.2 gigabyte per second reads
a gigabyte per second writes up to a
terabyte of flash storage it's an
incredible storage system if you want to
expand it what's Toro expansion begins
with Thunderbolt 2 can add expansion
chassis storage arrays and so much more
its massive throughput it can bond them
together with channel bonding kind of up
to six to six devices per port and this
is the heart of being able to create a
true next-generation video work through
model with a desktop computer for cavity
4k video 16 times the pixels of 1080p HD
video you can have up to two displays
plus a third HDMI display for broadcast
monitoring there's never been a system
that can do what the Mac Pro will be
able to do for 4k video expansion it has
a really cool feature when you move it
there's a motion controller and the
aisle illuminates to show your way and
there's a lot of great i/o dual audio
out for us b-36 Thunderbolt 2 dual
Gigabit Ethernet the new generation HDMI
up to 4k Bluetooth 4.0 802 11 AC this is
packed and built for expansion and we
can't wait to get this enhance of more
customers so they can show us what they
can do with it so the new Mac Pro will
cost 2999 and that's for configuration
with a 3.7 gigahertz quad-core xeon 12
gigabytes of ultra-fast d ram dual
firepro d300 s with two gigs of video
memory each and a quarter terabyte of
high-speed SSD now if you know what
d300s costs and that high-speed flash
you're actually super impressed with
this pricing
it'll be available before the end of the
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
