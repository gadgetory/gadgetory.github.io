interesting new camera tricks on its
latest smartphones including one that
makes very good use of a sheep so the
first one to talk about is micro video
so this is basically a little tool for
shooting those really really brief
little videos you press this button here
it starts recording you can lift and put
it back down to keep recording from a
different angle something else is quite
neat about that is that when you review
your footage if you press the mechanical
button on the side here and hold it you
can take photos in a burst mode that
mechanical button is actually what
alcatel calls the boom key and if you
want you can program it so that when you
press it it fires up the camera so it's
just a really quick way of getting to
taking some photos next I wanna talk
about this confusingly spelled fuse mode
so this is a sort of kind of cross
between panorama and a sort of light
version of PR so if you press it to
start taking your panorama and then move
around like this now it takes all that
information stitches it together you get
this rather snazzy animation and sorry
what you're left with is this video
panorama that you can move around inside
of like this by tilting your phone now
we saved the best for last this is my
personal favorite it's these little
sounds so that when you're taking a
photo you can get the attention of
everyone in the picture with this range
of noises so for example
I think you'll agree that farmyard
animals aren't often enough integrated
into cutting-edge technology so well
done alcatel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
