from cnet here at Mobile World Congress
2012 in Barcelona this is the sous
padfone and padfone station it's a lot
like the transformer prime and that it
gives you this nice phone that you can
then slide into a docking station and
yet either a tablet-like functionality
or even the kind of like a laptop
functionality almost there not a lot of
processing you can do on here but it
does give you this keyboard so you can't
buy them separately or together the
phone itself is a nice ice cream
sandwich phone it is Ice Cream Sandwich
very native and plain style no skins on
top of that so if you like this pure
experience then you are going to like
this phone the PadFone runs off of a
Qualcomm dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
processor the tablet itself has a 10.1
inch screen with 1280 x 800 pixels
there's also an 8 megapixel camera on
that when you use the PadFone with it
and a same thing with the front-facing
1.3 megapixel camera so all that is
taking advantage of the phone here let's
say that you want to respond on email
somewhere take notes during a meeting
play your video and you can use the
station as sort of a stand so you will
enlarge it instead of having 4.3 inches
to view your videos you'll have 10.1
inches and everything will be stored on
the phone itself optionally you can pick
up this extra accessory it is the stylus
headset and while it does work as a
stylist you'll also be able to press a
button and via bluetooth it will answer
your phone call if your phone rings
while it's docked so will be available
in early q2 that will be 2012 and it's
going to be available in europe and asia
and yes even the US no pricing yet but
keep your papers on cnet com and we'll
give you all the information we have as
soon as we have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
