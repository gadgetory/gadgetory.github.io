it and with me is the Panasonic TCP 55
GT 50 this is a 55 inch plasma TV this
is Panasonic's second best series of
plasma TVs for 2012 series also comes in
a 50 a 60 and a 65 inch size this review
will apply to all of them as Panasonic's
second best series this TV does include
quite a bit of bells and whistles the
principal one is thx video processing so
if you put this thing in thx bright room
or thx cinema mode or when you're in 3d
thx 3d cinema you get a pretty good
almost calibrated picture without having
to mess with any of the picture control
so that's the real benefit of this TV
over the step-down st 50 series this tvs
styling is also a little bit slicker
than that one it's got a nice thin bezel
around the screen here there's also a
sort of chrome accent around the very
edge so all told it's one of the nicer
looking plasma TVs we've seen we're not
big fans of the stand however it does
have this sort of weird two-tone look to
it of course hang this thing on the wall
that's not a problem
Panasonic glues plenty of inputs there's
four HDMI around back in addition to a
pc input and a component video input
although you need to do breakout cables
for that component input it's also a
smart TV suite on this TV we do like the
design of that Smart TV there is plenty
of video services available as well
including Netflix Vudu Amazon video
on-demand so all told the content
selection is very good there's also this
Viera marketplace that Panasonic uses to
get other apps and things and we do find
the quality of those apps are a little
bit better than some of the other
competitors out there although there
aren't that many of them the GT 50 does
have plenty of ways to adjust the
picture there's this custom mode that
allows you to go in and play with the
two-point grayscale as well as a couple
gamma settings it doesn't have the
10-point at full color management system
found on the step-up VT 50 however
picture quality on the GT 50 was superb
it's really one of the best-looking
plasma TVs we've tested this year almost
as good as the VT 50 but also at the
same level of the ST 50 which is a
little bit less expensive that does
bring up an interesting question if
you're in the market for a panasonic
plasma TV whether you get the GT or the
ST this one it's a little bit more
expensive the only real benefit is that
thx picture setting but when we went in
and calibrated the picture of this TV we
found
we could actually get a better picture
than thx using just the custom settings
so all told we do recommend the St 50
for most people you do get the nice deep
black levels this set as well as the
accurate color there's also a very good
ambient light rejection filter on the
screen so if you have some bright lights
in the room it's going to perform a lot
better than a lot of the other plasmas
out there of course compared to LCDs you
also get the benefit of excellent off
angle and screen uniformity performance
so again excellent performer but just
not quite as good a value as the S 250
we also took a look at the 3d
performance so this said it is a 3d
television panasonic does not including
glasses however but 3d performance is
pretty darn good as long as you leave it
in the THX 3d cinema mode and turn it to
48 Hertz which actually eliminates some
of the crosstalk we saw in some of the
other picture settings all told though a
very good 3d performer that's a quick
look at Panasonic's TCP GT 50 series and
I'm David Kessler</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
