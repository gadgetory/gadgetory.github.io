let's see what's free for the last month
of December this month's games are well
they're a bit underwhelming but you're
probably still busy playing everything
that came out in November anyway here's
what's free for playstation playstation
3's got it the best this month by far
for free in december is far cry 3 blood
dragon that's that campy 80s inspired
wacky first-person shooter ps3 owners
also get SSX that's the insanely fun and
over-the-top action snowboarding game
which i really hope they bring to
current consoles at some point on
playstation 4 players can get chapter
one of kings quest for free along with
the Slayer edition of gauntlet two
titles make up the PlayStation Vita's
free games for December the Japanese
action RPG freedom wars is free and so
is rocket birds hard-boiled edition
don't laugh well you could laugh but
this 2d action platformer is actually a
lot of fun I really love it okay let's
move over to the Xbox universe for the
month of December xbox one owners can
play the incredible adventures of van
helsing which to my surprise actually
got some decent reviews when it was
released and then from December 16th to
january fifteenth thief becomes free on
xbox one and i did not like that game at
all things aren't much better for the
xbox 360 for the first half of the month
the slingshot physics game castlestorm
is free and then for the second half of
December the action RPG sacred 3 is also
free also up for no charge the second
half of the month is operation
flashpoint dragon rising which is an
open-world military shooter and that'll
take care of it for december free games
as always a tiny caveat you do of course
need to be a member of playstation plus
and xbox live gold to access these three
games and those memberships do cost a
little bit of money but for the most
part they're worth it maybe not for
december but for other months they're
worth it
that will be it for this month I'll be
back in January for a brand new list of
games hopefully it's better than this
month I'll see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
