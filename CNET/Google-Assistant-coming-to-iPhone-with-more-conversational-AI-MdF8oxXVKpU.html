my phone stem from what I see a business
card I want to save details from a
receipt I need to track and so on
with google lens my assistant will be
able to help with those kinds of tasks -
I love live music and sometimes I see
info for shows around town that look
like fun now I can just tap the google
lens icon and point the camera at the
vet Markey my assistant instantly red
eyes is what I'm looking at now if I
wanted to I could tap to hear some of
this band songs and my assistant offers
other helpful suggestions right in the
viewfinder there's one to buy tickets
from tick Astor and another to add the
show to my calendar with just a tap my
assistant adds the concert details to my
schedule saving event save stone foxes
for May 17th at 9 p.m. awesome
my assistant helped me keep track of the
event so I won't miss the show and I
didn't have to open a bunch of apps or
type anything thanks Ibrahim so that's
how the assistant is getting better at
conversation by understanding language
and voices with new input choices and
with the power of google lens second the
assistant is becoming a more connected
experience that's available everywhere
you need help from your living room to
your morning jog from your commute to
errands around town your assistant
should know how to use all of your
connected devices for your benefit now
we're making good progress and bring the
assistant to those two billion phones
and other devices powered by Android
like TVs wearables and car systems and
today I'm excited to announce that the
Google assistant is now available on the
iPhone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
