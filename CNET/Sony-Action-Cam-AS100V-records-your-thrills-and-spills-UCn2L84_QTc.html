taking a slice of the action Kampai but
maybe third time's the charm
I'm Lexus Avedis for Sina this is a
review of the sony action cam is 100 V
if you're familiar with any of the
shotgun style action cameras from Sony
then the a s 100 feet won't come is too
much of a surprise except that now it's
in white the body is also splash proof
and of course if you want to have full
waterproofing you can get the optional
deep dive case that goes down to 60
meters or the standard 5 meter case that
comes with the camera operation is
fairly simple there is a giant record
button on the back of the camera open up
the flap and this reveals the battery
compartment as well as the microSD slot
at the front there is a previous and
next button you can use these in
combination with a record button at the
back to change between options with a
firmware update you can also use this
camera to livestream to use stream and
there's within the actual menus
themselves you can set the recording
mode of video to be either a regular 28
megabit per second now this is a
standard kind of video or if you want to
have what sony is calling the pro mode
this ups your bitrate to 50 megabits per
second and it should give you a higher
quality video as well you also now get a
really useful little adapter now you
screw this as a bottom of the camera and
then you can use it without the optional
casing if you want to mount it on
certain accessories though not all also
with some of the configurations of the
action cam denoted by a s100 VR you get
an included live view remote now this
has a built-in battery charger over
microUSB and you've got a power switch a
couple of buttons to change some
settings and a record button now this
attaches with Velcro and it slips over
your wrist and obviously you can do a
bunch of things with it but it's really
quite limited because you can't review
or playback any of the photos or videos
you've taken really only use this to
control up to five cameras at a time
that is 5 action cameras or look at the
live stream from recordings so if you
want to actually have that full
functionality of playback - you want to
use the app now speaking of the app
there is Wi-Fi and GPS onboard in this
camera as well as NFC for Android phones
easy one tap configuration now - the
all-important photo and video quality on
the regular 28 megabits per second
recording mode that's probably what
you're going to be using it most of the
time at either 60 or 30 frames a second
in 1080p quality is decent if you put it
side-by-side with something like the
GoPro Hero 3 plus you're going to notice
that exposures are probably a little bit
more dynamic on the Sony that means it's
a lot more contrast II and there's a lot
more areas where there are blown out
highlights as well the GoPro is a little
bit more even however if you change
things to the 15 megabit per second
recording mode image quality becomes a
lot better as you would expect compared
to the GoPro the trunk card of the Sony
is its image stabilization which makes
all the difference especially when
you're shooting moving subjects shooting
handheld when you're walking and so on
the other thing with the Sony that is
slightly problematic is that you have to
use micro SDXC cards in order to record
that X ABC s or that 50 megabit per
second high bitrate video as always if
you want to see more text and video
samples from this particular camera you
