welcome to the Apple by the place to be
for everything good and bad inside the
world of Apple and I'm just happy I'm
spending this moment with you alright
let's get to the show and the reviews
are in for the ipad air it's getting
praise from the technorati across the
board for its thinner and lighter design
that you really have to feel to
understand while retaining its
impressive battery life now it was the
highlight of the keynote for me so let's
check out cnet's review of the ipad air
hi everybody i'm tim stevens and this is
the fifth generation ipad it's the
biggest refresh to the ipad since the
second generation came out in fact it's
such a big change to the design that
they've gone ahead and changed the name
so meet the ipad air it still has the
same 9.7 inch retina display up front
that you've seen in the fourth
generation and earlier generation is of
the ipad but this generation is
critically twenty percent thinner and
forty percent lighter that may not sound
like big numbers but actually it is a
very noticeable difference let me pick
up and hold this tablet it's incredibly
light and incredibly thin much more so
than before it really feels great much
more close to the ipad mini than indeed
to the fourth generation and the
previous generation ipads that came
before it has the a7 processor which we
just saw introduced in the iphone 5s
which is a 64-bit chip which gives
really great performance we've actually
seen noticeable improvements over the
fourth-generation ipad which itself was
quite a performer now we've got the same
selection of ports as before which is
basically just one port the Lightning
port on the bottom of the device we do
now have stereo speakers which is great
however they're both still located on
the bottom of the tablet we would have
liked to see one of the speakers
situated on the top so that when you
hold it sideways and watch a movie
you'll get proper stereo separation
overall we're really big fans of the new
iPad air it's nothing really that
drastically different over the fourth
generation but the thinness and
lightness do make it much more of a
portable tablet than before you barely
will even notice it in your bag in terms
of the competition it certainly does
stack up pretty well in terms of specs
and performance however it's still a
fairly expensive tablet starting at 499
for the 16 gigabyte version and going up
one hundred dollars each as you go to 32
64 and 128 gigabytes if you like the 3g
or LTE
versions of the tablet you can give
those for an additional one hundred
thirty dollars each again pricing very
similar to the fourth-generation iPad
thanks for that deep dive Tim now just
in case you wanted to see if the air
lives up to apples claims that it's
about twice as fast as the 4th gen ipad
John pool of primate labs posted the
Geekbench 3 benchmarks for the new ipad
air revealing apples 64-bit a7 processor
running at one point 4 gigahertz and
scoring a 1465 in the single core test
and a 2643 on the multi-core test now
fast don't lie and truth be told with
these specific benchmarks it's over
eighty percent faster and this is really
the most impressive ipad yet even
without touch ID except they should
still call it the ipad pencil
introducing the thinner lighter more
powerful ipad air and you know it's a
good thing Walter White was able to do
the voiceover before well you know say
my name alright apple announced their
financial results earlier this week for
the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013 the
highlights apple sold a record 150
million iphones on the year up 25
million from 2012 it also sold a record
71 million iPads in the fiscal year for
2013 now the lowlights apple sold just
over 16 million max its lowest total
since 2010 and 26 million ipods its
lowest since 2005 now there's always
some nuggets of info to pull out from
the Q&amp;amp;A session afterwards they're
having plenty of reports that claim
apples retina iPad Mini will be in short
supply and when Tim Cook was asked the
question he said he was unclear whether
the big a will have enough supplies to
meet the demand translation guys it will
be in short supply now Koch didn't give
a firm release date and it's still set
for November you know that's also known
as Movember the month-long event where
people grow up their mustaches to raise
awareness for prostate cancer and you
know I'm thinking of growing out 12 and
never shaving it until the retina iPad
Mini comes out and that could be a long
time
Shh truth now Tim Cook was also asked
how Apple plans to address the lower
price segments of the smartphone market
and he said we're selling the iphone for
us as our entry offer we sell the iphone
5c as a mid-tier and the 5s our goal is
to have growth across the iphone ok Tim
that answers that and cook also confirm
because really he can't stop talking
about the fact that Apple still plans on
introducing new product categories
within 2014 and yes we know those two
categories are a TV and Apple's own
SmartWatch now sticking with the iWatch
talk according to the korea herald LG is
reportedly close to a deal with Apple to
provide o LED displays for their
upcoming wearable bracelet that can tell
time now the report also says that right
X obsidia right display will be the key
supplier for the rumored 1.5 inch screen
with LG being the second supplier let's
check out the quick bites an apple is
told the New York Times that a
manufacturing defect is responsible for
some battery issues in some iphone 5s
devices that could cause the battery to
take longer to charge or result in
reduced battery life the big a wasn't
specific about the number of phones
affected suggesting that it affects only
a few thousand but they will replace the
defective 5 s's with new ones an apple
is sending a set of Mac Pro posters to a
few members of the press including
cnet's own Scott Stein in New York now
here he is posing with them both of them
and I'm not jealous at all because who
really needs a really cool limited
poster on their wall of the mac pro nope
not me not jealous at all alright that's
gonna do it for this week's show send me
your questions and comments to the Alpha
Beta cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
i'll get to as many as i can thanks so
much for watching we'll catch you guys
next time for another bite of the Apple
