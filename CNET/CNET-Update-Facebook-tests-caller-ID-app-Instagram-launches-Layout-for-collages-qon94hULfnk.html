to put on your phone I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update facebook is
working on another way to weave itself
into your phone calls the social network
is testing an Android app called phone
in the description it provides caller ID
and automatic call blocking from
commonly blocked numbers essentially the
network is leveraging its enormous
database of more than a billion users to
match phone numbers with names telling
you who is calling even if you don't
know them now Facebook confirmed the
existence of the app after screenshots
were linked and posted to the blog
android police it seems it's only being
tested right now among Facebook
employees we don't have many details
Facebook already lets you make video
calls from your computer and voice calls
to friends on the messenger chat app
this caller ID test takes things a step
further now it's possible the phone app
may never be released but technically
Facebook did just launch another app
today instagram which facebook owns has
a new app for Apple iOS devices called
layout from Instagram the separate app
lets you combine multiple photos into a
single image there will be an android
version in the coming months facebook is
holding its annual Developers Conference
Wednesday and Thursday Mark Zuckerberg
may not talk about that experimental
phone app but he is expected to present
some changes to the network that mailer
in app developers to connect their
services and advertising more with
Facebook some speculate that Facebook
could talk about virtual reality it's a
hot topic lately in gaming and it's been
one year since the social network bought
oculus one of the leading companies in
the space and you can expect to hear
Zuckerberg talk about new features in
the messenger app that make it easier
for outside apps to be tied into
facebook's chat service standalone chat
apps are a big area with big competition
from snapchat and we chat and of course
facebook now owns whatsapp with 700
million users around the world just a
few days ago Facebook announced the
messenger app is adding a new feature to
let you send money to friends meanwhile
the mobile payment company Square has a
new way to send money to friends or
businesses the square cash app has been
a way for you to send money for
free to your friends transferring money
from your debit card account but now you
can create a special URL link called a
cache tag for anyone to give you money
it's a username with a dollar sign in
front it's a simple way to collect money
online when you're selling something to
strangers or asking for donations and
businesses can also set up accounts with
a unique cash tag name small businesses
will be charged a 1.5% processing fee
for this debit money transfer which is
cheaper than the two points 75% fee
Square charges for using its card
