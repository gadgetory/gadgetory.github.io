been putting big engines in their cars
and natural materials like wood metal
and leather in the cabins but now
there's this idea that city dwellers
want a smaller luxury car Acura's answer
to this question is the 2016 ILX now
this is the smallest car wearing an
acura badge and it's based on the Civic
Platform and that's not a bad thing it's
got a relatively small engine and
instead of old-growth timber and hand of
fur in the cabin acura tries to make
this a premium or luxury car with
high-tech features for example acura
fits the ILX
with these LED headlights that's a
standard feature not an option it's not
something you really see in the compact
segment the cabin of this acura ILX
feels kind of like a high trim standard
car rather than a luxury car premium car
we do have soft touch materials on the
dashboard this is nice metallic trim
here no wood of course and the suede
seats here in the console here I've got
the 8-speed dual-clutch automated manual
transmission now that's one at a
high-tech feature that puts us in that
premium category I've got my standard
Park reverse neutral Drive and a sport
mode plus I've got paddles on the
steering wheel here that will get how
that works in a minute I've got my
infotainment Center in the dashboard
here or here or well I've got two
screens and a set of buttons a very
confusing system so I push one of these
buttons down here does it do anything to
this screen it does something to this
screen up here these buttons control
this screen touchscreen is in the middle
of it all and has no relation to any of
these things another example of bad
design here I'm looking at my audio
control screen here I've got satellite
radio up right now I can choose
different stations that's cool I pushed
this audio button here and I get another
screen for my audio sources my audio
control up here which I can control with
this so which one do I use and they're
totally different formats to which it's
just I mean that's just bad design I've
got a decent navigation system here hard
drive based so the maps load pretty
quickly a live traffic and little route
around traffic dam so that's good a
hands-free phone system that's hooked up
to my phone through bluetooth audio
sources I can choose
from this screen here or this screen
here HD FM I've got a hard disk which I
can store music on a USB port for iOS
devices and drives Bluetooth audio
Pandora and aha for right app
connectivity another example on the
instrument cluster here I've got to
display and I've got a green label that
says lkas that sends for lane-keeping
assistant systems that's one of the
high-tech features of this car
so it's green that should tell me it's
on but I actually have to push this
button on the steering wheel it lights
up these little Lane lines on the
display and that actually means it's on
that I have a button on the left side
down here that's the road departure
mitigation system it's a different
system but kind of similar and so these
buttons are all over the place with
different labels I'd really have to read
the manual to understand how to work
this at all out of the hood we have a
2.4 liter 4-cylinder engine that's
driving the front wheels this engine has
direct injection which is a nice modern
piece of efficiency technology but we
only get 201 horsepower 180 pound feet
of torque out of this engine sand that
hugely powerful fuel economy comes in
about 25 miles per gallon city 35 miles
per gallon highway average is gonna be
about 30 miles per gallon not bad now
there's no idle stop feature on this car
and that might save some fuel the
suspension here is pretty comfortable
accurate does a good job with that it's
also pretty stable in the corners that
when you're pushing it in a bit but one
thing I noticed is a lot of engine noise
here a lot of sound in the cabin and
that just tells me that a cure didn't
really put a lot of sound dampening
materials here which is kind of a shame
because it really brings down the
apparent quality of this car the ride
quality of the car one thing I do get
though that is premium are a lot of
driver assistance features I've got a
blind spot monitor system so that
flashes little icons in the side mirrors
if there are cars in my blind spots
either side that's a nice feature to
have
and with that lane-keeping assist in
system i pointed out earlier this cart
will actually recognize the lane lines
and i'll actually turn the wheel a bit
under my hands so it does some of the
work of keeping the car in its lane but
it is very close to being a self-driving
car the base price for this model goes
to twenty thousand eight hundred twenty
dollars that's with destination factor
doesn't really do individual options so
this car with the technology plus
package and with the a spec package that
puts it at thirty-five thousand eight
hundred and ten dollars with destination
now the cabin tech in this model is not
nearly as good as an audi a3 a
competitive compact luxury model but the
driver assistance features are really
good the cabin is a bit noisy though and
that's what really keeps this car from
hitting that luxury or premium level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
