toshiba's 50l 2300 you this set is also
available in a 39 inch size this review
will apply to both this is one it's a
Shiva's least expensive TVs for 2013
doesn't have any smart TV or any of
those extra doodads but it does have 120
Hertz refresh rate although it's a
little bit problematic and we get to
that in a little bit but first let's
take a look at the main thing you might
have notice about this TV it's two-tone
styling it's got silver on the bottom
here along the bottom of the panel
itself as well as a matching silver
stand in this little pedestal it seems a
little flimsy but it's plain strong in
person doesn't allow the panel to swivel
however the rest of the TV is a standard
glossy black relatively thick border
around the edge and it's actually pretty
thick when you look at it on the side
that's because it's a direct led not an
edge-lit model speaking of the edges
they are pretty curved so all told one
of the nicer looking budget TVs you're
going to find the one standout feature
on the spec sheet is 120 hertz but
toshiba's flavor doesn't really behave
like 120 hertz TV it really produces no
picture quality benefit none of that
blurring reduction or even film based
kids that we prefer to see 120 Hertz TVs
it behaves more like a 60 Hertz
television so that's what we're going to
call it to achieve equip the AL 2300
with generally basic picture settings
but there is a color management system
and a couple of tweaks you can do to
grayscale as well as the ability to just
different picture mode so that's pretty
nice connectivity is ample with three
HDMI one component video even a pc input
there's also a USB port but that only
really plays back photo and music not
video now despite its relatively low
price we don't consider the l 2300 a
great value that's because it's picture
quality was a little bit disappointing
produces pretty light black levels it
also has that 120 hertz processing issue
we talked about earlier where it doesn't
really behave like a hundred twenty
Hertz TV more like a 60 Hertz model
there's also a pretty glossy reflective
coating on the screen here so it's not
going to be as nice in a bright room
some of the other matte screens we've
seen the flip side it does have
relatively accurate color and we did
appreciate the uniform screen which is a
direct result of having those LEDs
behind the screens opposed along the
edge I'll tell whoever you can't find a
better picture and more features in this
price range that's a quick look at
toshiba's l 2300 you led
