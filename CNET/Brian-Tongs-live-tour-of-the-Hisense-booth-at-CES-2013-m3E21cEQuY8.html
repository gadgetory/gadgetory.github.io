inside the show floor at CES 2013 and
you know we know CES hack actually
hasn't opened yet but we want to give
you an inside look of what's happening
inside while all this setup is going on
you still see a lot of bright lights a
lot of big things here so we want to
take you and when you enter the central
hall one of the first entries you get
into is the intel booth there are always
really super colorful we know Intel's
processors are inside of a lot of the
devices here so yes so we have this
beautiful lovely array of Intel
ultrabooks these are these you know
they're promoting a lot of their
convertible different notebooks from
Dell from Lenovo that they have this is
a tree because we like to see screens
shaped into artful forms right so we're
going to come over here and show you a
lot of the other things right now that
are inside this floor again there's a
lot of setup we have a lot of people
here you see this a lot like five guys
standing in a circle talking about stuff
yeah it's very very interesting okay now
a lot of people may or may not know
right Microsoft no longer here at CES
2013 but instead they've replaced their
booth with spaces from hisense now if
you aren't familiar with hisense their
company out of China and what they're
really trying to do here is accomplished
themselves as a player in the North
American markets right we have the
dominance by sony and samsung and even
LG korean and japanese manufacturers
that have really made their made a
strong solid you know market their
market players here in the US but
hisense is trying to show that they can
do it just as well so we're gonna keep
on walking down here you'll see a lot of
great colors here again intel kind of
using this pink blue orange array that
is it's always really attractive but I
at the intel booth it's really they're
just showing off their technology that's
inside other products where a lot of
these other boots like hisense are
showing products they actually have so
we have here check this out hisense also
promoting their own new google TV box
think of it as don't like kind of little
mini set-top box running android with a
Google TV platform we are expecting to
still see Google TV is still there guys
it hasn't gone away yet and hi senses
you know making that part of their
offering so we're going to keep on
walking down this way a lot of open
space here are also in boosts you'll see
a lot of production going on where they
make their announcements so over on this
side these are the switchboards &amp;amp; mix
boards for one
do speeches announcements on their big
stage over here you can see hisense with
this huge kind of long wall screen and
all these LEDs that are still getting
ready to get set up but you know it
looks it looks very nice all right we're
gonna keep on going here businessmen
doing business things right all right
also here in Intel again they like to
show off their intel wireless displays
using intel with or with their cameras
here for like you know video
conferencing it's really a lot more I've
noticed this year at CES is they're
using a lot more open space where in the
past they've really crap here when
actual show starts gonna be a little
crank right alright so we're going to
keep on walking get around this corner
just again give you another feel of what
this area looks like before we get there
though I know some of these screens
aren't fully on but this is high census
xt 880 design it reminds me a lot of the
Samsung kind of design with that really
thin bezel and small bezel but again
they're really trying to make themselves
a player here in the US and we'll see
how they do we know David capsa myers
our TV reviews guys so he's going to
tell us everything we need to know and
see if they're really going to be
someone legitimate that we should pay
attention to now we're going to keep on
walking down here I'm gonna do a little
mosey or reverse salsa if you if you
like and go pro how can you deny the
GoPro it's just really carved themselves
a huge niche in the consumer electronics
market really associated themselves with
the kind of extreme action sports and so
they're showing off content that has
been taken from their actual cameras we
know and we're familiar with the fact
that GoPro recently announced our GoPro
3 which is their next generation of
their GoPro camera with a lot higher
resolution capture ability and you know
you can really stick these things on
helmets on your surfboard which I do in
Hawaii which is always fun again here we
go they're setting up this car here they
just move this car in here to show off
I've got imagine this is a race car that
they've used but you know they want to
associate themselves with high energy
high action extreme impact sports there
you have a GoPro now we're also going to
keep on walking down here a little bit
more and one thing if you guys are
watching these videos we have this
little contest called our sprint
hashtag series and what we're doing is
if you see a hashtag like that you need
to follow cnet right in that hashtag
we're going to enter you into a contest
to win a samsung galaxy tab 2 10.1 inch
because we like to give you the goody so
that's something just watch our videos
you'll see that you need it you need it
you need a tweet that hashtag to CNF so
we'll be doing that throughout the
series but other than that you know this
is just kind of an establishing shot of
what we have at the beginning of the
central hall we're going to be at Sony's
booth neck so if you guys have any
questions about what we can expect to
see there I'll answer them on Twitter
we're going to throw it back to a break
we'll be back soon with more coverage
more press conferences and more coverage
from the show floor i'm brian song we'll
see you guys a little later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
