around you are all solar houses so we're
gonna show you this is the before shot
of that house over there so that's what
it looked like before now that's old
solar yeah we've got some close-up shots
so we can show and if you look if you
look carefully you can actually see the
the solar cells behind the glass this is
a textured glass tile if you look
carefully you can see the solar the
solar cells yeah see that so we have a
malfunction on the LED good so all right
so the better house is also solar and
that's a sort of a style above a french
slate which is one of the hardest things
to to do is it's considered one of the
best roofs you can possibly do as a
conventional roof so said well if okay
can we make a french slate roof that's
so low that looks as good or better than
a conventional French slate roof and
we're able to do that as well that's
done with hydrographic printing so each
tile is unique so that it's the
production process itself makes each
tile especially unique is sort of
special snowflake tile the but the nice
thing is like no two roofs will be the
same so it's not just cookie cutter you
can take any two roofs like that and
they will look different because they
are different
this is the so what the French late
hydrographic looks like and see that and
then this the third house is really
transformative guess believe it or not
that's what it looked like before so we
changed the roofings like whoa put that
roof on we got to change the house too
so that that you know that that tile is
is more of a modern look and here you
can really see as the angle changes that
you can see the solar cells so here we
put a film with micro louvers on it so
that as as the angle changes it goes
from transparent to opaque so from the
vantage point of the street or anywhere
near the house it looks completely
opaque but from the Sun it's to the Sun
it's transparent and then probably the
most pricing one is that the Tuscan
tuscan glass so this is also solar
panels but we put two versions of the
the tuscan glass approach all of the
dark tiles have solar panels so we
interleave a dark and light and then the
dark ones are the ones with solar panels
again you can see that the transparency
changes quite a bit so as you from the
sun's vantage point which tends to be
high angle you can see that the sole of
the solar cells but as you change the
angle to shallow angle it reverts to a
sort of a orangey color as a
demonstration video show you what
happens if you drop a drop a big weight
on a conventional roof tile and one of
our glass tiles so so that's the solar
roof weren't just we wanted to look
better last longer provide better
insulation and cost less all things
considered than a conventional roof</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
