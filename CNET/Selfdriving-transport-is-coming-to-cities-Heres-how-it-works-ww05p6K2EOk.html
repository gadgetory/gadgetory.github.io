our trials are designed for first mile
and last mile mobility that means
connecting residential areas to
transport and commercial hubs and that
means elderly disabled users can engage
in independent mobility it also means
that existing residents might choose to
use public transport rather than get
into a privately owned vehicle and have
a better and safer cleaner journey the
technology the vehicle uses is based on
range of different sensors primarily its
vision based but it's used it uses a
lidar map of the environment a laser
based 3d map of the environment to
understand and learn or it needs to
navigate in order to complete its
journey and here in Greenwich
they'll be operating in an unsecured
gated environment so they need
additional software and sensors to be
able to do that that additional
technology is coming from a company
called rocks bots occur in order to
prepare the route for navigation by the
shuttle vehicles octa botique have gone
through a process of creating a 3d laser
point cloud of the environment that
means taking a vehicle equipped with
lasers around the routes we like the
vehicles to travel it uses that point
cloud to learn the route and then its
cameras to navigate and localize once
the room is complete as you can probably
expect we're going to great lengths to
ensure the safety of our trials so we're
doing a lot around the preparation of
the route so we understand what our
potential risks where we likely to
encounter pedestrians at emerging
suddenly or cyclists emerging suddenly
from the route and we can control the
behavior of the vehicle in those
particular environments and we've only
done some limited demonstration trials
so far but in those limited
demonstrations we've seen people are
initially slightly anxious perhaps
you're unsure about how the vehicle is
going to behave but when they see that
the vehicle behaves in a very
predictable way a very safe way it
breaks and steers as they would expect
they learn to enjoy it very very quickly
and I think that's what we'll see in our
trials these automated shuttles if they
work successfully in Greenwich and we
expect them to with
I can be delivering automated services
in cities in the next couple of years it
will be a long time though before we can
see automated vehicles that can do all
of the journeys that a human driver is
currently capable of performing so
there's lots of development work to be
done
