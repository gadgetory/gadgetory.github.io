calm with the official iOS 5 release
from Apple its new core features have
pretty much remained the same from our
other preview videos but there's plenty
more to talk about so we'll show you a
few of the major ones and also dig a
little deeper now this video will not
include a look at Syria which is
available only on iOS 5 for the iPhone
4s so look for our video once that's
available but the first feature that
will impact you the most is
notifications Apple takes a cue from
Android here and you'll just swipe down
from the top to see them but improves on
them with their level of control in your
settings you'll be able to set the order
for notifications displayed also pick
the alert style for the notification to
appear as a banner that will go away the
standard on-screen pop-up or not at all
and there's a weather and stock widget
included as well any app with
notifications can be set up this way
iMessage is Apple's own version of
blackberry messenger and it lets you
send messages to your other friends
using iOS 5 devices without using any
text messages from your cell phone plan
now you'll see a blue bubble so you'll
know you're using iMessage and you also
get read and delivered message
confirmations now you can still send
normal Texas tune on iOS device users
but some people might be able to get rid
of their costly text messaging plan with
this feature also iCloud integration is
everywhere in iOS 5 and it allows all of
your emails contacts calendars and more
to be synced across all your devices
with iCloud enabled now the syncing of
media content is the slickest part you
can download a song on one device from
iTunes and it will appear on the other
take a picture on one device and it will
show up on your photo stream synced from
the cloud in seconds on another device
as well now sticking with photos the
camera app has been improved you can now
get to it from your lockscreen by double
tapping the home button and you can also
use the volume up button to take a
picture in iOS 5 there's also some basic
built-in photo editing the crop rotate
auto enhance and remove redeye and
twitter fans will be happy with iOS 5
and Twitter integration everywhere plug
in your account info and you can tweet
directly from your photos Maps Safari
and more now another new app is find my
friends that is similar to Google
Latitude
where you can let close family and
friends know where you are if you want
to now one cool feature is allowing
specific people to know where you are
for a specific block of
that eventually expires also new is
magazine apps with subscriptions that
will now appear in your newsstand app
now not all of them are compatible at
the moment but that will change soon
you also get reminders and there are
plenty of third-party apps out there
like it but many users will like how its
integrated into iOS and you'll really be
able to take advantage of this feature
with Siri on the iPhone 4s now there's
still plenty of other features in iOS 5
but we wanted to give you an overview of
some of the major ones i'm brian tom for
cnet.com and there's a first look at iOS
5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
