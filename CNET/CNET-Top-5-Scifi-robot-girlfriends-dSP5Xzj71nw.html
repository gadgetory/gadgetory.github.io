the great advancements of our age
wireless communication genetic
engineering personal computers but there
is one promise of sci-fi that we have
yet to achieve the humanoid robot
companion you know like the convincingly
realistic robot friend to dull the
soul-crushing pain of your lonely
existence so in the spirit of
Valentine's Day and to pay homage to the
stalled out dream of the future I've
rounded up my picks for the top five
Valentine worthy robot girlfriends of
sci-fi now I would have included some
dude robots to balance things out but it
turns out that the man bots of sci-fi
are either murderous Psychopaths or
things that look like c-3po so this list
is ladies only alright starting up at
number five cherry 2000 from the 1987
movie that bears her name now here's a
robot that is so convincing so lovable
that when she short-circuits her
boyfriend was willing to gun his way
into dangerous post-apocalyptic
wasteland just to find an identical
replacement now just be sure to keep her
away from the hot tub at number four
Andrea from the original series of Star
Trek episode 7 now if you're gonna spend
your whole life stranded on a remote icy
planet there are worse companions to
have than this she's a sweetheart she's
easy on the eyes if you're into that
whole 60s bombshell look and she knows
how to use a 3d replicator she's a
little clingy though
but if blondes are more your thing
number 6 comes in at number 3 now there
are plenty of entertaining humanoids to
covet on Battlestar Galactica
but none that are more seductive than
number 6 I mean you'll have to look past
a whole quest to eradicate humanity and
if you're trying to be discreet about
the fact that you're dating a robot this
is not the way to do it so how about
number 2 call from Alien Resurrection
now maybe it's just because I'm a child
of the 80s but nothing says girlfriend
material to me more than Winona Ryder I
mean you can go throw up beetlejuice
style for Halloween and if the world has
ever attacked by ravenous aliens she's
totally got your back now before I get
to my number one sci-fi robot girlfriend
let's take a look at a few I had to cut
from the list based on technicalities 7
of 9 was disqualified because she was
born human determinate ryx was too
deadly
Kameron from the Sarah Connor Chronicles
was too young not to be creepy in the
long term
got your Ian Cora from trying or
technically computer programs and really
the toughest one to let go was Lisa from
weird science but it's not really clear
that she's a robot she's more of a sexy
genie that came out of a computer I know
it's disappointing all right so with
that out of the way let's move on to my
number one pick for the ideal robot
girlfriend from science fiction Rachael
from Blade Runner I mean at the end of
the day do you really want to spend your
whole life with a robot who knows
they're a robot Rachael is smart she's
attractive without being scandalous and
she's outfitted with enough implanted
memories to keep conversations
interesting she's a keeper so there you
go my carefully considered list of the
most Valentine worthy robots in sci-fi
I'm sure I missed a few though so if you
have one to nominate or if you just want
to tell me I'm a sexist pig for coming
up with this list at all head over to
top-5 dot cnet.com and leave me a
comment I'm Donna Bell thanks for
watching
