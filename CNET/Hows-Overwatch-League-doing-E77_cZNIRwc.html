the second stage of its inaugural season
I've been attending lots of games and
keeping a close eye on the goings-on
here but are they making the grade
here's my report card thus far quality
one of the biggest complaints about
eSports is always that unless you're a
hardcore super fan it's a nightmare
keeping tabs on things like tournaments
teams and players on top of that the
quality of those events can vary wildly
those aren't issues at all in overwatch
league the polish here is next level
with broadcast standards made to look
like you're watching any other
professional sports league like the NFL
or the NBA the casters sometimes get
buried a hair too deep in jargon and
concepts that new viewers might find
foreign but overall they do a really
great job
between the ridiculously cool blizzard
arena high-quality broadcasts and
professional presentation this is where
overwatch league gets a big fat a
clarity I'll try to explain overwatch
league's inaugural season quickly it's
split into four stages each stage lasts
5 weeks and ends with a kind of mini
championship where the winning team gets
a cash bonus when the regular season
ends in mid-june teams have a month to
prep for the playoffs which start July
11th and in July 28th with two teams
duking it out for the title of overwatch
League champion and a 1 million dollar
bonus stages make the season a little
bit confusing but overall it's an OK
structure it also feels a little bit
weird to wait a month between the
regular season and the playoffs
particularly because fans should be at
their most excited at that point so I'll
give this one a b-minus consistency one
of the things overwatch League
Commissioner Nate Nance or insist upon
is consistency the idea being that if
it's a certain day during a certain time
of year you know there's overwatch
League happening they've done a nice job
of this with free matches every day
Wednesday through Saturday I ran into a
couple of instances during stage 1 where
I tuned in at the wrong time of day but
the league has already addressed this
issue going forward all week days will
start at 4 p.m. Pacific time and
Saturdays at 1 p.m. Pacific that's much
easier for fans to follow a - engagement
watch League does have one key thing
going for it it's really fun to watch
the arena is a blast to attend but
since there's currently only one in
existence it makes it tough for anyone
not local to LA to check out watching
the game itself can be a little
fast-paced for a non gamer to follow but
the observer teams and the spectator
tools Blizzard added late last year have
helped solve some of those issues
fans of the league are already deeply
invested from water cooler chats in-game
about the previous day's matches to
showing up in full cosplay to root for
their favorite teams I've yet to see
someone get into overwatch League who
wasn't already a huge fan of the game
though so I'll give this one a be
accessibility twitch reportedly paid
over ninety million bucks to snag the
exclusive rights to stream overwatch
leagues first two seasons that's a lot
of cash for something so unproven and
the exclusivity is kind of a
double-edged sword much like spending
Sunday's watching NFL games I want to
watch overwatch League all day long on
the biggest screen possible my
television unfortunately twitch doesn't
have official apps on either Roku or
Apple TV yeah I know I can access twitch
on my PlayStation 4 and if you have an
Amazon fire TV this isn't a problem at
all but when you consider there's a huge
potential group of casual viewers who
may find this to be one step too far to
check out something they're only mildly
curious about it's worth serious
criticism also it's super Reb the game
tells you when overwatch league is live
but accessing the stream on ps4 Xbox one
opens a console browser window which is
terrible lots to improve here I know but
ultimately not a total disaster so see -
I think overwatch League is in pretty
good shape but if it wants to get
eyeballs that aren't already fans of the
game there are a couple of areas they
could definitely improve upon stage 2
starts on February 21st but only time
will tell if a wall you can achieve it's
a very ambitious goals overall I give
them a solid b-plus
now where can I stick this report card
yes let's leave it right here
some someone will find it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
