from 2015 the TX NR 646 and so we've
been shivering with anticipation to get
our hands on 2016 models a mile the
feature count is way up can the new TX
NR 757 compete with talented receivers
from Sony and den on the most
interesting addition to this year's
Onkyo is with wireless music the NR 757
is Google cast enabled which means you
can cast Pandora for example to it and
other car speakers at the same time
which is great for parties as it's a
2016 receiver it naturally offers
support for the immersive formats Dolby
Atmos and DTS X it also has dedicated
zone 2 amplification looks-wise it's a
lot sleeker than last year's model but
it still retains the direct source
selection buttons we like so much also
slim down is the new remote which no
longer looks like it controls a power
plan the receiver has eight HDMI inputs
including one on the front and these
offer compatibility with 4k and HDR
video home theater is where the onkyo
excels a Mali automated setup procedure
wasn't great with a bit of tweaking were
able to get it to sound suitably
impressive movies sounded big dialogue
was perfectly understandable and
explosions had plenty of oomph and yet
while Denon's AVRs 920 w lacks on cures
multi room features it offers better
sound quality overall its surround sound
was more cohesive and the sound had
better clarity with both movies and
music the onkyo is nevertheless an
excellent receiver especially if you're
interested in streaming music it's just
no longer king of the hill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
