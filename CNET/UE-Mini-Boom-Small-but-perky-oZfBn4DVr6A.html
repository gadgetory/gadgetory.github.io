the Yui mini boom box this is the
successor to the Yui mobile boom box not
much has changed in terms of the design
they essentially look identical this is
a wireless Bluetooth speaker the grills
have changed slightly that design on the
pattern on the grill but otherwise these
are identical speakers but Yui has
updated some of the innards or the
internal parts of the speaker so you get
slightly better sound the bass is
slightly better and there is also an app
that allows you to pair two of these
together this is a $99 speaker so it'll
cost you close to $200 to pair a couple
of these together but you will get some
stereo separation but you don't get from
a small speaker like this that said even
though you do get better stereo
separation you're not gonna get better
bass and these little speakers just have
so much bass that they can output this
does play pretty loud but it does still
sound a little bit thin as far as extra
features go there really isn't a whole
lot but you do get speakerphone
capabilities the mic is built into the
top of the speaker apart from that it
does have a sort of a ruggedized
exterior so it is a fairly durable small
speaker there also some buttons on top
volume control buttons as well as a
dedicated bluetooth button for pairing
the speaker however there's no transport
controls so you can't pause playback or
advanced tracks some people like those
features even though you controlled most
of those features from your smartphone
or tablet
the Bluetooth range on this is about 50
feet that's a little bit extended from
your typical 33 foot range and the
battery life is around 10 hours that
will vary of course by how loud you play
your music all in all this is a solid
speaker in this price range there is a
lot more competition now in this smaller
speaker category so I can't say it's an
exceptional value but it's a pretty safe
bet if you want a small speaker for less
than $100 however if you do want a
better speaker you should step up to the
ue boom which costs double this but is a
better speaker overall and sounds
significantly better I'm David Carr
noise and that's the UE mini boom
Bluetooth speaker thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
