services like Spotify and want to be
able to listen to them on your home
stereo you could use your iPhone but the
little cable dangling at the front is
not a great look so what are the
alternatives hi I'm ty Pendlebury and
this is a review of the Sonos connect
and connect amp so Knossos Wireless
players have been around for a while but
the products remain up to date by adding
new services all of the time the latest
in a laundry list of services that
includes Spotify MOG and pandora is
Amazon's Cloud Player of course the
Sonos players will also stream music
from your network and support most
formats including FLAC WAV and Apple
Lossless if you have high-definition
files it won't play those though and if
this affects you get the Logitech
Squeezebox touch instead the main
differences between the Kinect and the
Kinect amps should be obvious from the
names the Kinect is designed to connect
to an existing stereo while the Kinect
amp is a stereo unto itself you just
need to add speakers both players are
controlled by apps for PC Mac
smartphones and tablets the app is very
easy to use and lets you create custom
playlists on the fly from a variety of
different sources the song else is a
multi-room system and is able to
integrate all of the different players
in your home into the one app the
biggest advantage of the Kinect players
over the all-in-one Sonos play speakers
is that they have a line input this
means you can connect a separate player
like a turntable or the TV and then have
that stream around the house to other
players if you like so which one should
you get though it's a bit more expensive
at $500 I preferred the connect amp
especially when I used it as the basis
of the stereo system being able to
control it directly from the app is
great and the amp was able to run any of
the smaller speakers I tried sound
quality was excellent with plenty of
detail and Drive and though it's more
expensive than Google's Nexus Q there's
no competition it's a much better
product the Kinect on the other hand was
also good but it's $100 more expensive
than the Squeezebox Touch and if you're
just looking for a player and no
multi-room playback I'd say get the
squeeze box again in terms of value for
money though the play 3 is still at
easiest
first and best way to get into the
science ecosystem this has been tae
