checking out the LG logos now this is a
bare-bones device but it's available on
US Cellular for 99 bucks without a
contract it's not going to blow your way
but that low price and pretty good
performance could be a good fit the
logos feels a lot smaller than it looks
it's got a 4.7 inch display with a 1280
by 720 resolution sure that's not that
1080p resolution you'd expect from
pricier devices but the screen looks
good
there's no color shifting a contrast
degradation when you're looking at it
off axis and with the pixel density of
312 pixels per inch text looks really
sharp and crisp there's a 1.2 gigahertz
quad-core processor and it's performance
is just right for the price your run to
trouble with more Hardware intensive
games but casual games like xx work
great in grand theft auto 3 runs really
smoothly there isn't too much in the way
of pre-installed apps here which I
appreciate the phone is running LG's
optimus UI which wiscons Android pretty
heavily but it's also running Android
lollipop the latest version of Android
that's not too common in a phone of this
price there's only 8 gigs of storage but
you can pry off the back of the case to
get to the microSD card slot which
supports up to 32 gig cards there's also
a removable battery we saw an average of
about 9 hours and 45 minutes on our
battery draining test which is a pretty
strong score so sure the LG logos can
compete with the big kids but at $99
with a pretty good screen and nice
performance it's a pretty strong
contender in the budget pack head over
to seen it to see how it fares against
the rest of its peers
I'm Nate thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
