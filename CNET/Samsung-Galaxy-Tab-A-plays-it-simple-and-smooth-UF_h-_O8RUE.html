taking a first look at the Samsung
Galaxy Tab a the 8 inch tablet also
available in 9.7 inch models sports a
four by three aspect ratio this gives it
more of an iPad aesthetic but unlike the
iPad it's made of plastic unfortunately
giving it a bit of a cheap feel the Tab
A is thin light and comfortable to hold
but those with smaller hands will have
to stretch their fingers a bit to
securely grip it in one hand running the
latest version of Android lollipop 5.0
it features Samsung's TouchWiz overlay
there's also a few free goodies as part
of the package as the owner of a shiny
new galaxy tablet you get complimentary
subscriptions to the New York Times
audio books from audible blankest The
Economist and more if you have a
compatible Samsung Galaxy phone the
tablet includes side sync software which
allows you to control your phone using
your tablet so if you're carrying around
both utilize the only ones necessary it
houses a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor one-and-a-half gigabytes of
RAM and 16 gigabytes of internal storage
it also offers a micro SD card slot
that's expandable up to 128 gigabytes
performance isn't incredibly fast but
the Tab A makes up for it with
consistently smooth performance after
loading large games they run without a
hitch and even using two apps at the
same time with the multi window feature
doesn't faze it much the screens 1024 by
768 resolution is a bit underwhelming
and it can look pixelated when it comes
to text however it doesn't make reading
difficult and HD content still looks
sure according to Samsung the battery
should last around 12 to 14 hours and
though we haven't officially tested it
yet I was impressed it lasted me about
two days on a full charge after moderate
to heavy use there's a rear 5 megapixel
camera and a 2 megapixel front-facing 1
both take decently sharp photos but
color saturation is a bit dull typical
for tablet cameras starting at 229 for
the 8 inch and 299 for the 9.7 inch both
tablets are available online and in
stores now for more details check out my
full review i'm Xiomara blanca cocina
and this was a first look at the samsung
galaxy
