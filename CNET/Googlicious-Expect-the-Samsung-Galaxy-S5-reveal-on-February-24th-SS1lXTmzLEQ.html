to Google ishes it's everything google
that we could pack inside a show each
week so let's get to it and the big news
that broke out recently came in the form
of a Samsung invitation to the press for
an event that are calling unpacked 5 at
mobile world congress in barcelona on
februari the 24th now looking really
closely for clues on the invitation i
think that the announcement might be a
reveal for a new cardboard box from
samsung with the number 5 it's also
called episode 1 and could feature a
young Anakin Skywalker and Jar Jar Binks
screen or this could be the reveal for
the galaxy 5 now diagrams based on
Samsung's filings for a super curvy
smartphone have been outed but I've ohm
Eric took those designs one step further
and developed his own concept render of
what the galaxy s5 might look like now
it's still expected to come in two
versions but some rumors claim Samsung
could ditch their Super AMOLED display
for an LCD this time around prototype
benchmark results have already leaked
online showing how it just slightly
outperforms other phones on the market
the leaks also show a 16 megapixel rear
camera and 2 megapixels on the front a
1080p display and a Snapdragon 800
chipset with a 2.5 gigahertz CPU but the
source says it was just an engineering
sample that was tested now our live
coverage for Samsung's event will be
right here on cnet that's a Monday
februari the 24th at 1030am pacific time
and the kino starts at eleven so join us
and we can all find out everything
together all right chrome boxes are
making some noise starting with Google's
shaking things up with their own video
conference package called a chromebox
for meetings that includes an Asus core
i7 chromebox a high def camera
microphone and speaker unit and a remote
for nine hundred and ninety nine dollars
google says it will allow businesses to
outfit 10 or more rooms with
videoconferencing now for the price of
one and sticking with that asus box
they'll also be selling it as a
standalone chromebox with an entry-level
price of only $179 that's touted as the
smallest and most powerful chromebox a
date when it goes on sale some
I'm in March now it has all of your
standard port connections and a modest
16 gigs of solid-state drive storage
with 100 gigs of google drive storage
thrown in the pricing for the higher-end
versions with Haswell processors has not
been revealed yet now HP is also
announcing their own colorful assortment
of Haswell core i7 chrome boxes that
will come in silver white turquoise and
black this spring the difference between
the HP and a sous chromebox right now
well HP didn't feel like giving us a
starting price point and in a
ventureBeat report the New York Police
Department is testing out google glass
with officers on patrol they signed up
for a few pairs of glass and they're
trying them out to see if they have any
real value in investigations but more
specifically for patrol operations in
New York City I would just advise you
not to call any of them glass holes if
you see them on the street because yeah
that would not be good and one of the
quirkier stories that we just can't
ignore flappy bird the game that set the
world on fire is no more now it was a
game for android and iOS with a simple
but maddening mechanic and critics were
bashing it now the game developer domed
when was making about fifty thousand
dollars a day but recently removed the
app stain on his Twitter account that he
cannot take this anymore and it ruined
his simple life so now he hates it you
know I admire him for staying true to
himself people swarm to download the
game before he pulled it and thanks to
them he's now making even more money
from it so dumb the win we salute you
even if we still hate your game all
right let's get to the winners of our
speck case giveaway contest for the
galaxy s4 and HTC one from last week and
the picture I used in that episode was
the one with the cute little dog and
kitten also cute and cuddly and it warms
my heart alright guys congrats go to our
