fully waterproof wireless bluetooth
speaker that comes in a few different
colors and fits in the water bottle
holder of your bike it's the middle
model in Scotia's line of sporty
Bluetooth speakers and carries a list
price of $99.99 but can be had online
for a little bit less hi I'm David car
noise and this is a pretty decent little
wireless speaker last year skosh put out
the original boom bottle which you can
get for a little over a hundred dollars
online
it's basically double the size of this
one instead of being waterproof it's
merely water resistant however it does
have a built-in speakerphone which is a
nice plus particular if you plan on
using this while riding your bike so
there are some trade-offs going with
this smaller model it doesn't sound
quite as good as its bigger brother and
leaves off the speakerphone but it is
easier to tote around since it's
basically half the size it also promises
slightly better battery life 11 hours as
opposed to the boom bottles 10 that's
pretty good
as I said it's waterproof and is rated
to be submersed in water down to 3 feet
for up to 30 minutes the caveat is you
have to make sure the ports are properly
sealed off there's a lid that covers the
microUSB charging port and the audio
input that's there for non bluetooth
devices to make that lid easier to lift
up Scotia's added a little strap which I
did appreciate a metal grill covers the
speaker's 50 millimeter driver and it's
worth noting that I didn't manage to
dent it when I stuck it into a bag with
some shoes and other gear luckily the
speaker sounded no worse for the wear as
far as the controls go there's a power
button on the front along with volume
up/down buttons that are raised and easy
to operate by feel if say you actually
do have the speaker tucked into the
water bottle holder on your bike with no
pause play button or transport controls
on the speaker you'll have to use your
smartphone or tablet control playback
I thought the speaker sounded
comparatively decent for its small size
particularly with less demanding
acoustical tracks that said you
shouldn't expect it to produce meaty
bass it's going to come off sounding a
little thin with techno and hip-hop
tracks for casually listening outdoors I
think most people will be fairly
impressed in the end while the speaker
doesn't offer
the sound quality or maximum sound
output of a more premium canister style
speaker like the ue boom it does cost
significantly less the de boom boombox
travel which costs around $50 and the
boombox outdoor which is right around
100 dollars are arguably slightly better
values at least at this moment but the
boom bottle h2o is a recommended speaker
it's worth a hard look particularly if
you see it's selling for closer to $80
