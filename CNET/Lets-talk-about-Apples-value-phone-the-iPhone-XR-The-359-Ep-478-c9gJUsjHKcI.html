Scott Stein the iPhone 10 our reviews
are out and we've got Scott here to walk
us through the new device
let me just read off some quotes from
your review sure you're probably not
going to miss any of the stuff in the
iPhone 10's but the did the iPhone 10's
brings to the table this is my favorite
iPhone probably in years and last I
think this is the one to get so let's
start with your overall impressions that
was obviously very positive yeah it was
because I think well Apple makes a lot
of iPhones too many iPhones and I think
that it's hard to make a decision I
think you often get tempted by the
step-up models and that's happened since
the plus phones have been here and the
dual cameras and they gobbled it a lot
more to make what is now their
entry-level phone I'll be it's still an
expensive 750 750 yeah but they've done
a lot more to make that an attractive
pick and I don't think that those step
up features are really is a step up
unless you're really really into some of
those fine details I don't think most
people won't be so let's talk about some
of the things that you would be missing
getting on the 10r as opposed to the 10s
or the 10s max dual camera there's no
dual camera no there's also the body is
what it's like steel instead of steel
aluminum instead of steel steel started
being a you know the iPhone models for a
couple years and I've been aluminum but
the Tanners are steel and then the last
thing is the screen which is an LCD
versus an OLED let's dive into that one
first are people really going to notice
the difference between an LCD versus an
OLED you did a lot of comparisons there
yeah we did a lot and I had some help
with that too and and if you look at
them side by side you definitely see
that the OLED is better absolutely black
levels some some color tone in some
instances it can look a bit brighter all
of the display nets are the same the
display however on its own looks great
and I think that's the important thing
to point out is if you're just looking
at it as an iPhone and you're not doing
a review right if you're coming to it
from a you know an iPhone 8 iPhone 7 it
looks great and I think the extra real
estate they're really mad
now it's technically lower resolution
than the 10s max but that resolution is
an area that I don't think the eye can
really perceive it's it the same
resolution that the eights been at that
kind of Retina Display level and it
looks great apps have mapped really well
to it I haven't found any that don't
work well it's a tweener size so it's a
little smaller than the max which I
actually like because I found that those
plus phones are a little too wide and I
feel like this is a a more manageable
larger phone let's talk about the camera
too so you're not getting the dual
camera were there any issues or problems
I guess the one thing that you noticed
was that what was it the pixel three XL
yeah takes better pet shots it takes
they're really nice and better better
frame portrait shots yeah I think you
know pixel three takes fantastic photos
the I wanted to compare because it's
also single lens Apple included a
portrait mode the single lens so it
actually does okay and never failed me
on people but it's only designed to work
with people so and it's also a
wide-angle so as I say in the review
it's a very different type of portrait
shot than the telephoto one on the 10s
things are just farther away so you have
to get closer to subjects it kind of
feels more subtle so I don't and I'm not
a big portrait mode user anyhow but I do
like to exome I like the ability to get
a little bit closer especially for
close-ups of things for when I work at
looking hands-on and things like that I
use that so I think lacking that it's a
shame but I think you can do enough with
this phone everything else from the
front-facing camera to the other
features wide-angle are the same as the
10s and so it generally it looks great
so ultimately hold on to your money
you're better off getting a 10 R if you
are an Apple customer you're better off
getting a 10 R then a 10 s probably like
a 10 s max if you really want a really
big phone I guess you would be in the
market for that down next to me is just
so in a in a rarefied zone with price
that I it's not something to me that is
in normal that's a price is no object
pick me this is like the battery life is
the best of them so that matters the
most to me they matters the most to a
lot of people you know saving a couple
hundred dollars or more is not
insignificant and sure the phones can be
even more of
well than this like this is what the
five top often you top iPhone used to be
750 but I think that's that's the area I
would accept for a new generation phone
and I feel a lot more comfortable making
the leap into this I think it's really
fast it's got all the stuff that I would
use jar
also we wanted to plug our ongoing
series online about rural broadband and
also 5g please give them a read if you
get a chance if you want to read more
about these stories check us out on CNN
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Scott Stein thanks
for watching
all right thanks everybody for joining
us for the recording of the audio
podcast that we'll publish later today
you can find links on how to describe
Ted that down in the description below
but for now we're gonna jump into the
chat and take out your questions and
comments in regards to the iPhone 10x RS
max Nano oh come on you know the name I
do not and I don't care you're just
naming next year's phone model you're
right okay so right out the gate let's
put the the bias and negativity aside
present company included
let's get objective Scott Demonte says I
feel like they could have knocked that
price down to 600 in my opinion of
course they got an objective but like
what do you think about that they could
have knocked the price down I think
however I had a a much less positive
feeling about where the iPhone 8 fit in
the lineup last year compared to the
iPhone 10 hmm and I do do with the
iPhone 10 are compared to the 10s and
10's max so that's what I was looking at
I mean this to me includes most of the
stuff that I will be talking about the
design of the 10 about I don't think
you're missing any of the other stuff
and yeah I would love to see them make a
more affordable iPhone I think the se
should come back and I think that you
know there's a they they they fill that
hole with older iPhones right now so but
if I was recommending look a lot of the
other phones in the landscape were at
seven hundred eight hundred dollars now
a lot of those phones that it's
competing with right in that zone so I
don't think it really is all that
expensive compared to the competition
anymore now also also expensive the
iPhone starting price has generally been
six hundred and fifty dollars for years
so to suggest six hundred I think might
be a little aggressive but 650 it would
have been nice but I understand that due
to inflation due to the fact that this
is years later and they're also pushing
up the price of their iPhones well past
$1,000 you don't want to set a price so
low that you're basically killing off
the sales for your higher priced items I
mean like granted if you're buying the
max as you said it's a money is no
object type of situation so you're
buying that one regardless but you wanna
you want a price it close enough to the
that at least people give the 10s a real
chance like they at least give it some
consideration yeah there's a whole I
mean there's a spectrum you look at all
those phones right now and everything is
like $100 $100 up up up up up up up and
that's always been the case I think this
is the landing point at this point with
the lineup where I would say I go to
this
I wouldn't necessarily go lower or
higher it also depends on where you want
to have a phone I mean I'm also if
you're not looking for a more advanced
phone and you want something just
functions there are many other options
in the iPhone land and outside of it so
before I forget so you have the 10s with
you and the 10r with you yeah let's do
the LCD versus the OLED comparison we
did this ahead of the show so you have
the same brightness set up you have the
same background and let's let's just
show folks that are watching this
whether they can actually see the
difference between these two obviously
the OLED is supposed to be better and
more expensive type of display so those
are the two phones immediately this is
just a home screen but in my review we
also look at a bunch of stuff same
wallpaper max brightness you can see
differences between these outside of
even this screen to me even though these
are both rated as the same brightness I
see that the OLED once I see the OLED
seems brighter and that could be as much
a factor of contrast or the way it's
handling color but it seems a little
more vivid brighter it definitely seems
much more vivid when watching things
like a movie like Blade Runner 2049 I
was watching that you could see you know
you look at a jacket and you can make
out a lot more detail on the OLED in in
like a dark-type scene it's like
televisions where you're looking at a
high-end OLED versus a capable LCD but
the point is that when I use this on for
everyday purposes for reading for movies
games I mean I just did as much stuff on
it as I could it was perfectly fine yeah
I would also like to congratulate BVG
who was an on-the-fly camera man just
now behind the scenes so I do it well do
it all
he really does I mean I love I love the
way the OLED looks on the phone but I do
not love $1,000 phones $1000 phone and
and and probably more you're gonna
upgrade to more storage than the 64 so
it's like suddenly er it is serious
laptop land and I just think at some
point starting now the phone prices have
to start becoming more reasonable and to
me that the 10r is an acknowledgment of
that it's not the complete answer but
it's the best answer for now perhaps or
an iPhone
obviously Apple had a year's worth of
sales data to look at to say here's how
our thousand dollar phones sold last
year yeah and they clearly understood
that if they're not gonna have like an
iPhone 8 style phone to kind of have
people fall back on we need something
like this yeah because otherwise we're
gonna lose a bunch of customers that
don't want to pay $1000 so it's nice to
hear that this is is a nice more value
or more budget option even though it's
Apple style budget so yeah well I think
it's like you know you'll notice the
OLED but you know it's foolish to say
like if I go to somebody and I have
asking anyone just like sort of like
what what you think of this other
display and I try to point out the
differences between Olight and LCD I end
up looking pretty silly because I'm
pointing out these really fine-tune
things that people don't really care
about especially on a smaller screen
right or and so I can perceive them but
like what would the value be to somebody
to say you're gonna spend up to get that
probably that group is pretty small and
you probably know who you are so then go
for it that's what Apple's that's the
whole proposition is to say okay this
old light is here but what's nice is
it's not a key feature anymore I don't
think it's a key feature I think the
more missing key feature is the 2x zoom
which I have realized the optical zoom
is something I use more often than not
and also can affect things like you know
if you use digital zoom to 5x versus
digital zoom at 5x on the 10s the
pictures come out much sharper I had an
example of that in the review they come
up much sharper on the 10s because it's
also taking advantage of some of that
optical zoom and so that matters you
know like that's the stuff and also like
if I'm taking a picture of somebody I
don't want to have to get so close to
them for portrait mode where it's
uncomfortable which it kind of is with
the 10r
where you're you're basically you're
kind of doing this basically kissing
them yeah like I mean here I'll take a
picture of you with it okay let's let's
take a picture of you with this in
portrait mode and it only recognizes
people so pet shots forget about it any
other objects forget about it it's
trained for just faces so I mean that's
okay I'm not too close to you but but
I'm like not too I'm not like casually
far away I mean it's a little
uncomfortable right if I do this that's
normal yeah but you're really far away
from me right now so there was the
picture of you there okay yeah I liked
her I would hardly call the pretty sad
right but it doesn't look like a
portrait looks like a nice sad photo of
Ben I look I look unhappy about
something but you're the magician there
with the thanking drop yes and then
there's the picture of you which was I
think it was like a more normal frame
yeah that's that's my get that camera
out of my face look Scott can't get any
closer I mean Rihan and also the the
face ends up a little more distorted no
offense but you know what I mean like oh
yeah and I look hideous
you get like a weird wide-angle face
which sometimes people like for a photo
where you know you're kind of like a
little more thinned or stretched out my
nose sticks out more and type of things
like that but I don't I I really like
the composition on the 10s but the other
thing I thought was interesting it's
more hold on hold on yeah we need to get
them more questions yeah there's a lot
to talk about
yeah for instance we had a familiar name
in the chat today Steven Shanklin the
iPhone 10 our have the same radio
technology as the iPhone 10s and 10's
max thank you good good thing to address
their carriers and bands so as far as
like carrier support it does not have
gigabit LTE so these are two important
things to think about gigabit LTE is not
available in all markets but it's not 5g
but it should offer faster throughput I
still had 230 megabits per second on
Verizon in my very suburban near
New York town of Montclair so that was
great it doesn't have 4x4 MIMO it has 2
by 2 MIMO now like that that technology
is to allow to allow you to get a signal
maybe on the edge of networks to be able
to get stronger connections it's useful
technology that it's the amount of
antenna connections that allow you to
kind of like lock onto the signal and
get a little more out of it
4x4 is on the iPhone 10s and the 10s max
it's two by two on the iPhone 8 8 plus
slightly less but Anna probably you're
not going to notice unless you're in the
woods saves a thing if you've had a
previous iPhone and you've been fine
that's what you can expect here I didn't
notice any radical improvement using the
10s in in the very spotty networks of
commuting New Jersey so I can't say that
like between using one or the other I
noticed like a night-and-day there need
to be a lot more tests with this but
that's something to consider well the
other thing that Shanklin may have been
pointing to is also the chip itself so
not the processor but the radio chip and
I believe they're all Intel this year
yes
so Qualcomm got booted there's there's
this whole lawsuit going on between
Apple and Qualcomm right now and Intel
is in the expensive ones it's in the
cheaper one that's and I can't imagine
it really feels any differently because
it's all basically the same chip anyway
so I mean in a week so far it doesn't
seem like again as a recommendable thing
to go for the upgraded 4x4 MIMO gigabit
I didn't perceive anything but there's a
lot more things you need to perceive in
order to say like maybe this matters for
you but again I think it's kind of we
have it in the review it's it's it's
another it's another one of the elements
so it was like durability of glass but
we need to do drop tests with it mmm
another question yeah let's keep it
moving we only got about six minutes
seven minutes left sir and Roy says LCD
is fine but how can you justify 720p and
20:18 good question well it is a good
question um to me like anything I
watched on it looked perfectly fine I
mean the peaking of can you specify how
1080p videos
Glee like YouTube videos or something
yeah perform on it everything looked
great
and we I went I you know we looked at
this with people who review televisions
we looked at this with like other people
in the office so I thought it looked
perfectly fine if you want a 1080p
display yes that's what the A+ is for
that's what the 10s and others can offer
the resolution to me never was a factor
and that's all I can say about it so I
think you know it's it's something that
makes sense but if the distance that
you're looking at from a phone it
doesn't matter again did it matter to
anybody when using the iPhone 8 so it
works really well for me that I really
tried to throw as much as much was like
everyday apps games videos as I could
reading web surfing it's it's I was just
trying to like see the limitations of
this 6.1 inch screen I didn't perceive
you remember when Apple came out with a
5k display for one of their desktop
computers right we had that in one of
the labs I had to I'm very nearsighted I
had to take my glasses off and look at
it this close to be able to see a
perceivable difference in like the dots
and whatever yeah and that's on that's
on a desktop display so there is
something to be said about okay the
number is bigger but are you really
gonna notice so I appreciate what you
said yeah I think Apple was an honest on
originally with Retina display in pixel
density I think I kind of lost Apple a
bit when they started getting into super
retina because I feel like you know the
whole original idea was that how many
pixels can your eye really perceive I
think that's kind of the main takeaway
in the end for a lot of these 11 yeah 11
pixels extra pixels for me always
mattered for like phone VR that was like
the most important use case for right
shoes right up against her yeah gear VR
with the Samsung phone yeah all right
more question moving along under the
five-minute mark
let's talk camera is the zoom on the 10
are good 10s zoomed photos are better
than the pixels and I got a cut-off I
would like to see a comparison of the
zoom on the 10r and the pixel Oh between
those two that would be good you know
looking at it and the pixel has in a
to maximize digital zoom that's superior
so we're gonna do a lot of camera
comparisons with that but you know
Google is doing more interesting things
computationally with what it can do with
a single lens Apple is just beginning
and I think there's a lot of work to do
with that digital zoom is just like it
was before so if you had an iPhone 8a
plus it's the same thing which is that I
kind of would prefer not using it if I
have to I would go to 2x digital zoom
and it's serviceable sharing in a photo
5x zoom is not at all serviceable 5x is
basically like a grainy man's grainy and
not nice but like a 2x zoom you could
share that in a tweet now like which you
know for things you want to frame out a
wall you shouldn't do any digital zoom
but that's why not having the optical is
is kind of a little bit of a loss there
but it ends up being on an everyday
basis not necessarily a big thing for
everyone but it's the biggest key
difference on this phone would you say
that that difference is enough to
justify upgrading from the 10 to the 10
are to the if you take the photos it
really depends on the customer yeah the
10 honest if you really if that's
something that matters a lot to you yeah
and it's worth $200 plus then then yeah
like if you really want to take photos
and you have a reason to have that off
to you know like an increased zoom but I
think correct me if I'm wrong here but
like according to your review it's very
hard to justify that increased price for
most customers a lot of customers I
think you're already kind of like
there's a lot of nickel and diming on on
like price increases and things like
that like steal watches and other things
so I feel like you know getting to like
the basics of what the phone needs is a
nice thing if you're a pro phone a pro
phone person a pro photographer person
who uses a phone well those people
they're very few of them but they're
very not according to them yeah but you
know I think about people who are
shooting movies on phones who were doing
like you know sports and other things
where they're using their phone is their
main thing or you're you're someone
who's youtubing or doing all sorts of
stuff stuff that you're really using
that phone and
in a professional way then yeah the
upgrades gonna matter and that won't
that cost won't be a matter a factor for
you because because you're because your
videos are gonna work much much more
professional people buy thousands of
dollars of camera equipment so I mean
yeah so an extra two hundred fifty
dollars whatever forget it like just get
the nicer camera because the tennis is a
step up with that both and also in
display so if you're looking to like
have the most perfect representation of
something if you need to view something
edit it etc yeah go for that bat so that
display is for but I'm just saying a lot
of people it's like the MacBook Pro is a
lot of people are paying up for tech
that they're probably not using and that
what's much more important for me is
performance basic camera quality in the
in the isp and all that and battery life
mm-hmm so attending those versus those
others but yeah I would say you get you
get the 10s or the 10s max all right we
are down to the wire it's time to say
goodbye but before we do that closing
thoughts storm King says what we're all
thinking these phones seem like a pit
stop until next year a big wait and see
situation mmm no comment I feel like
we've been living in that era for some
time now no 10 years you know they are
pitstop in some way I think we're
getting to the point with phones that
short of a folding phone or some you
know that type of technology which again
if Apple does that it might be much
later than other companies introduced so
that wouldn't be next year but Samsung
may do it Samsung made samsung often
yeah will lead the pack with that but
I'm saying if you're an iPhone person
waiting for a new design Apple just did
the 10 and I think they're gonna be sit
and tight on that design that's what
they do they sit tight on a design for a
while so I think next year you're gonna
be looking at maybe some other design
iteration but I wouldn't expect anything
really dramatic with it I think this is
kind of this is the form yes and if they
aren't iterative but that's kind of what
you get each very slowly iterative yeah
yeah they do take their time with things
and going back to the commenter that
said I'd prefer this closer to $600
because if you hold your breath until
next year maybe the 10r will still be
available and they'll cut the price
by a hundred bucks because that is yeah
you know how they do pricing I don't
know if you're really willing to wait a
year but that is an idea yeah to be
clear if you have another phone you're
fine waiting right now and that's that
more often is the case I think these
phones get to cook to cost like as much
as laptops you should be waiting a bunch
of years maybe you shouldn't upgrade
every two years right I think it's gain
the point you should wait a number of
years it's not a one year or two year
upgrade so if you have an iPhone 8 yes
they put I mean if you have an upgrade
path to somebody's offering your way to
upgrade this is how you should take note
of but I'm thinking this is like a years
old thing where you've been eyeing an
upgrade for a while and you're thinking
about landing on an iPhone I think this
is a good one to land on yeah good point
okay out of time we are living in the
era of premium phones from the pixel to
the 10s to 10's max to the 10r to 10 P
to 10 M I'm cooked so final thought we
see a lot of action going on with the 10
R we see a great camera but can the 10
rcy kids love the taste of cinnamon
toast crunch yes sure of course it can
what do you think you're paying for
after all this comes with sugar sugar
crispy coating I do like the colors
though so colors are cool this one
however is is white yeah there are more
exciting colors than that out there okay
let's let's let's call it a day the 359
is available on iTunes tune in
feedburner stitcher google play music
google podcast the amazon echo and of
course sanic calm scott thank you so
much for coming on always a pleasure and
thanks everybody for your questions
we'll see you again tomorrow bye bye
