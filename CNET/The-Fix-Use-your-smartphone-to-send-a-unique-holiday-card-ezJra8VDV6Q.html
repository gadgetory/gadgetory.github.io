there are nfc-enabled holiday cards with
this DIY I'll show you how to create a
holiday card that launches a video when
you tap it with an Android smartphone
the first thing we need to do is record
that video greeting so to do that I'll
launch a webcam recording program on my
computer and record a short holiday
greeting hey guys I just want to wish
you happy holidays and a happy new year
so now that I have my video recorded I'm
going to upload it to my YouTube account
and make sure that it's unlisted that
way only the people who receive this
card can view the video it won't be
searchable under regular youtube search
and within a few minutes it should be
uploaded to my channel and I should have
a link to that video at this point what
I need to do is program this NFC tag so
that when it's tapped with an android
phone that holiday greeting video
launches immediately right now this only
works for android phones since Apple has
locked the iphone 6 and 6 plus NFC
capability to only work with Apple pay
so for this I'll use trigger which is a
free app for Android I'll hit the plus
sign to create a new task and select NFC
hit next and then done now we'll create
the task so we'll hit next again hit the
plus sign to create a task and then
choose open a URL hit next and in this
window will type in the URL for the
video that I just uploaded then I'll hit
add to task hit next and now I'll grab
my NFC tag and hold it to the back of my
phone so that it writes that action to
the tag and it's done the last thing we
need to do is adhere the NFC tag to my
greeting card and these are great
because they're actually adhesive I got
a pack of 12 for about fourteen dollars
I'll just peel the back off
put it right on the greeting card just
like that now in my recipient receives
this card they'll see this little
android logo and when they tag it
they'll get a little video surprised hey
guys I just want to wish you happy
holidays and a happy new year if this is
something you want to do with a lot of
family and friends this year consider
getting a pack of NFC tags happy
holidays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
