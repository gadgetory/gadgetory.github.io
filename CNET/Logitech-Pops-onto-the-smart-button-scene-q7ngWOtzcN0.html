convenience is becoming the measure of
its success sure you can control smart
lights in your house but if it's not
easier than using a conventional switch
who cares with convenience in mind
logitech released the pop smart button a
device that controls all the connected
gadgets in your house with the ease of a
button press the buttons connect via
bluetooth to the bridge which connects
using Wi-Fi to the rest of the devices
around your house now for these two
buttons and a bridge the starter pack it
costs a hundred bucks each additional
button will cost you 40 now I like how
easy it is to use pop and one of the
biggest shortcomings of competitors like
the flick smart button is that you have
to anchor them to a single phone meaning
mom might not be able to use the button
if dad is out of the house with his
phone so pop is better for families but
it's not better for DIY enthusiasts
while logitech works with IFFT which
vastly expands its possible functions it
doesn't have the same in-app flexibility
as say flick which allows for ordering
pizza or reading your text aloud or
other kind of cool in-app features the
logitech pops biggest strength is the
fact that it works with the logitech
harmony hub so i can press this button
and it will actually control the lights
for my entertainment setup the streaming
service that it goes to and the TV
itself to turn it off this is a really
cool integration but it requires yet
another expensive Logitech device and
that's what pop really comes down to it
adds convenience to your smart home if
you already own a bunch of gadgets
especially the Harmony remote I really
like pop and I think it works well that
said I'd like to see more in-app
flexibility and really a lower price tag
before it really stands out on the smart
button market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
