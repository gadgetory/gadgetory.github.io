be a crime and which smartphone user
hogs up the most data I'm Jeff Bakalar
in for Bridget Carey this is your CNN
update are you an iphone 5s owner if you
are you're part of the most data hungry
smartphone users out there a new study
conducted by jdsu says that iphone 5s
users gobble up more data than any other
mobile device around and that includes
every single version of the ipad so what
about a product that is an apple well in
the top 10 list of gluttonous devices
only the HTC Sensation Sony Xperia SP
and galaxy s4 make the cut AOL has
announced it will pay 83 million dollars
for internet personalization site
gravity in a deal that will make it
easier for its network of sites to
present relevant content to its users
and it might also help aol's targeting
and advertising as well so if you're
like me and you've never heard of
gravity up until right this second
you'll probably recall the company's
interest graph it's a visualization of
trending topics on the Internet ok let's
switch gears just for a second and talk
about Nintendo after the company is
hinted that it might report losses for a
third straight year in a row a lot of
industry talking heads have declared it
time for a Nintendo to go mobile and
begin offering their games on platforms
like iOS and Android but Wired's chris
kohler has another idea altogether in
his piece he says the Nintendo should
avoid going to the mobile platforms and
instead competing with their business
model under the current model Nintendo
owners have to pay 250 dollars for the
console and then fifty dollars for each
game what Kohler says is that Nintendo
should lower their prices and open their
platforms to independent developers
either way you slice it the company is
facing some real trouble and plus every
time I talk about this there's a little
piece of my childhood that dies inside
reports are in that TiVo has laid off
much of its hardware engineering team
even though the company claims it's not
getting out of the hardware business
altogether and will continue to make
set-top boxes that said tivo is looking
to the future of DVR and how cloud
computing will most certainly be a big
part of it finally from the captain
obvious department
a new study out of an Australian
University has concluded that texting
while walking causes people to act funny
like abandoning walking in a straight
line and reduce range of motion and
other mental distractions make no
mistake people those who text and walk
at the same time are among the worst
kind of people so I personally find it
comforting that now we have science
that's going to back up that kind of
claim that's going to do it for this
