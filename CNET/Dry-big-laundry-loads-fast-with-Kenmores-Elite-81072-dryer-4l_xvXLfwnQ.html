lot of clothes in one load this Kenmore
Elite model though is one such model it
offers a huge 9 cubic foot capacity
which is enough to handle large bulky
items like comforters blankets and area
rugs without any trouble
it'll also accept two loads from large
washers at the same time I really like
that this Kenmore Elite has some very
intuitive controls it's easy to
understand what you're doing and read
the screen from any direction it also
has these slick LED lights that glow in
a cool blue hue as far as performance
goes this Kenmore Elite definitely hits
the mark it can go through lots of
clothes in a very short amount of time
and that's something we like to see this
dryer isn't perfect though for the price
you'd expect to get a dedicated water
line to power its steam modes but
instead you have this tray up to fill up
manually with water and that's a real
pain especially if you forget to do so
or you're in the middle of a cycle and
it runs out of water and something
trivial that I find annoying is that you
can't slam the door shut you have to
actually push it until it clicks into
place
so for fourteen hundred dollars this
Kenmore Elite dryer is a little pricey
but it offers a huge 9 cubic foot
capacity and is a great performer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
