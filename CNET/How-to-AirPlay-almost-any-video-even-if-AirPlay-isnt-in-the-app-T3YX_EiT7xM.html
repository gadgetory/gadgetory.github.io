how to contributor and today I want to
take a look at showing you how to get
video from your iPad through airplay to
your Apple TV even when the airplay icon
is not built-in or present within an app
now this doesn't work across the board
it's gonna be hit or miss depending on
which app you are using for example the
ABC Player or HBO GO this trick will not
work but with like the Masters app for
the Masters that just happened last
weekend or the NBC app this works
perfectly and you're allowed you're able
to watch full-size video on your TV
streaming through your iPad even without
that airplay icon being present so what
I'm going to do is go ahead and launch
the NBC app I already have a video
pulled up this is the office and as you
can see there's no airplay icon present
in the app when the video is playing so
in order to get it from my iPad to the
Apple TV what I'm going to do is double
click the home button pull up the app
switcher tray swipe over and here I have
the airplay icon so I'm gonna go in and
tap on that select the Apple TV I want
to stream this to now as you can see it
instantly sends it to the TV very
important here you do not turn on
mirroring if you do the quality of the
video is gonna go down quite a bit and
you're not gonna be able to view it
fullscreen like you can see in the
background here now one thing to keep in
mind is while this video is streaming
from your iPad to your Apple TV if your
iPad or your iPhone this isn't just
limited to the iPad if your device a lot
of the screen locks on it the video will
stop playing now to get around this what
we'll do is actually go into settings
general auto lock and change it from the
default or whatever you have it set to
it's a never odds are if you're
streaming a TV show it's going to be a
lot longer than the default 15 minutes
that that's present here so turn it to
never stream your video and then once
you're done come back in change the
setting back to whatever
you'd like once again this is Jason
Seifer granny was seen at how to that's

your Apple TV even if airplay isn't
present in the app make sure to visit us
