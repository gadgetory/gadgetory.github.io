to do it's the apple byte extra crunchy
podcast with your host mr. brian Tong
dude is your brain work my brains not
working man hm I still love you though
because your brain is actually working
welcome to the show everybody ladies and
gentlemen boys and girls just a little
early jump on the week here in the US it
is Thanksgiving coming up we only work
for three days oh I'm actually working
for today cuz guess where I'm heading
off to could you guess could you guess
hawaii hawaii man i wish i'm gonna come
back tan i'm gonna come back ten pounds
heavier I can't wait but you know before
we talk all that talk welcome the Apple
white extra crunchy it is our
complimentary audio podcast an extension
of the show really dig deep dive deep in
with us when you join us also you make
the show possible so we have our calls
that you guys can be a part of this show
1 800 61 62 63 8 leave your name where
you're from and your comments we've got
some great calls today even on this
short week so yeah we've got nothing but
love and we will continue to keep on
showing love to you right totally thank
you for calling thank you for calling
you guys help make the show so that's
quite honestly if we don't have you it's
like yeah I mean like no one with yeah
what are we going to talk about let's
just jump into the show again that
number before I go one more time I'll
say it slowly 1 800 61 62 63 8 someone
on periscopes like hey 1 800 dead live
it's like calls but they're not live but
they're dead live sure all right let's
get to it uh we've alluded to this and
started talking about this but the story
has really picked up steam and I am
talking about the antenna issues with
the iphone 7 now last week on this show
we talked about the potential chance
there were reports people are asking a
question is Apple potentially throttling
the maximum speed of the iphone 7 with
the Qualcomm modems on verizon and
sprint so I'm going to give a little
history backdrop for people that don't
know about this and they're just jumping
in and I don't want you to freak out
about I have the worst phone no just
let's let's just be cool about this okay
so first off there are two antennas
in two different antennas inside the
iphone 7 the AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile phones
have a intel-based LTE modem the verizon
and sprint phones have a qualcomm based
LTE modem and then also from what i've
read if you purchase the unlocked
version of the phone you will also be
blessed with the qualcomm LTE modem now
early on as far as a couple weeks ago an
independent tests found that when you're
in low signal locations and i found this
to be true even before this report came
out let's say you have one dot of data
yeah the qualcomm based modems perform
better seventy-five percent better in
relationship to data speed compared to
the AT&amp;amp;T modem phone so i believe right
there and I felt it I commute every day
all of a sudden when I use the iphone 7
like I'm not getting this good of a data
signal in general I I knew it right when
I happen so that is still holding true
okay so you might be frustrated about
that and you should be because I am the
next wrinkle to this story is that there
was a rumor that okay the Qualcomm modem
on Verizon and Sprint theoretically has
a maximum download data speed of 650
sorry 600 megabits per second compare
that to the Intel LTE modem that has a
theoretical maximum download speed of
450 megabits per second but tests have
found that both of the phones are
basically performing around the same in
that 450 megabit speed when it comes to
maximum download speed and again
depending on where you are how many
people on the network you know your data
is going to change your data speed and
performance and just cell phone
performance in general will be different
but the fact is that Apple was rumored
to potentially be throttling this and
now Bloomberg has stepped forward as
well as Rico to confirm that that is
indeed the case hmm how does that make
you feel Beecham it makes me bummed out
yeah like I would like full speed if I
have a modem that has the speed capable
I would like to have it you know give me
full power Scotty again to give me give
give it to me Scotty yes now
here's the other thing though where I
agree with you but at the same time it
is in Apple's best interest to have all
of their phones perform around
essentially at the same level for
example we know we've seen in computers
where sometimes processors are
overclocked for better performance and
sometimes they're not we've actually
even seen this in cell phones where you
could overclock a process of a phone
faster to perform better theoretically
but then you're also risking okay will
it get over we'll get too hot little
over key question right I'm gonna have a
hot phone in my pocket ha now this is
deliberately related to the Intel modem
which is not the actual process the
phone here is we've read this before but
let me see if i can find this quote um
specifically Apple had made a comment
here we go Apple's official statement on
the case and we did talk about this last
week but I'll say it again in all of our
rigorous lab tests based on wireless
industry standards in thousands of hours
of real-world field testing and an
extensive carrier partner testing the
data shows there is no discernible
difference in the wireless performance
of any of the models this is according
to Apple yeah so they're they're making
them all run the same speed basically
yeah they're making they're treating all
phones equal which again that makes I
say they should yeah it makes sense they
should do that quite honestly just
because a component can go faster if you
can't the whole question that I think is
kind of interesting is okay well what if
they were able to get enough Qualcomm
LTE modems as a whole and equipped all
of their phones with these modems then
that's when you're telling me uh you're
really not maximizing the speed because
you know you put the same hardware in
every product ideally again networks are
all different and some there's even you
know some at all so you can't imagine
all carriers are not going to also let
you get the maximum throughput of the
hardware that you have you you know
there's always limiters rattling me
they're already thrown right I get to 16
gigabytes and they're like hey you get
to 22 we're gonna throttle you they're
going to throttle yes they may slow
everybody down so
so we use too much data or data junkies
did so sometimes like the Wi-Fi here is
really bad in our building so I just
switched the LTE right yeah yeah and it
happens faster sometime no no that it
does most of the time bro like um so
anyways what I wanted to bring this
issue up about the two different
antennas is that it does exist this is
not an antenna gate where when you
squeeze your phone your phone actually
loses a signal oh yeah yeah it was
actual physical issue with the phone
when that happened on I it was yeah
physical issue yeah you put your hand
over certain parts of it and it would
lose signal if you squeeze it hard
enough it the things you'd have to
squeeze hard but in other cases um you
know it was just it was an actual issue
Apple solved it by saying hey guys
here's a free case so that she wouldn't
basically interfere with it as much okay
so this is all I'm telling you about
this antenna issue is because a I want
to educate you be it's good to know but
there's really nothing we can do about
it so is this something that Apple can
change like you know maybe you're down
the road it's an update technically
quite honestly if Apple they didn't
specifically say Apple how Apple might
be limited but it's most likely some
sort of a firmware update yeah that's
that day or a firmware that they have
placed on that specific phone so that it
doesn't reach its theoretical maximum
capacity yeah but at the same time if
all their phones can't reach this same
similar benchmark they're not going to
only say hey if you have a verizon phone
you're gonna get faster data right I got
you a lot of times when you get faster
data it's kind of more on the carrier
than it is on the actual phone because
that would I mean hey there fragmenting
their phones enough we have different
screens different screen sizes different
tech even moving forward in the future
with the whole potentially only one
iphone having an oled screen at the
biggest size with a dual lens camera I
mean we have we've already fragmented
their product line a bunch so who knows
but I just want to let people know and
don't feel lame I at first was gonna
make a bruja a big brouhaha and try to
get my AT&amp;amp;T phone switched out because
it does bother me um but there it's not
like they're just hey we're gonna swap
out your phone for you now it's not that
easy no so if you're someone who hasn't
purchased a phone yet though I would say
go through Apple or the querida
you get an unlocked version of the phone
totally because I think it's one
actually sorry I think it's the I could
be wrong correct me but I believe it's
the phone that is unlocked directly
through apple's also has a qualcomm
modem cool that's good to know i'm
just-just user tips yo ya no more dummy
kisses just thanks for the tip
unfortunately the unlock phones are a
little more expensive rattus you could
play well you can probably get one used
that's what yeah yeah yeah that's the
way to go for sure ok let's move on to
the next Apple story what's happening
what's shakin and what is bacon apple
believe do you believe this I do now
Apple according to a blurb Bloomberg
report is abandoning the development of
any wireless routers moving forward the
company recently stopped producing their
own monitors we know about this right
they used to have the great apple
display and that used to be the cinema
display they had like a 22-inch that I
bought they had a 23-inch that I bought
after that that was higher res because
at the time they were some of the best
displays on the market you were paying
the price of a computer for them don't
get me wrong only but things have
changed now we know what they're LG
Display it's a partnership but let's be
honest it's really an LG display
according to those Bloomberg report
Apple has disbanded its division that
develops wireless routers in another
move to try to sharpen their focus on
consumer products that generate a bulk
of its revenue according to people
familiar with the matter that's straight
from Bloomberg this is surprising to me
because the Internet of Things is a huge
thing you know the home kit all that
stuff that seems like this would tie
into that I will know this would be an
important piece of that puzzle I agree
with you and I think here's here's the
way that I can see it first of all let's
be honest Apple's wireless routers might
look pretty if you're into apples
aesthetic and design but there are
plenty of better routers on the market
from d-link I'm netgear from belk I mean
never seen an apple router in the wild
that you know what I'm saying well you
could come to my house and yes I'm sure
yeah I'm sure this time I Bryant on oh
my gosh I've never seen anyone with that
I've never had a friend who's had one
I've never really you've never had a
friend I've had any a friend but I've
never had a fro had a apple wireless
router I message in your my friend it's
like
I kind of understand like they don't
seem like they really were popular it's
not you have to be a die-hard Apple fan
to basically have an apple wireless
router I'm that's yeah you know who that
is reports them out for the Apple
routers no I will I will pour a little
out but we you know what we need to get
a pour some out but i'll only pour it
out when it's officially announced okay
because you know like this is a report
this is a report on this is a good
report I believe it's true but here's
some other reference to the apple
wireless routers they haven't refreshed
them since 2013 I've received plenty of
email saying hey should I get an apple
wireless router and my response was like
quite honestly if you get one now it's
not like they're going to be updating
the technology anytime soon I think one
of the new standards 802 11 AF which is
supposed to be pretty massive I mean
that's not really expected until another
year and a half or is it a G sorry G a G
but i think the number i think you said
was right i don't know that last yeah
letters AG is kind of the upcoming
consumer standard there's also
professional kind of commercial uses for
wireless connectivity but it's still not
coming out for another year and a half
so I told the person like you know it
it'll be fine but now I'm like don't
don't do it if you oh I also say there
are plenty of other actually better
alternatives there's this really cool
company called or be that does this like
awesome networking platform where you
can basically get these nodes and put
them in around your house Google's why
latest Wi-Fi routers are very similar to
that but or B is I actually like or be a
lot look it up y'all but again looks
like and it's I don't think they're
selling these in droves but they were at
a long time ago Apple's getting on the
wireless network router business I do
want to say for the record if I recall
right someone can correct me i believe
the ibook the clamshell I book was one
of the first laptops with Wyatt with a
with a Wi-Fi card in it oh really I
recall right yeah yeah Apple way back in
the day actually helped pioneer and push
Wi-Fi forward at least from a consumer
standpoint because and I remember the
reason why I was so high on getting
these wireless net the airport base
station that look like a silver
UFO the very frightened one whore the
very first one that looked like UFOs it
was because they were pushing this Ford
but now like all industries and
companies mature there they're not on
the front end of this anymore they
really aren't yeah yeah yeah so it makes
sense that they would bow out there
again there's no official statement but
I remember these I have I actually still
own a white it's like the second or
third gen a white UFO AirPort base
station that I just held onto because I
just thought it was dope put in the
museum put it in the brian Tong museum
of apple products I will I will we'll
put that in their book that we're gonna
take it out take some pictures of it
let's just hand glue it just handed blue
that thing will bind it ourselves all
right so I'm so that's the latest going
on with apple and wireless oh yeah well
we'll pour some out when it's official
we just wanted to also follow up this is
a real quick mention we've talked about
the breakdown in past episodes of why
Apple limited their macbook pros to 16
gigs of RAM a lot of people like look
there's other laptops and computers that
can clearly go up to a higher capacity
32 gig specifically phil schiller
directly now address this specific issue
he said this was first broken down in a
article by ben Slaney of mack daddy so
he talked about how the current chipset
intel chips and we have talked about
this a few more than a few weeks ago the
current chips that doesn't support the
faster ram that is available for 32 gigs
of ddr3 lower power speed of ddr ram
that could have helped push it but
apple's chipset specifically the intel
processor doesn't support it at the
moment and if they were to push forward
with the ram that it does support it
would require using up more power and we
talked about how the laptop could
potentially only get four to five hours
of battery life instead of 10 yeah and
if you're going to really choose that
trade-off you're going to say i would
like a 10 hour battery laptop battery
life over like milliseconds of time
saved exactly so people were frustrated
about I think people have gotten over it
but i also think as people are using the
macbook pro more I've
had some interesting emails of just
people that just haven't been as
satisfied with it at all right from just
from overall they're like this is not a
pro machine but again there's a lot of
pros that use it like a consumer machine
that call themselves pros I room we see
them every day in our office I know
sometimes I use my laptop to do some pro
work yes it is harder you know it takes
a little longer if it works you're such
a proud a pro man so Phil Schiller just
basically dressed the same issue and
confirm what we believe that it was all
about battery life and optimizing it for
that and again you can listen to past
episodes where we really really just get
into it apple also addressing another
issue with iphone repairs we talked
about last week of the touch disease
issue affecting iphone six-plus models
and that they have a $149 repair program
Apple has launched another repair
program this one is specific to models
of the iPhone 6s with a specific serial
number they would have had to been
manufactured between September and
October of 2015 because some of these
because these phones within that range
had unexpected shutdown issues so the
phone would just shut down I haven't had
that problem I haven't so I feel like
I'm okay yeah I think but what you what
you can do is you can call apple and
find out basically go to apple support
or if you look really close you find out
the serial number and then match talk to
them and see if you fall within that
range it will be a free battery
replacement that seems to be part of
this issue that will hopefully cure the
those wounds of unexpected shutdowns and
again this is specific to the iphone
success cool yeah i remember hearing
reports of people saying when their
battery gets to like 45 or something 40
there's a percentage and then it would
just shut just shut off that that's what
we're just shut off I remember now also
since it's Thanksgiving in the US for
all you Apple watch lovers Apple watch
has a special Thanksgiving activity
achievement if you run or walk 5k a
distance of 5k on November the 24th you
could earn a unique award and an
iMessage sticker that looks like a
circle turkey
with a looks like the ICA logo
discolored up a little bit some way to
get you get that if you want like an
exclusive dirt yet because you know like
on Thanksgiving Day come on you're
you're not walking on you're just
sitting I'm sitting I'm falling asleep
because i'm eating turkey and there's
that um what is it tryptophan tryptophan
baby dude I'm trippin with the van I'm
gonna be watching the parade like Macy's
Day Parade and your jammies in my jams
with some send me sort of alcoholic send
me a picture that I'd like to see that
how will tweet you miss your friends
don't you can send my family you need
some jammies fret so if you're loving
your Apple watching you want to go work
out and get a cool exclusive to that day
like it's an iMessage sticker actually
so i guess the hope is that you can brag
you know what's really annoying your
friends like happy thanksgiving and you
just send the iMessage sticker i just
completed 5k on thanks Amy I don't give
a flippin you know yeah I'm gonna be
like cool glug glug glug glug glug ah Oh
football game ah cool you're cool no
you're not wait totally lame all right
let's keep on rolling through this uh
you had I guess let's let's keep on to
your stories cuz I like okay your
contributions to this yes so I got a
tweet I got a tweet I got a tweet from a
guy and I I'm so sorry i don't know i
don't have his name right now hang on
let me see my gonna find him yeah but he
sent me this thing and this guy built an
apple mirror and the tweet came from me
from j something 88 okay anyway so
there's this apple mere that this guy
created and it's basically a giant
mirror right but he modded it so that it
works like an iphone is it actually
connected to an iphone i believe it is
connect i think there's an iphone inside
the mirror and it projects all this
stuff on the mirror so anyway okay well
people remember some people can't see
this would explain it it's pretty cool
like you know has it looks like an
iphone like this the shape of the mirror
is like an iphone it has the icons on it
you can move the icons around you could
do anything that an iphone can do but
it's just in a mirror so imagine you're
leaving your home in the morning and you
look at the mirror you know you're
checking your stuff oh let me check the
weather yeah yeah yeah check the weather
may be put on a song if it's
Siri enabled you can say hey Siri play
some music from your mirror whatever
else he has it connected to like a sonos
speaker it just it looks pretty cool and
then I was like I was really thinking
about it would I use this like would
this be practical and I mean it would it
could be just for if it's all
voice-activated things that you wanted
to do just play music play a video or
something like that but I don't really
see myself going up to a mirror a whole
lot and like pushing buttons see that's
the thing with it you know you're
normally further I look first of all I
could never do this so I will not you
know like sometimes we see these tech
things and were like oh screw that crap
I'm like dude I could never do this so
I'm gonna give props to the iphone
mirror second of all it actually looks
like what a future iphone would be
because youngsil yeah and thirdly it
does have one thing in common with the
iphone what's that no headphone jack no
head bowed oh yeah baby you know I had
to throw that one in there but yeah I
thought it was I thought it was a pretty
cool concept you know I mean for people
who are super vain and one of like being
the mirror all the time and I I guess
who does that who sees that type of
stuff who cares about how they look I
can see it being you know the way he has
it here in this Anna's website oh the
maker by the way let me let me say his
name I'm sorry a Raphael die mech I
believe that's how you say his name
Ronnie diamond you know you're a good
man you're like I've got to say dude's
name it's really it's important yeah we
actually gave me permission to use this
video oh that's really cool and I might
try to get him on skype just to tell
them like you know how are you using
this thing blah blah blah because I like
I'm actually checking my bet my butt at
you know I saw that that's one make sure
my butt looks tight yeah i'm using me
what is that app the UH but I have the
photo the photo booth app to take
pictures at night but in the mirror oh
my gosh but anyway the way he has it set
up it's like at the bottom of stairs
next to his you know his table like yeah
this table worries puts his keys or
whatever so eight I mean it looks like
it could be a practical thing it looks
kind of cool i mean okay i guess you
wanted to have I think it's I think it's
fun and it's cool that someone sends you
like hey let's just talk about on the
show that's what we do and then you had
one other thing that you want to show us
is that right this is another tweet like
last week I mentioned we need to make
the iphone great again
some dude stargaze on twitter he sent me
this iphone 7 concept video it's just
like a little real quick thing yeah I've
seen you know you know right well it's
like in your own internet when you're on
the internet like all the time which is
what we do it's like that's kind of my
job to be this sponge that absorbs so
much information some of it useful some
of a lot of a worthless yeah most of it
useful that there's a what reason why my
brain doesn't necessarily function all
the time yeah but yeah it's cool I like
yeah that's pretty interesting right
yeah I'll all around the video screen
goes all the way around the edges of the
phone and it just you know what am I is
is very he's trying to make that again
so thanks thanks thanks to our gaze all
right should we hit up our voicemails
yes okay let's go okay we have a couple
let's see number one hi this is Martin
from Raleigh North Carolina and I wanted
to know if there's any news concerning
the Apple file system or a PSS that's
supposed to come out circa 2017
something like that would this only be
for Mac OS or would it expensive the
entire Apple platform like iphones ipods
ipads to watch an apple tv's what it
really benefit consumers would just be
something that Apple is trying to tell
us we need like dongle gates I was
wondering if you could comment on that
love the show that was Martin right I
love it so for every one that doesn't
have necessarily reference of what he's
asking about this is the Apple file
system this is their new file system
that they're looking to push forward
through in a 2017 what we mean by a file
system so for example when you format
your hard drive right if you've ever
seen like they offer you an option when
you just want to do like an apple
specifically formatted hard drive there
was HFS then there was hfs+ Apple is
developing a new basically a modern file
system not only will it be compatible
with macs but basically all their other
OS platforms like iOS Mac OS T TV TV
vollis Michaels McMichaels there also is
actually a developer preview of the
Apple file system for people that real
we know what they're doing yes it was
just looking at that in Michael Sierra
so you can check that out but what are
some of its benefits it's optimized for
flash and SSD storage it features strong
encryption multiple levels of encryption
there's copy-on-write for metadata and
cloning of files there's a few other
things but what I wanted to talk about
is the reason why they're doing this is
first of all HFS and hfs+ are more than
30 years old so they were developed
during the era of floppy disks all right
things have changed file sizes have
changed so let's be honest no matter
what there's a lot of legacy code and
junk in there in that file system that
makes it less efficient and so for Apple
to develop a new modern file system that
can only be good now there really hasn't
been any new major news around it even
them from what I've seen in the
developer community I think it's a great
call because it gives us an opportunity
to educate people that are listening
about it I think that if any of you are
developers that are working specifically
with it and can maybe give us some
insight on it we would love to hear it
from our show again our number is 1 800
61 62 63 8 but there have been no new
major developments on other than the
fact that yes we are expecting to see it
in 2017 but I think some of the main
benefits of it is again it is going to
be a new modern filing system the
encryption level on this is article from
ARS technica that pointed out you know
there's multiple layers or levels of
encryption for files there is
unencrypted there's a single key for
metadata for the user data and then the
final one that is kind of brings it to a
higher level multi key with different
choices for metadata files and even
sections of the files them this is it's
more complex it's going to be more
efficient and ultimately I think that
being able to use that same modern file
system across multiple Apple os's is
going to be a benefit just from a speed
performance standpoint as well so is it
going to help me when I'm trying to find
a little thumb drive to put a file from
an apple computer onto a pc computer
sure no that's always the problem I
write soon yeah look the thing is that
no matter what your you're gonna most
likely for
at your drives and in the PC format
because as anything apples HFS format
right if you format a drive like that
you won't see it on a pc but when you pc
formatted drive you'll be able to see it
on PC and Macs you've got to imagine
that's going to be exactly the same with
this Apple file its new Apple file
system I wouldn't it really would be the
dumbest thing and he made a great joke
like are they just telling us this is
going to be good to use it probably to a
certain degree but I think if you're a
developer and why not or if you're
looking to really bring on a modern
system this is going to be more than
welcome cool though I'm down with it
right on ok all right next call hey
Brian just want to ask but do you think
the macbook pros way to extend
difference range ok thanks bye you like
how I said way way way I think I think
you know I've been hearing that from a
lot of people that it's just way too
expensive I think when you compare it to
what's available in the market today
overall best bang for buck is not going
to be the apple macbook pro but that's
not why you buy it like I've come from
the from the from a background like
everyone says is it worth my money to me
only you can answer that question now
when something is a complete ripoff like
that Apple book I'm just kidding I'm
still tempted to buy that stupid ass
thing I really am I shame shame for even
saying that but I need to admit it and
be honest with the audience that yeah
I'm still kind of tempted to buy it
probably should have bought it on day
one so I could do a video that could get
lots of use it would have got lots of I
know but sure you know what guess what
I'm not about clickbait I'm about
quality ok and and click bait so I can
keep my job it but uh yeah you know I'm
never gonna tell someone how much
something has work to them like
someone's like hey should i buy this is
there like oh is it worth spending three
hundred dollars in an Apple watch I'm
like it's your money I'm not going to
answer that for you yeah I've to me it's
way too much money it's just twenty-five
hundred dollars like that's a lot I'll
buy you like for laptops for like hi
Finn literally you could legitimately
get to high-end yeah PCs laptops like no
joke totally so for my opinion it's too
expensive
let's also remember again not here to
rip on it no just an observation I would
love to have one I would love to have
one too like honestly I'm gonna make it
my next work computer I think q2 they
said is when i'll be able to upgrade my
current you too yeah so it's like
securely wait I'm not even gonna use the
touch bar but I'm gonna get it Oh we'll
be using the touch bar will be using it
I'm gonna mode to you with it that's all
I care about someone's like oh man the
touch bar is amazing yeah I'm emoji
that's all I'm gonna use it for i'm just
all right one more comical hey if kiara
denial and i had a question so I
currently have like an iphone 5s and had
only 16 gigabytes and i was wondering
like is it gonna be a huge difference if
i get the iphone 7 plus model like what
is the pro notices cons and I believe
that's all okay I've good nice day
thanks gotta show love to ladies what's
up Kyra thanks for calling from Ohio
Ohio the Buckeye State yeah so what is
although the home of the Cleveland
Cavaliers which I'll let that pass for
now NBA champs I'll let that pass for
now don't remind me runners-up World
Series weren't runners-up yeah so I
think look Mike one of my friends has
has a she said 5s right 5s yeah one of
my friends is still holding out on his
5s in the anticipation that the iphone 8
is gonna be just mind-boggling and I'm
like dude if you get the iphone 7 it's
gonna blow your mind away if you have an
iphone 5s totally it's everything about
your like oh my gosh like what what
planet have i been on yeah yeah i mean
just the camera alone like boom yeah
yeah let's change your life but I mean
that the storage like da she heard her
questions about the store 16 gigabytes
is nothing um so yeah her she probably
has like no music on it two photos yeah
couple photos couple videos and then she
has to like sync it and take all that
stuff off to like put more stuff on
iphone 7 will change you're gonna go
like six months probably without having
to back everything yeah yeah I I would
six months and again what 32 gigs is a
starting point so that alone is gonna be
awesome could you met imagine a world
where you don't have to delete photos
constantly to make up space oh man I
actually I like delete me it'll work out
because i know i can get my music back
so i delete albums to make space but
that was in the past because i have her
60 fo iran in my 60 oh he's on the six
bow oh yeah I'm rolling my 60 file so i
