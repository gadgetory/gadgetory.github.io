really massive phones it has to turn
them into games consoles on the west
rate have seen edge taking a look at the
Samsung gamepad so you may have seen
something like this before the gamepad
is an Xbox style controller that
connects to your phone via bluetooth you
attach your phone using this strap on
the back
I'm told that it will handle a phone
anywhere between four and six point
three inches so it's perfect for
Samsung's larger devices it doesn't just
work with Samsung phones as long as your
mobile is running at least Android 4.3
and as at least Bluetooth 3.0 then this
should be compatible now with some of
these game pads you find that the
buttons don't generally match up
properly with games which may seem quite
hard to play
Samsung has thought about that a little
bit when you press this play button here
you get Samsung's s console now this
shows curated games that Samsung has
tested to make sure that they work with
the gamepad I'm not sure whether this is
something you really want to be carrying
around it's an extra bulky item to carry
when you could just be playing games on
the touch screen fun I have to say that
these controls do feel more comfortable
more responsive than some other similar
game pads I've tried it's recently gone
on sale expect to pay about $79 I'm Luke
