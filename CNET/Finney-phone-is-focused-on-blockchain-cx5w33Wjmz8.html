Seiran labs announced the finis phone
and finis pc it's a combo it calls the
finis device family now the hook is that
both can take advantage of blockchain
applications and be a secure way to
transfer and store cryptocurrency
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies all
work because blockchain technology is
keeping track and verifying all
transactions but blockchain can be used
in more things besides cryptocurrency we
are entering an age where apps are
starting to use it to keep all kinds of
transactions running smoothly so here is
the company trying to get ahead of this
trend and create a phone that can bring
together all these disjointed apps that
work with their own blockchains the
Finney phone is essentially an Android
phone with a split personality you get
all the Android apps but you can switch
over to the syren operating system for a
more secure environment woven into the
phone as syren zone blockchain and
currency verification system along with
encrypted messaging it's a little bit
thick for those not acquainted with
blockchain the company's promo video is
so filled with jargon it's like a parody
straight out of the HBO show Silicon
Valley the possibilities are endless
less flashy video features the CEO of
the company and he's explaining how the
users should not need to know the
technology behind blockchain to benefit
from the extra security that's working
in the background the fitty phone is
available for pre-order now for around
$1000 and bloomberg is reporting the
phone is scheduled to ship in October
this is not the first phone from ceiran
labs in 2016 it came out with Silurian
it's an Android phone that cost a
whopping sixteen thousand dollars it's
made of luxury materials and had extra
layers of encryption I'm Bridget Carey
