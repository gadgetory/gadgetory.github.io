other our brand and how we can make
Flickr awesome again we've made Flickr
spectacular full resolution photos up
full resolution photos down when you
upload and share your photos you don't
lose any fidelity no one else does that
no one else does that by default for
sure in terms of really preserving your
photos and making them shareable in
their full fidelity we also have created
a Android app that allows your photos to
be wherever and this is in addition to
our iOS app and PC so wherever you are
whatever device any screen any friends
you can upload your photos you can share
your photos Flickr works on all major
platforms and finally bigger the
terabyte of space that's now available
to our users and earlier today we were
going over various statistics so there's
all kinds of fun ways to slice and dice
this number but the one I thought was
really striking is if we take the users
that are on Flickr today those 89
million users and we scaled them up to
the terabyte all of the photos that have
ever been taken in the world fit inside
of it we're allocating that much space
and not only do they fit inside of it
they fit inside of it ten times over so
if you take all the photos if you take
all the photos ever taken in the entire
world and uploaded them to Flickr they
would only take 1/10 of the space that's
available to our current users this is
about putting lifetimes of photos on
Flickr and absorbing all of the beauty
that is that is a photograph into our
daily habits I also think it's
worthwhile to look at the before and
after shots because it helps you really
understand how far the products come so
yesterday this was the Flickr homepage
or actually an hour
ago this was the Flickr homepage now
this is the Flickr homepage it's all
about the photographs yesterday this was
your photo stream those photos that were
being uploaded this is what it looked
like
not very much about the photo lots of
white space lots of text now this is
what your photo stream your profile page
looks like on flickr a cover photo
full-bleed images and a justified view
of photographs in terms of the overview
of your sets what we call your out your
albums are called fats on Flickr used to
look like this again not very much about
the photograph today the view of a user
sets what the user sets look like looks
like this really exciting very immersive
and of course viewing photos which is
what people do on Flickr it used to look
like this again not much about the
photos a map lots of comments lots of
blue links we decided that when you're
viewing photos on Flickr it should be
about the photo so we're going to full
justified photographs that really take
out the whole screen use the full
resolution and we embody that same thing
with a full screen slideshow available
for your viewing and for your sharing on
Flickr and finally search this of course
searches near and dear to Yahoo's hard
this is what search on Flickr looked
like yesterday and this is what search
looks like today bigger images more
immersive more expressive a better
answer to the users query we're really
excited about all of the updates to the
interface we think it makes a slicker a
much more awesome product
