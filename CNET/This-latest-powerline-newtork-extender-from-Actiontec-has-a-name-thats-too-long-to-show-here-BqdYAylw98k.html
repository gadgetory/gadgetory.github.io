action tech wireless network extender a+
powerline network adapter of 500 kids
now you know that you Ignace is amazing
when you can say that in one breath so
don't try at home in fact the name is so
long and so inclusive and so descriptive
that I believe my job's done here so see
you next time just kidding there's a lot
more to this one here than his name so
let's find out now first of all this is
a set of two network powerline adapter
right here power I because when you plug
these two into one socket it turned the
power wiring of your home into a network
cable that connects the two units right
here after that you can use a short
metal cable to connect this adapter
right here to your router and this big
fat one right here to a device like
let's say your desktop computer and
you're not you just extend it your whole
network to that far corner where this
adapter is now this one right here is
big for a good reason number one it
comes with not one but two network ports
right here that means that you can
actually connect two Y devices such as
your computer and your ex back to your
network at the same time on top of that
it also has a built-in Wi-Fi network and
my testing the kid here worked out very
well actually almost well enough for me
to fall in love with it but I didn't and
I do have a few excuses and number one
because there's not enough instruction
now the kid here actually very easy to
use and chances are you would not need
help at all
in fact it come included with this d4y 5
setting right here and out of the box it
works immediately but what if you want
to change the default networks name to
something else that you want well good
luck because according to the quick
setup guy right here you can go to the
website actually intake and check out
the full instruction how to do that but
when I went there there was no
information at all now the second is
this adapter here is really huge and
very thick as you can see it doesn't
come with a pass-through power socket
and it come with a snap-on desire right
here and that mean it wouldn't block the
access to the nearby socket
and because pollard after that generally
need to be plugged directly into the
world to use and this gonna be a pain to
use when you don't have that many
sockets at the far end corner of the
house finally the thing that turns me up
the most is the hardware component and
the to adapter here support the home
plug AV 500 and supposed to give you up
to 500 megabit per second a powerline
connection unfortunately though all of
their network port right here support
the regular ethernet standard and that
means at most you get 100 bits per
second and on the Wi-Fi side support the
dual stream of the 802.1 and standard
and only works on the 2.5 gigahertz
frequency band now that is a standard of
2009 and that brings me to the
performance in my testing these two here
I should perform well but because their
specs are so low they was not at all
impressive when used with my clients as
expected it offer about the same speed
as a regular Ethernet connection some 88
megabit per second on the Wi-Fi side it
was much worse
I got about 40 megabit per second as
close rain when I increase the rate to
75 feet I got only about eight megabit
per second really slow and you cannot
really use this further than 75 feet
unfortunately now you know if you just
want to extend your whole network to
share the internet connection and your
broadband connection is modest and the
kid here will work out just fine for
just about ninety dollars it is actually
pretty good deal now for more on this
kid right here check out my full review
Cellcom and you do need to read that
really before you buy it because now
that you know the name no matter how
long it is doesn't always translate into
how amazing the subject is with one
exception that's my name now that's
something we can overcome that's because
I'm Domo and this has been the first
look at these things right here from
