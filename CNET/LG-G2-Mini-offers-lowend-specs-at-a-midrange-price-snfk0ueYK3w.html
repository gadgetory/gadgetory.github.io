LG g2 mini is the smaller less powerful
but mercifully cheaper version of LG's
flagship now it's a funny old world when
a 4.7 inch phone could be called mini
but it is admittedly smaller than the
5.2 inch g2 it has a narrow bezel around
the screen which helps keep the body
size down so it actually has similar
dimensions to the 4.5 inch motorola moto
G it's reasonably comfortable to use in
one hand although I'm not keen on the
scratchy plastic back which I think
makes it feel a bit cheap like the g2 it
keeps its power and volume buttons on
the back rather than on the side it's a
nice idea in theory of they're
positioned exactly where your finger
sits when you're holding the phone even
so I found they took a lot of getting
used to and I just don't think volume
button position is a problem that needed
fixing to begin with although it bears
the same name of the flagship for GT
Mini is watered down in nearly every
respect we display have a very
disappointing 960 by 540 pixel
resolution which is less than the Moto
G's 1280x720 screen and that cost less
in half and at least has decent colors
and it's fairly bright but it just
doesn't have the clarity around icons or
in text but you'd get from a higher
resolution panel the processor is
heavily watered down - with a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core chip inside rather
than the much more sprightly 2.2 chip in
the g2 it handles the everyday tasks
fine but it starts to struggle when it
comes to more demanding gaming rather
than the 13 megapixel camera of the g2
the mini pax an 8 megapixel camera on
the back which managed to take some good
shots and its HDR mode works well the
battery put in a strong performance on
our drain test and it's removable in
case you want to carry a spare
while the g2 mini does come with a
cheaper price when it's Big Brother it
seriously waters down all the specs if
you're looking for a more pocketable
phone with the power of a flagship look
towards the superb Sony Xperia z1
compact if you are on a budget though
than Motorola MOTO
has a better screen similar power and
the same up-to-the-minute version of
android kitkat
and hit coughed half the price of the g2
mini the Moto G doesn't have 4G but
that's probably a good compromise
considering the price safe to say the GT
Mini is not quite the shrunken flagship
we hoped it would be
I'm Andrew Hoyle for CNET and this is
the LG g2 mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
