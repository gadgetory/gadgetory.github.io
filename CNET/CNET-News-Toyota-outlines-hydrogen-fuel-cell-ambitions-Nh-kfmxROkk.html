today is really gonna change our world
and sooner rather than later
for years the use of hydrogen gas to
power automobiles has been seen by many
smart people as a foolish quest the
point of view is reminiscent of the
opinions 20 years ago of how the Prius
hybrid was called by many as a science
project that would never be economically
feasible the point is as change takes
persistence instead of turning out
clever phrases we at Toyota have been
turning wheels with electricity by
combining hydrogen and oxygen in an
inboard fuel cell system hydrogen as we
know works beautifully with oxygen to
create water and electricity and
absolutely nothing more hydrogen is
plentiful and there are many ways to
produce it and many of those are
sustainable and as we all know a fuel
cell is more efficient to operate than a
gasoline engine which means it requires
less fuel to travel the same distance
and again produces zero emissions in
2015 we will bring this technology to
market now that's not to say our work is
done and there are challenges ahead - in
particular the first is building the
vehicle and an affordable price and the
second is what are we doing to help
build that critical hydrogen refueling
infrastructure this project has been
fully in-house from the start we needed
to invent the tools which to develop
build and safety test
a truly brand new exotic powertrain by
far the biggest advance is coming to
market with a reasonably priced car have
been related to the materials the design
in the manufacturing the beauty is is we
have seen considerable improvement in
all three of those areas which is why
we're so bullish on fuel cells Toyota
has been in the dry battery business for
a long time
we love batteries we're the world leader
in hybrid electronics the dedication to
battery technology continues but
compared to battery electrics the rate
of cost reduction that we have seen in
fuel cell electric technology has been
staggering that's why our hydrogen fuel
cell electric vehicles will be in our
future sooner than many people believe
and in much greater numbers than anyone
expected the state has recently approved
more than 200 million dollars in fueling
for as many as 100 new stations 20 by
2015 and 40 by 2016 now those numbers
may sound small but one thing we believe
is that the issue for the infrastructure
isn't about how many there are but
rather location location and location
now Toyota and the University of
California the advanced energy program
collaborated on a spatial model that
maps out specific distribution of
stations the locations considered a
variety of data including hybrid and
electric ownership patterns traffic
patterns population density and so on
the model was based on the assumption
that owners would want to reach a
refueling station within six minutes of
their home or work what this model
produced was an initial cluster map that
identified only 68 station sites in the
San Francisco Bay Area Silicon Valley
Los Angeles Orange and San Diego
counties now if implemented this
them could handle a fuel-cell population
conservatively estimated at about 10,000
vehicles and the study went further by
using this model if every vehicle in the
state of California ran on hydrogen we
could meet refueling logistics with only
15% of the nearly 10,000 gas stations
that are currently operating in the
state we don't need a station on every
corner it's not about how many it's
about their location</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
