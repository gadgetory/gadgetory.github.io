a pretty simple remote at first glance
maybe a little too simple but hidden
just beneath the surface are a ton of
very helpful features here are five tips
and tricks for the Apple Siri remote
like on iOS double tapping the home
button or in this case double pressing
the TV button will bring up the app
switcher this shows all your recent apps
that you've used and swiping up on any
of them will force close the app the
force closing an app might not fix the
problem you're having you may also want
to consider rebooting the Apple TV there
is a reboot option in the settings menu
but you can get to it faster by long
pressing menu and the TV button and
holding them until you see a blinking
light on the front of the Apple TV when
you see it let go of the buttons and the
Apple TV will reboot watching something
on Apple TV at night or in a dark room
and returning to the mostly-white home
screen can be a little harsh on the eyes
so in a recent update Apple rolled out a
feature called dark mode you can switch
between light and dark mode in the
settings but you can get to it even
faster by just asking Siri just hold the
Siri button and say light mode or dark
mode to switch between the two since the
Siri remote has a touchpad scrubbing
through video playback is pretty simple
just click the pause and then drag left
or right on the touchpad to move forward
or backward in the timeline then
likewise there are shortcuts clicking
only left or right edge of the touchpad
will jump forward or backward 10 seconds
but an even faster way to scrub is to
use Siri you can just hold this area
button and say jump forward 10 minutes
or go back 2 minutes but if you know the
exact time of where you want to start a
video you can save that exact time hold
the Siri button and say go to 20 minutes
and you'll start at the 20 minute mark
if you lose or break the Siri remote or
you just don't like it you can also use
an iOS device as a remote for your Apple
TV just go to the App Store download the
Apple TV remote app make sure your iOS
device is on the same Wi-Fi network at
your Apple TV and connect the two thanks
to a recent update you can also cue up
Siri with the remote app which was not
previously possible also with a recent
update Apple rolled out the TV app which
is like a guide for Apple TV but with
this change came changes for the Siri
remote the TV or home button now takes
you back to the TV app not the home
screen you can change this in the
settings just go to settings remotes and
devices and
the toggle beside home button to switch
between taking you back home and the TV
app for more on Apple TV and other tips
