stores for the announcement on March 7th
is Samsung resting on its laurels for
the Galaxy s3 is Google copying Siri and
speaking of Google did it file a patent
to make a computer trackpad it's more
like a phone's touchscreen all that yeas
and nays and more today on rumor has it
it's Tuesday February 28 2012 and
welcome to rumor house and everyone I'm
Emily Dreyfus and I'm Korean Levy and
welcome to the Internet's most awesome
greatest of all time game show who on
earth ever yes and this is rumor has it
where we round up the week's hottest
rumors and then we discuss them forever
and ever and ever and talk about them
and love them and cradle them in our
arms and decide which one sound true and
which one sound like utter funk and then
we bet on them and then at the end of
the month the loser has to do something
embarrassing and this month it might be
me because if we check the leaderboard
over here
rumor has it scoreboard we went back and
found yep is actually beating me by one
point and that is because ladies and
gentlemen if you have been brushing your
teeth for the past half an hour or
checking your email or in a meeting or
dropping your children off from school
you may have missed that Apple send out
invites to the iPad 3 event so what that
means is the iPad 3 is confirmed it is
coming out on March 7th it may not be
called the iPad 3 do we know that 4 do
we know what's coming out on March 7th
they just gonna know they're gonna
announce it on March 7th but Apple isn't
8 we'll make it available yeah they make
it available piratical and in fact they
have not called it the iPad 3 I want to
bring that back it could be the iPad 2's
still folks great but it is definitely
an iPad iPad and it's a new iPad that's
gonna be released they sent out invites
to an unveiling announcement that will
be in San Francisco right down the
street from us so I will be missing from
work that day
and crowding the offices of the Yerba
Buena Center for the Arts to try to get
in because I clearly didn't get an
invite only
Josh Lowen sin did and it says on this
invite we have something you really have
to see and touch and it shows an image
of a finger
marking Wednesday March 7th on the
calendar on the screen of a new iPad and
so there are two things to notice about
this image first of all if that's the
bottom of the iPad where's the home
button maybe they're doing away with the
home button which is crazy because that
button kind of does a lot of stuff um
and then second it says we have
something you really have to see and
touch and as we've been talking about on
the show for a really long time the the
most expected and exciting and lauded
new feature coming on the iPad 3 is the
idea that it's going to have the Retina
display which is the super dense
beautiful gorgeous HD display that the
iPad has I mean that the iPhone has but
made bigger for the iPad 3 which means
that them everyone was the I've had one
on the iPad 2 will be really sad because
the iPad 3 will have amazing better
graphics so I feel as though them saying
they something you really have to see is
sort of a hint that it might have said
Retina display we so we voted on whether
it would be happen on March 7th and so I
voted yes and you said no which is where
the point comes in now we also voted on
whether would have a Retina display and
I said no and you said yes so that's
gonna happen that's for next month so
it'll just depend on what actually
transpired like that so that won't be in
time for the humiliation day next week
because the event is happening again to
embarrass me in the 7th maybe that could
be the humiliation is Emily trying to
get into the Apple event so we will so
we that means we'll have to push back
our humiliation day a week which would
be worth it
for Emily to try to get into the event
yes
now um since that wasn't a rumor that's
just news that we wanted to give you off
the top because it's very exciting and
obviously we've been talking about the
iPad 3 for a really long time we're
gonna get into our rumors in one second
but before that we have a very special
moment yes our very special steven has a
message yes I would like to take this
time to address our new YouTube fans
we've recently began syndicating to
YouTube and rumor has it is there now
you can go watch all of our seen that
podcast shows but before we before I
address them I just I just want to be
the first to make the comment you know
how they do a first second third to do
pre-emptive comment on our video before
anyone else gets a chance to so first of
all I'd like to say you're stupid yeah I
believe I think you're dumb I hate your
dumb face and I'm hitting the dislike
button on you and I think you're lame so
thank you for comment
anybody who else who says anything like
that is copying they're gonna have to
work a little bit harder to insult how
we look how we speak and everything
about us why we were born right and I
feel like we should do that very special
welcome every week just as a reminder to
our new YouTube fans we're watching your
women and you should get back in the
kitchen oh right that is another big one
that will you keep getting and stop
cackling like hens yeah so I will try to
stop cackling like a hen while I cook
breakfast
so thank you YouTube for you thank you
thank you for taking a moment out of
your life so so should we get to the
rumors yeah so the stuff is super
exciting I'm really excited that it's
finally happening that we don't have to
ever talk about it anymore
after next we and Steven do you have an
iPad already no I'm gonna come waiting
for them
Wow somebody grocery list oh maybe we
can all look at that one and then you
have a one yeah maybe it's time to go
green the one I have to see one will get
a three and then we'll be like a little
traveling iPad fan yeah we can oh yeah
totally you like play
first of all problem my case isn't big
enough for my iPad all right so our
first rumor is not about anything Apple
related finally for once it is about the
galaxy s3 and that details of this phone
have leaked online so information
obtained by boy Gina support boy genius
report ggr tells us that Samsung plans
to launch the device across more than 50
markets or cities simultaneously which
is good news for those hoping to see the
US models arrive at or near the same
time as its international counterpart
which doesn't always happen sometimes
they release it in Europe first and then
everybody here is sad and then buy the
thing that comes out they're done with
it because they don't wanna be number
one we never want to be number one so
the galaxy s3 will run Android 4.0 Ice
Cream Sandwich of course and it'll have
Samsung's TouchWiz UI and it will boast
a massive 4.8 inch full HD display which
is great no it's it's so edge to edge e
more specifically the screen will be
1080p HD and will offer 16.9 16 to 9
aspect ratio which is would be perfect
to connect your TV and totally and to
watch movies and that is unheard of as
of now no no phone until now has had the
16 to 9 aspect ratio so that's crazy and
we were just getting used to the 720p HD
screens and then they're gonna blow our
minds with 1080p if I got this 1080p
phone it would be better than my TV yeah
my TV in 720 yeah so is mine totally
like everybody gather round
by four and point eight inch screen
better it'll run a 1.5 quad gigahertz
quad-core Samsung Exynos processor it'll
have an 8 megapixel real rear camera 2
megapixel front-facing camera 4G LTE
connectivity and rounding out the
details or my favorite detail is that
it'll come in a ceramic case which seems
so weird is that a thing and then you
know which is different from Samsung
which usually goes with plastic cases
which are you know the chassis my
all-time so I don't know what a ceramic
case it sounds like that would be even
more breakable more laughable yeah but
you know know there are some like
hardcore intense really strong ceramics
out there so maybe yeah I mean maybe
that's a thing and maybe it's lighter
than metal and maybe I don't know what
that thing's better gets less hot or
something totally so I mean clearly
there's a reason for them to do that so
in an earlier show in this show that we
have no idea what happened in it because
we were exhausted at las velas Vegas at
the CES show we reported that the device
might be released at Mobile World
Congress and it hasn't yet it's not it's
officially delayed it's not coming in my
rule so it's not so that so I don't know
how we voted because that that show is
like stays in Vegas including that show
so now the new reports are saying that
it will come out sometime in May so in
this story Scott Webster the person who
wrote the story points out that when
this phone comes out it'll be the most
popular Android smartphone out there
most likely because just last week
Samsung announced that the galaxy 2 sold
20 million units in only 10 months and
its sales are just increasing they're
not even slowing down they're just
ramping up and so they're doing so well
with the s2 their Wonder Apple is suing
them well that's oh my god totally
they're ripping off yet one more thing
from Apple letting people get all crazy
and anticipation acting about crazy
hush-hush about their device that's all
rumored and whatever well in the
meantime
current generation product is like
flying off the shelves yeah and people
can't get there that's why not delete it
because we were so disappointed it
wasn't gonna come at Mobile World
Congress and now mobile or Congress is
going on right now and like nothing that
exciting hate to say this has been
released and this would have been the
star of the show but maybe the reason
they didn't release it is cuz they like
Apple don't want to release it at
someone else's event exactly there buddy
else that's exactly right and so their
current generation phone is doing so
well why like burn yeah you know bridge
whenever you send out an awesome tweet
and it starts to get retweeted and then
you tweet again don't tweet while your
initial tweet is doing so well just let
it ride so listen Samsung way to go
that's how you do it you just sit around
and let the rumor mill just like keep on
swirling around you and then in May or
June or whenever you want it to just let
it go let this thing launch it can have
anything by then it can have ceramic
everything it could be 1080p whatever it
could have poor battery life nobody
cares
it could do it you know it could be the
worst phone but nobody will care they'll
be so happy that you've finally finally
released it and the world is going to
eat it up because it's a successor to an
already amazing product and I think
that's what they're that's what they're
banking on we're gonna I think we should
vote on it right now I think well it's
fresh and already so we'll the Samsung
Galaxy s3 come out in May with all of
these specs remember the ceramic
whatever the 1080p well we have to vote
on the ceramic will come out in May yeah
I say no I'm gonna make it a game I say
no that this won't happen oh it won't
come out in May would be really weird
for to be ceramic I already think that I
may be wrong yeah so so we'll see so
we'll see what happens I mean even if it
comes out in May but doesn't have all
these specs I'm I lost you give me a
half point or yeah or one of us lost you
got a half we're gonna start going to
have is because this board is like out
of control no rumors remember how we
thought that we would never have any
because nothing would ever come true to
be so long tail and now we have eight
points yeah and we don't even know where
half of those points came from no
somewhere we have some people on it
don't you don't worry we have the name
of Venus the CNET fisherman yeah okay
well so shall we take a short break and
when we come back we'll talk about two
interesting patent rumors from Google
that are either copying everyone or on
the cutting edge of innovation you
decide students can register for the
lottery starting tomorrow and
registration is open until Friday
the UAA will notify the winners of the
lottery by Monday December 15th and
vouchers can then be picked up from
Tuesday through Thursday now students
with more than 90 credit hours have the
best chance of getting tickets but
everyone is welcome to sign up live from
the newsroom Cara Minelli
w UFT news thanks Cara
you
and we're ban we're back that little
video is so fun
it's so embarrassing you know that that
I mean that can happen to me any moment
people sometimes people walk by the
podcast room and they don't realize that
we can't see them and they're like right
and really animated gif of Homer Simpson
going into the bush that a minute but
okay so now back from our break our
first rumor about Google patents today
comes from the source patently Apple
which is generally only concerned with
Apple patents but I think watches that
compels competitors to see what they're
doing and if they're stealing and if
Apple should be stealing it back so
patently Apple reports that Google has
filed a patent for a Siri like voice
control for its Google TV uh that and
and uh sorry one other part of it is not
just that it would be for Google TV
itself but it actually pulls in
integration with Android devices like
phones and tablets so that you can
interact with your Android device with
your voice and have it program your
Google TV that's what this supposed
patent is about now I want to mention
one caveat up off the top of this that I
find very strange and that is that
patently Apple in their report they give
images that look very legitimate they
give details that look very legitimate
and the figures all look right but they
do not link to the actual patent filed
by Google which it is supposedly and it
should be a public patent and in the
next rumor that Kareem is gonna talk
about you'll see that in that one we get
to look at the patent now this morning I
tried searching the US Patent website
for this patent itself but it was
incredibly difficult and wanted me to do
boolean logic to get to it and I had to
come to work I was doing it on my phone
on the bus so it didn't quite work but I
urge any of you guys who really want to
be sleuths to go and see if we can find
this actual patent because it's a little
bit odd that they didn't link to it and
then all of these other sources have
been reporting on patently Apple's
report without the sort
right and that does not look like patent
I mean usually it's like big one stick
figure doing this thing well and we can
compare it to the patent that you're
about to talk about that has real art in
it rent see and actually links to the
patent actually links to the patent so
I'm a little bit skeptical of this that
doesn't mean it's not true
lots of other publications are not
taking it with a grain of salt they're
taking it like yes this is a patent
that's been filed and I think it does a
little bit odd that they didn't then go
out and find a patent anyway is what it
what it suggests is that merely six days
after Apple announced iCloud so this was
last September at Google so what was the
exact date September 29th 2011 is when
they say that this patent was filed
Google filed to have a voice-controlled
user interface that is on its Google TV
which is sometimes built-in it's not
something like I would have a logitech
TVs but it's generally a set-top box and
that would allow you to control that
using your voice not using motion
control which is one of the suggestions
that Siri the the one that would be on
the Apple TV that people are that is
rumored to exist and it will be rumored
to have serial control would be not just
voice but also gesture so that you could
say turn on or like you could say when a
Seinfeld on and then go like this or
something to go down to the next one
this doesn't include that at all it's
just voice but it's pretty cool and it's
pretty cool that you can do it with your
device because if you think about the
fact that your TV might be in a
different part of your house we've got
your your smartphone in your pocket you
might want to say to your phone oh hey
can you turn on the Academy Awards right
and start recording exactly or you can
do it as you walk into the house you can
say you know start recording this or
turn this on or turn the TV on or turn
it off yeah like if your TV is across
the room and you're cooking you can say
to your phone hey can you change the
channel on my shows coming on and can
you turn up the volume and can you
record it right and I mean that's
actually really rad I have no idea if
it'll work people don't have Google TV
my friend Liz actually has Google TV and
she's written me and said you need to
stop bad-mouthing Google TV because I
have it
I love it and good for you Liz you're
keeping them the business I'm really
happy about it you know somebody was
selling one at the office the other day
and Emily and I looked at each other
we're like nope for free but this would
be pretty cool now this to me seems like
even though as I said I'm a little bit
confused about why we don't get to see
the actual patent it does seem like this
is the direction that all TV
manufacturers are going in and people
who have TV os's and um ways you can
interact with the TV and as we saw in
Vegas at CES LG and Samsung have already
announced TVs that have this built in to
their systems and the Apple TV that
everyone's super excited about I mean
the main reason they're excited about it
is because of this reason because it's
the remote control that Steve Jobs
wanted to murder right this does away
with that what I kind of like about this
better than the Siri dare I say it what
I like about this you know patent filing
or whatever better than what Siri is
doing a series like making you in the
rumored I really yeah
yell at your TV and so you're like turn
on turn on Seinfeld or whatever and then
and in this you're yelling into your
device yeah but what if it if this were
to surpass the Siri implementation in
the ITV what I like about what I would
like about it is like right now like
with the Kinect or whatever when you
talk or with the Xbox you have to say
like being searched
you have to like use very static
commands and with Siri or was something
like this that would be interesting if
you just said turn on whatever and
that's what this Pat this patent
suggests the it one of the images shows
them saying what time is Seinfeld on and
then it lists Seinfeld is on Fox at 7:00
dadada do you want to watch and so it
understands regular English like every
good robot should right uh-huh I mean
please don't make me use stock questions
because I don't remember how to do
merely remember like the stock things I
do mean I I have a voice-controlled GPS
that's built into my car and there are
certain things I have to say to it and
what's wonderful about it is that like
it's like my secret language with my car
I'm all go home and then it can take me
home but I can't say please take me home
and then it's like do you want to
display
but yeah I mean I actually think that
it's probably likely that when the ITV
does come out if it does later in the
year which I'm sure we're gonna talk
about forever that it will include some
sort of iOS fully baked implementation
where you could talk to your iPhone and
and and your iPad and do it that way
I mean and and that'll that stands to
see if the iPad 3 will have Siri which
we're not sure but the iPad 4s currently
has Syria so you could use that perhaps
but yeah the thing that's interesting
about this is that the filing was so
early that it was September 29th of last
year before we were even talking about
Apple TV really I mean Jean monster was
talking about it but we weren't and so
the suggestion is since they've been
working on it and they already have
Google TV that exists they're not having
to build an actual television from
scratch at Google headquarters that
perhaps they beat Apple to the punch
with this voice controlled stuff that
actually to me doesn't seem that
exciting because LG and Samsung already
did that so who cares but that is the
rumor love it I love it I love yelling
into my phone so now let me say we'll
let us bet on it are we going will
Google TV get voice control to make you
shout into your phone to your phone yeah
will Google TV get mobile voice control
for its TV yes what do you think um yeah
I think yes I think it's inevitable if
it doesn't happen we'll both be like
that we were wrong have you girls ever
used Google the voice search on Google
like where you just speak into Google
and I'll search something for no but
it's pretty x yeah it's really works
really good I think it works a lot
better than Siri actually so yeah oh
that is cool well then they're already
on their way to making it awesome kaboom
blam hmm alright so now that we're on a
Google a Google kick let us continue
with Google Google has replaced Apple
today in the in
no that happens spill the beans yeah we
have nothing to talk about yeah we can
talk about Google all day long so here's
another Google patent and the thing with
patents is that it seems like companies
just like Willy's Patent file patents
for everything that they think is gonna
be big or not big or whatever just to
cover themselves so who knows you can
never tell with patent filings but here
is a Google patent that hints at a
mobile and desktop convergence which
makes me say duh why wouldn't they do
that of course so patently Apple found a
patent filing titled mapping trackpad
operations to touchscreen events and it
describes a system for turning something
like a trackpad on a computer or a
notebook computer into an analog for the
touchscreen used in conjunction with
touch based applications essentially
putting Android on to a desktop computer
the patent application reads something
boring it's like blah blah touchscreen
device allow a user to provide direct
interaction with a computing device so
basically it means that if you it's
basically like the Magic Trackpad like
that Apple is already been using has
been using you know if you use like four
fingers you to the side it goes to your
next open window or whatever whatever so
it were this patent refers to
capabilities that will allow the
trackpad operations to be mapped to the
touchscreen allowing even computers that
don't have touch capabilities to run
Android and apps designed for it so
Android OS for a computer and maybe
that's what the rumored jellybean OS is
all about it shows that this patent what
it shows is that Google is really
seriously eyeing the desktop realm and
the market and they're trying to make
their own version of the Magic Trackpad
that Apple already is using and
basically again just goes back to the
fact that everything is becoming more
increasingly influenced by mobile
because people are computing on their
smartphones and on their tablets and not
just on the computer and all of that is
sort of merging into one thing and so
Google has to do that and as we're gonna
see tomorrow we're there's a big
announcement coming tomorrow morning
you guys should stay tuned for don't
don't stay in front of your computers
the entire time but tune back in
tomorrow morning for this big Microsoft
announcement where we're gonna get to
see most likely Windows 8 they've
announced that that's happening oh but
then we should have won a point for that
because that was we said that that was
coming out in February oh well we're
gonna we're gonna wait what happens well
yeah I mean what will see the they're
gonna talk about it at least and we feel
as CNET feels that Windows 8 is gonna be
much more focused on mobile it's for
tablets it's it's also for computers but
it brings everything sort of together
and I think I was at a panel discussion
the other day listening to some app
young app developers talking about how
everyone sort of who's making new
products and new software believes that
mobile and the distinction between
desktop and mobile is gonna be gone
really soon so I think that this might
this this patent just really drives with
Google trying to say trying to make a
way for its mobile products to work on
its desktop right well patently Apple
speculated in their report of this that
Intel could expand its support for
Android beyond smartphones to power
ultra Brooks with its new chip called
the Haswell chip and it's designed to
create a harmony between notebooks and
tablets and by 2013 so the Haswell chip
it promises to support multiple
operating system functionality which is
also what jellybean was about where
channel in which you can sorry
somebody put a coin in my jukebox
requesting that I speak in milady
jellybean the cool thing about jellybean
was that you could boot up to your
Android OS or from your Windows OS
without you've gone and over it without
a reboot without rebooting sorry so
anyway this is could also be coupled
with another story that I found which
was cool which was another Google patent
which you could just let's say draw I
don't know how this would work exactly
but like let's say you're already on
Google on your phone if you draw the
letter S on it it would just start
searching so you basically never to
leave your fingers from the touchscreen
that is blowing my mind
so sorry no but actually that really is
blowing my mind that's pretty awesome
okay is the Android OS coming to
computers yes this reminds me of like
the Palm Pilot when you had to like draw
a certain weird little shapes and stuff
to get different letters yeah yeah
totally so I mean it's an interesting
house was talking about that the other
day sorry about how he had to learn a
secret language and like then he
remembered it hits like relearn how to
write because it couldn't learn his
writings called like graffiti or yeah
and it's like and and it's so weird and
it was hard it was interesting so I mean
obviously that was the Palm Pilot that
needed that functionality was like from
10 years ago so clearly they probably
will not do it that way but like it'd be
interesting to just draw a G and Google
comes up or whatever that would be cool
and then you continue so you're just
constantly doing this on your phone
person having to see well and then
what's funny is that we're like oh I
don't know I don't like talking to my
phone like hello Siri but instead I
would just want to do this all day yeah
and no matter what you look like it's
really like doing this and whispering
and so really you look like a lunatic so
alright shall we get to our layout of
the main section yes please
yay or nay
harpsichord music alright I will read
them okay and alright I'll be the Oh the
secretary yes fantabulous will Apple
pull Siri rival the evil Evie from the
App Store yes of course they will yay I
also say hey Oh
oops you're the writer yeah sorry Oh
Microsoft and Apple teaming up to
destroy Android absolutely no I didn't
read that story I chose just to do it
based upon entirely the headline and it
that makes no sense
I love it Apple and Microsoft they're
mortal enemies I'm saying yay okay good
rumors are circulating that Samsung is
planning a smartphone with an edge to
edge screen dubbed the Samsung Galaxy B
may I say yay yay and here's the most
boring one of all and I sort of asked an
Apple employee this yesterday and he
laughed at me but I can't tell you if
that is a good thing or a bad thing
Oh iOS dock ports going to get smaller
hey I say and here the most important
question of all is that smaller iPad
going to happen or what are yay or nay
ordinace brought to you by mister ed
okay so I think that was that's
basically our show yes so now we we
listen to our voice mails and I really
like this new format I think we're
really tightening it up and it was a lot
tighter
I like voting it'll help that Apple
totally obliterated aren't my first
rumours off the top we just have a much
shorter show way ahead of the game let's
listen to some voicemails from Cale from
Greenville calls in just this kid he's
so nice and funny hey guys this is Cale
from Greenville South Carolina and
I just wanted to say how much I
absolutely loved the show I look forward
to every Tuesday just so I can listen to
you guys make jokes about all the rumors
and stuff and Emily you are very good
with kale that's the best is that if
this is the same kid he has his own
little rumor show I have tube I think
it's kale the geek it's not the same guy
check it out on YouTube take one break
from yelling at him to go into the
kitchen yeah I turn on this video and
then I saw that it was women so so what
are you doing out of the kitchen and
yeah on YouTube and then they're all
first what else do we have any more
voicemails okay look at the home were
hiding in a bush it's Samsung needs to
do Apple won't make me laugh for 10
minutes straight I know you were having
a bad day in this fix everything it was
like I feel like leaving work today it's
really wonderful thank you so happy I
want to go do it later I'm going to
escape and everybody is like where did
she go and you're they're probably
raccoons in there be careful Homer
it's blue you would have they would have
just blended into the wall oh my god
okay the show today ladies and next week
will be the day before the iPad 3 event
so we will have a lot of final
speculation about what the features will
be which will I mean it's gonna be the
last chance to bet and vote and then
after that I will most likely have lost
and so then we'll do a great humiliation
day the next that will film the next day
and show the next week so don't miss
either of those shows guys and I hope
you have a wonderful day and thank you
so much Jane thank you thank you YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
