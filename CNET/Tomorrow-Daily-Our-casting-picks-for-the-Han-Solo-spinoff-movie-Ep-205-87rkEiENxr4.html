trash that kind of looks like pac-man a
3d printed bridge that's going to be the
first of its kind in the whole world
plus a han Solo spin-off that we're
going to tell you all about punch it
Chewie
greetings citizen to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva joining me for the first
time on the show a friend of mine a dear
friend of mine a colleague an excellent
of the same college Cameron Lewis
joining us and also world's worst wiki
impersonator I'm very throaty I don't
you know little Flemmi it's a ya know
it's you got time though we force
awakens doesn't come out for at least
another few months so you're good you're
good and we're gonna be then we're gonna
talk about a console or two but ok so
really quickly before we before we move
on to the headlines let's tell everybody
at home who you are and who are you and
what is your daddy do wow you know my
dad he's actually an engineer so I'm at
a little nervous about the bridge thing
we're going to talk about oh ok all
right well then you'll have to show him
the show and like ask him about this 3d
printed steel bridge I absolutely will
because I don't I think he's gonna have
some doubts about it yeah I am a radio
host and a entertainment host I do some
shows afterbuzz TV in d100 radio and my
own podcast called the Cameron Lewis
show that you guys can check out in
itunes and anything like that and a good
friend of yours yeah a good friend I i
I've been on this guy's podcast we're
gonna go listen to it it's a good one
super good and really really fun um ok
guys we have got a lot of talk about
solatube headlines
all right we're gonna get to Han Solo in
a second but let's just really quickly
talk about space trash we've discussed
this on the show before there is a lot
of trash up in our orbit apparently NASA
estimates over 500,000 bits of trash
bigger than the size of a marble so not
some pieces are not so big but still
dangerous we've all seen gravity you
guys we know what happens in space trash
gets out of control not good no never
good so a lot of different groups and
people are trying to figure out how to
clean that stuff up and still keep it
safe and so this is this was a pretty
interesting proposal here this is from
the EPFL they want to create a project
they started this project back in twenty
twelve it's called clean space one it's
a satellite that they plan on and you
can see this is how it's going to work
it's going to to reach out this little
net and it's going to grab space trash
and then it's going to flick it into
Earth's atmosphere and burn it up on
re-entry that's the solution is just
throwing it back at us throw it back at
us well i mean i wish that maybe that
happened to lures like if in the trash
they threw it out and just throw we're
right back in their car or something i
think of a hilarious i think it's a
fantastic plan um but yeah so okay so
that little cube there is actually uh
it's called swiss cube and it's up in
space and they launched it up there a
while ago and what they want to do is
this a little 10 centimeter cube they
want to go get it like they're gonna the
plan is to go get it in a couple years
so they're gonna go and extend this sort
of net cuz before they wanted to use
like a claw from Agra claw machine and
then they wanted to use like other ways
but then they've kind of discovered that
almost like eating it like pac-man is
kind of the way to go so they would let
go and they would this net would eat
this stuff and then they would take it
you can see it's flying back down you'd
burn up on re-entry is this a good cross
promotion for that new movie pixels it's
gotta be right that's what's going on
here you're not fooling us you're not
fooling us movie studios but it's I mean
it's interesting enough it's there's a
lot of precision involved they're gonna
make this work they want to they've
announced official plans as of yesterday
to do this mission in 2018 they're gonna
launch this mission in 2018 so it's
going to take a few years taking three
years to announce the official mission
which will happen in another
so they have to build the net they feel
the whole thing they'll be the whole
satellite so and then they and then once
they get that done they got to send it
up it has to reach orbit catch up to the
Swiss cube and then it has to get the
Swiss cube and then fling it back into
these tell me that the graphics on the
screen of the computer that controls
this looks exactly like the pacman game
I mean if it doesn't that seems like a
real missed opportunity yeah they have
to do this a real missed opportunity um
so yeah that's what's going on with
cleaning up space trash ah but now I
think we can discuss what's really
important that's gonna be happening in
space and a galaxy far far away which is
Cameron story a new Han Solo spin-off
also coming out in 2018 okay wondering
if they're coinciding I'm just gonna say
again a studio this is studio this is
studio poi yeah I pretend so so
yesterday actually Disney and Lucasfilm
announced that in 2018 a new han Solo
origin story spin-off is gonna come
around exciting for Star Wars uh
directors chris miller and phil lord
from the lego movie oh the lego movie
who doesn't love the lego movie so funny
and 21 double straight me about this 21
Jump Street cloudy with a chance of
meatball meatballs was the first big one
I think but so they know how to do funny
yeah they know how to do funny which is
perfect i think because this is han Solo
that's why Harvey God yeah yeah you know
driving rogue yeah oh he's a charming
rogue we should have him in here the
scoundrel I'm really excited to school
though this is awesome I'm so happy with
the choice of the directors I believe
this is the first Star Wars movie or at
least the first announced Star Wars
movie where there's a duo directing yeah
so I'm happy about that the writers of
this film John and Lawrence cast in
lawrence kasdan wrote for Empire Strikes
Back can't get a better Star Wars writer
than Lawrence Kasdan Raiders the lost
art this guy knows what he's doing I his
son John who's joining him to do the
script wrote for Dawson's Creek and
freaks and geeks uh I love freaks and
geeks so funny yeah I so he's a funny
guy who's freaking case was hilarious
he'll be able to bring a little of that
edge in which i think is a good thing
yeah i think so i think with something
like that i think you kind of have to
have absolutely
and they did mention when they announced
this movie that this was actually
supposedly this is not the movie that
josh trank left right so josh glad you
the boba fett right is reportedly a boba
fett movie and he left and they're still
I think working on that project but they
kind of said no this isn't the same
movie this is a new announced project
which I'm a little surprised they didn't
save this for comic-con it's like yeah
in advance something must have happened
something must have leaked they want to
give you a story yeah they must have
been like if somebody knows like we
gotta get it out there before other
people leak it yes here's a fun fact for
you though Chris Miller actually
interned at Lucasfilm did he many moons
ago and so he's kind of coming full
circle that's crazy in turn their weird
magical that's pretty awesome it's so
magical alright so we got to talk about
the obvious questions so that brings us
to our hashtag of the day which is TD uh
we really TD solo me really thats thats
you got to have TD solo yeah uh number
one who's gonna play han Solo like cuz
he's gonna be young it's a big can't
have Chris Pratt you guys can't use
Chris Pratt because he's too oh yeah ye
Chris Pratt everything well that and
he's he's too old to play a he's the
same age Harrison Ford was when he
played Han Solo in the original Star
Wars so we can't it's there's no prequel
there no big what's a lot younger he
does um I think people just looked older
back then it's like they just
automatically like carrie fisher's like
what 19 or something and she literally
looked like she was like 30 yeah so I
like I don't know how that is but then
she like didn't really aged for a while
and then I don't know I don't know that
works movie magic movie magic I guess so
who's gonna play han Solo and then also
is there a plot that you would like to
see how what's that what's the plot so
what are you what are you thinking who's
the actors you have a mind I'm thinking
James Volk that's a good choice
currently starring in zoo on CBS uh-huh
uh it was on the crazy ones he has some
comedic flair to him and also to the
hoax he's he's actually not as old as
you would think really he's about 30 ish
somewhere here I think you gotta go like
young tight like early 20s you want like
somebody from Disney not necessarily but
maybe so okay well who's who else you
got who that's okay so James vogue is
the first 1i have this
when I have is james Van Der Beek well
obviously James rhetoric but he's way
too old looks great I don't know I think
too old too old uh yeah also you know
you can't have Dawson running around in
the Millennium Falcon but John Kasdan
wrote a couple episodes of Dawson screen
I'm thinking hey there's a little
connection there maybe they're still
talking hmm maybe they can get him on
board all right fairly james Van Der
Beek the other one I was thinking miles
teller all right whiplash miles teller a
lot of a lot of critical acclaim has
that has that kind of look about him
could be it could be a you on the
Harrison Ford he better fly the money
and Falcon at my tempo he's yeah that's
right don't be early and don't be late
no um okay again here's my choices taron
egerton from Kingsman the Secret Service
look at him that way that guy Oh a great
choice come by such a good pic is a good
pic there's a deep does a deep cut cuz
he's kind of unknown and I feel like it
would be a great opportunity for him
obviously every actor under the age of
like 40 is gonna be begging to play this
role yeah huge this huge star making
roll uh I also really like Grant Gustin
who plays the flash whoa he's right in
that age bracket for me that's the age
that I thought I could see Grant Gustin
I could see that there's another another
bit of a connection there Chris Miller
and Phil Lord were in talks to
potentially direct question right maybe
they're thinking about taking him and
they kind of know and then lastly I
really like this Vic to Garrett Hedlund
do a garrett hedlund look at that that's
a that's a han Solo my friend good
that's a young han Solo he would have
what did hair is there to it is he's got
that kind of there and he's really got
that kind of roguish charm like it
interviews and stuff you gotta see that
roguish charm so i would say Garrett
Hedlund that's that's my number one pick
but those other two guys are great too
really great as well but Garrett Hedlund
just gonna play young Chui ah you know I
don't know um Justin Bieber that's a
good that's solid high pitch is high
pitch smoky sounds yeah that's really
sad so TD solo that's your tell us who
you want to play in nope
Pratt you guys know Chris Pratt can't do
it you can't do it he's out yet this is
the yet too obvious too obvious you're
not a lot of pic that's too obvious TD
solo do that all right let's talk about
the 3d printed bridge that your dad
might be interested in this is pretty
fascinating i love this this is going to
be the world's first 3d printed steel
bridge it's gonna be a footbridge it's
going to be an Amsterdam and here's how
it's going to work so we have this video
which is pretty cool the company is MX
3d they have created a sixaxis robot
that has a welding machine attached to
it and so what it does is it prints
metals in all kinds of metals all kinds
of materials so it won't be a plastic
bridge like weezy no 3d printing yeah
people assume plastic no this is steel
this is a steel bridge and this robot is
going to make it so this is a smaller
version of the bridge they want to end
up making and how it works is it can
detect errors and correct them in real
time it does not require scaffolding
this robot all it does is it builds out
an arm and then it walks on that ards on
and keeps going anything and it has a
ton of rotating ability it can rotate in
any direction so it so it can literally
print this entire 3d structure by itself
because it can just go in kind of in a
spiral all the way around and just keep
building so yeah there it is printing
out steel good that which is
crazy-looking this video is amazing
crazy straw it's he had does it's a
crazy straw made of steel that you can't
get anything out of so but that's the
kind of material they want so you can
see they have this kind of really
beautiful kind of helix design and they
want to they want to make this as a
footbridge and it will support regular
uh regular folks walking across it all
the time that's amazing that's a they
said it based on the robot right now it
would take about that's a smaller
version of the bridge right there right
take about two months to to build a
full-size bridge but they won't be ready
to build that bridge until 2017 so
that's how it work they use two arms and
then they build everything out and then
the robots or just keep building it all
by itself I'm happy they're starting
with a footbridge yeah I'm not going for
the car because that would make me a
little bit nervous about using it maybe
not a time to swing for the fences I
think you're right i think you're
definitely right this is not
time to be like let's do it so that big
rigs can go across now let's just let's
hope we're in gate sighs yeah maybe just
hold off on that it was this could be a
first step toward something like a
golden gate bridge all fully 3d printed
which is pretty amazing it's crazy when
you see the video of the thing just
sliding along what it created you know
just hours ago it's amazing it kinda
reminds me of the little balsa wood
things that you create like in grade
school a little little bridges and set
probably much more sturdier than that
probably more certain gonna be okay but
yeah so they they're working on this
they haven't said exactly where in
Amsterdam they're gonna put this bridge
I've even announced it yet but in
September in Amsterdam there's gonna be
a visitor's center where you're able
where you will be able to go and learn
about the progress of the bridge so once
i think it's September we'll know
exactly where it'll be and what the
progress is on it you can like check in
on the progress of the bridge which I
think it's kind of kind of great so
that's a good flight that's a yeah we're
gonna have to tomorrow daily live from
Amsterdam I am in so that is it for our
news headlines we're gonna take a quick
break when we write back with a totally
insane Mod Squad that makes me very very
happy and also your user feedback and
our phone talker for the day so don't
click weights tomorrow daily
Jeff you're just now joining us i'm here
with cameron lewis magnate of radio and
television entertainment terrible
Chewbacca impersonator I'm doing that
gotta really stopped you in Houston yes
maybe it's just not a great idea to quit
half of the audience just stopped
watching they're done but the other hat
in my car you're weird collar yeah I
mean really you're just you're blowing
it right now a first-timer never coming
back ever coming back okay guys we got
to talk about this crazy Mod Squad so
Logan hit the graphic
a friend of mine sent me this very
interesting craigslist post that popped
up in Oregon Eugene Oregon this guy says
he's like what did he call himself oh
here's a quote from them I'm gonna read
you this quote okay presenting your
chance to be the proud owner of the only
dinosaur skeleton that has been
reanimated through the mysteries of
science and technology it's a tricycle
it's a tricycle we have some images of
this it's it's a bike and it's a shape
of a small t-rex and here's the best
part you can totally it's a puppet as
well so you can ride your little t-rex
trike and the handlebars control some
wires that go to the mouth so you can
like open the mouth up do the jaw and
then the pedals also have control is
that control the arms so you can wave
and then I do a little Flay a little
wave whatever little tiny arms well
miniature t-rex strike right there look
at that it's hard for me to think about
using this and not just picture me
rolling up falling over in falling over
the seats leaving back really far it
does not I don't know but I would be so
tempted to just terrorize my neighbors
with this thing I would really like to
put some music in there and like
literally just play ridin dirty like it
just cruise down my hood like that seems
like the way to do it right do not um I
just want Chris Pratt to ride this thing
like just down the road like it seems
like a perfect photo opportunity for
Chris Pratt uh this guy spent months
putting together this entire thing it's
fabricated on a bicycle and he took it
all apart put it all back together he's
look there's like foam pieces and all
this stuff there's some cons though if
you're thinking about buying it so we're
gonna I'm really sorry there's a couple
of things that you need to be aware of
buyer beware caveat emptor you have to
be aware that you're gonna be constantly
repainting and refinishing this thing
because apparently it is a moving
bicycle and things move and they rub
against each other which means the paint
rubs off so it's also feeding it gotta
feed the thing I oh you got a kit you
gotta eat at least six children a day
it's just really it's tough it's really
telling you or one adult human I mean
six kids wanted all human either way um
but yeah so it's two thousand dollars
per cost you a grand Wow do you want
would you would you if money were no
object would you buy it I mean I
kind of feel like that's a small price
to pay to be the king of the Dino trikes
you would be the talk of your town you
can start tricycle dang good you try
getting a t-rex a dinosaur at right gang
that's such a good idea I think that
seems like a really great cartoon so
Disney call me what will make this great
is if we have little Triceratops
velociraptor you guys come along with
this yeah ones for the kids for kids of
course for the kids I think it's totally
worth two thousand dollars I if money
was no object if I was Oprah rich I'm by
one by one for everybody you get a trike
raptor you get a tricycle machine you
gotta try crafter you get a trike
Triceratops Triceratops Triceratops and
you have you also yeah you get one too
patent pending patent pending yeah of
course it's ours I love this so much
it's just really funny uh he'll include
he'll throw in a can of white paint for
touch-ups if you buy it for two thousand
on what a deal but he decided he's not
the right writer for this poor tricycle
and it needs the right magical master to
tame it I like that yes that's why he's
sound like it like it just does nothing
right right anymore like I you know
maybe you should be the one that takes
this thing in who is the chosen one
who's the harry potter of dinosaur
tricycles i don't know i don't know who
that person is alright guys we've talked
enough about that guy let's talk about
you and it's time for it your user
feedback alright so we're still waiting
on some san diego comic-con tweets to
Roland I figure we'll keep that hashtag
going I we had somebody mentioned that
they were surprised we didn't hear about
a pizza throwing machine at comic-con
because last year they have the the
pizza shooter that you go shoot pizzas
40 and renew turtles um so I figured
we'd go for some more web bots which we
just story on Monday about two robots
who got married and and we asked what
what do you get a robot couple whose
freshly married because getting them a
toaster seems rude like it seems but it
seems really know I was to get a room by
myself it's like feeding a chicken eggs
yeah it's kind of weird a little bit odd
yeah it's a little strange so uh lewis
wrote in and he said get them lots of
beer hashtag futurama hashtag bender
OS love that that's a good one the good
one Dustin wrote in and said I would get
them a free month of internet access so
they can merge all their online accounts
together haha hashtag aww Dustin's think
in a marriage clouds yeah yeah that's
what he wants it's a community property
state when you marry a robot and then
link wrote in and said I would give them
oil so when they get old and rusty they
can loosen oh wait you you're assuming
they're gonna be together forever link
is a romantic is it all romantic nice
job link and then Kirk road this one
makes me laugh Creek Road and said haha
get them a cradle and hope for a new
robot soon would they just build a new
robot and then put it in the cradle I
think that's probably how it work I'm
thinking I'm gonna get them that that
dinosaur bike man seems if I could see a
robot writing a t-rex bike I mean that
really seems like the pinnacle of
civilization what else would you want
out of the universe that's like peak
robot excellence yeah absolutely why
would you ever want anything out that's
a great that's a great poll that's what
about a small price to pay for that yeah
that's true mom Bryce the guy we're
stuffing find the right-sized robot cuz
if it's too big then it'll fall all come
down what if it fine was the size of a
Dyson that sounds good yeah at all
knurled a little tiny roll what can we
use Genghis oh yeah it's right on top
it's fine he came right on top of the
t-rex's head oh you guys we have one
last piece to user feedback it's always
