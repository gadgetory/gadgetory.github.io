of oddities come as I show you the car
the time and the world forgot there it
is the Hyundai Azera I had big hopes for
this car but it turns out I was the
president of a fan club of about this
many people now they're relaunching it
ever seen one in the wild that wasn't a
rental probably not neither abide but
this is a much better looking car now
and they're going to give it a big push
it actually is the last car in Hyundai's
plan to completely blow out their whole
line and redesign it across 24 months
which they've now completed it has their
flicks culture look to it little gaudy
to my eye as is the new Sonata which I
also love as a car but I'd love to see
what kids designer Pete schreier would
do with this guy anyway 3.3 liter
gasoline direct injection v6 in there
293 horsepower and it moves this biggish
car at a combined 23 mpg one choice only
on the gearbox six-speed automatic what
I like about it is they've content
editio drivi camera standard touchscreen
head unit with nav and standard Hyundai
blue link which is their new connected
telematics system so they're slotting
this guy in the mid-20s I'm sure it
comes out in 2012 time and price to be
determined the question is how well will
it compete against its cousin the very
popular sonata or its other cousin
upscale the to Genesis twins they got a
bit of a juggling act here now they're
not set yet on when in 2012 the new
azera comes out but we'll assume early
in the year or they call it a 2013 and
pricing going to be somewhere in the mid
20s I'm sure that's where the outgoing
model slotted about 5 grand above sonata
and this one definitely looks about 5
grand nicer in person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
