your wrist
I'm Scott Stein and this is the Samsung
gear s a massive curved screen
SmartWatch this is the sixth Samsung
Smart Watch the difference here is that
it is a phone it has its own 3G service
and SIM card and you can make calls on
it via speakerphone or pair it with a
Bluetooth headset and it runs on
Samsung's gear ecosystem this is Tizen
OS its own set of apps if you have
previous gear watches you know the drill
they work with Samsung phones not with
the rest of the Android landscape and
that's different from Android wear which
is Google's own SmartWatch platform that
Samsung did make one SmartWatch for the
gear live now this also has a lot of
fitness tracking elements a heartrate
monitor and the ability to use GPS if
you're connected to 3G to track your
walk or your run and it also has a
variety of apps you are limited to what
you can do on its own if you're not
paired to a phone by the apps that you
can run on it some things like Nike Plus
didn't really work unless we had a phone
nearby and notifications which are a big
part of the SmartWatch experience those
only work if you're compared to your
phone at the time this also has Wi-Fi so
you don't have to have 3G if you're
sitting at home and you want to be able
to tap into that the screen is large
enough to read full articles on and one
of the coolest apps of Samsung's
newsreader that allows you to look at
news briefings and swipe and read the
whole article kind of cool but you know
you probably have your phone around
right you'd pull that out and read and
that's the question here why would you
have a giant curved smartphone on your
wrist that does the same things that you
can do in your pocket with your phone a
question that may not be answered now
the Samsung gear s is maybe one of the
best design gear smartwatches but at the
sixth iteration how many more of those
will come and which one do you want to
buy I don't think it's worth getting it
for the phone features right now I'm
Scott Stein with a look at the Samsung
gear s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
