power and your velocity while you're
lifting hi I'm Bridget Carey with CNET
and we're here to check out a brand new
type of fitness tracker you've seen a
lot of fitness trackers that measure how
much you're running how active you are
throughout the day but here's one just
for people who are professional athletes
really trying to hone in on their
strength training a lot of times you
want to know what your 1 rep max is the
core of everything really comes down to
the apps software based on what your
needs are it'll give you recommendations
on how many reps you should do and how
much weight you should be lifting on the
app you choose your exercise and set how
much weight you will lift the armband
tracks your precise movement and speed
to calculate your power based on your
speed it may suggest you try more weight
or if you're slow and unsteady you could
be close to your max this is actually a
crowdfunded product they were on
IndieGoGo to meet their goal those who
are the first people to donate are
getting their units now for those that
pre-order they can get it for about 150
dollars and it'll start arriving in
August and when it hits the market will
go up to about 190 dollars a lot of
professional athletes are actually using
it now many sports teams are starting to
use it with their players like on hockey
the Dallas Stars the Philadelphia Flyers
and even the Washington Redskins those
are just some of the teams that are
starting to incorporate this into their
training routine this isn't gonna be for
the couch potato that wants to just get
motivated this is people who are serious
