the Apple byte it's all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple so let's get
to the stories the iPhone 3GS is here
and has sold over 1 million units its
first weekend on sale now that beats out
the iPhone 3G launched even more
impressive was the fact that it was
available in 8 countries on launch
compared to 21 countries for the 3G now
pre-sales surely helped out that number
but it's still impressive now Steve Jobs
made his first public remarks since he's
been away from Apple saying customers
are voting and the iPhone is winning now
this after the Palm Pre made its debut
selling somewhere between 50,000 and
100,000 units in its first two days
speaking with Steve it's been confirmed
that he did in fact get a liver
transplant at the Methodist University
Hospital in Tennessee now they won't say
when the surgery happened but SJ has
been seen at Apple headquarters this
past week and doctors gave them an
excellent prognosis this is great news
and we're happy about it so you know how
we do it here at the Apple bite we did
some investigative work of our own and
got the scoop on the I liver
Steve's gallbladder now produces twice
as much bile it cleanses body toxins
with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor and
it's preloaded with the App Store that
thing is one-of-a-kind now in the
aftermath of the 3GS launch Apple is
giving a $30 iTunes store credit for
customers who experienced activation
delays in some cases the delays were
more than two days now you know I could
rip on Apple because shouldn't they have
been ready this time around but I have
to give them some props because they're
one of the few tech companies that gives
back something when they've goofed in
this case it's iTunes credits and when
they lower the original iPhone 200 bucks
only a few months after it came out they
gave a $100 store credit to people who
paid the full price they even took care
of me when my laptop ran too hot and
burned my lap they actually helped pay
for the aloe vera limit that I had to
apply to my inner thighs right here
Brian what he am I know doodoo it's
healed it's all it's all good just get
back to the show please fine I'll show
you that later okay all right Apple
biters if you're looking to tether your
iPhone and you can't wait for AT&amp;amp;T
I've got the hack for you Apple
announced that tethering your iPhone
will be available to 3.0 software users
later this summer in the US what if you
need it and you want it now I could
never get Wi-Fi there has to be a better
way
i'm brian tong with cnet.com and i'll
show you how to activate tethering for
your iphone without jailbreaking it now
for those of you that aren't familiar
with it
tethering is connecting a phone to a
laptop or similar device and using the
phone's data connection as your internet
connection first off here's the
disclaimer this feature is not yet
officially supported by AT&amp;amp;T in the
United States and it potentially breaks
your agreement with AT&amp;amp;T or your carrier
internationally so you guys have to do
this at your own risk
now tethering plans normally cost an
additional amount on top of your cell
phone plan so we don't know how long
this will work or if they will bill you
anymore but it's here for now it's
really easy and it works for most people
so first step let's launch your Safari
browser on an iPhone running the 3.0
software and go to this website it's
called the iPhone Help Center by Ben m80
you want to scroll down to tethering and
internet settings and press on the
download link select your country then
your carrier and you'll get to a final
page where you'll press the install
button and it will download specific
profile settings for your iPhone and it
only takes a few seconds once that's
done we'll go to the home screen jump to
our settings then general then network
and you'll now see an internet tethering
option to activate it turn it on and you
have the option to tether over Bluetooth
or a USB cable plug in the USB cable to
your iPhone and your computer and we're
here on a Mac and if you can see it
automatically detects it select it as
the connection you want to use and boom
like that you are tethered the process
works the same on a Windows XP or Vista
machine so just plug it in the operating
system detects in your network
connection and you'll be surfing in no
time what's up
Oh Brian what's going on why so blue
loosen up I can't get Wi-Fi you can't
get Wi-Fi and you're crying like a baby
check this out I got my iphone all set
up to tender you could do that yeah you
can okay let sticks out cnet.com boom
like that there we go right thanks buddy
yeah no problem I'm Brian Tom for
cnet.com with your hack for tethering
your iPhone user wise for good times and
bad times
oh yeah focus lock in okay I got it
got it okay next story here we go the
iPhone 3G S stands for speed but just
how fast is this thing media let's
recently released their JavaScript
benchmark test results using the
SunSpider test suite on the iPhone and
its competitors like the Palm Pre and
t-mobile g1 and the results the iPhone
3GS was three times as fast as the pre
three times as fast as the iPhone 3G
running the 3.0 software and over five
times as fast as the g1 so yeah you can
now start calling it Speed Racer now in
some quick bytes push notifications are
now seeing the light of day in apps like
AOL Instant Messenger and B jive I am
which supports multiple IM services
apple also dropped a bunch of updates of
their own with a Final Cut Pro update
time capsule and airport firmware
updates and Apple TV goes to 2.4 with no
exact changes listed yet but it now
supports gesture controls for Apple's
remote app on the iPhone and iPod Touch
and a little tidbit I found myself just
to let you know the iPhone 3GS now fully
supports the Apple headphones with
remote and its volume control from the
actual headphone I rip them to shreds on
this one so you know when they listen to
us and fix something just like putting
firewire back on the 13-inch MacBook Pro
I'm gonna turn that bad apple into
something sweeter like homemade apple
pie
alright that's gonna do it for this week
send in your emails to the Apple bite at
cnet.com i'm brian tom thanks for
watching and come back next week for
another bite
