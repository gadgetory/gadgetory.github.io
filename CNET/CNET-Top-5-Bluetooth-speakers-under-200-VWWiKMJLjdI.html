practically magical way to stream music
from your phone or tablet but the best
ones can be expensive and the cheap ones
don't sound much better than the speaker
in your phone I'm Donnell Bell and in
this top five I'm counting down five of
the best sounding speakers in that sweet
spot between 100 and 200 dollars
selected by CNET executive editor David
Carr knowing starting off at number five
the Sony SRS x3 Sony holds up its
reputation for sound quality with this
feature pack sound brick priced around
$150 along with great sound and get
speakerphone capability and NFC tap tap
air feature and seven hours of
rechargeable battery life at number four
the Bose Soundlink color Bose you say in
color it's hard to believe but they
managed to make a relatively hip looking
little speaker here that sounds great
and can be snatched up for just $129 new
charges over microUSB and it comes in
five colors coming in at number three
the TDK Trek Maxx a 34 I think they
missed an opportunity here to make this
thing look like a giant cassette tape
but the design is still pretty cool its
water resistant to making it a great
choice to keep in the kitchen or the
patio eight hours of rechargeable
battery life 150 bucks
number two the Bose Soundlink mini this
one comes in right at $199 but you get
that Bose tuck shirt grown-up design and
the extra fidelity that Bose is known
for no speaker phone feature on this one
but the charging cradle is pretty genius
and finally our pick for the best
sounding Bluetooth speaker under $200 at
number one the logitech ue boom here's a
speaker that looks as loud as it sounds
it's water-resistant it works as a
speakerphone and offers up to 15 hours
of battery life it's not cheap at $199
but it makes a statement it sounds great
and could probably survive an extreme
weekend without breaking or running out
of power so there you go five affordable
great sounding Bluetooth speakers for

speakers out there head over to cnet.com
