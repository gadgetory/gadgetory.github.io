here with an important tip for Amazon
shoppers see if this sounds familiar
you're looking for something on Amazon
and naturally gravitate to the product
that has the five star rating thinking
it must be good you click buy now hold
on there partner
some of those reviews might be fake and
could have been planted there by the
vendors employees or even paid reviewers
although amazon has taken steps to crack
down on this problem it's still a
problem there are a couple tools
designed to help you ferret out the
fakes fake spot and review meta use
sophisticated algorithms to vet reviews
and let you know how many of them are
legitimate just copy and paste any
Amazon URL to either site and you'll see
well reviews of the reviews better still
both services offer browser extensions
that scan an Amazon page with just one
click
problem solved right not necessarily
before you decide against a product
remember that when you see a low rating
fakes but is merely grading the
percentage of questionable reviews not
the product itself so a c- grade for the
reviews doesn't mean that the product
should also get a c-minus and in my
experience fake spot and review meta are
sometimes at paws with each other one
indicates slots of fake reviews the
other gives most of them a pass so these
services can be helpful but use them in
combination with your own judgment I
recommend reading the reviews for
yourself it's pretty easy to spot ones
that are totally made-up as with
anything you buy online always check the
sellers return policy and the products
warranty I purchase lots of items that
had questionable reviews but turned out
to be just as good as advertised so take
everything with a grain of salt and
always use common sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
