mind control which as it turns out
sometimes means getting control of your
own mind I know it sounds sci-fi but
it's a reality and this is just one of
the devices making it happen and neuro
sky is one of the companies behind the
futuristic technology they've developed
a type of headsets that actually reads
your brainwaves or EEG that's fine
that's fine
this appears to be my brain this is your
brain when digitized okay so the first
thing you're going to know this is that
white line which is called the raw EEG
signal and that's just a completely
unfiltered reaction of the electrical
energy that's coming off of your
forehead then using sophisticated
algorithms the software takes the data
from my brain and shows my mental state
are very attentive individual from there
I can start training my mind I can see
my brain doing things this is where yoga
practitioners could be really good
because they can just turn it on and
just lower the heart rate lower the
metabolism and be relaxed and it's all
done with this little headset and clip
on earpiece so just logistically like
how is this talking to this is it
bluetooth the way that it works is that
your body gives off electrical signals
and we make instruments that measure
that and then via bluetooth that
communicates with the device should we
like take this baby for arrived by this
baby I guess I mean my brain Somali what
you're playing here is a game called
focus focus it's a very fun game around
attention relaxation first I grew a
plant with my mind deep breaths everyone
makes me really nervous to think about
relaxing
who's that guy paradoxically I seem to
relax more when I talk one star and then
I was on to exploding a can of redbull
there's our rope I also tried tug of war
don't distract me
I just lost me now that I've spent some
time honing my skills I think I'm gonna
take on our intern Brett in a little
battle of the minds it's on oh it's
always on Ravus mm-hmm begin and my
challenge was to will this floating ball
to the other side of the game board
I just don't want you to lose on your
own show you know now imagine wearing a
headset like this one all the time this
is called the necomimi and it is more of
a social type experience it lets people
know what you're thinking whether you're
interested whether you're bored whether
you're relaxed do you think you'd ever
want to wear them at school have a good
day truly the possibilities are
mind-blowing crazy lady a research lab
called chaotic moon has used a headset
from a company called Emotiv to create
technology that allows you to control a
motorized skateboard using your minds
run away and yell stop thinking stop
thinking as you're thinking as you were
running the board was racing back along
the side chief</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
