with project Fiona was bring something
to the market that they really want it

doing crowdsourcing feedback figuring
out what they wanted you know and so we
changed it made it the doc created a
suite of accessories that really could
drive your gameplay experiences so it's
a tablet it's a PC and it's a console so
it's steam big picture you can put all
your games or we have our own launcher
program as well right on your television
screen play in the living room watch
Netflix do whatever you want and now is
this a prototype or is it shipping for
our fans about shipping in q1 so
shipping in q1 for i5i 5 it starts and
shipping a few one and it uh
sells for $9.99 for the i-5 model great
