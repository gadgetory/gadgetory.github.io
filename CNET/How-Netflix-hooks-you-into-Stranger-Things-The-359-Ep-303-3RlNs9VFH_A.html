23rd it is time for the 359 podcast I'm
BVG and it is episodes 303 here are your
hosts
Joanie's soles Minh and Roger Chang heyo
happy Monday
happy Monday morning how's everyone's
weekend it's almost Halloween yeah I
know
buddy not mine but my kids alright Sam
you know actually we spent the weekend
trying to find the costume in Elmo
nobies obsessed with them so speaking of
Halloween and spooky themes we're gonna
be talking about stranger things a story
on how Netflix gets you to click play on
let's just strange things but all shows
but because the stranger things is
premiering Friday what can we talk about
that I will also talk about t-mobile and
Sprint potentially merging in the next
few weeks what that's gonna look like
and lastly we'll talk about a story that
Ben wrote about this retailer that uses
robotics automation but didn't fire
people so happy ending story as always
if you have any questions in the comment
section Brian will pick out the best and
we will get to them in 3 minutes and 59
seconds hang out for the headlines we'll
be back to see you in 3 2 welcome to the
359 I'm ready Jane I'm Joni Saltzman
stranger things is coming back and have
its premiere on Friday
Netflix revealed some of the tricks it
gets to it gets to hook you into the
show Jon you actually talked to them
what did you find out about sort of the
little games they play when promoting
their shows well we all know that
Netflix uses algorithms to surface shows
that it specifically thinks that you the
individual are going to be attracted to
but they go deeper than that for example
with stranger things they and with all
shows they cater the image that you see
with the suggested title in those
carousels of suggestions that you see so
with stranger things if you were a fan
of documentaries you might see a picture
of cheap hopper or if you're a fan
dramas you might see a picture of eleven
pending because what they would do is
they would a be test different images
for different users and find out they
would be able to home in pretty quickly
on well this kind of user that really
likes teen dramas would click more so
with this picture than with the other
yeah Amy because I just assume it's the
standard boilerplate photo they surface
it's interesting that they put that much
thought into what image correlates like
what genre yeah and for a while they
would have image specific images
specific to a title by country they
would have like a different image for US
versus Japan right but they found that
that didn't really work because you can
have somebody who has the exact same
taste of you as you in Japan and your
next-door neighbor could be somebody
that like your their taste in movies
like makes your skin crawl so they found
that the best thing to do is to cater
the image to the taste that you have
rather than the place that you are and
strange things are surprisingly like
topped a bunch of these charts it's one
of the it's one of the most popular
shows on Netflix and so it's the number
one show and a lot of these what they
call taste communities where people have
similar kinds of tastes so you could be
a fan of teen dramas or you could be a
fan of sci-fi or you could be a fan of
horror and stranger things could be the
top thing that you that is watched in
that group for a lot of different yeah
the teen dramas to course of course
and so stranger things is a surprisingly
like I love that show it's pretty good
pretty excited next up t-mobile posted
third quarter earnings results this
morning unsurprisingly results were
strong they added new customers blah
blah blah all we actually care about is
that Sprint and t-mobile are supposed to
get together in the coming weeks as
evidenced by the fact that t-mobile
didn't hold a conference call they
basically just put out the release and
John ledger had a quick video Q&amp;amp;A like a
seven minute video because they didn't
really want to take questions on the
only thing we want to ask when are you
gonna buy sprint so we'll see that's
that that's we're hearing early next
month but that could potentially shake
up industry and for a lot of people
change up the service that they have and
your gut reaction is bad idea it's gonna
be messy I would say it's one of those
things where like theoretic
if they can actually get it all to work
together like this would be a non paid
service would be great if technology
works but companies have a lot of
trouble integrating businesses and these
are two very different or these
companies have very different assets
that will take a lot of work to put
together so lastly I want to give a
shout out to Ben's story about this
retailer boxed that managed to invest in
robots and automation but still managed
to keep all of their employees jobs I'm
a happy ending story not sort of goes
against the idea that robots are just
gonna take over so definitely check it
out from these stories check us out on
CNN I'm Roger che I'm Joanie Saltzman
thanks for listening alright so I'm
gonna go ahead and start delving through
the comments and questions but who is
everyone's favorite stranger things
character right now right now oh my god
I love them all I like Jon Ralphie Oh
son I'm just gonna put that out there I
like all the character what's the kid's
name been some I forgotten something no
look at their names I forget the actors
names they big hug they become their
characters so much that I don't even
think about they're the actors named
it's a Finn wolf heart which is the most
amazing real name yeah yeah remember
being at Comic Con where forget who was
talking about how as a moderator is the
comedian he kept joking about how the
kid had like a porn star name but this
was a kid he was talking about so fellow
weird guy probably kids probably heard
it I mean I guess it's cliche to say 11
but cool yeah that mainly Bobby Brown
really kind of stole the show oh yeah
like out of nowhere just like stole
everyone's hearts right and you know I
love that goes to so I could we've got a
common thread there what about you Brian
oh like I said I really like the kid who
looks like John Ralphie Oh from Parks
and Recreation right
a great character to love to hate yeah
well he's got a Redemption yeah yeah I
don't know I like you said it's truly an
ensemble yeah read somewhere he's funny
first read somewhere that they initially
planned it for him to either be knocked
off or be like really but like they
liked him so much that they like I know
barb the martyr I mean wasn't Mark
stranger things originally going to be
an ensemble or not an ensemble an
anthology show like like American Horror
Story where every season was supposed to
be a refreshed kind of concept like
don't you dare get rid of these kids
yeah and now I mean all their careers
are doing really well after this - I'm
again I'm terrible with the actors names
but the guy who played the sheriff he's
the new Hellboy yeah that's awesome I
see the you know the new him everywhere
those files is killing it he's killin a
so hilarious all right let's go ahead
and jump into some questions from the
chat norm field says have you seen the
stranger things countdown banner that
started on Friday
I think Netflix is expecting season 2 to
be a pretty huge event yeah yeah hope it
doesn't break they're surfers like the
other big releases well you know about
not having those kind of service issues
other
HBO and you know what's funny is HBO Go
is the one that struggles HBO now has it
completely different back end and so and
you subscribe directly to HBO online via
HBO now you're less likely to have those
problems than if you get it through your
cable subscription by watching it in
their HBO Go app um which in a way makes
sense cuz like if you're actually paying
for the app like better friggin work
right um but it better friggin work no
matter how you're paying Netflix though
has a really good track record
usually when you guys have trouble with
streaming something you know not a
blanket scenario but usually it's
because of something on like your ISP or
Internet service providers and or
fighters and I always I always question
that like whenever it starts to choke
out I'm like
I said verizon fios or is it Netflix
like I and ya really know for sure but
there's no way to really know unless you
want to waste a lot of time figuring out
why you're not getting watch but like
babe we gotta run some speed tests right
now I don't know what's going on but
Netflix has a pretty good track record
in that regard
all right the rest assured you'll be
able to get your stranger things and
well maybe hopefully who else binging it
here this weekend because Michael Hickey
says I'm going to marathon it after I
catch up with haters and I know like
it's going to be every ounce of strength
I have to not sit down and the whole
thing in one one-shot I don't I'm pretty
sure I won't pinch it I like I probably
be able to grab two or three extra hours
to watch it that's that's it I just
can't turn it off I sacrifice sleep
unwillingly like when when I was started
watching I think I watched eight
episodes all in one night yeah I think
when I went the first time around I did
I bitch like I think half the season the
next day yeah it was hard to stop
watching it's really here's an
interesting response Pele says stranger
things is just a series it's been hyped
up and blown out of proportion
six out of ten for now Wow and that is
an uncommon response to that I'm
speechless and that's coming from
somebody who doesn't care about a lot of
TV shows but stranger things really kind
of whisk me away to a place that kind of
hit all the right notes Pele I'm just
kind of curious what what did you find
kind of myth about stranger things I
know you're not calling it out calling
it crap but you're just like I don't
know so much I just want to know your
perspective I want Pele also to open up
his Netflix splash page it's home page
and see like what I want to know what
his carousels are like the first
carousels like come on yeah that's what
probably it's probably just something
that's not right for him he's not in a
taste cluster no I mean everybody's
entitled stranger things as Stillman's
cross so I have to get to creepy but I'd
like to know his age cuz there I mean it
does sort of hit a certain nostalgia
factor depending on how old's that's
very true me like it like hit that sweet
spot the 80s right on for folks who
didn't grow up with that it doesn't
resonate strongly definitely wouldn't I
totally see what you're coming from
there oh wow I just don't even know how
to respond to that
okay yeah you're absolutely yeah no I
mean there's a lot of thing I don't like
Game of Thrones yeah I'm super
indifferent to Game of Thrones and I've
lost interest in walking dead yeah yeah
all right more questions
Noren says the Netflix Marvel shows are
pretty amazing too I can't wait for
Punisher next month
I too am excited for Punisher I'm really
excited to see Jessica Jones come back
because that to date is my favorite of
the Marvel I enjoyed parts of Jessica
Jones and daredevil but like I find them
to be kind of boring oh man and Jessica
Jones kept me going the whole time I was
in the middle the season I was like so
what are what else is coming down the
pipe we got stranger things this week do
we know what are the other big temples
coming down through fro there's that
bright movie it's got a supernatural
vibe to it too that's in December I can
you know what I will answer this
question I will do a little research
right now here's an easy one for you
Josh is asking are the Marvel TV shows
leaving Netflix when Disney starts their
own service no so that's a really good
question my understanding is that what
your top thinking of is the deal that
Netflix has with Disney that's for
Disney things like the Marvel movies and
like Pixar movies that deal is the one
that Disney's like but this is a part
but the Marvel TV shows or like a Co
partnership between Netflix and Marvel /
Disney so that deal is different from
the Disney deal where Disney's like
we're pulling out of Netflix so you
don't need to worry about the shows are
safe yeah those are safe for as long as
they've been agreed to make and I think
they've been successful for both
companies but I would wonder if Disney
is going to actually start developing
their own to somehow compete with their
own but they haven't had a lot more
hasn't had a lot of success on TV listen
yeah thanks Leia what was it the agents
of shield yes still going on but it's
not all that hasn't been very popular
okay I would argue it's actually gotten
better but people stopped watching yeah
there was agent Carter
agent Carter right and then like right
now there's the and that is flopping I
don't it's not getting good reviews no I
mean that I mean and then the next thing
is gonna be cloak and dagger I think oh
yeah freeform
yeah yeah they had a lot of that a
comic-con I mean I don't think we have
to worry about Marvel Disney pulling
Marvel out of everything and going
completely exclusive they're wiser to
spread their tendrils across like Hydra
across all of the different platforms
and hopes to you know pull in different
audiences they might not been aware of I
mean yeah if they really wanted to just
play it close to the chest everything
would have been on ABC and we know
that's obviously not the case right oh
well I mean true you're right I forgot
about that
but Netflix is not right right yeah
other things coming that question David
Fincher like Netflix is second original
15 serious from David Fincher called
minehunters gonna be in the neck before
the end of the year
Saburo which is an Italian show in a
time like original in Italian that's
getting a lot of buzz right now
something called dark which is also
their first German original series and
the crown the second season oh yeah
which was something that they spent a
lot of money on like it was a critical I
thought it was kind of sneezy but I
watched the whole thing over
Thanksgiving last year well it's a
period piece right yeah one of those big
set gorgeous set design yeah it's like
God all right
let's switch gears over to t-mobile
Matthew dad your dad's in the chat with
so much haven't had or haven't t-mobile
and Sprint been talking about the merger
for several years which one is recurrent
of acquiring which what's going to
happen to the deal offered by
mobile all right so I'll try to take
them all on a time they have been in
some at some level talking to each other
for years you know soft Bank which is
Sprint's parent company famously tried
to buy t-mobile a few years ago the
government stepped and said no that's
you know we want for national carriers
we've got a different ministration now
so the thinking is they have a better
shot with a trump presidency versus
Obama presidency so what I'm hearing a
deal is likely to be announced sometime
in early November t-mobile would be the
acquirer it's almost like a merger of
equals it's gonna be a stock deal but in
the NT Mobile's parent company Deutsche
Telekom will be the majority shareholder
and will have control over it and and
John ledger and his team will run the
combined company gotcha
yeah because that was gonna be the next
question from Josh to say who was really
gonna be in charge after all this time I
mean look it's hard to discount the
effect that John Ledger's had on the
wireless industry and and how well
t-mobile has done he's basically we've
taken it from 0 to 60 and you know few
short quarters so it makes sense for him
to keep going with that and I mean
Marcelo Claure as the CEO of Sprint has
done some stuff in terms of turning
sprint around but they're still kind of
in trouble just kind of mess so I
imagine if I'm Marcelo I'm like I'm
gonna take my payout and just walk away
yep with lots and lots of money and
let's try to help out Blair now it's too
early to say with how like the state
that this acquisition is in yeah but
Blair asks if I oh one of the services
money and they merge am I going to have
to pay up or keep using my phone so
either way the deal gets announced it'll
be like a year maybe even longer until
the deal gets sealed so it really
depends on what your terms the contracts
are and like whether or not you're
willing to switch even after the deal
closes I don't imagine that they're
gonna be booting people off right away
t-mobile bought MetroPCS a few years
back and they were fairly
ooh they're they gradually phased out
the phones because they were using
different technology and sort of
replaced phones for users as needed but
it was a gradual process
no one's getting booted out in terms of
paying up I'm assuming paying for your
phone that I think it's all gonna be
dependent upon after contract
yeah it's dependent upon your okay so if
you're like what's sprint you're still
gonna be paying up the surface as is for
a while just cuz it's gonna take a while
for this thing to close and for them to
even start integrating the services
right and even like as things might
shift and change and as far as service
goes it's gonna be a while before it
really takes gear it's really just about
John ledger getting more money for his
pink sock collection pretty much makes
everything sneaker collection yeah yeah
yeah I think airplane I mean like that I
think the ultimate goal what consumers
would want to see is that t-mobile and
Sprint would combine their spectrum
assets although the wireless airwaves
that they have that could theoretically
provide a much much better service both
indoors outdoors throughout the country
but it's gonna take I would say years
until that actually happens in any kind
of meaningful way for consumers one more
from the - before we close it out I
thought derecha Telecom was trying to
get out of the US market was I wrong or
did that change no no that you're not
wrong they wanted to get out and then
John ledger took over and t-mobile stock
started soaring and now don't you
telecom is that in that rare position of
power they actually now they don't want
to give it up because it's become it's
gone from one of the laggards to one of
its growth engines that's why they're in
such a great position to Steve Jobs he
did a good job the business it did but
that's the main Steve Jobs did a lot
more I think I don't have a better
analogy all right I mean yeah in terms
of the the baseline principle it's all
the same but yeah it that's why don't
you telecom now can basically argue for
terms for better terms to Softbank right
have now before we closed out have we
ever seen anything like this before as
far as an acquisition big to big players
yeah yeah yeah well spread in the cell
phone market yes Nextel Sprint itself is
a product of a merger between sprint and
Nextel and back then both were two very
strong companies and they merged and
they became a one terrible crappy
company with terrible crappy servers for
years at the point where
almost wrecked that business that's why
there's like that did anybody go get
caught down that that that whirlwind no
I was a sprint customer before the
merger but I remember the service
getting progressively worse and worse
for customers and they were running two
networks for a while because they were
not compatible and both networks were
like getting crap and crappier so you
know so we have that to look forward to
yeah all right everybody that's it for
today Roger you want to bring us home
