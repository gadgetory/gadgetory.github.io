stand in Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona I'm taking a look at the NEC
medias W an Android find that has two
screens so you can think of the medias W
is basically being two screens bolted
together attached by this hinge when you
fold the phone flat it ledges just 12.2
millimeters thick unfortunately we can't
fold it all the way here because of this
big security tag that I want us running
off with it each screen is 4.3 inches on
the diagonal when you open it up it's
got five point six inches on the
diameter taking in both screens so when
you open it up you will get to home
screens as you can see I can swipe
across these and see twice as many
widgets that wants that's very good some
other cool things you can do with the
two screens are set a video duplicating
on both screens which could be handy if
you're sitting across from someone on a
train or a bus maybe and you both want
to get a look at the footage you can
also put maps across both screens and
get a slightly bigger view of where
you're going and the browser as well has
some quite cool features so you can see
it's expanded across both of these
displays gives you a wider view you can
pin pages as well so you can keep one
browser page always present on one
screen and keep browsing away on the
other one that could be useful if you
wanted to keep Facebook or Twitter
running on one side and have a look at
more web pages on the other when you're
in the gallery you'll see thumbnails
displayed on the left screen and larger
images on the right which is quite a
cool idea something else is good is it
if you tap and hold one of the images on
the left side you can drag it onto the
facebook app to quickly post pictures to
facebook apart from the two screen
feature this is a fairly standard
Android phone it's running Android
version 4.1 which isn't a very latest
version of jelly bean but it's pretty
close so you will get all the usual
treats like access to the Google Play
Store and of course all those home
screens you can fill with dynamic
widgets and apps NEC says that the
battery shouldn't be too badly impacted
by the two screens obviously having two
displays will take mortal on battery
life then you would see with a normal
phone but of course you won't have both
screens open all the time
so hopefully it won't be too bad so I
think having two screens could
definitely take some getting used to but
it's a very cool idea if it doesn't
impact too much on battery life that is
it's coming out in japan in april
there's no word yet on a release
elsewhere in the world but fingers
crossed day on the Westway via cnet and
this is the NEC me dsw</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
