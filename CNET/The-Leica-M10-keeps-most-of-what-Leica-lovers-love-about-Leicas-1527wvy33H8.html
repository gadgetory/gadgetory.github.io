released the m9 full-frame camera and
with the m10 like is making the m-series
even Aamir based on feedback from its
film faithful Leica made the m10 faster
and slimmer a slim is the analog m7 and
it made the viewfinder bigger and
brighter improved the noise profile and
simplified the operation like it did so
without sacrificing many of the
conveniences of digital but it did drop
some that are in the m9 company's view
is that the m9 is a workhorse camera
while this one's for the photography
purists who I guess don't want video a
USB connector or strobe sync connector
to make it possible to see all the
important shooting settings while the
cameras off like a move to the ISO
sensitivity control to the top though it
maxes out at ISO 6400 it can only map
one of the higher sensitivity values to
the dial at a time it's got a clever
lift to turn retract to lock design
though the m10 retains the removable
plate on the bottom which covers the
battery compartment and SD card slot
you'll be in there a lot since the
battery life is not very good at least
when you're using the optional EDF I got
to spend a few days with a
pre-production unit the viewfinder did
seem better to me I usually have trouble
focusing with range finders but this one
wasn't bad I still preferred the
optional AVF though since it magnifies
the focus area and offers peaking one
downside is I found it fogging up in our
sort of winter weather photos look
pretty much like any other modern like
this one of the nice things is that the
JPEGs look exactly like the raw Diane
G's which is not true of a lot of other
cameras</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
