here at GES first build facility in
Louisville Kentucky first build is a
place where anyone can submit product
ideas and work with teams of designers
and engineers to take that product from
the design stage on through to
production first bill just opened its
doors today and to kick everything off
they shared a few of their prototypes
with us one of the prototypes is a smart
pitcher it's really just a basic pitcher
but they added a bunch of sensors to it
and they also added an autofill
dispenser inside of a refrigerator so
when you put that picture under the
dispenser in your refrigerator it will
fill water up to a fill line and then
automatically stop a second prototype is
actually a garbage disposal basically it
takes a typical garbage disposal makes
it a lot smaller so it can fit under
your sink more easily the blades are
more powerful but they're dispersed to
the outside of the disposal so it's less
likely that you'll cut your hand and the
design is supposed to be easier to
install and not clog as often another
prototype is a double oven range but the
top oven actually pulls out like a
drawer so you don't have to reach inside
the cavity of the oven to pull out your
food it also has a peak feature
basically it just lets you tilt open the
door so you can look inside without
having to pull the door open the final
prototype they showed us today is called
the line cook this is a prototype that
was developed by the level one
hackerspace here in Louisville it is an
oven that can read barcodes on food and
then Auto set the ovens temperature the
time and the cooking mode that it wants
to use so those are the prototypes they
showed us here today there's no pricing
information yet but these will all be
available on the first build site in
limited quantities and if they really
take off they'll make it to mass
production in larger GE facilities
thanks for watching on Megan Willerton
