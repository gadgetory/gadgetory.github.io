smarter but did you know that you can
control the connected devices in your
home right here in the driver's seat I'm
seeing that the right Chris stay tuned
and I'll show you how to control your
smart home using your car the first
things first if you're going to create a
home automation system that's
controllable from your car you're going
to need some home automation devices and
what you want are smart devices like
these that work with if it is an online
automation tool that lets you craft
custom recipes that tell your smart home
what to do when certain things happen
now the linchpin to this is this guy
this is called automatic and it's a
hundred-dollar device you're going to
plug into your car's data port it will
track your fuel efficiency and your
check engine light it'll tell you where
you parked it'll give you little
reminders to help you increase your
efficiency it's a cool device but the
coolest part to me is that it works with
ifft and that means you'll be able to
use your car as a trigger for those
recipes setting automatic up is really
easy just get into your car and look for
the data port on the left side of the
driver's side you'll plug automatic in
and it'll beep then you'll pull up the
app on your phone follow the easy steps
and you'll have connected your car's
computer to your phone over Bluetooth in
my home I use automatic in my car and I
have Belkin Wemo switch is turning my
entertainment center on and off I like
having that entertainment center turn
off when I go to work so it's not
drawing power during the day here's what
that recipe looks like I go to if this
than that and I go to this and I select
automatic and I go down to if ignition
turned on in area the in area is
important because you don't want this
recipe to trigger whatever you turn your
car on you want this recipe to trigger
when you turn your car on at home that
means you're leaving that's telling the
smart home i'm leaving i'm in the car
i'm going somewhere this is a good time
to turn off things so i'm going to
select that turned off an area and then
i'm going to tell what area i want and
i'm going to pick the area right around
my home this is a little geofence circle
so if i'm in that circle on the map this
recipe will work so if that happens then
I want to have a belkin wemo switch turn
off when I go over to the belkin wemo
I'm going to tell it to switch off and
I'll tell it which switch I want and
there it is there's my
recipe if my car starts when I'm at home
I want the entertainment center to shut
off and now every time I leave for work
or go out to see some friends at night
my entertainment center will shut off
and I'll save a little bit of
electricity and there you go just like
that you've taught your smart home how
to tell when you're coming and going
ought to make the things in your home
accordingly just using your car for cnet
I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
