to fit in the palm of your hand I call
these machines Micro desktops and the
best example is Intel's line of compute
sticks
these look like slightly oversized USB
keys but inside is a full Windows
powered desktop there's an HDMI port at
one end so you just plug it into any TV
or monitor add a keyboard a mouse and
you've got a working computer the
original computer sticks Rant Intel Atom
processors and cost around one hundred
and fifty dollars they were fine for
basic web surfing but nobody really
wants to use an atom powered PC all day
long this upgraded model looks and feels
very similar but cranks the CPU up to a
core m3 which is intel's upscale line of
processors for super thin super light
laptops and desktops kind of like the
12-inch Apple MacBook it plays HD video
does photo editing and feels much more
like an everyday desktop but that also
means it's more expensive currently
three hundred and eighty nine dollars
that's a big jump from the earlier
compute sticks but still hundreds less
than most other core M pcs the last
computer stick we looked at had two USB
ports built into it this one drops that
number back to one but adds two more to
the kind of hefty power brick so at
least you can plug in USB receivers for
keyboard and the mouse if you don't want
to use bluetooth the biggest advantage
of a stick PC has more to do I think
with security then price or performance
you can keep all your files safely on it
take them to a meeting or on a trip and
then when you're done just stick the
entire thing in your pocket and walk
