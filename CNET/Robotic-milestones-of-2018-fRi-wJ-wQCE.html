our cherished pastimes here at CNET is
to take a look back at all the awesome
new robot achievements that happened
there were a bunch of great milestones
for robots in 2018 and these are our
absolute favorites let's kick things off
with a four-legged robot beast with a
special kind of handicap cheetah 3 is an
MIT creation and it's pretty impressive
it's a blind robot meaning it doesn't
use any vision based tech like cameras
to navigate the world around it the idea
is to develop a robot that can use feel
or touch to figure out how to traverse
things like uneven terrain and in 2018
we watched cheetah 3 take a wobbly
journey up a short staircase in the
future we may see cheetah threes
descendants performing work teams too
dangerous for humans
blind locomotion you never look so good
now that we've celebrated a cat robot
how about a dog oh it's so nice I'm oh
this adorable little robot dog got a
reboot this year and our very own
Bridget Carey spent a week with Ivo
introducing it to her daughter a real
dog and some senior citizens
she found it charming especially for a
dog that runs off a battery it's the
only robot on our list you can actually
buy but the almost $3,000 price tag is
enough to scare away all but the most
dedicated Robo dog fans from picking one
up it's still an amazing achievement and
future iterations could go a long way in
acting as companions for anyone who
can't handle a live pet
a robot dog might not be in your future
but there's a good chance our next entry
might make an appearance in your life
Disney's stickman started off as a
straight piece of metal but soon evolved
into a robotic stunt double capable of
some pretty incredible acrobatics in
2018 we watched as Disney Imagineering
research and development released a
video showing off the newest iteration
of stickman doing tricks even the
bravest stunt doubles might think twice
about these machines are the future of
Disney's already believable animatronics
and will likely performin shows at
disney parks around the globe
sometime in the future the only misstep
not naming it a crobat so obvious
another human s robot made our list this
year but it's a little less
entertainment and a little more
terminator
it's Atlas one of our all-time favorite
robots this bipedal bot has been in the
public eye since 2013 and now five years
later Boston Dynamics swole super
machine learned how to parkour every
major milestone from him is always a
delight to watch and this year's update
was no different he left over a log he
found it over boxes and pretty soon
he'll be hunting humans for sport and
trying to kill John Connor of course I'm
joking joking or am i and last but
certainly not least on our list of 2018
s greatest Robo achievements it's NASA's
insight Rover we all watch this global
scientific effort reach Mars in November
touching down and marking the first
major spacecraft landing on the red
planet since curiosity did it in 2012
it's got a big job in sight is designed
to study Mars as crust mantle and core
hopefully providing scientists with new
information about rocky planet formation
in our own solar system we've already
gotten some selfies from insight as well
as some audio from Mars itself
we'll definitely be watching insights
Twitter feed for more as its mission
continues so those are our favorites was
there something we missed
scream really loudly at your screens so
that I can hear you we can't wait to see
what 2019 holds for the future of
Robotics until next year be good meet
