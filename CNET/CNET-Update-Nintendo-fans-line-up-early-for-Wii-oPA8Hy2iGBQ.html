Carey and this is your cnet update on
Sunday the wii u goes on sale but at the
new york city nintendo world store
several people are already waiting in
line to be the first with a new system
i've been here since tuesday morning at
eight Tuesday midnight Monday night I've
been just about the middle of October so
by Saturday night will be about money
since I'm a huge fan of Nintendo's
portable gaming more than anything the
wii u's almost like a giant yeah and
it's really exciting to me at the
portable game of to see how go home
Gaming is going to treat
well that x games online save some money
definitely kicks in for me based on how
you look at it I think it from a
parental perspective it's going to be I
can get the system for my child and they
can now play the game on the tablet
while I'm watching TV I just want to get
home and just lay in bed I just play my
wii u just I don't have to stand in
front of the TV just one particular game
in general outside of super mario
brothers for the wii u i'm very
interested in which is zombie you and i
played the demo at the nintendo
experience and i have not played a game
right back with that word changed entire
wavy we play the actual video games
where you have to look through the
gamepad to find items that you need all
right partners and sponsors and help me
or one of the sponsors as you can see
sunny morning down vxg there a video
game Entertainment Group ducks term
which is a social media website for
gamers without them would have been kind
of impossible to do a whole month in
other news Microsoft has been hit with a
lawsuit over the storage space in the
new surface tablet the
five-hundred-dollar surface is
advertised to have 32 gigs of storage
but there actually is only 16 gigs of
free space to store your files that's
because half the storage is being taken
up by the operating system and the
included programs so a lawyer in
California is suing saying this is false
advertising microsoft says the lawsuit
is without Mary's since on its website
it does stay that the user only gets 16
gigs of free space other tablets also
have this issue but I guess it's
typically not this dramatic if you get a
32 gig ipad only 28 gigs is free to use
and Facebook is finally adding a way to
share another users post on a mobile
device but this share button is only
going to be on the mobile website it's
coming soon for Apple and Android apps
that's your tech news update you can
find links to all of these stories on
the blog sina com / update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey
