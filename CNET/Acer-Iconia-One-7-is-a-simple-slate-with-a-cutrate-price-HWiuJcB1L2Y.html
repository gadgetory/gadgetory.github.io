at around 230 dollars but if your budget
can't stretch that far this one hundred
and $29 Acer slate may satisfy your
simple needs
I'm Xiomara Blanco prasena and this is a
first look at the Iconia 1:7 the 7 inter
is a budget tablet and it definitely
feels like it the plastic back feels
cheap and the smooth weaved texture
doesn't help its case it is pleasantly
lightweight however a bit flimsy feeling
like you could easily break if I
accidentally sat on it the top edge
houses the microphone pinhole microUSB
port and headphone jack while the power
button volume rocker and micro SD card
slot sit on the right edge the pair of
speakers on the back sit close to the
bottom edge and they work better for
movies and audiobooks than music inside
the tablet houses a 1.6 gigahertz
dual-core Intel Atom processor 1
gigabyte of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
internal storage
the Iconia 1:7 is upgradable to android
4.4 and includes some free apps or blit
whereas some like to call it and you
can't delete them so unfortunately they
take up some of your internal storage
touchscreen response sometimes lags and
apps have the tendency to randomly crash
despite this I thought the tablet
performed fine under pressure letting me
smoothly stream video and play games
while downloading files and updating
apps the Acer Iconia won seven Don's a
1280 by 800 pixel resolution display and
HD video looks fine but text often looks
pixelated simple mobile games run
smoothly even when plenty of apps are
open in the background but large games
take a long time to load and look choppy
during gameplay the 0.3 megapixel
front-facing and 2 megapixel rear
cameras produce underwhelming photos
there's no manual focus though the
front-facing camera does have face
detection photos are washed out in color
a bit fuzzy and focused and grainy
especially in low lighting the
front-facing camera also has a greenish
tint to its photos there are plenty of
inexpensive 7 inches available that are
great for casual use but the Iconia 1:7
is a more affordable option for those
with a tight budget if you can pony up
to the $229 Google Nexus 7 or Amazon
Kindle Fire HDX they pack better screens
performance and builds but if you can't
the Acer Iconia 1:7 is a super simple
7-inch slate for a bargain-basement
price once again I'm Xiomara Blanco for
CNET and this has been a first look at
the Acer Iconia one 7 tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
