report and now for the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the new
samsung SCH you 740 now this is a very
cool multimedia and messaging phone from
verizon it's got this innovative dual
flip design so you can open it like a
phone or you can open it in landscape
mode for text messaging and emailing
full qwerty keyboard of course megapixel
camera here on the front music player
nice skinny design my only problem
really with this phone is that the SCH U
740 is designed to compete with the LG
env and I mean think about how that goes
I'll take the LG and be my good man vs.
I'm looking for that Samsung skinny
phone with the keyboard thingy that
flips open this way and that way and
then it also plays music it takes
pictures and does email and stuff you
know what I mean like the scu boat 42 or
something yet no you know what I'll just
take the LG env thanks and now for the
news microsoft CEO steve ballmer says
that sales of windows vista have indeed
been disappointing and he says piracy is
the reason so you know I would have
thought the problem lay with the
multiple confusing editions of Windows
Vista the incredibly high price of the
new operating system coupled with the
cost of the new hardware you'll need in
order to run it the fact that it's hard
to pinpoint what benefits if any it
offers over windows XP and widespread
reports of compatibility problems with
everything from video games to iTunes
you know when you think of it that way
you kind of have to wonder who would
even want to steal it Viacom this week
announced a deal with these still in
beta internet TV service juiced Viacom
will provide some of its full length MTV
Comedy Central and B et shows too juiced
now the news is interesting because
Viacom recently cut off talks with
YouTube and demanded that YouTube remove
a hundred thousand videos that infringe
on Viacom copyrights and Viacom to move
is also interesting because the company
seems to be betting that people are less
interested in short low-quality clips of
online videos and more interested in
watching complete shows downloaded from
the internet so you know you'd go from
this
hey you come to this meeting with the
CEO oh oh yeah yeah I forgot yeah let's
go to this hey you coming to this
meeting with the CEO hmm yeah I'm just a
minute you know it's two o'clock right
now we gotta go yep once I did you know
this meeting is mandatory for the her
company boo come on I am watching this
you know you're so fired yeah you know
what on second thought maybe this deal
isn't such a good idea and speaking of
addiction a 58 year old man is suing IBM
for firing him claiming that he is
addicted to the internet and he should
have been entitled to treatment instead
of being summarily dismissed for
engaging in sexual encounters and online
chat rooms James potenza also says that
other IBM employees engaged in much
worse behavior but were not fired for
example he says that one couple had sex
on a desk but both people were
transferred instead of being fired Oh in
related news HBO has just announced
development of a new series JavaScript
divas behind the big blue door a study
this week found that playing video games
can actually make for better surgeons
researchers said that video game skills
translated into surgeons who made fewer
errors performed faster and scored
higher in surgical tests than colleagues
who did not play video games the only
downside is that sometimes the game
playing surgeons killed their patients
on the table perform taunting dances
over their bodies and then challenged
them to go ahead and respawn noob I'm
Mollywood and this has been the buzz
