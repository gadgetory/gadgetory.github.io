gonna you know so i thought they were
supposed to win will you your favored in
everything we're okay yeah pretty what

idea what happened oh I don't know what
happened next year you know what next
year okay thanks man yeah texture great
yeah we'll see next year when they play
the ravens at you okay but I hate that
guy what's shakin brian Tong here and
welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and yes I'm still getting over the Super
Bowl loss but congratulations goes out
to all you Ravens fans I'll two of you
so let's get to the stories and really
the big news this week was the official
release of the evasion jailbreak for the
iPhone 5 it's an untethered jailbreak
and it's the first of its kind to work
on all iOS 6.1 capable devices including
ipods ipads and iphones even going as
far back as the 3gs now the user
reaction has been great with over 4
million unique devices using the cydia
app store since the jailbreak release
now in response apple recently updated
their knowledge base article to warn of
the side effects of jailbreaking such as
iOS instability security vulnerabilities
short and battery life and a potentially
inoperable device now blurry vision
shortness of breath or dizziness we're
not included I have no idea where this
came from now you know jailbreaking
becomes a game of cat and mouse with
every iOS update and Apple has already
released their latest iOS 6.1 point 1
for developers there's no new major
features here but improvements for maps
for Japanese users and it possibly fixes
the jailbreak from working all right
sticking with iOS and 9to5 mac reports
finding files for radio buttons in the
ipad music app in iOS 6.1 the icon is
similar to that radio icon that used to
be in itunes for the mac and some of the
files featured the word by in the fight
names it lends some weight to the Apple
music radio service rumors that
Bloomberg predicted to launch in the
first quarter of 2013 even though
negotiations with music labels have been
moving very slowly so we'll see if these
are placeholders if the music deals are
made also Apple rumor sites are seen web
traffic logs from unidentified machines
claiming to run OS 10.9 make a
significant jump from a few dozen last
month to thousands in the most recent
month Apple is still on a yearly cycle
of its Mac OS release around july so the
timing of this could indicate a similar
timetable for OS 10.9 hello kitty cat
that's what they're calling it now an
apple patent use the big a was just
granted a patent relating to an
integrated touch sensor and a solar
panel configuration a screen would have
both functions where when idle it can be
used like a solar panel in a charging
mode but once it detects an approaching
object like a finger it would switch its
function to a capacitive touchscreen now
this is crazy stuff and doesn't prove
it's coming but this would be a killer
feature for any phone and it's worth
keeping an eye on all right now if you
guys want to quench your thirst for some
apple TV news another patent filing from
the big a also revealed a system that
can adjust and enhance audio based on
the user's proximity to the device it
could be used for a phone tablet or
laptop but the diagram shows a TV with
multiple people as the example a
multiple microphone array proximity
sensors and facial recognition can also
be used for a video conferencing
function as well and Apple TV fans that
are wondering when will Apple open their
walled garden and bring more content to
the platform to be happy about this news
a Bloomberg report says the Cupertino
kids are in talks with HBO to bring the
company's HBO Go service to the apple TV
now you'll have to be an HBO subscriber
to use it and it's reported to be coming
in mid 2013 all right we gave you guys a
little bonus episode from the macworld
show floor earlier this weekend you
should check it out if you haven't seen
it already but we also got the chance to
sit down with music artists will I am to

Apple and his amazement with my last
name

there and really getting involved in
technology also has pretty good
hairstylist if you recognize that your

first artists i got involved with
technology companies from a creative
side you actually have an iphone case
under the IM plus line right the photo

put out Brett to market so it works like
this it's a camera different lenses this
is the fisheye lens my favorite we have
a 360 lens panoramic lens zoom lens wide
angle lens has a better flash and a
battery and a keyboard so in the way it
works is your iphone fits in it like a
cartridge so this would be like your

cameras and it sits in closes snaps
