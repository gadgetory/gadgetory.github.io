tong and the seven inch tablet category
remains one of the hottest right now so
we're facing up to primetime powerhouses
it's a prize five punch out between
Africa iPad Mini and Google's Nexus 7
our judges for this fight just one it's
saying sing a tongue I'll score each
contestant on its own merits round by
round the final prize fight score will
be an average of all rounds using the
nearest tenth of a point hold on to your
butt's round one is designed the iPad
Mini brings apples unmatched design with
an all-metal body that takes cues from
apple's ipod touch lines it's
comfortable and light to hold with its
7.9 inch display that's larger in size
but its biggest drawback is its 1024 by
768 resolution that looks alright but it
just isn't a Retina display now Google's
Nexus 7 is still one of the best-looking
7 inch tablet designs we've seen to date
it's beveled edges with a grippy
perforated backing feels more
comfortable to hold compared to the mini
and its 7-inch screen pops with a higher
1280 by 800 resolution that's visually
sharper beauty is in the eye of the
beholder but I'm calling this a tie at
4.5 points apiece next rounds controls
and user interface the iPad Mini brings
iOS 6 that snappy and intuitive and is
still the easiest pick-up-and-play
interface on planet earth the home
button has multiple functions to access
current apps and a few basic settings or
you can tap it for Siri even if it gets
the job done
iOS hasn't evolved enough and I want
more beyond the notifications pulldown
now the Nexus 7 brings androids jelly
bean and it's a legit OS that can stand
on its own it's super clean and snappy
while bringing Android staple
customization with widgets that are
resizable and a dock for your apps then
let you also drag icons on top of each
other to create folders notifications
are still here when you swipe from the
center but swiping from the top right
now brings you quick access to here
settings this comes down to preference
but Google takes this round with a 4.5
and the iPad Mini gets a 4 so after
averaging 2 rounds the Nexus 7 leads
next round is feature both tablets bring
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and front-facing cameras
but you won't find any memory expansion
slots here the Nexus 7 comes with 16 or
32 gigs of storage and an Nvidia tegra3
quad-core processor it steps up its
feature set with jelly beans Google now
which delivers relevant information like
whether public transit and nearby
businesses based on how you use it
Google's voice search and commands are
second to none and it's faster and more
accurate plus its maps are more reliable
right now and it includes Google Street
View and public transit options now
Android Beam lets you exchange data with
two nearby devices when you tap them
together and it's Google Play Store may
not be on quite the same level with apps
but it's still a legitimate offering
plus jelly bean 4.2 is coming to the
Nexus 7 and we'll be bringing gesture
typing to trace over your words instead
of typing them out and multiple user
accounts on just one tablet now the iPad
Mini comes in 16 32 and 64 gig flavors
but disappoints with an older a5
dual-core processor that lags behind
their other product lines it brings its
own voice search with Siri that has a
prettier interface when you're looking
for sports stores or restaurants but
it's just not as accurate and its
response time lagged significantly
behind Google's Apple brings her own
turn-by-turn directions with their Maps
app and it does the job for some people
but we know about its issues and it
still has a long ways to go before it
regains my confidence you can also view
the content that's on your iPad Mini to
a television set that's connected with
an Apple TV if you live in the Apple
ecosystem and it's really Apple's eCos
that might be its greatest asset here
with unique apps and games that make the
iPad more than just a tablet the Nexus 7
still shines here and takes this round 5
to 3.5 next round is web browsing and
multimedia Google's Nexus 7 brings one
of the best mobile browsing experiences
even without Flash support with its
Chrome browser that brings features like
an incognito mode for private browsing
the iPad Mini brings Safari which is
just as solid of a browser with a snappy
pinch and zoom and brings features like
cloud syncing of bookmarks on other
devices and a clean reader mode video
quality looked great on both devices but
I give the Nexus 7 just a little edge
when it came to Netflix and YouTube
streaming with its higher resolution
screen now Apple's iTunes store also
gets an edge here because of its
exclusive content deals but Google Play
still has a robust library of its own
media content beau tablets have
front-facing cameras but Apple
differentiates itself here with a 5
megapixel rear camera that also shoots
1080p video mode and a panorama mode
that works really well compared as
third-party apps and it continues to
push the taking pictures in public with
an iPad movement the iPad takes this
round with a perfect 5 and the Nexus 7
gets a 4 after averaging 4 rounds the
Nexus 7 still these by 2/10 some point
round 5 is performance
both of these tablets feel fast and
snappy to navigate even if their
processors are different in our video
playback battery drain test the Nexus 7
gave us just over 10 hours of video
playback compared to the iPad Mini that
chimed in at over 12 hours and that's
the best battery life out of any of the
7-inch tablets on the market today
the iPad Mini gets a 5 and the Nexus 7
gets a 4 so after averaging 5 rounds
were tied the final round that decides
it all is valuable the Nexus 7 16 gig
model starts at $1.99 the iPad Mini 16
gig model starts at 329 now you can even
purchase a Nexus 7 with 32 gigs and
mobile data connectivity for cheaper
than a base model iPad Mini and this is
really one of the first times where
Apple's pricing seems to really be out
of touch especially without a Retina
display or a curved processor inside of
the mini the Nexus 7 takes this round
with a 4.5 and the iPad Mini gets a 3 so
let's average out all six rounds and in
a battle where the Nexus jumped on top
early but the iPad Mini fought back to
even it up it was the price that made
the biggest difference and the Nexus 7
takes this battle 4.4 to 4.2 and defends
its title as your pride size winner
I'm Brian Chong thanks for watching
we'll catch you guys next week for
another prizefight
