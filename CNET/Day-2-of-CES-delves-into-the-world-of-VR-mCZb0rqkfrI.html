CES 2016 i'm brian coulis with Professor
Scott Stein got you another one
professor of technology interpretation
emeritus yes all over stroke yes we're
here for day two of CES to bring you
what's exciting which is a lot of stuff
including some new experiences in VR
which we're both excited about yes so
here we go all right let's go started
out with televisions which I think we
kind of have sort of passed over until
now the most amazing one rolls up yeah
the Motorola we've seen a lot of TVs but
now we're seeing some concepts behind
the scenes
yes concept LG was showing some some
displays or the stuff gave a
kastle-meyer check these out that's a
rolling OLED display like a sheet of
paper you curve it up it shows how
flexible these displays can be and you
know how you can tell it's really a
breakthrough is that it more than just
bends it literally rolls up right and
they let us get near it usually when
they have something super out there like
this they have like five or six people
on a velvet rope but we can't get near
the thing well we can almost touch this
yeah and they show even and this is
fixed but you see in one part of the
video how it is actually being rolled
not just that that mock-up in static
right so the wallets on your ear right
here there we go okay it's on right now
a little bit exposed but they're showing
it's actually pretty nice you know who
knows we gonna roll up your OLED
newspaper but it's a show that you can
do some interesting things up there but
the curving can go in all sorts of
directions not just this way and you're
starting to see some of those like s
shaped ones and who's who knows what's
gonna come next even beyond TVs the
screen tech is very flexible can you top
it this has also got big import for
retail as well when we talk about retail
technology a little later in the roundup
but this is the kind of thing that
retail installers love to do to create
displays like you see it conferences
like this that retail stores and I guess
one of the ideas is look you could have
a TVs you can roll up and put away when
you're not using
which appeals to a certain you know
lifestyle and design crowd that doesn't
want that big black plastic thing out
all the time on your wall justin
bieber's marketing cruel put these
everywhere like they do in shock on the
on the sidewalk all right there was also
this is a cool of the see-through OLED
TV window what is this weird mix-up yeah
so this is also LG and it's showing what
OLED can do it's a funny thing about
OLED we talked about how an OLED is
fired up it's there when it's not you
get pure blacks but that also means that
when it disappears there's nothing there
and this screen is showing transparency
in place of that black so we're seeing
or if there is big you through the
window hello there are some smart
windows we've seen but this is getting
of the point where I think it looks more
like Minority Report where say we keep
talking about that as a movie touchstone
but this is a I think this sort of
trippy screen imagery like that you can
start doing some really interesting
things yeah yeah yeah really again a
great retail technology as they're
showing here also a great possible tool
in the future toolkit for augmented
reality yes and I mean maybe maybe like
installations deep arts theater all
sorts of things the unite displays
perhaps this feeds into head-up displays
in vehicles who's to say be there's a
lot you can do there lot you can do now
we didn't talk about pcs yet either so
far this week we want to get covered on
that most of them are around a PI
performance vein origins PC with a
wraparound form factor and we've seen
curved TVs before this is more
pronounced isn't it yeah this is a pcs
have been actually a pretty big story at
this show this is a 34 inches a curved
screen this is this is a high-end
machine Origen likes to customize and
build out these machines you know this
has replaceable parts though so you can
still go in and swap out what you need
so it is designed for for a serious user
and it just kinda shows what you can do
now in these forms maybe we'll start
seeing all in ones it's usually all ones
are not a thing you tend to see in
gaming pcs but this one was pretty so
modular they were able to get a curve
there's one big flat motherboard there's
lots of smaller boards put them in an
array around there and it just looks
cool those I'd rather have that
I want to go in there and stop modding
right now there you guys want to get my
hands on it little subwoofer built into
the backplane there I didn't get the VR
headset just set it up neatly and that's
cool yeah room it's pretty cool okay
that's cool I don't know that that was
really interesting is the razor
Raz ers the maker blade razor has always
got an amazing system here or a
controller or something every year
something wild and crazy this is a
laptop high-performance compact laptop
for gaming obviously hyper external
outboard dock for graphics cards yes now
this is like I feel like the MacBook 12
inches again kicked off that super small
laptop tremor saying this is tiny slim
super thin super small and for a couple
of years now we thought about graphics
and possibly being ported out at USB see
I was talked about with Thunderbolt but
now that's the idea here as you plug
this in and now now it's a beefier it's
a big unit but now you're playing games
on it you want plug in it's an everyday
laptop Razer has a lot of concepts the
reason why I think it's kind of cool is
that razors really had a nice track
record recently their blade laptops have
been great it been real yeah real deal
great laptops so even though this looks
like I'm kind of pie in the sky idea
sometimes I go what's this what's it's
gonna be this looks like a really nice
laptop you pull off of that graphics
then you have your desktop station then
you take it on the road and you don't
have to get a gaming PC and USBC is a
big enough pipe move that heavy graphics
load back and forth finally shows we can
do impressive ok let's turn to some
smart home stuff now everyone knows the
Sleep Number bed right I mean they buy
more radio commercials than anybody on
earth I think and TV commercials so we
know them tends to be a multi-thousand
dollar fancy bed and all that they came
out with the tech iasts and I believe
cheapest of their beds an interesting
intersection $1,000 for what they call
it lower case I T connected mattress
$1000 it has both the usual Sleep Number
side-by-side air variable inflation to
get the different Sleep Number but
you've also got biometric measurement of
heart rate sleep style respiration and
it has a smart component that will take
that information and recommend to you
how you should sleep better when you
should go to bed to get well-rested and
give you the usual sort of report later
if
how you slept it's it's a smart mattress
in a true sense yeah and we've seen
there are there are little unroll things
that they've had where you can track
your your heart rate and sleep not have
it built into the mattress but to see
like a big company doing this
interesting the price considering it
also does that it's not bad
will you use it I mean Sleep Number is
already pretty good about like you know
they're push the idea of like they want
to customize combined I think with the
idea that it would help customize your
sleep if it's not working for you yeah I
think that's where it gets interesting
as opposed to what does this really mean
for me and I think they're trying to get
to a purpose and this can then set the
Sleep Number without you having to guess
all the time right but are those
commercials gonna say well my sleep
number is 45 my wife's is 70 how much
trial and error did that take and how
did you know it's the right number what
feels good isn't necessarily given give
you the best sleep but this supposedly
we'll know and do it right from Super
Bowls to wearables this is this is the
oddest one we've had yet the welt the
Samsung smart belt wins worst name at
CES yes that's it for a few years now
it's gonna it'll take that title
probably super well wearable smart belt
and it does what all belts do remind you
that you're fat by noticing that there's
more pressure on sensors and it's
holding in more girth than it did before
Thanksgiving and so let's you know and
how much and gives you a track of how
much weight you're gonna gain if you
keep eating like this in the next few
days and weeks so this is like your
enemy I mean it makes you miserable
every day when you put this thing on now
it just brings that to your phone and
throws in front of your face
you will never be able to justify it in
any smarts so well from Samsung yes
they're exploring you know I think the
throwing stuff against a wall but it
bears noticing keep an eye on things
like fabrics and suits Google with their
project your Carver they this conductive
fabric here the suit look like it was
trying to throw information yeah we're
like digital business cards if it's as
group you know Samsung has got their own
research and development teams they're
showing off products that not even the
our normal product representatives know
about right now these are the things
where you go there was a coming of
Samsung that Samsung doesn't know right
they live
you ask the Samsung Repp sometimes you
say what's come in they go I don't know
go check it out we're surprised isn't it
and that's kind of cool too yes great
trivia Samsung has a fashion clothing
line nothing to a tech they are a
clothing maker in Korea I had no idea
they'd make me plays in and this plays
into that drones we've seen all kinds of
drones here at the show of course but
none that you can ride in that just
changed our ashley Esqueda is actually
right with a drone that will carry you
not just take video of you let's take a
look at what she found there hey guys
ashley Esqueda with Cena down here on
the show floor in South Hall drones are
a really big story at CES this year but
what about a drone that can carry a
whole person in it this is the e hang
184 it has eight rotors they are
humongous also we're gonna check out the
cockpit check this out
you're gonna get in here you're gonna
check out this map there's gonna be
locations you can tap on you're gonna
tap on your location and this is an
autonomous aerial vehicle it is gonna
take you exactly where you need to go
and you don't need a pilot's license
that's one of the goals of he hang 180
for the founder of the company actually
was inspired by unfortunately the death
of his friends who were small pilot
small plane pilots so they wanted to
design something that nobody need a
pilot's license to pilot to gold places
but could get them from short ranges
without as much danger you want to limit
your danger here so the e hang 184 is
designed to do just that and it gets up
to 65 miles an hour
you got 23 minutes of battery life on
top of that it gets up to 11,000 feet in
the air that is really really high I
think I'm terrified of heights I don't
want to go that high but it'll hover
generally about 500 to a thousand feet
this thing is going to be available to
real consumers and the goal is that it's
not going to be exclusive to the
billionaire circuit so get out your
millions or your hundreds thousands and
get ready to buy the e hang once those
regulations and the FAA approves this I
predict I'm gonna have one of these to
get through LA traffic now
sit from the show floor make sure you
check out all of our coverage on
cnet.com / - yes okay we're back with
CES in depth day two of the show here in
Las Vegas Brian Cooley with Scott Stein
another technology that has some retail
import kind of like a couple of displays
we just saw again in the display
category something called memo meas
magic mirror it's an evolution of a
product that we have seen a year ago but
now apparently about to move into actual
stores this is a mirror that here's
Beatty doing his thing it's a mirror you
get in front of and you see yourself
changed while you're in front of it in
real time
so here's Beatty and his clothes and
changing color of the clothing so he can
try different styles and clothes off the
store without having to try different
clothes on see how they look at least
for color now depending on what kind of
a back end you've got on this in terms
of computation and AI you can move
beyond color you could also move to fit
fabric texture garment you can just run
through the entire store without ever
going to the store and get a pretty good
approximation of how something looks on
you this is what I you know what I
really want to do is I want to just
basically see this move into my
television I want this I want the
software and the and the cloud
processing and of course you're gonna be
able to shake your butt future Beatty
and be able to get that into something
that I've got in my home so I never did
go to the store again and try on clothes
I hate that I feel miserable I know if I
don't do that that I'm really regretted
any randomly ordered right but yeah I
want that I also want some sort of like
uni suits that would just I don't know
how that would do that like three core
items that would just keep changing
colors and you get just tons of
drawstrings you can make it baggy or
tighten if anything you want to wear it
each day okay let's move through the
last couple things we've got going on
here
that would be aware on my hair I'm lost
right here okay the Dragonfly 20 circuit
board printer this print circuit board
so you print things now they're just all
plastic or materials what if you could
print something that has integrated
circuits literally integrated circuits
inside of it please think of it the
traces the electrical traces can just be
another layer as long as it's conductive
ink that you've got from one nozzle just
draw the conductive part while you're
adding case layers around
substrate layers around it it's actually
brilliant it's fantastic you think about
building prototypes for items you can
now 3d print circuit boards maybe you
can 3d print an entire computing device
that you want to test out in prototype
and one of the biggest expenses in
manufacturing Electronics is all the
discrete components and the expensive
machines that place them and drop them
on there this is a step toward the idea
that you literally print some of the
used to be complicated discrete
components that's really solid state if
you get right down to it yeah that's
truly celebrate start seeing things that
use that very soon all right mr. born
boy wrap the show big use for VR adult
entertainment
turns out that there was one company
that we've seen Naughty America that has
been very forward facing about putting
this out there at the first experience
no Brian Tom got to experience it
Vanessa got to experience it here on the
stage you may have seen their reactions
pretty intense this is a you have to
sideload get ready to sideload if you're
gonna experience this at home because
these these developers they don't want
you to be using adult entertainment so
they're basically telling you to
download these files they're 180-degree
3d and I did try this out and you
download it to local storage and try to
make sure that people don't discover
some cache of it about half a dozen
videos or so so far they feel
hallucinatory if you ever seen strange
days or the old movie brainstorm that's
not Brian tongs body yes my body sent
that's how I sighed John's professor
Stein it's rage you're really about to
Seidler Stein that's my concern
yeah yeah so this is it's very
convincing so what I can say the close
ranges are technically it's close range
very high resolution very well optimized
nicely done
very disturbing bullshit what
nope no peripherals yet I tried it on in
there oh I was I tried out the full I
tried on the whole experience that's not
ever see I told my mother was gonna go
to a nice clean professions yeah and
Here I am with you this is the future
this is the future help us all okay
that's it for tonight don't judge me
what an experience never do Brian Cooley
and professor Stein will be back
tomorrow at 11 o'clock Pacific with the
big roundup of the whole show with our
picks for the top 10 products of CES
2016 so a really big zoom out that's not
nearly all that's happening here on the
CNET stage though we've got the smell
alarm clock waking us up at 9:00 a.m.
we'll crack open a hoverboard with
everything wishers standing by because
let's face it your airline won't let you
transport want anymore
plus our appliance team will discuss
their favorites here at the show as well
so we'll see you bright and early
goddamn it early tomorrow morning yeah
sleep it a little bit like you and your
VR Scottie download yeah I bet you will
have a side loan right we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
