divide us this time with a really weird
audio file yeah this is the sound that's
driving people nuts some people swear
they could only hear Yanni others only
hear Laurel so what's going on here
which is the right answer and the answer
is sort of
both there's a Yanni sound that's on the
higher range of the spectrum and a
Laurel that's on the lower end and if
you change the pitch of the recording it
can help you hear one word more than the
other so what is influencing our brains
to hear Yanni or Laurel there are a few
things that play one could be your own
ears if you have some hearing loss you
may not be able to pick up on the higher
pitched Yanni sounds as easily you can
also be influenced by the type of
speakers you're using something with
deep bass is gonna pick up
Laurel more URI URI
so I only heard Yanni on my headphones
but then later at the office I heard
Laurel on speakers and now my brain can
go back and forth so to find out if my
brain was broken I spoke with linguistic
expert Abby Walker she's an assistant
professor and co-director of the speech
lab at Virginia Tech we think there are
two things going on one is personal
about the listener and one is about the
equipment that they're using so
essentially the the main divide and what
you're hearing is about how much
information you're paying to the lower
frequency versus the higher frequency
sounds that are going on and they're
both there so it's not kind of right or
wrong to pay attention to one versus the
other but of course there is another
question what is the original sound
supposed to be the New York Times traced
the origin story and it's just a poor
quality recording of the word Laurel
from the site vocabulary calm go to the
page for Laurel and you'll find a sound
file on how to pronounce it Laurel a
high school student in Georgia was doing
some school work and he recorded the
audio coming out of his computer
speakers which totally muddied it up and
when you realized people were hearing
two different things on his recording he
shared it online it jumped from
Instagram to read it to Twitter and it
just blew up so before you start taking
sides and breaking apart friendships
consider that everyone could be right of
course some people don't want to see
both sides like this guy he's all for
Team Yanni whatever I'm Bridget Carey
what did you hear when you first played
it and did it change for you overtime
and while we're on the matter
the dress is obviously white and gold</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
