I'm cars Tsuboi cnet.com joined by
senior editor Seth Rosenblatt to tell us
all about Microsoft's brand new
operating system Windows 8 News 8 and
this is the very first operating system
that is touch-enabled writes up first
one from Microsoft absolutely and
they've designed it to work on laptops
desktops and tablets and these laptops
desktops tablets don't necessarily have
to be touch enabled to run the operating
system absolutely so they've ripped
they've priced an upgrade at forty
dollars so if you want to upgrade your
old windows 7 windows vista or windows
XP machine you can do that and it's
fairly affordable so right now you're
holding a touch-enabled laptop a sony
laptop that's running the new OS show us
a little something so you can see you
swipe through your tiles you can jump
into a tile we are and then to get out
of that and to get out of that you can
go to your Start menu there so what do
you think of the user interface so far
I've been using it in various forms for
about a year it's fairly stable it's
very fast very fast to boot very fast to
wake from sleep it's also the most
secure operating system that Microsoft's
ever put out and those are very good
reasons to upgrade one thing that may
confuse some people is there is a
desktop mode that looks a lot like
Windows 7 sure because it is yeah or it
is mostly so you have this and you still
have your charms bar there so you can
jump back to your metro and the desktop
mode is what allows you to run legacy
programs uh-huh and when can the public
get their hands on the new OS sure it's
available on october 26th right and what
do you think this really means for the
company moving forward that's the that's
the sixty-four-thousand-dollar question
for Microsoft I think that this is
really about making themselves relevant
again it's a very aggressive move it's a
huge change they're putting out all
kinds of new hardware they've never had
hardware restrictions on their
manufacturers this tight before so
there's a lot that could go very well
for Microsoft there's a lot that could
go wrong okay well we will be stayin
tuned and if you'd like to get any tips
tricks and reviews of
windows 8 you can log on to cnet com
