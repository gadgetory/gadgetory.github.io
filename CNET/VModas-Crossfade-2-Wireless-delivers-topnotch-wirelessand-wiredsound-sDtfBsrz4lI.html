new crossfade to wireless headphone
which starts at $330 is that it's a
little more comfortable than its
predecessor that's because it ships with
new thicker ear pads those new cushions
aren't quite as thick as the optional
extra large ear pads you can purchase
four v motors earlier full size
headphones but they do offer more
cushion the other big changes are on the
inside there's a new 50 millimeter
driver more frequency response in Wired
mode and an increase in battery life to
14 hours the reason that there is better
battery life is that there's a bigger
battery inside the headphone and it does
add a little bit of weight and the
crossfade to wireless tips the scales at
a beefy 309 grams with the included
standard aluminum shields which can be
swapped out with a set of vemos optional
custom 3d printed shields the headphones
fold up to fit into the same slickly
design carrying case that came with the
original crossfade Wireless the case
does have one small design modification
a set of small air vents why well it
turns out a lot of DJ's like v-moda
headphones and they tend to sweat on
their headphones then throw them in the
case after a gig things can get a little
stinky after that thus the air vents
this is one of the best sounding
Bluetooth headphones you'll find in this
price range and arguably the best
headphone v-moda has ever made well it
doesn't blow away the competition is a
wireless headphone v-moda has managed to
increase the detail and clarity and
improve the quality of the bass from the
earlier model it's also worth noting
that the headphone has been certified by
the Japan Audio Society to meet the high
res audio standard in Wired mode my only
reservation about the crossfade to
wireless is that it's a little heavy but
otherwise it's an excellent sturdily
built wireless headphone that offers
more refined sound than previous v-moda
headphones for more in-depth analysis
