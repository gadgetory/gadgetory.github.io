share with you about cybersecurity I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update as hacking a tax increase
governments are getting more involved in
cybersecurity and it's not always a good
thing on Monday the UK Prime Minister
David Cameron said if he's re-elected
he'll work to ban encrypted messaging
apps like whatsapp snapchat maybe even
apples iMessage service his view is that
the government needs to be able to tap
into chatting services through a back
door to monitor possible terrorist
communications and the government can't
do that when apps use secure encryption
well that's my kind of fly with tech
companies that are beefing up security
you can't create a back door that only
lists the good guys in if there's a
whole it's going to be exploited by
hackers and with hacking attacks on the
rise we need enhanced encryption now
more than ever President Barack Obama's
administration has its own cybersecurity
proposals among them the ministration
wants private companies to be more open
with the government about cyber threats
if more companies work with federal
agencies then the hope is that it's
easier to fight hackers as a team but
there are questions regarding privacy
such as how much data will companies
share with the government to stop cyber
crime everyone wants more information to
have a stronger a defense against
attacks but what private consumer data
it needs to be given up to do that
moving on to other news Facebook is
teaming up with the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children to put
Amber Alerts in your newsfeed when a
child in your area has gone missing
you'll see a photo of the missing child
their name and description as well as a
license plate number and the details on
the suspected abductor looking ahead
this year we're going to start to see
some notable advancements in real-time
speech translation for different
languages Google is following skype and
instead of be working on an update to
its Translate app it's going to be able
to automatically recognize a spoken
language and then translate it into text
on your screen in your language that's
according to a report from the New York
Times it goes beyond saying a phrase
into your phone and then hearing it read
back to you in English last
week at CES we saw dozens of drones that
can fly but here's one that prefers the
sand a team of engineers working with
Disney research in Switzerland created
the beach but it's designed with a
turtle body the beach bot creates large
drawings in the sand with a rake
dragging behind to create art the robot
knows where it is on the sand by
scanning poles at the corners of the
designated drawing area it's similar to
how some robot vacuums know where to
cleaning your home that's your tech news
