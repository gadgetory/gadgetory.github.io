we feel the reflective tone of fall and
all the peaceful contemplation that the
clothes of another year in our lives
does suggest so naturally our minds turn
to all that tech stuff we're about to
buy
I'm Brian Cooley with the top 5 tech
products according to what you've been
seeking out on CNET as of end of October
2011 heading right into the holiday
buying season number 5 is maybe on the
list because so many folks just want to
see what the hell it is the Motorola
Droid Razr yeah like you my mind's eye
immediately imagine some kind of Android
II and redo on the iconic razor flip
phone but with a bigger screen I guess I
don't know what I was expecting
well now it's just another slab phone
but one that's a mere quarter inch thin
and so light you'll think it's one of
those non-functioning demo units and
since it uses Kevlar for reinforcements
it's great for the person on your list
who lives in a crappy neighborhood and
it's got a stainless steel frame so it
won't snap into when you slam it on the
table each time Android reboots number
four another Droid this one the Bionic
I'm almost surprised this isn't number
one I don't think I've ever had people
ask me so much about a pending new
product as this one when it debuted as a
prototype way back in January it assured
in this new class of phones we call
super phones our review which gave it an
editor's choice says it best
the Bionic is everything you want from a
high-end smartphone kind of high praise
from us but it also costs a
class-leading two hundred and fifty
bucks with activation and it's the size
of a snow shoe number three is yep
another smartphone this time the Samsung
Galaxy S 2 Samsung's Galaxy live has
powered them to actually overtake Apple
recently as the top maker of smartphones
and this one like the Bionic we just
talked about works on 4G networks which
in itself is a huge area of interest
among you smartphone shoppers on CNET
and light the bionic it also got a C net
editors choice
a lot of drool all over it number two
continues this crazy smartphone route
today which reminds us why smartphones
now outsell computers
it's Apple's iPhone 4s there was huge
interest and pent up demand for whatever
was gonna follow the iPhone 4 and once
everyone got over their rage and
bitterness over it not being an iPhone 5
Apple moved like four million of these
in opening weekend add in the fact that
the 4s brought the iPhone to a new
carrier another 50 million folks who can
now consider getting one and you can see
where the hotness comes from before I
get us to the number one most popular
piece of gear on CNET through the month
of October 2011 let's look at the
hottest categories you're all lathered
up for believe it or not it ain't just
smartphones ok with that number one
category in mind the number one most
popular piece of tech gear on SEANET in
October was not a smartphone it was
actually a product you couldn't even get
yet the Amazon Kindle Fire the fire is
Amazon's $200 answer to the iPad that
isn't really an answer to the iPad you
see I expect it to open up the tablet
market to a new and separate population
that iPad doesn't speak to thanks to a
lower price smaller size simpler array
of features and built-in Amazon services
that have really never had their own
device before and most importantly did I
mention the price 200 bucks
the fire hits mid-november check out our
CNET review for word on whether it
really is only the second tablet to ever
get any traction with users I've got all
your links to these guys and a bunch of
fresh top 5 lists like this over at
top-5 cnet.com check it out i'm brian
