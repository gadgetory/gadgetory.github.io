you want then buying a new phone can be
daunting because out of all of this you
have to pick this or this or this so I'm
going to help you narrow down some of
the best phones that you can buy today
if you like a phone with a large screen
measuring 5.5 inches or bigger the
Google pixel XL is one of my favorites
it's not too heavy even though it's big
it's also extremely fast to use and it's
the best expression of what's known as
pure Android that is Android without any
phone makers whistles and bells on top
of it Apple's iPhone 7 plus is really
great too the two cameras on the phones
back helped create this cool
artistically blurry effect and the phone
is a solid and reliable addition to the
iPhone family I'd also recommend the
samsung galaxy s7 edge the phone is
excellent and those gorgeous curved
edges are definitely going to get you
noticed among your friends one last
large screen phone is sort of sneaky
because it also happens to be the best
mid-price phone you can get and that's
the one plus 3t the camera battery and
internal speeds are all better than
you'd expect for a phone that costs a
whole lot less and those other ones that
we just talked about now for phones with
five or 5.2 inch screens I'd say go for
the Google pixel the iPhone 7 and the
Samsung Galaxy s7 those are all two
smaller versions of some of those large
phones the low cost moto g4 is on the
opposite side of the spectrum from these
guys but still today's best budget buy
when it comes to camera battery life and
quality hardware under the hood lastly
I've got to give a nod to the Moto Z
play which is one of the new moto phones
that works with snap-on mods like an
extra battery pack projector in various
cases the play is the best deal of all
three Moto Z phones out right now it is
the cheapest yes but it also has great
battery life and a headset jack that the
others don't so you won't have to toss
aside your favorite wired head</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
