most report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's your music in the cloud sprint
going to bat against ma belle and my new
house in Kansas City Kansas but first
it's the gadget of the week the gadget
of the week is the samsung series 9
laptop otherwise known as hot hot gadget
porn i first fell in love with a sweet
little MacBook Air competitor at CES
thanks to its outrageous thin and swoopy
looks and now our editors come along and
say the speed the sexy design and the
long battery life make it one of the
best ultra-thin windows laptops we've
ever reviewed looks and brains break my
heart why don't ya of course the 13-inch
model is almost seventeen hundred
dollars so cool down everybody like all
the hottest of the hot it's out of our
league but a girl can dream and now for
the news amazon launched a new cloud
service that lets you store your music
in the cloud and then stream it from
anywhere the first five gigs are free
and you have to pay after that but no
you heard me right amazon launched that
not Google or Apple boom thank you
amazon now sure if you're a DJ it's
probably not for you and it doesn't
playback music on iOS devices so maybe
not for you iphone users either but if
you're an Android user just like a web
user or me you are psyched less site the
music labels obviously sony music says
the service is totally unlicensed other
label execs said they were shocked that
amazon didn't even ask for permission
and of course there is talk of lawsuits
but amazon says it has the legal right
to store your music without extra
licensing and let's be honest we
consumers we want this I want this and
if the music labels are going to take on
someone as big as Amazon and publicly
demonstrate just how anti-consumer they
really are then fine let's do this fight
fight speaking of fights Sprint is
vowing to fight the AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile merger
with media campaigns and government
lobbying and considering that every
single consumer I've talked to many
listen even the economist say the move
would return us to the old ma belle
monopoly days I'm grateful for all the
help we can get fight sprint fight man
we got a hole like this is sparta thing
going on today don't we google this week
announced a new recommendation button
just like Facebook's like button it's
called plus one because Google's nerdy
like that and when you see something
that you like I mean plus 1 then you
click the button and it tells your
friends and your contacts and the rest
of the world that you like I mean that
you +1 that thing it's kind of like a
social network but not really a social
network because who would actually say
out loud that they're competing with
facebook even though Google totally is
fight headlines this week nokia
announced it will stop using the Symbian
mobile operating system after 2012 it's
surprising news I mean I thought nokia
was gonna die with symbian like the
Spartans but now they're gonna die with
Windows Phone 7 like the Spartans just
kidding just kidding Kansas City Kansas
is the winner of Google's ultra high
speed internet although cities that
rename themselves google or made their
mayor's jump in frozen lakes are crying
in their megabits right now and all
145,000 people in kc will be rocking one
gigabyte per second internet connection
soon pen I wonder what real estates like
they're in reasons why I love the
internet a female cobra escaped from the
Bronx Zoo this week and ended up with a
hilarious twitter account and a hundred
and fifty thousand followers at my last
count which is totally funny and
wonderful but is anybody still trying to
find the deadly poisonous actual cobra
though
and finally let's have a look at what's
clogging the tubes in reasons why I both
love and hate the Internet Rebecca Black
13 years old nothing but ambition she
puts out this cheesy auto-tune video and
ignites the white-hot hatred of the
anonymous mass of Internet the video has
66 million views and 1.2 million
dislikes in fact this week she passed
Justin Bieber as the most hated video on
YouTube
like Bieber she's doing just fine
reports say Rebecca is making a hundred
and twenty seven thousand dollars a week
from Friday she's donating most of the
money to Japan and her school and she's
been on The Tonight Show and Lady Gaga
is a fan but as usual with the web let's
be honest it's all about the parodies
and Hitler I'm weighing up in the
morning gotta be fresh gotta go
downstairs get em a bowl of cereal seen
everything zombies go where yeah yeah
but below cannot assess its up together
if it isn't writers and husband need a
diuretic advisors are a great immaculate
Connie's to Las indices or dom deefizzy
