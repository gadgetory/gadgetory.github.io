pretty familiar with the idea of a
connected car you may already have one
but there's a brewing business model out
there that is actually a bigger change
than the sheer connectivity itself let's
take a look most notably it would be a
car connected to the cloud via a
built-in cellular data radio in the car
or through an obd2 port add-on device
that has that cellular data ability it
can also mean having a phone paired that
can create a data link but at that point
it does depend what apps you are running
to meet the definition of connected car
I don't think something like streaming
Pandora really counts and I personally
do not include a mobile hotspot in the
car in the definition of connected car
that's just a hotspot and that formula
is rolling up to some big numbers now
but huge numbers later with a lot of
cars times a lot of revenue and a very
high growth rate even though its niche
now but here's the road map whether it's
US or worldwide revenue you look at both
are in the billions now with a very
strong annual growth rate for the next
few years even though the number of cars
on the road is not even 10 percent in
the US and not even half that worldwide
so that's where the business is going
but what is the business as you're going
to feel it and pay for it first of all
we start with the basic building block
and that is that factory built in
cellular data radio let's say that adds
a few hundred dollars to the MSRP of the
car now looking forward they're gonna
have 20 million cars worldwide with
these radios built in by 2020 or if you
have an older car but it's 96 or later
you can often add an under dash dongle
to something called the obd2 port let's
look at Verizon for example they've got
one called hum they charge you $30 for
the device $20 activation fee nothing
lives under the dash giving you a subset
but a pretty good one of what a full
connected car condition now once you've
got the hardware you had a service plan
to keep the pipeline going between the
car and the cloud General Motors has
millions of cars on the road with OnStar
connected services and that package
about three hundred and fifty dollars a
year to subscribe outies connected car
service package cost two hundred dollars
for six months or 750 for 30 months and
that Verizon device we just talked about
that's $10 a month with a two-year hitch
now we've got the pipeline set up and we
got it running we got to fill it with
services the ones you know best have
been out there for a while on services
like OnStar things like crash
notification locate your vehicle
remotely
start it adjust the climate even stop
the thing when it's been stolen but
newer services that are more commercial
more retail they can run from the
trivial locating a doughnut on your
route to the much more substantial doing
deep constant analysis of your driving
for example to qualify you for a
substantial insurance discount the more
futuristic examples look like this
connecting your car to your home so they
can control one another usage based
insurance early days now but pay for
only as much auto insurance as the miles
you drive warrant finding a parking
space right on your dashboard and paying
for it through a service as well
relevant food and service prompts on
your dash that are all about the route
you're taking see donuts above and
having tolls and parking fees
automatically paid just by driving out
or driving through one of those
locations now if you're like me I know
what you're thinking I can do this
already with some apps on my phone a
toll transponder and a free dongle my
insurance company will send me
absolutely true it's a little more of a
hodgepodge that way but the next and the
final big wave for automakers is to get
into what they call mobility services
every car maker has this on their
corporate lips Mercedes move L lets you
seamlessly plan a trip that involves not
just one of their cars but also transit
ride sharing and car sharing like their
car to go service Ford has Ford pass it
rolls up a whole slew of connected
services like parking location and
payment merchant discounts and offers
for where you're going
BMW's eye services they do something
similar but with a strong emphasis on
finding electric car charging locations
and paying for it seamlessly and the
final frontier for connected cars will
be when they touch autonomous cars to
talk to each other as well as to talk to
the cloud to do the logistics and
driving tasks better now this is going
to be in a little different technical
area it's gonna require a new
radiofrequency standard called DSRC
digital short range communications and
that's for cars to specifically talk to
each other in their own piece of radio
spectrum
it'll also tie into something called 5g
cellular networks these are very low
latency networks that will also be on
things like smart phones but not
expected in the market till at least
