and it's got a very long lens I'm Josh
Goldman and this is fujifilm finepix HS
50 EXR it's Fugees flagship magazine
featuring a 42 X zoom lens that goes
from 24 millimeters to a thousand
millimeters and it's a manual zoom which
makes it very nice for shooting faster
moving subjects since you can quickly
zoom in and out compared to a motorized
zoom though the movement is a bit jerky
so it isn't great for movies it does
however make this camera feel more like
an SLR especially with its manual focus
ring the flip-out LCD and
high-resolution electronic viewfinder
and its new cue button that lets you
quickly access the bulk of your
important settings in a nice easy to
navigate interface you also get other
high-end features like hot shoe and mic
input and it's also one of the few mega
zooms that can shoot in RAW and raw plus
JPEG now just because it has some things
in common with an SLR doesn't mean it
performs like one its sensor is still
small compared to a digital SLRs so its
pictures won't be as good and despite
improved focusing its performance lags
behind an SLR as well so again not an
SLR it is however excellent for a mega
zoom it's new sensor uses Fuji zxr
technology that improves dynamic range
and low-light performance though it does
have the resolution to 8 megapixels
which is still plenty for most needs the
dual autofocus system does give it
faster autofocus speeds especially
noticeable at the wide end and it is
loaded with a lot of shooting options
and controls it's definitely better for
a more advanced user but still great for
someone who needs a family camera or
someone who's primarily an automatic
snapper that wants to grow
I'm Josh Goldman and that's the fujifilm
finepix HS
