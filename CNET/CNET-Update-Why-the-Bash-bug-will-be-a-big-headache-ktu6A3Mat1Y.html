bug that will wreak havoc on our lives
you know just another day in tech I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update it's time to come to terms with a
simple depressing fact about the current
state of Technology you can't trust any
software or device to be secure from
hackers I hate to sound so dark but a
security flaw has been revealed to the
world and it impacts an enormous
percentage of software it's called the
Bosch bug Bosch is a program that sends
commands to your computer it runs in the
background and many devices use it but
there is a weak spot that serves as a
back door for a hacker to send a command
to take over your machine or rummage
around servers and steal information
this bash bug is all over the place it's
in Linux systems and Mac OS 10 the bug
can be found in your company's complex
servers or the simple internet-connected
light bulb in your home that's right you
can't even trust your light bulbs
because the software is everywhere and
because it's so easy to execute the
attack security researchers are calling
it catastrophic so are you terrified yet
you may be desensitized to all these
hacking attacks but don't shrug it off
because now that knowledge of the flaw
is out in the open the worst is yet to
come as companies rush to patch this
they will be pushing out alerts for you
to update your software and you should
update everything although the tricky
part is that you may not be able to
update everything like that light bulb
hopefully our future smart home products
will have more security precautions
amazon is actually working on some smart
home products sources told Reuters that
these smart home products would connect
to the internet and could make it easier
for you to order things around the house
such as ordering more laundry detergent
when you're running low but since you
can't hit a magic button in your home to
order more soap amazon let you shop with
tweets now you can add items to your
wish list by tweeting the hashtag amazon
wish list you can also add items to your
cart with the hashtag amazon cart you
need to connect your Amazon account to
your Twitter account to master this
trick
has to be a reply to a tweet with a
product link which is kind of strange
but hey that's social media for you in
the meantime the world continues to wait
for apples next update to iOS 8 after
the first update was botched the mobile
operating system update that was flawed
left new iPhone 6 bottles without cell
service and broken touch ID fingerprint
scanners if you did get stuck with a bad
update there is a way to download the
old iOS 8 to revert your phone back to
the previous operating system but it's
unclear how long before Apple can fix
the damage to its image with consumers
that your tech news update you can learn
more at cnet com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
