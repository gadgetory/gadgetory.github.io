at the clips SB 120 speaker clips is one
of America's most popular designers of
loudspeakers and so it was with interest
that we check out its version of the
sound stand the SB 120 this is a sound
bar that's designed to support your TV
and connects to it via optical cable or
analog in if your TV supports it the SB
120 can decode dolby digital as well but
be aware that this speaker is stereo
only in addition you also get bluetooth
for streaming music from your mobile
devices the clips is fairly big for a
device of this type and it's built
solidly too unlike some speakers that
claim to fit a 55 inch TV like for
example the LG sound plate this one
really can and with these the cosmetics
are a little ordinary but at least it
does have a black ash wrap on the top
but the biggest design flaw is the lack
of a display this means you can't tell
the volume at any time particularly of
the on-board sub it's not really a sub
though more a couple of small bass
woofers with two mid-range drivers and
tweeters as well unfortunately there is
no way to add an actual subwoofer either
despite the lack of deep bass though
sound quality is very good with the
relatively large drivers putting most
other devices at the price say between
300 and 500 dollars to shame it's able
to conjure up more mid-range detail
which means better movie dialogue and
better music playback however the lack
of a true surround option the onboard 3d
mode is pretty terrible means that other
sound bars and stands are better if you
wanted just watch movies or TV at a 350
dollar street price though it's a pretty
good deal especially if you want
something that sounds better than your
TV and can play a tune as well this has
