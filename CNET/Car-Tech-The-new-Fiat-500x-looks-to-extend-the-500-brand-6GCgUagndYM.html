on the floor at the 2014 paris auto show
and right now we're taking a look at the
Fiat 500x it's another sort of large ish
crossed over from the small Italian
brand if you're seeing hints of the Fiat
500l don't be surprised the two vehicles
share a lot of the same styling cues if
they sort of upsize the Roundhead life
in front of porky design of the Fiat 500
but what you may not notice is that
underneath the skin it actually shares
its underpinnings and a couple of its
engine and transmission options with the
recently unveiled Jeep renegade this is
going to be the first Fiat model that
wolf debut with the 9-speed automatic
transmission that we've seen on the
Chrysler 200 Â°c and on the jeep
renegade it's also going to be available
with a wide range of engines starting
from diesel engines to turbocharge four
cylinders all the way up to the brand's
naturally aspirated 2.4 liter tiger
shark engine putting out about 184
horsepower now it's going to be
available in two different trims one's
going to be more cosmopolitan more
metropolitan for the city and the other
is going to be this sort of leisure
model that's going to have extra plastic
trim is going to make it look a little
bit more rugged and inside we're going
to have a couple of more infotainment
options under the UConnect branding
previous systems were powered by Garmin
but 5.5 and 6-inch navigation systems in
this vehicle are actually going to be
powered by TomTom so we're looking
forward to getting our hands on that and
seeing how they do it's also going to be
available with the beats by dre audio
for those of you who like the bass at
the very least i think the notchback
design is a little bit more attractive
than the Fiat 500l so if it's going to
go big this is probably a good way to do
it I've been antuan goodwin on the floor
the 2014 paris auto show taking a look
at the Fiat 500x
