of the vizio m 601 da3 our television
with plasma now out of contention in
2014 it's up to companies like vizio to
make the best of a bad lot and produce
decent pictures from an LCD TV the way
Vizio is doing this is with a local
dimming system as featured on its
60-inch em series apart from local
living this TV also features passive 3d
and a smart TV suite with apps such as
netflix and pandora connections on this
include four hdmi ports and two USB the
sign of this television is excellent
with a very streamlined look but there
are computer like elements such as the
browser tab like logo and the monitor
like stand the remote control is a
combined Wi-Fi infrared model and while
it's supposed to be a learning remote
unfortunately we couldn't get that to
work so I'd suggest get a Logitech
Harmony instead while watching this TV
you aren't fooled into thinking you're
watching a plasma but it is capable of
much better black levels than any other
TV at its price picture quality is solid
even if it can't compete with a
Panasonic st60 for example but try
finding one of them anymore color is
acceptable though red is a little off
and can't be corrected with the minimal
color controls with the vizio M 601 da
3r you'd get a big screen a decent
picture and living room friendly design
even the closest competitor sharp finds
it hard to compete on all three points
this has been ty pendlebury for cnet.com
