editor at Cena today we take a first
look at the spot mobile phone now I know
this phone looks a little strange looks
a little old looks like it might be from
like I don't know the early 2000s or
you're probably wondering maybe it's
something from Wall Street that old
movie but I can't say this is a
satellite phone so it is actually
somewhat newish it is a phone of now but
it doesn't connect with solo network it
actually connects with satellites
floating way up in space which is why it
probably looks a little big and why it
has a non-traditional design actually it
has this big antenna which I'll get to
in a minute that really connects you
with the satellite but yes it is very
big it is very bulky even though this is
a phone that you'd want to carry
probably when you're hiking or camping
or backpacking or something like that
isn't exactly compact you're gonna want
to bag or a really large pocket for it
isn't particularly heavy even with this
big battery on the back but yeah it's
just a little big so just keep that in
mind one thing that I didn't like is
this charger now this isn't just some
normal little wall charge or even just a
small cable you could plug into maybe an
external battery or computer no this is
something like you'd find with maybe a
camera or I don't know or you know some
sort of big electronics so you have the
plug that goes to the wall you have that
big AC adapter and then you have this
other cable that's pretty long which is
you know nice if you can keep you can
park it a long way from the wall when
you're charging but not so nice when you
it's just something else to carry around
also has a proprietary connection that
goes to your phone which don't not
really a fan of the phone actually has
that port here on the bottom not the
most convenient or best arrangement for
something that you're going to want to
take when you're on the go on the front
there is this small display it is a
completely monochrome but it just has
red and green pretty small just shows
the essential information like the
connection your battery life if you're
connecting to a satellite the phone
status of course there are no graphics
since this phone doesn't run any apps or
a music player or play movies or
anything like that
and then down below are the alphanumeric
keypad so you can use this to dial you
can actually send text messages with
this phone but you cannot receive them
so that's a bit disappointing that you
can't have the two-way communication but
I guess that letting you send text
messages out just gives you another way
to communicate otherwise not many
controls here on this side there's a
volume rock
right do you like it cuz it's really big
and it's rubberized so it's easy to find
we're on a call and there has a 2.5
millimeter headset jack here I'm the top
almost everything is 3.5 these days so a
little disappointing they go 2.5 you're
gonna need to get an adapter if you have
normal size 2 headphones or you're gonna
be needing it a two point five
millimeter headset the biggest features
on the back are this big battery you can
see it right here it does pull out
easily and that antenna so of course
you're connecting to satellites that
means you need a big two antenna you're
gonna have to rotate that tena up and
pull this out and there you go so you
know if you're using this in public you
will be noticed quite readily but this
is essential for connecting to the sky
of course when you use it you're gonna
want to make sure that there are no
trees or buildings or any other
obstructions around you don't need to be
in a completely open field I mean I used
it in places where you know there are
trees little ways away but you just need
to have a clear shot to the sky
mechanism is fine it's not too loose
it's not too stiff and you're just gonna
need to rotate it around sometimes
adjust it maybe to get the maximum
satellite coverage the display will have
a message it says rotate antenna you're
gonna see that here because it says now
it says looking for service of course
we're not gonna find anything since
we're inside but you will find that
status of where the phone's connecting
or not right on that display and then
when it's connected you'll see the bar
you'll see bars just like you would
normally up here in the corner I use
this phone a few places I used to use it
here in San Francisco I used it up in
Sonoma County where it's in a rural part
of there I used it on the Olympic
Peninsula in Washington and I used it in
Greece as well in each place I was able
to make a call after a few seconds or
maybe almost a minute of connecting to a
satellite sound quality's okay you know
it's not fantastic but this is a
satellite phone so I really wasn't
expecting miracles if this were a normal
cell phone I would be pretty
disappointed I probably Tralee trash it
actually but one thing about this phone
of course is the it really needs to work
only that one time where you really
really really need it so as long as it
does then you'll probably be okay it is
a bit expensive the phone itself is
almost 500 dollars and then service
plans are pretty pricey but if you are a
person that really is gonna be out in
the wilds a lot you are you're gonna be
likely backpacking out in the
backcountry you're gonna be in a place
that just doesn't have normal cellular
service and you really need to keep in
touch or you really just want it for
emergencies I suppose the cost is going
be worth it to you overall though pretty
unique device but as far as satellite
phones go it is accessible it is pretty
small and it works and it works fine I'm
Ken Sherman and this is the spot global
