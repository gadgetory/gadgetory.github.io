about with Facebook they all did the
neat way to talk about it is oh you know
you have mark and then you had Cheryl
and then like he was a good CEO but
that's not actually kind of how it
happened in that like when he started
out he was like not a very good CEO and
like in fact i think it was like
valleywag was like every day they'd
write like we demand Mark Zuckerberg
steps down as CEO from facebook he's
incompetent what actually happened was
he learned how to do the job when he
started out as CEO of facebook facebook
groove airy fast he had very senior
people reporting to them him he hadn't
had any experience with that he hadn't
worked at a company let alone run one
but he was learning and over time he
learned how to do the job he then hired
better executives one of which the most
important of which was Cheryl but he
also became a much better CEO founder
CEOs really don't know how to be CEO but
that doesn't mean that they can't learn
and it doesn't mean that like you know
all professionals went up that learning
curve somehow someway at some point and
the question is like Ken that founder
learn that job and can you tolerate all
the mistakes they're going to make while
they're learning it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
