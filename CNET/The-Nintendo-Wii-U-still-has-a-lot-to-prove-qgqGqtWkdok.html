cnet.com and this is my first look
review of the Nintendo Wii U now before
I get going here I need to disclose that
as of this recording there are a lot of
features not yet accessible on the
system
these include we backwards compatibility
Nintendo TV we - Wii U transferring a
shop miiverse Wii U video chat access to
the Nintendo network and all the
streaming apps like Amazon and Netflix
and even more stuff
we're told that some of these features
will be available on day one and some
won't
for example Nintendo TVs not going to be
around until sometime in December but I
will be sure to update the video and the
review once they go live but for now
let's talk about what we do know the Wii
U comes in two models the basic and the
deluxe now I definitely recommend going
with the deluxe for 350 dollars because
you get Nintendo land included in the
box and a bigger 32 gigabyte flash
storage drive plus more accessories the
game in the memory are worth the extra
50 bucks alone now the Wii U console has
a total of four USB 2.0 ports and an SD
card slot up front there's an HDMI port
and back along with slots for a
component connection power and the
censor bar all we games end controller
accessories work with the Wii U so
there's no need to buy anymore if you
already have some old ones laying around
the Wii U provides a unique gaming
experience using a rechargeable tablet
controller called the gamepad that can
use motion and touch control to interact
with games the battery lasts about three
to five hours depending on what you're
playing and it takes about
two-and-a-half hours to fully charge one
of the coolest and most promising
gamepad features is the ability to play
off TV games which place shifts all the
action on to the gamepad anyone who has
roommates or lives with a spouse will
absolutely love this feature now
not every game supports this so you have
to read up beforehand on which games do
at launch only a handful of them support
it like new super mario brothers you
Darksiders to assassin's creed 3 and
call of duty black ops 2 now the range
of the gamepad is good and as long as I
had it within the line of sight of the
console I was able to use it around 25
feet away however once you go into
another room that distance drops through
just one wall I was only getting it to
work and around 10 feet away from the
console now playing with the gamepad is
a lot of fun but it's a really big and
cumbersome unit this is over 10 inches
wide I have monster hands so I can only
imagine how a small child is gonna have
to really grip this thing the gamepad
only weighs about a pound but it does
take up a lot of real estate there are a
ton of buttons on the gamepad too so
there's plenty of room for controlling
almost any type of game thinkable it's a
very versatile controller the gamepad is
very responsive and there's absolutely
no detectable latency issues at all now
the Wii U's interface looks just like
the 3d s's with rows of tiled icons that
represent games and apps the menu screen
can be swapped back and forth with the
gamepad screen during most instances
jumping in and out of system settings
can take a little longer than you would
think I've had to wait as long as 20
seconds on occasion by today's standards
that's almost unacceptable the Wii U is
the first Nintendo console to support HD
gaming and playing mario and high def
for the first time is awesome most of
the games look fantastic and are just
about on par with ps3 and xbox360
graphics though video files out there
may spot some shortcomings with texture
and frame rates there's definitely a
learning curve with the gamepad and I
found that I don't always know where to
look there are some visual cues
on-screen but some games assume that you
already know what to do while Nintendo
TV will allow for the combination of
live TV Guide viewing content discovery
and more the gamepad can only currently
control your television in fact it
actually does a great job with my
and files box however it's probably not
going to replace the Harmony remote that
you might have because there doesn't
seem to be any sort of activity function
where the gamepad can blast a series of
commands to get a device working instead
you'll probably have to manually input
items just like you would with a bunch
of separate remote controls again we'll
be updating this video review with much
more information once it's pushed live
so be sure to check back here very soon
there's a lot more to learn about the
Wii U console on all of the games you
can play on it so I highly suggest
reading through the in-depth review on
the product page I'm Jeff Bakalar and
this has been a first look at the
Nintendo Wii U</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
