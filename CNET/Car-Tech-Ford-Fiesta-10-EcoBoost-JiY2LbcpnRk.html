engine stands with you but in this case
we should you never see 3-cylinder
engines in the United States they've
always been considered kind of an
oddball a smart car accepted speaking of
oddballs but now Ford's about to make
their first three cylinder engine ever
and roll it out here in the US and the
Fiesta and here's that engine right here
it's a one liter little tiny guy three
cylinder direct injection turbocharged
that's that EcoBoost stuff the idea here
is to make everything better than the
base 1.6 liter inline four so 123
horsepower 145 foot-pounds of torque
both those numbers are up from the
standard engine which is bigger and
better MPG fewer cylinders always
delivers that benefit they don't have
numbers yet but let's assume this car
can do pretty close to 40 average just
based on the volumetric efficiency of
this design now this kind of an engine
is also going to be one that has a
higher amount of torque because it's got
that turbocharger that should mean it's
more fun to drive than the current
normally aspirated engine the downside
these EcoBoost motors tend to cost maybe
about a thousand dollars more than their
nearest lower tech sibling in the
forward line if I do the back of the
envelope math right at four dollar gas
and about 15,000 miles a year you should
earn back that premium in around three
years and then have this little gravy
mill saving you money every year after
that this little guy comes out in the
2014 FIFA that's going to be a late 2013
arrival
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
