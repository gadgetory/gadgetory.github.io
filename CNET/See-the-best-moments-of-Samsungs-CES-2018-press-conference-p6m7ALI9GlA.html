consumers about buying a new TV I often
hear how tedious it can be to do all the
setup adding apps and that lengthy login
process
yes we spent a lot of time thinking
about how we could overhaul that process
by using the device you already use the
most and as all the information you need
to set up the TV
that's your smart phone just connect
your Android or iOS phone to the TV via
Bluetooth Low Energy and when it's
connected you see this you'll get this
pop up when you get this pop up all you
need to do is just press the setup and
it's actually loading necessary
information from your phone to the TV
via smart things cloud next I want to
talk about universal guy because I think
it's important I'm a UFC Fan and I've
set it up so that when I fight I want to
watch is about to start I'm gonna get an
alert here okay okay so there you go
there's an alert it says it's starting
in one minute so to tune into that
channel all I need to do this time it's
just click watch and there you go UFC
when the door rings we can check who's
at the door right from the TV screen
without missing any of the action we're
cool okay all right so why don't you
click that thing and view it in full
screen and then there you go
so we've made the 2018 family of more
personal than ever as you mentioned it
earlier Joe it now recognizes multiple
voices and knows your preferences based
on the voice yep
play my morning brief Good Morning Joe
here is your debrief you have sales
meeting at 8:00 a.m. meeting of 12:15
p.m.
Samsung CES 2000
tene press conference at 2:00 p.m. as we
do followed by team meeting and working
dinner at 6:00 p.m. have a great day Joe
it wouldn't be CES without an amazing
new Samsung TV ladies and gentlemen I'm
talking about the Samsung micro LED TV
the world's very first consumer
television with self emitting micro LED
technology it uses non-organic materials
and does not require a color filter to
produce perfect blacks and accurate
color the micro LED does not sacrifice
brightness or viewing angle either and
the Samsung micro LED is modular meaning
any size you want any configuration you
can think of this tvs design transforms
the concept of what's possible notebook
9 pin it is our lightest and most
durable tour in one PC ever giving you
the power and flexibility to work
wherever you are it weighs only 2.2
pounds and has a 360 degree rotating
hinge for optimal display best of all
the s-pen is powered by the PC itself so
it never needs to be charged now this is
a productive powerful and portable PC
Samsung flip is a portable fully
integrated and interactive whiteboard
that can connect to your PC and your
phone so you can easily share and markup
content together as a team so here is
the notebook 9 pen and the last slide
that we were working on and I just have
one suggestion that I want to add in
here I'd like to slide this over and
we've been talking about this target
consumer all day and I'd like to go
ahead and make that a graphic on the
side there so with my node 8 I simply
tap to connect using NFC technology
and like that I have video and a two-way
control of my phone very cool
our intelligent digital cockpit shown
for the first time here at CES 2018
securely delivers greater productivity
and personalization with countless apps
and enterprise services the digital
carpet merges the instrument cluster and
the entertainment systems of the car
into one with Hartman's sophisticated
sound solutions and branded audio
systems and integrating bixby and the
clouds the digital cockpit delivers a
more personalized more entertaining
in-car experience than ever before set
your thermostat on the way home see what
groceries are in your family hub before
you go to supermarket stream your music
in the car and have it playing on your
smart speaker when you come home
seamless connectivity to your digital
life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
