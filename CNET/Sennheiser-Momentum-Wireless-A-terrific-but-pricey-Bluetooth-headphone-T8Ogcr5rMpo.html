Sennheiser momentum Wireless one of the
best Bluetooth headphones you can buy
right now though not exactly cheap at
$500 what's great about it well for
starters it's a very comfortable
well-built headphone Sennheiser has
tweaked the designs of both its momentum
over ear and on your models both of
which now come in wired and wireless
versions and have a new folding design
that gives the headphones a little
smaller footprint when they're in their
included carrying case with both the new
wired momentum M 2 and this wireless
model Sennheiser's made the ear cups a
little bigger so they fit over your ears
better and don't pinch anything the
designers also made the ear cups softer
aside from its wireless capabilities
this headphone also features active
noise cancellation and FC tap tap air
technology for compatible devices
Bluetooth 4.0 and it also supports the
apt X codec on top of that you can also
use the headphones as a wired headphone
and it sounds very good in this boat and
actually plays louder with a cable
attached but back to Wireless mode for
that the playback and volume controls as
well as the power on/off button are on
the right ear cup and I was able to
operate everything easily enough by feel
alone the noise cancellation which isn't
too heavy is always on there's no switch
to turn it off but battery life is still
quite good at 22 hours the noise
canceling worked well in the streets of
New York and the integrated microphone
which is actually dual mics work very
well for making calls with my cell phone
as you talk you can hear your own voice
inside the headphones which keeps you
from talking louder than you need to in
many ways this is a direct competitor to
the $379 Beats Studio Wireless which
also has active noise cancellation the
beats is an excellent wireless headphone
and just as comfortable but the
Sennheiser just sounds a little bit
better with tighter bass and an overall
more textured refined sound it's not a
huge difference but there is a
difference as far as the differences
between this model and the smaller and
less expensive momentum on-ear wireless
this is a more balanced audiophile
oriented headphone
momentum on your wireless is a zippier
more exciting model I'm not sure which
one I like better for sound but I do
prefer this larger over ear model for
its fit it's just a little bit more
comfortable anyway that's it the
Sennheiser momentum wireless it's a
shame it cost five hundred dollars but
hopefully that price will come down a
bit over time so more people will be
tempted to buy this excellent bluetooth
headphone it's great if you could afford
it I'm David Carr noise thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
