and this is the SE ki se 50 uy Oh for
this model number denotes the first 4k
TV we've tested at CNET yes this little
50-inch or is a 4k resolution TV that
means it has four times the pixel
resolution of a standard 1080p
television of course you'd expect that
to give a tremendously better picture
but at this screen size it really
doesn't I'll talk about that in a little
bit but first let's look at the external
design of the seiki the set is a very
minimalist around the edges it really
has a pretty thin bezel here there's
really not much to the design except for
this unfamiliar nameplate and a little
LED along the bottom here it's a glass
stand it doesn't swivel very basic
external design of course you look at it
from the side it has that characteristic
LED thinness so that's something in the
plus column the sets features are
extremely minimal the really only thing
to talk about besides 4k is 120 hertz
refresh rate that doesn't mean that this
TV has smoothing however unlike most
hundred 20 hertz sets you cannot turn on
or off that smoothing or soap opera
effect the set does have minimal picture
adjustments you can play around with a
couple of picture modes but as soon as
you change any of the settings it'll
default to a user mode from there you
can really only play with the most basic
settings such as contrast brightness etc
the remote itself similarly basic I was
a little confused by the many number of
buttons here especially for TV with this
simple of a feature set turns out a lot
of buttons are devoted to navigating USB
photos and music if you decide to use
that feature there's also a bunch for
the built-in tuner yes this TV does have
a tuner like every other television on
the market so it's not quite fully a
monitor but it does sort of behave like
a computer monitor right now the only 4k
content you can really get in your home
is computer-based so I think people
hooking a computer up to this TV will
get the best benefit for that extra high
resolution on the flip side as a regular
televisions performance wasn't that
great we'll go through those two right
now
first off with 4k content the company
did supply me with a little server
filled with a couple of 4k clips the
content wasn't really spectacular though
it wasn't the highest quality 4k content
I've seen looked a little bit soft yes
you could tell there was more
than with standard 1080p material but as
with all 4k I've seen you have to be
very close to appreciate that detail and
50-inch set math tells us you have to be
about three feet eight inches to about
seven and a half feet that range in
seating distance from the 50-inch TV to
actually appreciate the difference of
course the further way the more
difficult it is to appreciate and of
course with lower quality content you
can't see that difference that much so
all told the 4k benefit on this TV
really depends on how close you're
sitting of course when I did sit very
close I played a video game on this TV I
played a little bit of BioShock Infinite
look great on the computer with that
really high resolution at an extremely
high-end graphics card connected to this
TV and that really allowed the game to
pop of course if you have a lower-end
computer pushing that many pixels is
going to be extremely difficult so this
is reserved for the hardest core gamers
on PC of course other 4k content is
pretty much non-existent you're not
gonna be able to find any 4k blu-rays 4k
broadcasts or any other content right
now that's all a couple years down the
road of course with no 4k content that
means are going to be mostly watching
normal hi-def on this TV and it's really
not very good for its price point the
black levels are relatively light the TV
crushes shadow detail is also relatively
inaccurate color although that is the
brightest spot on this TV video
processing is very important because of
course TV has to scale 1080p and other
high-def content to fit the 4k pixels
that scaling was good but not great it
actually looked a little bit softer than
a comparable 1080p TV right next to it
so all told not the greatest picture
quality and again for this price point
you do expect pretty good picture
quality from 1080p because that's mainly
where you're going to be watching
despite that bare-bones feature set
there are plenty of inputs you get three
HDMI all of which can take 4k up to 30
Hertz there's also a VGA input for
computers again that can go up to 4k
resolution as well as a component video
input in a pair USB slots all told I
can't really recommend the sake a to a
lot of people unless you really really
want a 4k TV of course it is the
cheapest 4k TV on the market so it has
that going for it I'm David Katz minor
from seen it that's a quick look at say
k's inexpensive 4k TV the SE 50 uio for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
