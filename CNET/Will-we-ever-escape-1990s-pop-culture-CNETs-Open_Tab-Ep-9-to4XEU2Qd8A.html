on another edition of open tab I am Jeff
Bakalar I'm hanging out this week with
my first sidekick that I ever had on
this show you were the one Raj owner mr.
Roger Cheng from cnet news and runs our
East Coast Department thanks for being
here awesome to be here as always thanks
for being here and then we have our
intern extraordinaire mr. Jake roll how
are you doing I'm doing well thank your
having me back feeling good feeling very
looking good you look healthy as you
have been eating that's what I want to
hear we feed our interns with here in
turn you know we treat our interns well
only the finest with knowledge and
sustenance right right okay these fine
gentlemen are going to be helping me
discuss reminisce lament whatever you
want to label this sort of overwhelming
resurgence of 1990s pop culture that
we've been experiencing full blast
thousand miles an hour over the past I
don't know five six seven a decade years
that's going to be a lot of fun and the
overarching topic for today's show yeah
if you have a comment a question a thing
something you want to get off your chest
a limerick a haiku don't be bashful type
that in the comments section below
however you're watching the stuff and
Jake will see it will see it will
hopefully be able to talk to that so
make sure you participate up let's let's
talk about the the wrapping up of comic
com yes right comic-con ended a couple
weeks ago and the vibe that I got was
that gamma calm wasn't that cool yeah
right yeah did you guys is there any
like little bit of news that came out of
that thing that you were like oh least
they're making another that bunch of
trailers I mean look the biggest thing I
don't know if it was the biggest thing
was the biggest disappointment Navy was
a was Pokemon goat yes Pokemon go panel
they actually upgrade the panel to halt
age was the big
that's the biggest hole several thousand
people packed in there someone is spread
a rumor that they were gonna release a
legendary pokemon for those players
turned out the developers niantic went
on they weren't really a prepared they
just sort of gave some very big updates
to the game in all are some problems and
that was basically it they must have
been sweat like yeah imagine you're
backstage of the panel and there's 7,000
people they're all ready to eat whatever
it is you're going to serve yeah and
they're like oh no we only have like a
marginal update to this app people must
have flipped people must have lost their
you know why and in I've been to
comic-con a few times you are waiting in
line for hours yet for our lakes in
particular right been just an order that
amount of time just waiting for that
place so yeah yeah to bring in to bring
nothing virtually nothing it's just yeah
that is a bummer not great may that kind
of set the stage for comica the biggest
disclosure was that eventually be able
to trade your Pokemon with other player
oh that was worth the seven our way
thanks no niantic oh that really work
out of the best yeah its present it's uh
that's crazy unfortunately that's kind
of how it goes sometimes a comic con you
know I usually there's some sort of big
announcement or reveal and I think they
were spread out a little bit but nothing
really like rose to the top where at
least you know when you're not on the
ground in san diego and you get the sort
of ripple effect out wherever you are
something always services to the top
right but nothing really happened this
year where I was like oh man they're
making a live-action you know race or
that none of that no nothing blew me
away I'm a lot it really expected I
think the biggest surprise was Justice
League coming out with a trailer given
how early it is right only right right
and that it didn't completely suck for
well well lookie we'll see yeah I mean
well no what do kind of no feel like the
DC track record right right but not so
hot not that great no maybe you don't
want to turn that DC I get that first
Batman vs Superman trailer people went
bonkers over they did couldn't even see
it if you didn't go to the event we're
talking about it from month and how that
movie turned out I mean and now with the
Suicide Squad getting real
I am getting ripped I'm sorry I know
where we're going out of order here a
little bit of like come on did you have
any really high expedite eyes 2020 yeah
which is where I'm coming from but like
this trailer everything about this move
the Joker has a tattoo that says Joker
on yes kind of smacks you're trying a
little too hard everyone else is like
nah dude it's jared leto he's gonna rise
above that now no no he did that rise he
didn't rise at all not at all no no the
first the worst part is I think they
went and supposedly shot scenes to make
things a bit more comical after
realizing how dark Batman vs Superman
would but if you read those reviews like
none of them really speak to that man
apparently didn't help at all like it's
still pretty grim yeah and a little
nonsense a lot nonsensical right so I've
read reviews that call it like an
untangled hot mess like ooh that's rough
that's rough so the best thing that
happened to me selfishly at a comic con
is that our own Mike Sorrentino hooked
me up I was kind of okay so I was
freaking out over these limited edition
neca Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
figures that were based off the arcade
cabinet gay ass from the 90s let's bring
a photo up of what Mike got me so he got
me the set he got me the four turtles
you see here if you ever played that
arcade game they like heaven I don't
think it was office except maybe Jake as
he wasn't alive right you're right if
you weren't alive you literally did not
exist yet but that's fine and if you
look real close they like have the
button mappings of that is great detail
did a really really good job with this
thing and only the paintings even got
sort of that digital like the bit mark
yeah they did like is a pixelated sort
of finish on the optimism and they're
big they're like six inches it's oh yeah
I i I'm in a safe place here where I can
brag about this and people are like well
that's cool aside from when I told my
wife and she's like you should live here
anymore so I'm glad to be in a safe
place right that's nice
no I got appreciate that I look at a
little bit jealousy alright cool I could
get someone jealous off my Ninja Turtle
figures I'm in a good place um alright
we're going to move along a little bit i
want to talk a lot about you know we
started off with like the sort of
overwhelming sense of you know
supplication with all these 1990s
properties and we're kind of just going
to like blow through a bunch of things
here that are getting remade yeah having
some sort of reimagining reboot from
things that you know emanated from
nickelodeon in the 90s or cartoons on
network TV and then Andy's so let's kind
of just like roll through what we got
Brian feel free to just kind of start
rolling through this stuff and we'll
pick them off one at a time what do you
have here first is it okay so this is
the goose bumps that came out that came
in South which'll hi I didn't even
realize yeah I didn't actually know it's
so neither what happened with this one
it wasn't I saw it with some specialist
and oh you saw I saw at school some
friends and you know we're kind of into
the friend I'd you watch on that foot
Sarah but it wasn't anything special
with a more comical take on it and Jack
Black wasn't all that good huh yeah I
feel like this what might have been one
Jack like phoned in here perhaps I would
call it all right next up is this still
goosebumps oh no what do we have next
year let's let's keep running down the
line I like this because a lot of it
okay so hey arnold is Colonel down
excited about this so Jake super excited
about hey arnold i was a cartoon from
the late 90s and tell me what it was he
alive I don't want old was this dude
with a football-shaped head who preceded
Stewie for family guy he's the first
football shaped a cartoon character
pioneer a pioneer the original football
head right pioneer this time okay but he
was just like a kid they went to school
my got into trouble like had
misadventures and stuff anyway comment
on his football shaped head or know
someone come over to your name I
remember I feel like no Helga he'll call
those the one who said it was like all
with your head stupid yeah I should call
them football head yeah all right yeah
well what's crazy is like no one is ever
like
you should rise you doctor hey you guys
normal shades don't work like he lived
in like the the house like they like all
the different borders from everywhere
okay so there was like a very like crazy
kind of mesh together interesting i
wasn't a gigantic hey arnold fan but it
was it was like towards the end of my
nickelodeon career if you will alright
let's move along there's Helga clenching
a fist there what do we got next year
okay they're making a movie i 27 I mean
I'm sure right now breaking news
breakingnews are gonna meet his parents
yeah get under like the jelly what is he
like an orphan or so his parents like we
never really knew he was living with it
i think it was his grim yeah is the
grandfather and he was always country
supposedly the first car to do with that
yeah you look like a heavy topic that's
a right football heads and familial
issues a lot of different stuff got
really intense stuff all right ah next
up oh yeah we're looking at the you know
and this is this is a screen grab on the
left from x-men apocalypse and on the
right is the x-men 1990s cartoon which
is the best that is just the best okay
thanks man so good ever hello damn good
didn't it in and still play to land in
it dan it and it looks like church bells
put oh yeah really powerful stuff what a
great cartoon so we're just you know
referring to the fact that at least in
apostle about some of them get the
costume kinda got the nights I lost get
the costume that's very close to the car
what's the best 90's x-men costume on
the right there though I'll tell you
what it is I'll tell you whose it is I
know it is starts with a gene aunty I
gotta go with a gambit gambit bien look
at him yep he's basically a one-note
character but his costume is awesome and
he's just ready to go with a deck of
cards that dress up so good man you
think they'll ruin that too they'll
probably room said well that's in the
that's in the cars ya see what is a
giant 8am is not gonna know is that is
that whose wasn't yet canyon was playing
yet let's play gambit yeah gambit wasn't
that buff no so we'll see I left the
nigga comedy cuz he's actually pretty
funny guy just really not a great mutiny
I don't seems gambit I don't seem this
gambit real quick who would be a better
gambit don't see Brian brenell
because mart wasn't Ryan Reynolds well
he's Deadpool Deadpool man owns Deadpool
now but I feel like he was gambit in one
of those movies right no no he's good
what are the Taylor's I forget which one
was gambit in that Wolverine movie oh
right yes it's terrible yeah his accent
slipped in and out it was just not it
was not a good experiment sure anyone
could pull off a good camp at these days
no that's tough Cajun accent it's tough
yeah all right we'll let that want to
calculating one yeah what else we got in
the hopper here mr. bvg up on screen the
Power Rangers now look I am full
transparency was not a Power Rangers guy
yeah neither was i I watched some of it
I mean wasn't a huge fan I think the new
reboots a little disturbing the
especially the female suits with the
breasts what really just weird why where
else they gonna pull them they go they
don't really need them i mean that's
that's not really functional is it you
rest are marine that's weird right you
got a little socks on oh I think oh
you're saying they're exposed to much
all right interesting several people in
the comments just keep reading people
the power rangers yeah people love
powering will do what the power rangers
so like here's my thing about it right
power rangers that show was a mess right
right i was like a hot mess whether use
like a lot of middle earth and it looked
real bad well basically took footage
from a japanese show right yeah it's
real bad even like what was her name
what's the woman's the evil woman reader
alsa roof hey reza your good press that
I even remember that yeah all rights
reader repulsive that's pretty bad
really I just been bad like what's going
I said out those costumes for the most
part look pretty badass yeah yeah and
you're gonna tell me like oh now power
rangers isn't campy and laying like I
don't gotta show you come a very big
jump it's a big it is it's a dark gritty
reboot though like all of them are now
going through dark gritty reboots a big
dark I don't know alright themes like
it's gonna be a drunk when he does right
there's like hell happening behind them
I mean I think for a lot of people that
the appeal was the fact that it was
campy it was fun it was a hot mess
people like that exactly yeah p were
like oh this looks really bad there
like strings on everything there's like
really all but that's why we liked it
bashe yes I'm gonna keep that right yeah
by the really bad effects I was like
part of the charm like there was no way
kids might like I was maybe twelve
thirteen fourteen when that stuff came
out none of us were like oh the
production value super great on this is
why we love the show I wasn't like that
right oh there's a hot mess but like
it's it's like ironically fun yeah right
yeah give me a break with this new Power
Ranger stuff I'm sorry in the channel if
you really enjoy power rangers but i
hope that story sort of laid it all out
there for you what else we got i love
this game that we're playing so this is
trans oh this is a transformer so
explain this Roger this is something
yeah so yes even though it's an 80s
cartoon it's getting its own kind of
gritty reboot this just premiered
yesterday actually on go 90 exclusively
which first time anyway trivia first
time I actually use go 90s okay what is
gonna go 90 is the YouTube like mobile
video app from verizon although you can
get on any service on any phone okay uh
and transformers is one of their
exclusive shows oh this is a gritty
reboot its mix of CG and cartoon it uses
the essentially the plot from the ad
show so it skips over all that Michael
Bay mess and the show that I'm by
wearing my optimus prime sure as you
should be as you do on wednesdays
exactly if you're if you're big 80s
transformers fan this is supposed to be
the answer to although Michael Bay woes
you've had for the last few years you
and you've had them at a lot of years I
did endure there for a lot for a while
now so you have all had Michael they was
since the beginning since Michael Bay
was born bad way yeah Brian there was a
trailer for a certain Nickelodeon show
with a certain hidden temple can we play
that this is a legends of the hidden
temple was a game show on Nickelodeon in
the 90s or maybe early two thousand i
saw reruns of it when i was watching Oh
said everything we've have you heard of
double dare do you know double dare that
on a gas or whatever was ok getting
loading
and that was accurate a good that was
good i got daredevil day like Marc
summers yes and like all the physical
challenges yeah how did you watch double
dare like that I think your way Oh
English we're my brother watching number
double there I think I did or something
boy don't work summers its host a show
on Food Channel that's right the
unwrapped yeah so if you see the show
we're watching so now I do we know what
kind of functional reboot this will sir
I think it's a from Mike sorrentinos
post about it I believe it is a VR
experience gosh i'm not i hope it comes
back and i'll be cool like I kind of
caught the tail I know should we need to
see it like live so what I'm hearing is
that they're doing a sort of like linear
story telling about the game show like
they're using like the myth the mythos
of the games like that lure telling a
story which I mean all right I don't
know why they're like gay barracudas
coming I think I care enough about the
backstory aim showed up well if it's a
dr maybe I'll Karen yeah silver snakes
what else was there blue barracudas
silver snakes silver snake I want to say
wolves without meru the maroon monkeys I
orange monkeys you know I'm talking
about there right ah Begley you can buy
those shirts at like yeah I feel like
Kenya yeah like hot topic oh yeah it's
like one of those songs all never fly
nature yeah yes you'll never see it um
so this is this begs the question right
guys like is it too much are they are
they are they playing to our nostalgia
factor too much is it too much overkill
like we just saw ghostbusters we just
saw this is it is it too much to handle
now you know we've never lived through
this before we're like we're in our 30s
and you know sort of having things come
back around I don't know how do you feel
about it you know it's I'm fine with it
yes if it's getting me more or say
transformers or right actually I hard
presses see any of the route that's the
other reboots like really care about but
yeah I mean if it gets me somebody that
the classic shows I want it or i watch
the kid I mean
okay with that yeah that's that's fine
yeah i mean i feel it's so like for me
you know obviously the ninja turtle
stuff they were seeing right now I think
that kind of is that your bug me the
wrong yeah a little bit I don't know why
I mean I guess I know why I just didn't
feel like then you sure as I grew up
with but that's okay right maybe the mic
help Michael bathing soil stuff a little
bit as well I don't know uh you know
that that's just sort of something that
I have a problem there's a certain sort
of like I don't know legacy that you
have this memorized you have I'm totally
okay with new things yeah we're
definitely at the point where nothing is
sacred now right we sort of to accept
that right these reboots are all gonna
happen that whether or not you like got
no new ideas in Hollywood so you find it
is there a reboot though that if it did
happen you would you would just lose it
um I'm a huge fan of animaniacs okay see
Animaniacs come back that's right you'd
be into that a lot of people in common
term presently that one also an even
match was a big poppa backhoe and dot
love their adventures man so I've heard
they so they recently reunited as a cast
I didn't know that man Real ID no no no
so they did a Q&amp;amp;A that's pretty cool
that's pretty I feel like I would really
be into a ren and stimpy everything I
know they tried to bring it back I want
to say they tried to do it maybe eight
years ago no wonder to that I know it's
on hulu town who that's good to know
there was some they were something like
so I don't know rough about that show I
remember when that when that cartoon was
on I just remember being like oh let's
Brian not for me no I mean right nor be
like that's graphic even for a part to
me yeah it was pretty intense yeah but I
was a fan was a really big fan what
about is there is there something sacred
that if they they redid you'd be like no
no this could never happen I'm kind of
like that with a bug ranch a little bit
you don't want them to bring about hell
once I enjoyed the ax really it was good
and like all grown up was like okay yeah
but like it wasn't anything yeah good
and like rugrat impaired
that was the movie yeah I was ok with
that like if it stays tube like and they
mix with like the wild thornberrys i
think it was i don't know that's what
we're gonna wrap it but i think that
show was like so good like it's like in
its prime back then sure yeah there's a
reason why i got and they tried to bring
it back and it didn't steal yeah i mean
i look at it like going back to the
transport i'm a huge transformers
finisher but I go back and watch those
cartoons that they're pretty terrible
yeah they're bred plot-wise they make no
sense you can see all kinds of weird
animation errors you can see where they
start cheap dad on on the effects and
just like what let's reuse that
background again I love it it no I mean
but that's why I'm like nothing's sacred
and I'm okay with these rubies recourse
yeah so I do think though if they if
they I realized back to the future will
get me oh did a hundred percent oh yeah
unless unless like the studio ownership
the crater still own the rights to it
for now so we should were sampling that
I kind of waited net to wait it out
basically for them basic it off I think
it's reasonable to assume it I believe
the two with the director and the writer
robert zemeckis Zemeckis and Bob Gale
Gale yeah I think are pretty adamant
against the reboot which is good on them
yeah we're not selling you know like we
don't like money you know on money stay
integrity I could respect integrity
totally I got to interview of not
Zemeckis um alan silvestri the composer
oh yeah and Bob Gale on back to the
future day actually was that last year
yeah and we can talk about stuff like
that but you could tell like they were
not over it do you know like they were
still very much into the fact that back
to the future is very much important and
a part of the zeitgeist they were there
they were still very psyched I would
still be living in a moment totally I
was part of that totally yeah alright
we're going to try something a little
new on today's show it's a little
different let us know if you like it or
not in the in the chat we're going to go
with something that falls in line with a
little bit of like hey it's five o'clock
somewhere sort of theme we're going to
present to you our weekly geekly
cocktail okay this week let's keep it in
line with an
materials we've concocted a ninja
turtles mutagen all right this is one
shot malibu rum one shot as Roger fills
up his glass one shot of melon liqueur
and one shot of pineapple juice shout
out to cocktail 365 on the blog spot for
the recipe they also have drink recipes
for each of our favorite superheroes so
in the all the ninja turtle so you
should check out their site we don't
have this here right now are the right
ingredients we're not the right

yes let's let's try it out and and let
us know what you think but just i like i
like the ingredients i like what that
drink looks like on paper but I don't
know green compression green drinks can
be either either right I tend to stick
with the brown was speaking of green
drinks ladies and gentlemen we had to
stay somewhat sober so except for me
yeah except for Roger who's about seven
deep right now so we wanted to have a
different green non-alcoholic drink and
we have one from the 90s right here it's
serg remember surge was a commercial

producers brian van Gelder's it's his
favorite drink from the 90s he got his
hand on this 1997 iconic can remember

on in this commercial Armageddon they're
like Armageddon have you been to the
street with the couches on it now you
gotta race across the couches to get
soda water to get the green juice anyway
I don't know what that was going on but
what is going on right now is we're
gonna try this alright well look at
least this one's relatively new because
it's still fizzed when it opened up

pop over to our live questions and
comments Jake what do you have for us
are people losing their minds over 90s
nostalgia in the comment section for us
chicken surge yeah not so much about
sherry desert yet but a lot of people
are really asking about 90 s a bunch
people asked us if we could talk about
you do what I do thank you oh that's
card game yeah everyone I remember you

question yeah it aired I remember it it
for me it ran kids WB because it be
block there was a card game that came
around so right after Pokemon there's a
pokemon i think digimon yo yugioh
there's also same family like shows that
they stole from japan a new purpose for
the American army like slap the Western
a sticker change all the names
translated everything I think excised
out any Content that was inappropriate
and it started selling stuff and it
worked
was popular films by underbar games from
the elements yeah yeah home interi
school are no arrest I don't know if
they're planning any kind of I don't

get back yeah I come back yeah I don't
maybe it still going on I don't know
does anything surprise you anymore now
what else are we are still actually
going on power what power rangers are
squirming right would it be like outside
of the reboot no I was like I'd like
this how our Rangers show like there's
some power range it's just 300 it like
still no no it's been running I don't
know if it's running now but it had been
right for like 20 years huh they
basically just take a show from Japan
repurpose it right and there's like a
