in the arm with a new slim model let's
take a look at some of the new features
this new addition is noticeably lighter
and slimmer than its predecessor but the
changes don't end there the most
significant change is at the screen
while keeping that same resolution has
been changed from an OLED to an LCD
panel it looks pretty good here but I
think we'll have to get it side-by-side
with an original Vita to really see if
that's an improvement or not also new is
one gigabyte of internal storage and the
Vita slim now charges via a micro USB
socket which is going to be really
useful if you have a lot of those cables
lying around
now the original Vita didn't have very
good battery life but this one should be
a little better sony says you can expect
up to 6 hours of gameplay it's coming
out in the UK on the 7th of February
butters of the time of making this video
we don't have a firm us release date yet
I wouldn't be surprised though if we get
one in the near future when it comes to
handhelds competition has never been
fiercer as well as fighting Nintendo's
3ds the Vita slim also has to contend
with the likes of the iPhone and Android
gaming something that might help is the
fact that it's going to be a little bit
cheaper so that might tempt people to
give it a shot
on the Westway PC net here with the new
PlayStation Vita slim</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
