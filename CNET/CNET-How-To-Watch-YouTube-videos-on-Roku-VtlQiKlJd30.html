channel in fact it seems like every time
a third-party Channel that streams
YouTube videos gets added Roku pulls it
well luckily there is a workaround for
this today I'll show you how to use a
set up called Tuan key which lets you
beam YouTube videos from this phone to
your Roku let's get started first you'll
need to do some setup on your Roku so to
do that head to a browser on your phone
or your computer and go to owner Roku
comm slash ad here you'll be asked to
add a private channel private channels
are basically beta channels that you
won't see available for download here
but you can still add them on the
website so over here go ahead and enter
my Tuan key and hit add Channel and
within a few minutes you should see the
Tuan ki Channel show up on your Roku now
that we have that set up we have a
little bit more to do on your phone so
go ahead and install the Tuan key beam
app for your iOS or Android device it's
totally free once you have it installed
you'll see a landing page full of video
sources that you can use to beam videos
to your Roku but today all we really
want is YouTube now the next thing we
have to do is connect your phone to your
Roku to do that make sure your phone is
connected to the same Wi-Fi network as
your Roku once that's set up go ahead
and swipe left from the home screen of
the app and you'll see what I call your
beam panel here's where we'll connect
your phone to the Roku hit display
device and then select Roku video player
now that everything's connected you're
ready to start beaming YouTube videos
from your phone to your Roku let's give
it a try so we'll go back to the home
screen and click YouTube you'll
basically be taken to YouTube's mobile
site here find the video you want to
play select it and within a few seconds
you should see a beam button overlaid on
the video hit that beam button and if
you did everything correctly
you should see that video buffering
on your Roku within a few seconds there
it is
now while the video is playing you can
swipe left again to view the beam panel
and you can pause or stop the video
right from this panel now if you want to
get fancy you have a couple other
options the first one is video quality
if your Roku is connected via ethernet
and you have a pretty good internet
connection you can beam your videos and
a higher quality to do that go to the
gear icon in the app select settings and
change the bandwidth quality to high
also check out the cue option you can
set up a whole list of videos that will
play one after another within the app so
swipe left to get the beam panel and
then click beam cue off to turn it on
now head to the videos you want to cue
up hit the beam button and it'll be
added to that list and when you're ready
to switch back to on-demand viewing hit
beam cue on to disable it so now that
you know how to watch YouTube videos on
your Roku also check out the other
channels that Twankey has to offer like
Vimeo Ted or Funny or Die granted some
of them are already available on roku
but you might find it easier to just
navigate and beam them from your phone
as always if you have any questions
