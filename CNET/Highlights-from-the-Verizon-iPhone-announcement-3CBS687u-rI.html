here in the room you're expecting a big
announcement today I don't think will
disappoint but I think it also proves
the old adage in the press if the press
writes something long enough and hard
enough eventually it comes true
collaboration between industry leaders
is the engine for progress and
innovation in the wireless market and
today we're bringing to market the fruit
of our strategic partner with another
giant of the high-tech industry and
that's Apple and today we are extremely
gratified and I can't think of a better
word to announce that early next month
the iPhone 4 will be part of the great
Verizon Wireless portfolio of products
and so I'm incredibly happy and I can
tell you all of Apple is very very
excited to bring the iPhone to Verizon's
93 million customers and new customers
who want to use the iPhone 4 on Verizon
we're incredibly pleased to give Verizon
customers the choice they've been
waiting for we've designed an iPhone 4
which connects to Verizon cdma/evdo
Network and it has all the features that
you would expect so now I bet you're
wondering when and and what is going to
happen next so let me give you a little
bit of background on this on February
the 3rd Verizon Wireless existing
customers are going to have an exclusive
opportunity to preorder the iPhone 4
online ahead of general availability one
week later on February 10th the iPhone 4
will launch to everyone at Verizon
Wireless online Verizon Wireless stores
as well as at Apple Store
an Apple online Verizon Wireless agents
in a matter of weeks will then be coming
on board and carrying the device as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
