Morris and it's time to get loaded Sony
is launching its own music service today
called Sony Music Unlimited a basic
level of service costs 399 per month and
gives you curated music channels a lot
like Pandora although you can skip or
fast-forward songs a premium tier costs
999 per month and lets you listen to
whatever music you want on whatever
device you want including ipad or iphone
so you don't have to own this music you
just call it up whenever you want it the
store launches today in the US Australia
and New Zealand meanwhile sony says it
has no plans to pull music from its
label from itunes you might want to pay
attention to news from the FBI today the
government agency is going to outline a
wiretapping policy that enables the FBI
to tap into digital communication like
email and social networking obviously
these are great tools if you're a crook
not so great if you're a crime fighter
the bureau calls this a going dark
problem it means illegal activity goes
on in places that they can't see the FBI
solution to this problem may include
intercepting and scrambling voice over
IP calls also worth noting and looking
into this story I found out that the FBI
has a weekly podcast did you know that
google announced google one pass a
subscription service that's a lot like
apple's subscription service which was
announced on tuesday google's one pass
is for newspapers and magazines to
channel their subscriptions and delivery
through google at the frequency and
price that the publisher sets while
Apple is keeping thirty percent of
revenue Google is only keeping 10
leaving ninety percent to the content
publishers it's powered by Google
Checkout so that's how readers will pay
I hate to do it but I think it's worth
reporting that there are new iphone
rumors circulating this time the rumor
is about a smaller iPhone that Apple may
be planning during its summer iPhone
refresh the chipmaker arm has indicated
that Apple may be planning a $99 iphone
that would be smaller and have fewer
features The Wall Street Journal
speculates this is because Apple feels
threatened by the prevalence of Android
which I don't really buy but those are
the rumors and a
the rumor mill only gets crazier this
time of year so get ready Warner
Brothers is trying something new the
studio is selling movies as apps this is
kind of interesting if you want to buy
the movie inception or the Dark Knight
you can buy it as an app on iPhone iPad
or iPod touch the app itself is free and
it has bonus features about the films
like trailers trivia soundtrack and more
but if you want to buy the actual
feature film you can do that within the
app through iTunes your iTunes account
will be charged and you won't have to
leave the app to watch the movie only
these two movies are available as apps
for now and they cost between nine
ninety nine and 11 99 and think twice
before you hack your playstation 3 Sony
issued a warning on Wednesday that
anyone caught hacking the ps3 will be
banned for life from Sony's online
services forever or at least as long as
you're using that digital ID and finally
more Facebook friends may mean more
anxiety in your life psychologists from
a university in Scotland found that
there is an inverse relationship between
number of facebook friends and contented
this they found that there is negative
effect of having too many Facebook
friends because of a pressure to stay in
touch and present yourself in a certain
light in your digital world they said
that Facebook can keep you in a kind of
quote neurotic limbo I could have told
you that that's your news of the day if
you want any more about our stories go
to cnet com / loaded I'll see you
tomorrow I'm Natali Morris for cnet and
you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
