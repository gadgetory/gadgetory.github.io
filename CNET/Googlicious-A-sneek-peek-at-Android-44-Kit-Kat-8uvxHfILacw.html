welcome to google isha's is everything
google that we could pack inside of a
show each week so let's get to the
hottest story and it's all about the
nexus 5 after a purported draft of the
LG service manual for the next Google
phone was posted online for all to see
now the 281 page document reveals the
overall device design it can also be
printed out if you want to do a coloring
project but most importantly it's all
about the specs and it's expected to
feature a 4.95 1080p IPS LCD display
with a Snapdragon 800 quad-core running
at 2.3 gigahertz 2 gigs of ram 32 gigs
of storage wireless charging an 8
megapixel rear camera hdmi output
there's conflicting info whether or not
it'll have bluetooth three or four point
oh now this could all be a hoax but if
it is it's a pretty good one and the
Nexus 5 is still the most anticipated
Android phone right now now if you're
looking for an Android 4.4 KitKat update
a few early build screenshots of
Google's mobile OS have been posted by
gadget helpline when it was still
internally known as key lime pie the
interface looks pretty similar and
that's a good thing there's the addition
of the Google Drive app animations are
reported to be smoother but most of the
changes are related to features like
enhancements to the photo editor subtle
tweaks to the dialer and payment and
printing options no data is available
yet but all signs are lining up for us
to see this with the release of the
Nexus 5 now back to phones and LG is
doing more after cnet's Roger Cheng
learn that LG is preparing a smartphone
with a curved display that will be
called the LG G flex perfect for this
guy now here's a sketch we received of
the phone that will not Bend but will be
curved from top to bottom LG recently
confirmed that they have started
production of the 6 inch curved phone
and it's slated to be introduced in
November but that is subject to change
and bigger continues to be better unless
your Apple leaked images of the HTC one
max show what appears to be a
fingerprint scanner on the back side
between the SIM card and camera images
of verizon's branding on the phone
leaked out as well and this is
gonna be another six inch bad boy
expected sometime this month all right
let's take a break and check out a
how-to for finding your loss to Android
device if you've been jealous of apples
Find My iPhone service you've probably
wondered why Google doesn't give android
owners the same thing well it took a few
years but that locator tool is finally
here the Android device manager lets you
find an android phone or tablet make it
ring and if you think it's in the hands
of a thief you can even remotely erase
it to show you how this works let's say
I lost this phone and I'm trying to find
it with this tablet first head on over
to google.com / android / device manager
and log in with the google account
associated with the device you're
looking for use the drop-down menu in
the white box to choose the device you
want to locate now if we look at my lost
phone we can see that the GPS is working
to find it back in the browser the blue
circle on the map shows you where your
devices it's not a precise location but
it's usually accurate within a few dozen
meters at this point you can make your
phone ring by clicking this button and
it'll sound off even if it's on silent
if you think your phone was stolen it's
probably a good idea to leave the
investigation to the police in the
meantime you can use this erase device
option to remotely wipe all the data for
this feature to work you'll have to set
it up on that device ahead of time head
to your phone or tablet then go to
Google settings Android device manager
and check this box just know that if you
are forced to use that erase device
option you completely lose access to it
meaning you can no longer locate it now
it's great that Google is finally giving
us this feature but it could use a
little help for starters you can't
remotely lock your phone so be sure to
set a secure lock screen pass code and
this probably goes without saying but
this feature only works when the phone
you're looking for is online and still
registered to your account thanks
Sheriff for that and now I know there
are a lot of you TV fans out there and
this is exciting for those of you who
don't have access to HBO or a buddy's
HBO Go log in HBO is making episode
it's popular series like girls newsroom
and my favorite game of thrones
available on the Google Play Store now
just get ready for the park in season 3
where everyone seen it's all the mom get
yeah it's seriously crazy episodes vary
from two to three dollars and nineteen
to twenty nine dollars for a full season
with more HBO content planning to roll
out in the next month now in the rumor
mills Samsung is allegedly developing
their own competitor for google glass
that may appear around April or May and
might be called gear glass see this is
why it's a rumor it's very flimsy but
with Samsung you know they can really do
anything so this isn't a surprise and if
you've been watching TV lately samsung
has released its treaty campaign for the
galaxy gear watch it ads in prime time
slots that also has a similar feel to
apple's ads campaign when they announced
the original iphone hello hello hello
hello hello but the biggest problem here
tecra viewers across the board don't
have good things to say about it in fact
you won't want one after reading them in
your better holding onto your 300 bucks
and let's end things on a positive note
this week with our own YouTube video of
the week this one comes to us from the
popular BuzzFeed channel in it's called
