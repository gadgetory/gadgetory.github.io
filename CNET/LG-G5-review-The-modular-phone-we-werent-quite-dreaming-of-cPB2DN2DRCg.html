completely remove and accessories that
attach back onto the device the LG g5
takes a stab at the modular fantasy
users have dreamt about for a long time
but if you want the handset solely for
this feature you may be disappointed
LG only has two add-ons that take
advantage of this capability a camera
grip and a digital to analog audio
converter with no plans to make more
though these accessories are fun the
phone's modularity is limited in this
narrow capacity and for the time being
LG will have to depend on third parties
to build out this feature even more but
the g5 is still a great device in and of
itself it has a USB type-c port a
fingerprint scanner and an always-on
display that will continuously display
the time date and any missed
notifications there are two cameras on
the back a standard 16 megapixel camera
and an 8 megapixel camera with a
wide-angle lens
the latter lets you capture more space
within a frame and LG included some
camera tools so you can have a little
fun with this
perhaps the handsets biggest draw
however is that it has a removable 2.8
ampere hour battery during our lab tests
for continuous video playback the phone
lasted an impressive 12 and a half hours
and if that doesn't satisfy you you can
still swap out an extra battery in the
middle of the day plus reselling it
comes easier if you can promise a fresh
battery inside the LG g5 isn't water
resistant like the Samsung Galaxy a7 nor
is it as powerful in terms of processing
speed and battery life the g5 also isn't
as cheap as say Google's flagship the
Nexus 6p with the g5 s unique modular
design however limited it is retains the
benefit of the replaceable battery for
many Android users not having this is a
deal-breaker so if it's important to you
the g5 should be your top choice it's
not the all-around best of the best but
it is the best Android phone right now
that still has this feature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
