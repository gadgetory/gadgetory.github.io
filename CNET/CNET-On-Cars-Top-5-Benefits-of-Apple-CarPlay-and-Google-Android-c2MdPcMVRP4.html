about to get a major new chapter or just
get made obsolete as apple carplay and
Google's Android auto start shipping in
some 2016 models and the aftermarket has
beaten car makers to the punch already
installing carplay and android auto
systems in the cars we already drive you
don't have to be a mobile tech nerd to
love this idea just a car owner who
wants to feel less pain while driving
I'm Brian Cooley with my top 5 reasons
at carplay and android auto are going to
be a blessing now these are my picks
based on spending a lot of time in a lot
of cars and try my patience with their
cabin tech and admittedly limited time
poking around car playing Android autos
and serve very very new don't screw this
up guys and make us both look bad here
we go number 5 dashboard distraction I
put this low because let's face it
screwing around with infotainment while
you drive is still screwing around with
infotainment while you drive no matter
who design it however Apple and
especially Google are expert at
predictive knowledge their systems are
built to try and know what you mean or
want before you're even done inputting
it nice on a phone critical in a car
number four lousy user interface car
makers are all over the road on their UI
what their screens and displays look
like all too often have a single thing
in common they look like hell Google and
especially Apple have a look and feel to
their platforms that holds together
across all screens and ideally across
third-party apps it creates some badly
needed consistency imagine if cars had a
gas pedal on the left and sometimes on
the right number three old media even
Apple the folks who invented iTunes
aren't so much in the mp3 game like they
used to be and neither they nor Google
were ever married to things like
satellite radio HD radio CDs they have
no problem quickly embracing the new and
dumping the old things like streaming
choices that come so fast car makers can
often just hope to be two generations
behind number two stale POS
your car's current navigation rig points
of interest seldom are they are instead
these stiff rigid outdated categories of
things that take longer to page through
than to drive to and almost never are
they aware of what you like it's mostly
collections of obvious things like
national chain locations or overly broad
categories like museums or cemeteries
yeah kill me move over and let live
search and my preferences and history
flourish in the - before I get you
number one some things that are
certainly beyond the ability of Apple
and Google to fix beyond infotainment
like complicated touchscreens for
temperature control why blind spot and
Lane Departure warnings that all sound
like the same bird chirping or absurd
180 miles pedometers that crush every
increment down so small you can't tell
you're doing 50 or 70 without taking out
a magnifying glass the number one thing
that Apple and Google can know must
improve in the dash is maddening
voicecrackboys commanding cars used to
be like magic until smartphones arrived
and showed us it's actually more like a
gallstone get out of the way car makers
there's no technology better proven you
shouldn't be involved in then voice
command dress add in the fact that voice
envelops most of what happens in the
dash and I can't wait to talk to Siri or
say ok Google behind the wheel more top
5 list - wait the car lover go to see
net on cars calm but on top 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
