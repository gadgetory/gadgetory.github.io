packed with high-end tech but don't
quite have the budget for flagship
phones then check out the affordable on
a 7 by qua way this 5.2 inch phone is
clad in metal which helps it both look
and feel like a satisfyingly premium
device the camford edges and drilled
speaker holes help add a touch of style
to the high-end feel isn't just skin
deep either as the honor 7 is packed
with some solid tech the display has a
full HD resolution which looks bright
and crisp
while it's 2.2 gigahertz octa-core
processor seems more than capable of
handling your everyday tasks it's
running on Android 5.0 lollipop with the
same emotion interface you'll see on
honours and hallways other phones I'm
not that keen on it as it has no app
tray which can make things look a little
cluttered on the back is a 20 megapixel
camera which is a very generous amount
of pixels for such an affordable phone
it can take some decent shots too and
has a range of nice slow shutter modes
which help you get a little bit creative
beneath the camera is a fingerprint
sensor which worked well in my hands-on
time the battery isn't removable but on
a reckons you can squeeze over two days
of regular use out of it which is a very
big claim of course your own times will
vary very much depending on how
demanding you are the owner 7 may not
have the cutting edge looks we've seen
on phones like the galaxy s6 edge but it
packs a solid lineup of specs into a
good-looking metal body and doesn't
charge anything like as much for it I'm
Andrew coil for CNET and this is the
honor 7 bike Huawei</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
