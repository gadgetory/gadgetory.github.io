tech onna me conference in lake tahoe
with venkatesh prasad who's a senior
technical leader at ford obviously
people don't always associate technology
in cars but that's really started to
shift you talk about the idea of the car
as platform what does that really mean
this is really fascinating for us the
car as a platform means you can now in
some sense make that available for all
the creative folks around the world to
create applications to bring value to
the car and we can stop looking at the
car as a an entity that brings sensors
and actuators together sat sensing Road
sensing the planet in some sense and and
really working with other cars networked
in many different ways the car really is
a component in a much larger system of
systems that ties into the roadway
system into other modalities of
transportation into cities into big
cities into cities that talk to other
cities so as you look at that you're
really looking for applications that get
the internet working for you while you
drive today the internet for the most
part doesn't work for you when you drive
we sort of hard a when you get to be
sort of weight to do something when you
get to be and this is really looking at
the platform is looking at the car as a
platform enables the internet to work
for you while you're on the road it
allows the creation of applications
through multiple source multiple teams
allows the mash-up of data that's
sitting in the car mashup of data is
sitting out in the clouds and and really
and the delivery of services to the
driver to the passengers so it's really
a way of making your journey more
productive more fun and really at the at
the end of it all more useful if you
work and how long is it going to be
before we all really have the internet
everywhere in our car mean we have our
phones which has the capacity to get to
the internet but right now as you say
that internet is usually off and it's
certainly not system-wide within the car
right so I've actually said this before
but you know the internet really has
been tuned 20 miles an hour what we want
to do is really tune the internet speeds
to driving speeds that process is just
beginning to have a we can now make
phone calls and place calls and get
calls safely but you can actually look
at a whole lot of services coming to you
services that really happen and take
care of getting more done while you
drive not getting you to do more as a
driver but really working for you so
well you get to your destination you
have a whole set of service that
really worked for you whether it's
finding the best restaurant and parking
associated with that or taking care of
reservations for four journeys elsewhere
or taking care of getting you some some
suggestions to how you might want to
modify your house and essentially
presenting that to you as a radio
station as a radio channel happening in
the cloud happening through the device
you bring in and really happening
through the presentation that's built
into the vehicle one of the notions that
we've heard of this conference is the
idea that the car should also be part of
the electrical grid you know shouldn't
cars be this storage of electricity that
when the grid needs it can give it back
what is what do you think about that
notion well as really as I said the car
has a component in a much larger system
of systems and the system of systems
includes the energy system if you will
but energy gets created energy gets
stored distributor in the car is an
integral part of the whole big cyst
system of systems if you will so you
look at it in a very light sense this
video X that's happening there's extra V
that's happening where v is the vehicle
of curves and X could be anything it
could be the grid it could be a cell
phone it could be the cloud and all that
is really coming together with with
systemic architectures that are enabling
the mashup of data and the presentation
of data to you as the driver or you as
the passenger great well thank you so
much I look forward to talking more
venkatesh prasad who's the senior
technical leader at Ford I mean afraid
for cnet thank you much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
