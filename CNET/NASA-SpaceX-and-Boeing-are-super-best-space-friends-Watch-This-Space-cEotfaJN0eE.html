organizations joining forces to send
crew to the International Space Station
and hopefully fight crime like the
Superfriends but why doesn't have some
need Boeing and SpaceX anyway and in
these newfound partnerships who's gonna
make the friendship bracelets I'm Claire
Reilly welcome to watch this space from
the CNET studios in Sydney this is your
guide to everything on earth you need to
know about space and tonight we're
kicking off the new year with a look at
NASA's a bizarre love triangle
that's right NASA is teaming up with
Boeing and SpaceX to get to space faster
with a Commercial Crew program or CCP at
CCR there we go the CCP is NASA's
public-private partnership set up to
develop new spacecraft and launch
systems to send humans into low-earth
orbit and to the International Space
Station
it's NASA's equivalent of saying we've
been shooting humans into space for 50
years and we're pretty bloody sick of
paying for it all
but Commercial Crew program sounds a
little less spicy the idea is to
outsource work to make NASA space
program more cost-effective while making
sure it can still send crew to the ISS
it's like mom encouraging her feckless
teenage son to get a job at Burger King
sure NASA is happy to provide the
astronauts who work on the ISS but you
better believe it's not going to keep
driving them to work in the NASA station
wagon I mean Kobe your friend Elon just
got a car can't you get a ride with him
NASA is no stranger to working with
other companies to get its missions off
the proverbial and literal ground it's
worked with Lockheed Martin to develop
supersonic aircraft it's made a virtual
crew member with Xerox and it's even
signed an agreement with uber to explore
the future of urban air mobility which
is grown-up NASA talk for sweet merciful
crap flying cars but this time NASA is
trusting SpaceX and Boeing with its most
precious resource no.not moon money
astronauts All American astronauts
launching off All American soil ever
since a nasa wrapped up its space
shuttle program in 2011 the government
agency has had to rely on other
countries to get its astronauts into
space and that's fine until someone has
to go and tell the boss that one of
America's astronauts just
to abort a launch in Kazakhstan because
it's Russian made rocket was on the
fritz but last year's Soyuz launch aside
it's fair for NASA to watch some skin in
the game after all this is America's
Space Agency and murki is as America
does and so America done gone found a
way to launch its space Patriots from
the land of the free and home made
rockets or as I like to call them Yankee
tanks so in the famous words of the
samurai pizza cats theme song who do you
call when you want a pepperoni well if
by pepperoni you mean a viable human
transportation system to deliver
astronauts to the ISS then the answer is
Boeing and SpaceX speaking off let's
take a look at these two suitors vying
for NASA's attention it's like that
episode of Beverly Hills 90210 where
Dillon had to choose between Brenda and
Kelly Boeing is the Brenda a long time
stable partner with hundred years of
history therefore NASA through this
insanity Boeing's relationship with NASA
goes all the way back to the Apollo days
it built the first stage of the Saturn 5
rocket for the moon landing it makes
sense for NASA to choose Boeing they
know each other there's a connection but
then there's SpaceX the blond-haired
Tory Taylor of the private space
industry it's only just hit the scene
but it's got its eyes on NASA and since
their summer fling they're making waves
Kelly
I mean SpaceX has the looks it has the
money and just like the original Beverly
Hills an honor to honor it has a weird
eccentric brother who's determined to
borrow under the streets of LA to build
a secret underground tunnel network
that's super rich but this isn't nine oh
two one oh and these two companies don't
have to compete for NASA's attention
using monogrammed cupcakes they both
have roles to play
for its part Boeing is building a crew
space transportation capsule known as
the cst-100 Starliner according to
Boeing the Starliner can fit seven
passengers for missions to the ISS it
will carry up to four NASA sponsored
crew as well as time critical scientific
research which we all know is code for
new episodes of Game of Thrones the
reusable spacecraft can be used up to 10
times it can land on solid ground rather
than in the ocean and there are backup
controls inside for the pilot as well as
wireless internet not to be outdone
SpaceX calls in spacecraft the dragon
because Elon Musk
the crew dragon has a capsule for crew
with onboard controls as well as a trunk
which carries unpressurized cargo and
the spacecraft solar arrays the dragon
made history in 2012 when it became the
first privately owned spacecraft to send
cargo to the ISS but it's always been
designed for people - and even tourists
you can kind of see the tourist angle
when you read the SpaceX website which
describes dragons enjoyable ride for
Windows for earth views and I kid you
not an escape system that feels like a
ride at Disneyland but this is space not
Space Mountain and NASA wants to make
sure that these two companies have year
that actually works first they need to
conduct uncrewed test flights Boeing
calls this an orbital flight test while
SpaceX has dubbed its demo one from
there they'll test their systems for
safely aborting a launch before finally
running full test flights with crew on
board if all goes to plan they'll be
then certified to start missions to the
ISS not everything has gone well so far
boeing crew member eric boe had to be
replaced due to medical reasons and
SpaceX has faced a number of launch
delays but while Boeing's bow had to go
and the crew Dragon has been flaggin
things are still on track for this year
SpaceX is planning an uncrewed test
flight for February with Boeing slated
for March after crude test flights in
June NASA hopes to have its first
operational mission in August fingers
firmly crossed the hope is that by the
end of 2019 NASA will be transporting
astronauts just as Eisenhower intended
an american-made Yankee tanks fresh out
of Disneyland suppose that's why they
build them with Windows so the
astronauts can see it truly is a small
world after all all right that's it for
this week's edition of watch this space
we'll be back in two weeks but in the
meantime if you've enjoyed our broadcast

updates as they happen I'm Claire Reilly
for CNN goodnight and Godspeed I know
what I'm doing I think I would know if
there were too many references to
Beverly Hills 90210 can we talk about
how Elon Musk is essentially just Hank
Scorpio from The Simpsons like down to
the flamethrowers no it's fine though
the Soyuz is totally okay they didn't
have to plug a hole in it with their
thumb that is a problem in a space
program
so anyway they're having a party because
I think it's Kelly's dad has just gotten
out of jail and they reveal the whole
thing to brenda they go on a walk at the
time but it was such a drama I can't
believe that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
