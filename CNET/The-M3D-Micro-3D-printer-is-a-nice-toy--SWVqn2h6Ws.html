now it would not need a magnifier to see
it it's right in for me but it's indeed
very small in fact the smooth surface
seen compared with others now the micro
also have a small build size for example
this Queen right here is about as tall
an object you can build by the way this
took the printer three hours to make and
this fat King right here
nine hours so it's slow about as low as
other printer of a same technology
called fused filament fabrication now
the print quality is also that of this
technology you can always tell that this
is a 3d printed object and there's no
way I can make a convincing replica of
any part my body even this little thing
it's just too smooth and gorgeous anyhow
as for pre materials the printed use
standard film and come in spoiler like
this now you can hype the spool
underneath the pre platform or can have
it hang out the printer either way is 5
but the printer can only work with one
spool and attack I mean testing the
printer was easy to you but it can only
bring directly from a computer there's
no SD card or used to be slot and the
computer have to be connected to it the
entire tab of the print so if you bring
a large object make sure you cross your
finger and this is what happened when
the printer was disconnected Midway the
Queen has no hat so all things consider
this is a fun to use printer and the
fact that it costs only three hundred
and fifty dollars helps so if you want
to gingerly enter the world of 3d
printing this is a safe by just make
sure you have a low expectation which I
always do for example I bet that my
little finger now would have more
attention from you than this printer
that's to be expected
I'm Domo
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
