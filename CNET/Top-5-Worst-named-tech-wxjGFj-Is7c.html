is like finding a dot-com address the
good ones are all taken and I've got
proof
I'm Brian Cooley with the top 5 worst
named tech products part to the list has
actually grown since the last time we
did this number 5 is the Cisco seus it's
kind of clever in a cloyingly cute sort
of way that eventually makes you mad the
third or fourth time someone asks you oh
what's that you're caring and you have
to say it it's a tablet that is centered
around Cisco TelePresence get it see us
WebEx meetings and transformative
business software applications and
software management which sounds awfully
boring for something called see us
number four is George now if you're of a
certain age or familiar with rat-pack
slang you think I'm talking about your
bird in fact it's something considerably
bigger a really good iPod dock music
system from the also clumsily named
chestnut hill sound that's a company I'm
told that George was chosen because this
was their first product like Washington
was our first president clever no not
really
number three is the Casio oh is that G's
own gz1 gus' own I honestly don't know
and whatever I say I'm probably wrong
and it probably doesn't matter since
nobody's in the market for a phone that
looks like a GI Joe reject number two is
the Tivoli audio iê iê iê iê i and
i'm not kidding
these guys usually make some
nice-looking well named understated gear
this is not one of those our review
calls it attractive but that's back when
we had a blind guy doing audio reviews
and it has no bass or treble controls
Anglos for four hundred bucks that's how
they got the name number one is of
course quickster netflix overnight
debacle first of all why would you take
the slowest of your two video platforms
DVD and call it quickster second why
would you name a DVD video service
something which has no reference to
movies DVDs video television or your
existing globally known brand name and
third why would you not check first if
the Twitter account of the same name
isn't already owned by some dude who
uses a pot-smoking Elmo as his avatar
fail for more top fives like this if you
can stand them go to top 5 dot cnet.com
I'm Brian Cooley thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
