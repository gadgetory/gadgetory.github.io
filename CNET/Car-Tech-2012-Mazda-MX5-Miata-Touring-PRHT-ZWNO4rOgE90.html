Honda for cancelling the s2000 and not
the natural gas Civic but in the
meantime I've got Mazda to help me work
through my angst let's take a ride in
the 2012 Mazda Miata mx-5 power
retractable hardtop special edition
check the tech and catch our breath
they're army out on top of the stack
it's a power retractable hardtop special
edition here's how your spot of special
it's got black wheels and a black top
first time Mazda has ever done a
contrasting roof from the factory it's
got the chubby cheeks like all the
Miatas do like it's got a mouthful of
chestnuts for the winter that goofy
dopey-looking grin on the front overall
though nice tidy packaging the specials
are only available in two colors chick
car red and regrettable pearl white
can't win on either front there if you
know the story of how the Miata got
started you know why it's like it still
is an American motor journalist was
talking to the brass over at Mazda they
said what should we do next in terms of
an interesting car he said no one has
reinvigorated the ethic of the 1950s
British roadsters do that crazy talk
then that was before they sold a
bajillion of these look at the inside
still very simple not a whole lot
different than a 50s British roadster
except it runs all the time
the only partial concession to modernity
is this head unit and it's barely a
concession to modernity
you've got am/fm no HD radio sirius
satellite radio is an option for like
400 bucks aux jack is down here no USB
no ipod mil streaming Bluetooth in fact
even Bluetooth hands-free isn't on every
Miata but we have a high trim car so it
is little touches that make this guy
nice inside this is one of the firmest
Crispus gearboxes you'll ever drive I
love the real mechanical thumb wheel
switches for the seat heaters so they're
still on next time you get in that's
nice in the winter look at this a horn
button they don't do that anymore now in
true vintage form you can still get a
whole bunch of different trim levels
Amiata with a canvas top this is not one
of them we've got the perk the power
retractable hardtop and it's a great one
it goes back real tightly behind the
seats and it goes up and down in a
really speedy 14 seconds this is one of
the fastest tops of any kind in the
industry on a car that is rather
affordable and notice nothing gets in
the way of your trunk space when this
thing is up or down pretty good trick in
a small car and speaking of small here
is perhaps the strangest windbreak we've
seen in a convertible I don't think
that's possibly large enough to do
anything although it does make a nice
basket for drying oregano on the way
home from the grocery store now under
its diminutive hood the Mazda Miata has
got a pretty basic motor but it's a good
engine it's a 2 liter inline-4 basic
stuff no direct injection no turbos it's
got variable valve timing these days and
multi-port fuel injection not direct
injection but it gets the job done
167 horsepower 158 if you get the
automatic not sure what's going on there
but you're not gonna get the automatic
anyway because then I'll stop answering
your emails or speaking to you 140 foot
pounds of torque regardless of the
gearbox moves this 2500 pound you heard
me right little roadster up to 60 in
about 7 seconds or so while delivering
21:28 mpg
and she read a bunch of reviews in the
car magazines in places where they call
it a pure driving experience and it
sounds like a bunch of that BS the car
journalists right but it's true what's
happening in this car and you notice it
immediately is that you're not fettered
with a bunch of computers and software
and algorithms that are interpreting
your driving yes this cars got
electronics like many others lesser than
most but they get out of the way and the
car is very direct you wear it more than
you driving ok specifically this car has
no real torque until you get this thing
wound up a little it doesn't come alive
till about the high 3,000 range on the
tach not bad it's the kind of car it is
it's not godless but it's not a torquey
vehicle of course mounted 140
foot-pounds the rear end will come
around on you to some degree if you
don't know what you're doing because the
suspension is relatively unsophisticated
I'm on crap pavement here on some
decreasing radius turns that it's just
not a great place if you're just pushing
it too fast and not paying attention the
ride is unrefined it's not brutal but it
is unrefined you feel the road come
through the cars will build it doesn't
sound like it's coming apart but again
this is not the car you take on a 600
mile road trip nonetheless that's just
who you are you hear me talk about
responsive all the time this is one of
those it's a responsive vehicle that
doesn't mean powerful that doesn't mean
fast that means it's light and it does
what you think it's going to do when you
give it an input that is the rarest
thing in vehicles today thank god Mazda
still makes this thing comes on to
chicken out a long time ago on theirs
and we're now left with one that you can
afford ok the price at mx-5 miata
power retractable hardtop forget about
the special edition we're gonna make 450
of these contrasting ones you're not
going to get one of those but that's ok
you get a better choice of colors so go
for the touring retractable it's about
28 3 nicely equipped but you've got to
then step it up to the Grand Touring
1400 more to get the Bose audio leather
heated seats and you're all
so going to get automatic temperature
control sports suspension is 6:50
Bilstein shocks limited slip
differential and firmer all-around
automatic transmission 1,100 bucks we
talked about that you're not going to do
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
