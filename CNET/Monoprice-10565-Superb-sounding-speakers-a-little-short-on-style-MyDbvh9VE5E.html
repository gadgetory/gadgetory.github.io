going to take a quick look at the
monoprice 105 65 this is a new 5.1
speaker system from monoprice that's
currently selling for two hundred and
forty nine dollars you may remember that
earlier this year monoprice rolled out
another two hundred and fifty dollars
speaker system that was nearly identical
to the popular 400 dollar energy take
plastic speaker system so identical in
fact that there was a lawsuit and the
case was settled and the mono priced
speakers were discontinued well now
monoprice is back with the 105 65
speaker system and while it looks
somewhat different than the energies
it's still pretty similar the speakers
have the same sized woofers and tweeters
and both subwoofers have 200 watt amps
in a down firing eight inch woofer but
the speakers do look significantly
different the big difference is the
matte black finish which doesn't look
quite as nice although it is more
resistant to dust and fingerprints the
drivers themselves don't look quite
identical and the positioning of the
speaker Jackson bass ports on the back
are different as well
overall the monoprice speakers don't
look as stylish that have more of a
generic look while the energy system is
a little classier aside from looks these
speakers do sound different unlike mono
prices last system which sounded
identical to the energy system the big
surprise is that the mono price speakers
actually sounded better to our ears we
had resident audiophile Steve Guttenberg
give both systems a listen and while
they're very similar sounding overall he
thought the mono price system had
slightly deeper bass in more mid-range
and treble detail that's high praise
since the energy system has long been
our favourite sounding compact speaker
system for under $500 the mono price
speaker sounded great with both movies
and music delivering better Sonics than
even the best sound bar the other
surprises at the pricing difference
between the two systems isn't as drastic
as you might think for one the cost of
the mono price system doesn't include
shipping which can add over $40 to the
cost depending on where you live and to
the energy take classic speakers are
frequently discounted down to $350
sometimes even as low as $300 so if
you're willing
to wait for a deal the price difference
isn't that significant between the two
systems so ultimately it comes down to
what you personally care about the most
the mana price speaker sound a little
better but the energy system looks a
little better and it has a better
warranty the nice thing is no matter
which way you go you're getting a
fantastic value and great sounding
speakers I'm Matthew Muscovy ak and this
is the monoprice 105 65</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
