with CNET and for those of you who
really value small cameras with long
zoom lenses you'll want to consider the
Canon Powershot SX 500 is it's certainly
not pocketable but considering its 30x
zoom lens it's one of the smallest and
lightest options available with that
much range it's also well priced for a
camera with that feature it does come
with some sacrifice though since canon
used a slow ccd sensor and older image
processor instead of the high
sensitivity CMOS sensors and newer
processors found in its higher-end
models this means it's shooting
performance and low-light photo quality
isn't as good as those models and you
miss out on some features like 1080p
movie capture you do get 720p video
though as well as a lot of other
shooting options for those who like to
leave it in auto or those who like more
control there's no electronic viewfinder
but the 3-inch LCD is good and the grip
has this a nice notch in front so you
can hold on to it and to help you with
your framing when you're using the zoom
there's this button on the side of the
lens that shoots the lens back so you
can find your subject and then zooms
back in all in all not a bad package if
you're doing your shooting outdoors and
your subjects aren't moving too fast
I'm Josh Goldman and that's the Canon
Powershot SX 500 is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
