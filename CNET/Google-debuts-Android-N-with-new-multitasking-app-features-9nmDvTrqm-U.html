research is that over ninety-nine
percent of the time people only selected
app within the last seven so we decided
to simplify by automatically removing
apps in the list that you haven't used
in a while this then makes it much
easier to find the app that you're
looking for also based on popular demand
we finally added a clear all button at
the top yeah feels good but my absolute
favorite feature is something that we
call quick switch you can now flip to
the previous app you're in just by
double tapping the recents button from
anywhere you can think of it like a
simplified alt tab and it's amazingly
useful in so many situations for example
let's say I'm in a phone call I'm trying
to coordinate an event I can flip over
to the calendar app I was just in by
double tapping the reeses button at the
bottom right from there I can check my
schedule and then flip back to the
dialer by double tapping the recents
button again it's pretty cool now many
of you also asked for the ability to
display more than one app at the same
time so we've invested a lot of effort
in redesigning our window management
framework in n and we're introducing two
powerful new windowing modes in this
really split screen and
picture-in-picture split screen is
designed for tablets and phones and it's
really simple to use so for example
let's say I'm watching a video on huge
YouTube to learn how to make the best
nachos I can long tap on the resource
button to enter multi window and from
there launch something like Google keep
for example now I can update my shopping
list for ingredients while I'm watching
the video the second mode
picture-in-picture is designed for
Android TV and it's a great way to let
you keep watching something while you
perform another task for example let's
say I'm watching a live TV program on
retro gaming and they're talking about
pac-man and I want to see if I can
install and play the game myself I can
put the live content into picture and
picture mode to keep watching it and
then go ahead and perform a voice search
for pac-man this will then give me an
option to install the game from the
place
store all the same times watching the
contact it's pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
