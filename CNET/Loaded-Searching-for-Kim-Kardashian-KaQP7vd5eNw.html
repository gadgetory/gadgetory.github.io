Morris and it's time to get loaded
Google's new ebook store is coming soon
this is google editions the online
bookstore that was announced earlier
this year a Google spokesperson said
that it will launch sometime this month
it will compete with the likes of
amazon's kindle book store and apple's
ibookstore the key difference according
to google is that books will be
available everywhere there is a screen
basically the internet reading devices
and mobile phones yahoo released its top
search terms of 2010 they do this every
year in early december which i guess
means that the searches in december
don't really count the Gulf oil spill
was the top search followed by world cup
and then a lot of pop stars like Miley
Cyrus Kim Kardashian lady gaga justin
bieber and britney spears who used to
hold the number one spot but has since
fallen to number ten bings top search
terms were a little different Kim
Kardashian was the number one search
term followed by Sandra Bullock tiger
woods Lady Gaga and Barack Obama the
number ten term was a little odd it was
free just free free what I don't know
this season Santa can leave you a
voicemail a personalized voicemail if
you want this fill out the custom
content form on google voice it's sort
of like a mad lib style form so it will
say something like hi John your mom and
dad told me that you've been a good boy
this year and you want an ipad or
whatever which is very cute and playboy
has a way for you to save your adult
material in a safe place the new Playboy
hard drive the 250 gig hard drive comes
stocked with a digital version of every
issue of playboy since the magazine
launched in 1953 it costs three hundred
dollars and obviously has the playboy
logo on it so it won't be a big secret
what's on there those are your headlines
for today I will see you tomorrow I'm
Natali Morris for cnet.com and you've
just been loaded
