a look at Lenovo's updated
back-to-school line of traditional clam
shell laptops they've got some
interesting updates to some laptops it
may look pretty familiar we've got the
new series now we have the you 330 touch
and you 430 touch these are ultrabook
style laptops but now of course they
have touchscreens and more importantly
they've been updated to Intel's current
fourth generation processors also known
as well those are great for battery life
and then the 14-inch you can even add
Nvidia discrete graphics then we've got
the y for 10 that's a gaming laptop not
the first thing you think of when you
think of lenovo we've like earlier
versions of this laptop and this new one
again has the latest Intel processors
that's great but you can't get it with a
touchscreen which is a little bit of a
disappointment and finally Lenovo's S
series which are very inexpensive
systems that are still pretty decent
here we've got the s210 touch with which
is an 11 inch laptop that adds a touch
screen which is a great feature to find
on a lower cost laptop and there's also
the s400 that's a 14-inch with a
touchscreen that should also be fairly
inexpensive and even have AMD graphics
that catch with both of these systems is
they have the last generation intel cpus
not the new ones that we call as well
but for you know usually under five
hundred dollars i'd guess for both of
these that's not too bad at all i'm dan
ackerman with lenovo's updated back to
school laptop line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
