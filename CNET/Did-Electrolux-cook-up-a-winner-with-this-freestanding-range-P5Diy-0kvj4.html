today we're taking a look at
electrolux's freestanding 30 inch
electric oven the here we go he I 3 0 EF
3 5j s hope I said that right and this
is a free-standing range with a smooth
top electric cooktop and a 5.3 cubic
foot convection oven interior so it'll
circulate hot air using a fan and that
makes for more even and sometimes faster
cooking if you look at the burners
you'll see this fast boil burner on the
front right that'll amp up the wattage
to boil things more quickly you'll also
get this simmer burner and a warming
zone along with two other burners that
have adjustable sizes the other notable
marquee feature for this oven is the IQ
touch control panel sounds fancy all
that really means though is that you've
got a lot of buttons I'm not sure I
actually like that because that makes
for a really cluttered display if you
take a look at this it looks a little
like something you might see on the set
of Star Trek I don't know how to fly
that ship and I don't know how to use
this oven at first glance that said once
you find the buttons that you're looking
for and get used to this kind of wide
display you've got you do have a lot of
options you have convection baking and
broiling and convection roasting you can
do even a slow cook mode that sets the
oven to a low temperature for kind of
that crock-pot style of cooking
you'll also find this fast preheat mode
that will accelerate your preheat time
by 3 to 4 minutes in our tests and then
also this my favorite mode just punch in
a commonly used set of settings and hit
the heart it'll save that setting and
then you can get back to with one press
that's great if you have a recipe that
you make a lot but a lot of these
features they sound good they are
attractive when you hear them but then
when you actually play around with them
a bit they're just not that deep they
don't actually have much new
functionality it's nothing that you
can't do with another oven take a look
inside the oven here we'll see the
bright cobalt blue interior that's
pretty common on Electrolux ovens
although some competitors have that as
well LG Samsung there's also the
recessed baking element at the bottom
here that's hidden to the panel so you
can spill stuff and not get it right on
the coils you can also put some water in
there to run a nice steam cycle that
will help loosen up stains and clean it
and also there are these glide racks I
like these a lot they have ball bearing
mountings and glide in and out of the
oven with next to no resistance all the
Electrolux is a
lovin it performed well our test and the
food all tasted great we cooked a lot of
stuff in it but it's not an exceptional
oven it doesn't really set itself apart
with any unique features and at this
price point fifteen hundred and forty
nine dollars I think you sort of have to
start setting yourself apart we've seen
smart ovens at that price point
there are induction ovens and only cost
a couple hundred dollars more the
Samsung flex a duo can be split into two
cavities there are double ovens that
cost less than that so it's kind of a
high price point for something that's
pretty basic all things considered
I've seen it on sale at some places for
around $1,000 if you see it at that
price point maybe consider it but at
full price I don't think it's worth it
for seeing it I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
