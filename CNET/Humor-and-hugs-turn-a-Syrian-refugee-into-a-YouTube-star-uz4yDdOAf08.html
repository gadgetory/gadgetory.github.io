at the beginning and in the end we all
human and we are not allowed to hate
somebody just because he is coming from
another country facebook youtube it's
like somehow for me and from many and
others people as like the big door to to
say our manner you know what we are
thinking what we feel all the media
talking about us soon the TV on the
radio on the online news so they talk
about us but we don't have a chance to
talk so this way i use this internet
then i have my chance to talk about
myself it was just really great to hear
how powerful youtube in some of these
areas can be like we hear about it all
the time but to actually meet somebody
where YouTube and Facebook have made
such difference in his life was really
really interesting
