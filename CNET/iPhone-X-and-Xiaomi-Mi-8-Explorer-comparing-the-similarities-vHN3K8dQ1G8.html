phones but you've got to admit they look
a lot alike this is the Xiaomi me8
Explorer this is the iPhone 10 they both
have notches they both use gestures and
the camera module is on the back looks
similar too I'm gonna take you on a tour
of how they're the same and how they're
different the Xiaomi 8 Explorer is
clearly larger than the iPhone 10 with a
6 point 2 inch screen versus a 5.8 inch
screen but the two phones have similar
shapes they also both have notches with
almost identical proportions this is the
area that houses the front-facing camera
and other sensors you get a 20 megapixel
front-facing camera on the me8 explorer
and a 7 megapixel shooter on the iphone
10 but remember more megapixels don't
mean better pictures here's another
similarity between the two
the me 8 explorer has its own version of
the iPhone tens face ID which uses
infrared light to map your face
unfortunately shammies phone won't tie
into mobile payments it's just used for
unlocking but the me 8 explorer also has
a pressure-sensitive fingerprint reader
built into this screen a few other
phones have an in screen reader as well
but this is the first to require a bit
of pressure to unlock it let's check out
gesture navigation now just like on the
iPhone 10 you can swipe up to exit an
app and swipe and hold to see your
recent apps on the me8 explorer you can
also swipe down in the middle of the
screen to get to your quick access tools
and swipe inwards from either edge to go
back one step
Xiaomi will also add its own AI
assistant and an animated emoji like the
iPhones an emoji but only in later
updates all right time to flip over to
the back we immediately see two stacked
12 megapixel cameras in the same
position all the way over to the left
with the flash in between on both phones
this is a blatant design copy here but
then there's a completely different
panel on the me8 explorer that shows off
the components that you'd find in a
phone this is just decorative though
you're not literally looking into the me
8
unlike the iPhone 10 the me8 Explorer
has no wireless charging and no
waterproofing but it will cost the
equivalent of under $600 compared to the
iPhone 10 stratospheric thousand dollar
price
note that the me 8 Explorer is a special
edition of the me 8 we know it will sell
in China but we don't know yet if we'll
see it anywhere else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
