aps-c compact follows Fujifilm and Leica
into that odd pricing limbo between a
thousand and thirteen hundred dollars
while more people are buying enthusiast
compacts they're not so enthusiastic
about the price range
fujifilm unlike a both offer a
rangefinder like shooting experience for
the extra money but Nikon instead
delivers great photo quality in a
well-built compact body that's more like
a point-and-shoot than most enthusiast
compacts though it has a fixed focal
length 28 millimeter lens it extends and
contracts like a zoom that enables it to
have a built-in lens cover which is a
nice change from the other models and
they're extraneous lens caps it also
slows the camera down a bit though the
old metal body is nice and has a
substantial feel with a reasonable grip
aside from the two user setting slots on
the mode dial and a separate adjustment
dial plus the two programmable buttons
the rest of the camera operates like a
typical point-and-shoot the control dial
seems underutilized with no way to
program the navigation buttons for
direct access controls as you'd expect
it has a manual focus ring and it has a
pretty nice feel there's a magnification
window for focus assist but no peeking
like on the x100s performance is mixed
it has great shot to shot speed and fast
continuous shooting but the autofocus
system and lens are a little sluggish
just like the rest of its competitors
battery life is even more disappointing
though the real strength of the camera
is the photo quality thanks to a nice
sensor and lens photos come out sharp
metering and exposure systems are
consistent and the colors are accurate
and pleasing I like the camera it
produces great photos but it lacks the
extra Genesis a quad that I expect to
justify a price tag over $1000 and if
you're not a pixel peeper you may not
think it's worth a few hundred more than
something like the Sony rx100 I'm Lori
grinnin and this is the Nikon Coolpix
today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
