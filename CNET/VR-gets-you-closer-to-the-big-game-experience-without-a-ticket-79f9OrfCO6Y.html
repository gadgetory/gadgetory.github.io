a big screen but virtual reality or VR
could change that so fans aren't just
watching the action on the field they're
virtually in the middle of it I've never
seen anything like it I'm on the field
you know I'm right there with the
players virtual reality is making you
feel like you're somewhere where you
weren't you feel like you can reach out
and touch someone at the NFL experience
for Super Bowl 50 jaunt VR and next VR
gave many football fans their first
glimpse of NFL content in virtual
reality it's almost like being at the
game but you don't debate the ticket
price felt like I was on the sideline
well for VR it's the ticket that you
can't get you can't get down there on
the field you can't get in the locker
room with special headsets and
smartphones and screams the 3d view is
either 180 or 360 degrees when you move
your head you can see who and what's
around you vr is excellent for that kind
of behind the scenes in the huddle or
right there on the sidelines it's
perfect next VR has tested showing an
NFL game live in virtual reality there's
there's no technical limitation from us
doing it today we look forward to
working with the NFL those future VR
live streams could mean fans who can't
attend games could experience them at a
fraction of the price give you a
pay-per-view and alucard the
subscription virtual reality isn't just
for viewers several NFL teams including
the 49ers train with VR to cut down on
the physical hits on their players so to
try to replicate that action in
real-time VR is a good way to do it so
you know if we put our quarterback in
the pocket feeling pressure it's still
unclear when we'll be able to watch a
super bowl game in VR but we know there
are already some fans ready for it to be
a reality it was amazing in San
