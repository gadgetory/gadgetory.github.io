quite a thing to behold I mean these are
always flagships but this new one it's
like it found the table full of
technology at the Mercedes building and
gorged on all of it did they get it
right or did they just get it big let's
drive this 2014 s550 and check the tech
now first off this new S is bad news for
atheists it's proof there is a God
because they got rid of those crappy
looking faux pontoon fenders that made
the last car look like a Mazda 3 now
spotting a new s-class is easiest from
the front big deep aggressive grille
looks really hot to be honest and now
you've got an LED eyebrow above the
headlight as opposed to below on the
outgoing car so easy to pick one out of
a crowd speaking of those LEDs Mercedes
says this is the first car in production
that has no filament light bulbs at all
56 led's make up the headlights 35 make
up the tail lights and 300 are in the
cabin now this may be the first car
we've driven that totally askew is
anything but LCD displays everything is
communicated via these two twelve point
three inch 8-3 ratio
LCD panels now right off the bat look at
that map that is amazing this is proof
of a maximum technology that sometimes
things get faster enough or bigger
enough that they actually hit a limit
and they change every Road is there
every nuance of it and you really get a
sense of where you are and what roads
coming up next no other system really
pulls that together like this the bigger
issue is the tech stuff that is in here
there's a lot of it is scattered all
over the place particularly when you get
to media radio has your radio stations
and you have to go through this almost
sort of needless screen change to get to
them it's pretty but it takes time of my
eyes off the road then for your non
radio sources you go to media now a lot
of car companies segregate other sources
under media but I think for an all-new
design like this s-class they should
think more progressively and start
putting all media together in one place
but then when you want to get to your
internet media sources you go to yet
third menu which of course is your phone
and address book but also the internet
stuff which lives under here and under
that sub menu you find mercedes-benz
apps but there's also internet radio
under there and then there's a www thing
which is a browser but doesn't work when
you're driving a lot of familiar things
here Google local search Pio I downloads
weather traffic cameras is new in this
car you can get a look at where traffic
cameras are and look at them for the
road ahead
tuning radio I don't recall that being
in a bands interface before Yelp we've
seen before and of course gas stations
and movies a lot of what's on this
interface has to do with the seats you
can adjust the size of the backrest you
can adjust and position the lumbar same
thing with the shoulder region massage
has been in there for a long time but
now instead of just having levels of
intensity they've gone into like types
of massage you have a seat heating
balance control and thank goodness you
can reset the whole thing when you get
lost one of the things I've always hated
in Mercedes is this little vestigial
weird number keypad who has this anymore
they finally made it useful by turning
it into a touch pad the problem is it's
very vague the touch isn't well
calibrated as you can see I can easily
touch two stations or even more at a
time and of course whatever you're
listening to comes to a high-end audio
system in this car including a couple of
choices of burma ster audio systems
which suffer primarily from the
unfortunate coincidence that they look
at a glance just like a Budweiser logo i
had three passengers getting here and
say when did Bud get into car audio and
they weren't kidding it of course sounds
great I won't say it's less filling but
it definitely is one of those where I
have to wonder how much money can you
put into a car audio system before you
no longer hear it but basically see it I
would check this out
up here in the glovebox is a little
bottle of stink water this thing is a
perfume that will get injected into the
air conditioning and ventilation system
on demand there's a menu for this as
well the intensity of it the key to it
Mercedes says differently those little
four dollar would you get in the car
wash is this will not stain your
interior so once you turn it off it
dissipates and goes away they named all
the sense as moods including one called
free side mood that disturbingly sounds
like there will be a
I conceived in the backseat at some
point in the back of our s550 it's
relatively Spartan believe it or not
because we haven't got all the options
which could include these executive
top-up tables like you have in business
class screens that let you echo the
navigation screen like on an airplane
and of course all manner of additional
massage and heating and cooling but even
though we're kind of slumming it back
here there doesn't care got plenty of
room for him
dual panoramic sunroof back here but I
got to point this out it's actually
broken up and smaller than the one we
just had on a jet a wagon so it's not
bad but not the best back around these
seats and also all around the cabin
you've got this funky Club mood lighting
back here this kind of goes with the
whole perfume in the glovebox theme five
colours you can select from different
levels of intensity different levels of
absurdity
one day I want to be a Mercedes
mechanical only because they have the
most spacious offices underneath these
hoods that open perpendicular I love
that here we find a relatively normal
Mercedes story a twin-turbo v8 one turbo
on each bank 4.7 liter displacement
direct injection sophisticated variable
valve timing the output is 455
horsepower 516 foot-pounds of torque
great torque figure it's a v8 and
because it's got turbos on it zero to 60
for this 4,300 pounds sedan comes up in
a very quick 4.8 seconds one choice on
the gearbox 7-speed automatic a real
automatic not a dual clutch anything
like that
the mpg numbers on this guy are still
TBD as of our shoot today but we're
guessing eighteen thirty which will be
roughly twenty percent better on both
counts to the outgoing s-class with a
similar engine that's what we're saying
these promises anyway now self-parking
is something new in cars these days but
self-parking something this big in a
space we've set up this tight this
should be fun alright the little blue
icon tells me it's looking for parking
I'm looking for a white diamond
alongside it that says it's found a
space big enough to put this thing in
there it is put it in reverse
okay self parking and here we go this is
where you really appreciate active
parking not with a small car with a big
car that you're pretty sure you couldn't
park yourself at least not two times in
a row when we are really close to that
bumper ok time to cut in let's see how
it does
let's close that looks close coming back
I don't hear any curb rash feel like I'm
about to select Drive look at that hard
right
nibbling nibbling going to the front
here select reverse and let's mop up and
finish
very nice okay brick I'm gonna do is
come to a stop why start with a stop
because I want to see how this auto
start-stop technology has been refined
engine shuts down I did not detect that
if I wasn't watching the tach I wouldn't
have known it and the restart almost is
imperceptible quick and barely shaking
the car finally someone's getting starts
top done in a way that befits a car of
this refinement now these cars can be
equipped so they will actually self
drive up to the mid 30 mile-per-hour
range like in traffic they'll follow the
car in front they'll handle acceleration
braking and steering I'll be honest I
never really got it to work in my
driving with the car ditto goes for the
lane departure tech that was on and off
as well but my colleague Wayne
Cunningham says it worked out pretty
well for him combine that with the fact
this is a pre-production car and I'm
going to withhold judgment on both those
technologies till later this car does
two things really well first of all it
showcases an awful lot of Technology
most of which is not silly gimmickry
it's a good state of the art showcase
secondly it also takes the s-class brand
and I think makes it much more
progressive this doesn't feel like such
an old goats car anymore from the
interior design of the exterior design
to the fact that it has a lot of really
interesting technology that's pretty
much all well done
