today to talk about the parrot flower
power the parrot flower power is a smart
plant sensor you place this thing in the
soil next to your plant and it is going
to read moisture levels sunlight
fertilizer and temperature and it's
gonna send that data to your phone or
your iPad with a Bluetooth signal so
once this is up and running it's gonna
collect and track all the data and then
you will upload that data to the cloud
with the Bluetooth signal that it's
gonna send to your iPhone iPad whatever
then you can check on that data on the
device itself on the computer and
eventually the parrot system will show
you the data and give you
recommendations about how to care for
your plant the parrot actually makes a
great plant rescuer if you have an
expensive plant or a plant you care for
and you can't figure out what is wrong
with your plant the parrot is probably
gonna find it out for you it has a nice
extensive database that's very
searchable and you're gonna put the
plant in tell it what plant you have and
it's gonna find if any one of those four
parameters is off so if you're normally
pretty good at this but a plant is
stumping you the parrot for 59.99
is probably gonna be well worth it to
help you save the plan unfortunately the
fact that this device is bluetooth only
means it lacks a little bit in terms of
being a plant monitor the Bluetooth
range means you need to be standing next
to it with the app open on your device
in order to be able to get an update
with any data I kill plants sometimes
because I forget to water them I'm not
gonna remember to go check on it with my
app in terms of being a guardian of your
garden this thing lets you down because
it won't let you know without you taking
an active step if you're just looking to
monitor your garden and you just need
some help with recommendations and
it will do that but other things on the
market are gonna do it better for CNN
