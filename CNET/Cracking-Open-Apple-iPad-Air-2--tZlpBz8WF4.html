button and even a thinner profile the
iPad air 2 is a solid upgrade to last
year's model and as I'll show you it's
actually easier to open and has a few
surprises inside the case I'm buildin
Weiler and this is cracking open the
iPad air 2 is the same width and height
as last year's air but it's ever so
slightly thinner it also weighs a few
grams less but the difference really
isn't noticeable the air 2's Retina
display has the same resolution as last
year's model but it comes with the new
anti reflective coating and for the
first time the front panel and display
are actually laminated together which
will definitely come into play when we
crack this thing open
now along with the screen upgrades the
air 2 has Apple's new a 8 X processor
and m8 motion coprocessor it has better
FaceTime and iSight cameras 802 11 AC
Wi-Fi and finally a touch ID enabled
home button now given all this new
hardware I can't wait to see what's on
the inside so let's get cracking as with
last year's iPad air I use the heat gun
to loosen the adhesive that holds the
front panel to the aluminum case then
starting from the lower left corner I
used a series of thin tools to gently
pry the panel off be very careful around
the lower right corner there are several
ribbon cables here that connect the
front panel to the motherboard you'll
also need to take care not to insert
your tools too far into the case when
working along the left and right edges
doing so could damage the display
luckily however thanks to the air to's
new laminated display you no longer need
to remove the front glass panel and the
display screen as separate parts once
you disconnect its cables you can remove
the whole assembly as with last year's
air the battery is on the left the
motherboard on the right the cameras and
antennas along the top and speakers and
the Lightning connector at the bottom
now this is a Wi-Fi only model so it
lacks some of the components present in
the side
version now looking at the front panel
we can see the fuse display panel
the repositioned ribbon cables and the
touch ID enabled home button now
unfortunately the battery and most other
components including the motherboard and
their connector cables are glued to the
metal case now forcing them loose could
damage them and I want to put this back
together in working order not destroy it
so I'm going to end our cracking open
here that doesn't mean however that I
can't share a few interesting facts
about this iPad now for starters Apple
reduce the size of the battery from a
thirty two point nine watt hour unit in
last year's model to a twenty seven
point six watt hour unit in the air to
the fact that this tablet still has the
same 10 hour battery life illustrates
how much more efficient the new hardware
is now second the air 2 has two gigs of
RAM compared to the original ipad air's
one gig
now this along with the new a 8 X
processor gives the air to a true
performance boost and lastly and perhaps
most interestingly there's an NFC chip
hiding under the motherboards metal
shields the same one used on the iPhone
6 and iPhone 6 plus now the air 2 does
support Apple pay but not tap to pay at
the register so the existence of this
chip seems a little odd perhaps Apple
will enable tap to pay at a future date
with all its upgrades and a super-thin
case the air 2 is a solid upgrade to the
iPad line and Apple even made it a bit
easier to repair now for more
information on the iPad air 2 including
real world tests and pricing check out
