legal in California
uber is now picking up some passengers
in San Francisco using its fleet of
self-driving cars however there might be
a teeny-tiny problem
uber might be breaking the law by doing
this the California Department of Motor
Vehicles wrote a letter to burr saying
it is illegal for the company to operate
its self-driving vehicles on public
roads until it receives an autonomous
vehicle testing permit the letter
continued saying any action by uber to
continue the operation of vehicles
equipped with autonomous technology on
public streets in California must cease
apparently the California DMV had
already warned Ober about the permit
issue a month ago
uber does not agree with the DMV the
company wrote its position in a blog
post
uber says it looked into the permit
issue and does not believe the company
requires one uber says California's
rules apply to cars that can drive
without someone controlling them and its
cars are not ready to drive without a
person behind the wheel
20 other companies working on
self-driving vehicles have received
permits from the state including Tesla
GM and Google the California DMV letter
also says that if uber does not confirm
immediately that it will stop its launch
and seek a testing permit DMV will
initiate legal action for more
