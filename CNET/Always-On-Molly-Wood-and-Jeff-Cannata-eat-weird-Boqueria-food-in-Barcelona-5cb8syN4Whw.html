it's beautifully like color
arguing about the color was it tastes
like
um
it's a little tartar than I would expect
it to me but the flavor is not very
strong at all kind of like a little bit
it's like a strawberry kind of like a
strawberry you want to try one of these

gonna try something here and now you try
this

least gonna eat the taya this is a
hardon this is like a serious business
well you're right it's very mild

found like that better than your
calcified churro I can't say I've ever
had anything quite like it you're right
it is sort of the consistency of a beat
not not fan no different than the churro
that you would get it Disneyland I like
