the sequel to one of my favorite systems
from last year that is the lenovo
horizon this is the horizon 2 it is part
of what i think is a very exciting new
category that we generally call tabletop
pcs so the big 27 inch almost a mega
tablet I've got it on this optional
rolling cart right here and you can take
it and tip it down like this and then
that launches this custom interface that
lenovo has that lets you manipulate
things with your hand you can do a lot
of like kind of circular movements like
this i have some apps here i can go into
my photos and flip them around and i can
pull them out and do things with them
and then i could send them away when i'm
done and of course you have games very
important for any kind of tabletop pc is
to have games and then when you have
games the first thing you ever want to
do is play like air hockey everybody
does that so you can flip it up like
this and they actually give you a couple
of paddles and you can air hockey your
way around and we've had fun with pretty
much every table top PC we've ever
tested by doing exactly that this new
version besides being a little bit
thinner and lighter has a higher
resolution screen it's a 2560 x 1440
which is better than the 1080p and last
year's and definitely more appropriate
for a big 27 inch monitor like this so
you don't need the rolling cart like
this it's got a kickstand you can stand
it up on your table or just lie it down
flat on your coffee table on your
ottoman anything like that start at 1499
and should be out later this year at CES
2014 i'm dan ackerman with the lenovo
horizon 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
