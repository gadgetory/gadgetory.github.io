taking pictures more with their cell
phones these days there's actually a
boom of cool new cameras coming out
right now and some of the most
interesting ones fill the gap between
full-on professional DSLR and the
portability of a point-and-shoot so if
you're ready to graduate from Instagram
or maybe you've already got a DSLR and
want something a little more agile these
are the five cameras you're looking for
compact cameras for advanced shooters
hand selected by CNET senior camera
editor Lori grunion starting off at
number five the sony cybershot DSC RX
one now it may be number five on this
list but it's actually the number one
camera here in terms of photo quality
you get a full-frame professional grade
sensor and a stunning carl zeiss 35
millimeter lens now there's no optical
viewfinder but that's not why it's at
the bottom of this list so what's the
catch how about a $2,600 price tag you
can spend the same amount on nice DSLR
with a lot more shooting flexibility but
if what you really want is something
compact that doesn't sacrifice an inch
on image quality then this is the camera
for you number four comes down to earth
a bit
it's the fujifilm x100t n-- hundred
dollars this retro-styled compact packs
a great viewfinder and works well under
manual control you're dealing with a
slightly smaller aps-c sensor and the
lens is a little quirky and the
autofocus isn't the best but the overall
image quality is beautiful plus it's a
hip looking camera it's like a mustache
and a beer cozy away from moving to
Brooklyn at number three the canon
powershot g 15 finally a camera that
won't bankrupt me it's also the last
camera on this list that you'll see with
an optical viewfinder so that's a
must-have feature and you don't have a
gram to drop the G 15 is your best bet
now the image quality isn't quite the
same as the last two cameras but the
lens is very fast and you can tease out
some extra detail by shooting in RAW
it's not the hippest looking thing but
come on Who am I fooling I don't even
have any tattoos
tramp stamps don't count forget I said
anything save even more cash with number
two the canon powershot s110 at around
$400 it's really just a glorified
point-and-shoot but it's good enough to
get an out of respect from serious photo
nerds it's also two generations removed
from my favorite pocket camera the canon
s 95 which I managed to lose this year
and still cry for everyday like the s 95
and the s 100 the s 110 offers a lot of
manual control and will even shoot in
RAW if you want to squeeze it for all
it's got no viewfinder and the
touchscreen is a little bit more trouble
than it's worth
but it's small enough to fit in any
pocket and small enough to lose but if
you had to choose just one camera they
hit all the high notes on this list fast
lens affordable price manual control raw
image capture and a pocket-sized design
you'd arrive right here at number one
the sony cybershot DSC rx100 fast bright
carl zeiss lens
big old 20 megapixel sensor adjustment
ring right on the lens not the cheapest
at $650 but worth every penny this is
the pocket point-and-shoot that puts all
the rest to shame so there you have it
five great cameras that will fill the
void between your cell phone camera and
a full-blown DSLR for a few other
recommendations check out senior editor
