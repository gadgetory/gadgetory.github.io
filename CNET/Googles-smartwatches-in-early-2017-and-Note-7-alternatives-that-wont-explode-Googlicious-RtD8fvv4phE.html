Google issues for everything inside the
world of Google and unfortunately we
start off with one of the biggest fails
we've ever seen in consumer electronics
with the Samsung Galaxy Note seven now I
called it the best phone of 2016 and it
really was until you know things went
kaboom and then it went kablooey
again now Samsung has completely halted
production of the note 7 and they even
started shipping out note 7 return kits
last week that included gloves and we're
made of fireproof packaging
according to apt elegent there are still
over 1 million Galaxy Note sevens still
in use right now so if you're one of
those people please just give it up
because denial isn't just a river in
Egypt plus Sammy's making an effort to
persuade people to remain loyal to the
brand by offering a $100 credit for
anyone that is exchanging their device
for another Samsung phone now people who
exchange it at a carrier store for a
different brand phone get a $25 credit
and they know this is as bad as it can
get but hey you know at least they're
trying now according to The Wall Street
Journal initial cost from the note 7
debacle have completely wiped Samsung's
2.3 billion dollars of projected mobile
profits for the quarter with the whole
bean as large as 3 billion dollars we've
talked in the past about Samsung's rush
to get out the note 7 to take advantage
of a lackluster iPhone released this
year except it literally blew up in
their face but what was really behind
this according to reports and breakdowns
the note sevens design exerted undue
pressure on its battery packs which in
turn resulted in the negative and
positive poles to come into contact and
voila the smoke you know where there's
smoke there's fire plus Samsung SDI
batteries proved to be too big for a
design that was trying to be as slim as
possible while also being waterproof
when they went for replacement batteries
from China's ATL the second time around
even that didn't fix the problem now the
note 7s design was also tightly sealed
not by screws but by glue that held it
all together so they couldn't even tell
customers to remove the battery because
it was glued down and I fixed it tear
down even
was taken apart was not an easy task so
so much for the best phone of 2016 but
what are some of the alternatives out
there for you right now well if you're a
Samsung person you can always get that
$100 back and go for an s7 edge it's the
easiest phone to transition to you won't
lose anything from a specs standpoint
but you'll miss the s-pen bigger screen
and USB see now this might seem like
you're going backwards but if you're all
about the s-pen the note 5 is the
closest thing to the note 7
functionality maybe Samsung even brings
a software upgrade to bring some of the
new features to the 5 but the Android
phone I'm most excited about is the
pixel and in this case we'll go large
with a pixel XL it's a great big screen
alternative with the pure Android nougat
and the Google assistant coming October
20th other great alternatives include
its Korean rival and the LG v20 that's a
spec beast with a 5.7 inch screen and a
removable battery to boast that's coming
out October 28th and the 1+3
is a feature-packed 5.5 inch AMOLED
display phone it's half the price at 399
and comes packed with a whopping 6 gigs
of RAM and you know if you're willing to
finally switch over to the fruity side
the iPhone 7 plus is another big screen
gem that deserves your attention if
you're fed up in you know ready to go
Apple or you can just wait for the
Samsung Galaxy s8
yep the rumors are already out there in
San mobile reports that we could see two
Galaxy s8 variants one is rumored to
feature a 2k 5.1 inch curved Super
AMOLED display while the other will have
a 5.5 inch 4k display it will come
equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 830
processor or Samsung's own Exynos 88-90
5 a dual camera lens system will be
exclusive to the larger screen phone and
the viv artificial-intelligence
assistant that samsung recently acquired
from viv labs will replace s voice the
guess is that we'll see it launched at
Mobile World Congress in February of
2017 which honestly isn't even that far
away and in Google News to do
commercials featuring the first made by
Google pixel phone have arrived
showing a search bar morph into the
shape of their new flagship phone the
phone is already completely sold out on
the Play Store except for the very
silver and quite black 5-inch models
with 32 gigs really blue sold out in
just a couple days which left some of
you really blue also the phones are
expected to ship October
20th and I have one coming my way and
taking a page from what they've learned
working on both hardware and software
Evan blast reports that the Google made
SmartWatch is running the next version
of Android 2.0 will be delayed into the
first quarter of 2017 there hasn't been
much news recently but two devices are
still in the works that support
swappable bands the slammer 42
millimeter watch codenamed swordfish
features a single button interface and
gets rid of the flat tire design now the
more advanced of the two watches
codenamed angelfish will feature LTE and
GPS and allow the watch to work as a
standalone device that does not require
a phone it also includes a heart rate
sensor and a three button design all
right that's going to do it for this
week you can always email me at Google
dishes at cnet.com or to me at brian tom
thanks for watching we'll catch y'all
next time for some more of that Google
