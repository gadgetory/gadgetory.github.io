running the latest version of Android
the Nexus 7 is the hottest thing going
in tablets right now and this how-to I'm
gonna share some tips on making it your
own first let's take a look at the home
screen by default Google fills the
screen with a mosaic of your most
recently played media I like it
personally but it might be a little
disorienting for a longtime Android
users if you don't like it delete it
it's just a widget and a tap and hold
will let you drag it into oblivion you
can fill the void with your favorite
apps and widgets by tapping the circle
above the home button and choosing from
your collection just tap hold and drag
what you want onto the homescreen a tap
and hold will also pull apps in and out
of the launcher down here at the bottom
and to get really pro drag one app onto
another on the home screen to create a
folder another quick customization you
can make is to change the wallpaper find
an empty spot on one of your home
screens and just hold your finger down
to see your wallpaper options here you
can choose a photo from your gallery you
can choose from the stock wallpapers
there's also a selection of live
wallpapers here which are really cool
and animate in the background to keep
people from snooping around on your
tablet when you're not there you should
make unlocking it a little more
difficult you can do this under the
security settings which you can quickly
get to by swiping down from the top and
hitting the little control panel up here
a passcode is gonna be the most secure
option for you but a fun one to check
out is the face recognition unlock that
uses the front camera so now when you
wake up your tablet you just hold it up
in front of you and unlocks when it
recognizes your face you might be
thinking can't someone fool this by just
holding up a picture of me
well Google thought about that and they
included an option here to require an
eye blink to prove that you're alive now
while you're tweaking the settings here
are a few things you might want to
adjust or disable in order to really
squeeze the most out of your battery
life under settings turn off all the
location services to keep GPS from
sucking down power you can make a
dramatic improvement to battery life by
taking the screen brightness level down
under the display settings also know
that if you hold down the power button
for a few seconds you'll find
airplane mode for quickly shutting down
your wireless features one last
customization that I recommend is to
kick up the font size maybe I'm getting
old but the default size here seems too
small under the display settings you'll
find a font size option that can fix
that so there you go hopefully I've
shown you a few extra things you can
play with on your Nexus 7 tablet more
