toaster oven the answer is yes this is
the Panasonic flash Express toaster oven
it's so quirky and yet people who own it
have the type of gripping obsession you
don't often see for a kitchen appliance
I am in love the warm glow of this
little fella went on best toaster since
sliced bread happens yes I've actually
made hard-boiled eggs in this
successfully it's this cheery little box
who would think that actually making
toast or warming a pop-tart or warming a
pop-tart could bring so much excitement
the secret to the flash expresses
enthusiastic fan base is the unique way
it cooks food most toaster ovens rely on
heating elements this one it cooks your
food using a powerful light easy Big
Easy big fast as you can mix them up mix
them up pour them in the pan slide them
inside a man let them back down not that
oven with a light infrared light means
this oven preheats fast high-end saunas
and space heaters use the same
technology and the way it works on the
flash Express is similar the light heats
the quartz and ceramic elements to get
high consistent temperatures without
much waiting roasted vegetables some
Moore's and grilled cheese take no time
at all they cook evenly
crisp beautifully and because of that
infrared there's no lingering smell
afterward also that light it kind of
draws you in and Here I am staring at it
just to get this shot of course I got a
headache
anyway this thing is weird there's a
temperature control that looks like a
radio dial the timer that stops at
twenty five minutes the cord comes out
of the side kind of a bad design and
finally it has that very specific
hashbrown button
eventually a new version will come along
with more useful buttons or a modern
design that fits in with the rest of
your kitchen but even if a sequel does
arrive you can bet will still be loving
the original
it's a toaster oven
ah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
