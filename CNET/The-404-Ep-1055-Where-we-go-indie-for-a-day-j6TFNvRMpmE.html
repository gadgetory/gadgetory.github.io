and the trailers all set because we'll
run with that mostly at the top you
wanted you want to test it out make sure
it's a plan okay yes right now so make
sure we got good audio a new ways to
communicate okay you cognize okay if you
make full screen yep do that great oh
that looks great cool
all right in three two it's Wednesday
May 16 2012 you tune in to the 404 show
on Sina TV I'm Jeff Bakalar and I am
Justin you this is the show where we go
indie for a day just for a day in our
hearts we're very lucky to have on the
program today please Anne Heche oh and
James swear ski filmmakers from the new
film indie game the movie this is really
cool because obviously everyone who
listens to our show knows how passionate
I am about gaming and have two artists
here who share that same passion and
actually did something cool with it is a
treat for us so welcome to the program
thank you so much for being here today
well thanks for having us our pleasure
um I want to show the trailer to the to
the to the film because I just think
it's shot so beautifully and it's just
really a really good piece of art so
before we actually get right to the
trailer real quick tell us exactly what
this film is what it is about we'll run
the trailer and we'll get into some
business here cool yeah movie is a
future doc that james and i made about
independent game developers so we follow
game developers as they make and release
their games and we followed super meat
boy Fez and a little bit of braids and
so it's all about that creative journey
of making that thing and putting it out
there very cool so um you know it's it
gets pretty intense at times I want to
run the trailer real quick and we can
get into more about what these
developers with these independent
developers faced on a day to day basis
which sort of blew my mind let's check
out the trailer right now for indie game
the movie
I'm determined to make video games and I
make video games because I can I mean
it's the sum total of every expressive
medium of all times made interactive
like how is that not it's awesome my
whole career has been me trying to find
new ways to communicate with people
because I desperately want to
communicate with people but I don't want
the messy interaction of having to make
friends and talk to people because I
probably don't like them and it's not
just a game like it's I'm so closely
attached to it this is my identity it's
fence I'm guy making fast you know
that's that's about it you're making it
was about let me take my deepest flaws
and vulnerabilities and put them in the
game
I'm on the line me like my name my
career if this if this fails like I
don't think homeworking games again I
like in a concentration camp if
you can't get it just if you can't get
the work done then the past two years
are basically worth nothing no pressure
all you've been doing for four years is
look at this like this closely you can't
see anything else you don't even see the
mistakes in
alright very cool what an engaging
trailer it really makes you feel like
these guys are not just making games
they're sort of headed into battle it's
intense it's pretty intense um so how
did this get off the ground now I know
there's a lot of backstory this film was
funded primarily through Kickstarter how
does that press because we talked about
Kickstarter all the time we're sort of
fascinated by the whole idea of sort of
crowdsourcing funding for stuff how did
you guys get from hey we have this idea
to hey all right it's at Sundance now in
five words go yeah um it kind of we
ended up doing like a long time ago this
short little five minute documentary on
this one independent game designer Alec
Aloka and it was actually a documentary
for hire this little five minute
commercial piece and we thought it was
going to be like this little puff piece
you know just the guy made a game that's
cool sure and it had end up being kind
of the process of talking to him ended
up being just a lot more than that it
ended up being like about this guy who
the more and more he worked on this
project the more it kind of became like
this extension of them and this
reflection of them and it reflected
completely what he was going through
when making the game and it was just in
that was kind of like a new idea to us
the fact that games could be personal
and an expression of something and it's
not a new idea because that's been
around for a long time but a new idea to
us and then after that we kind of at the
same time we were going down to the
independent game summit at the game
developers conference San Francisco and
hearing all these stories just like Alex
from all these other guys about you know
basically just point everything you have
into your game sure and then putting it
out there see how people react to it and
just if we were always taken aback at
how crazy dramatic and stressful these
stories were and we're like well you
know if we can get that on film that
would be that would be compelling I
would love to see that documentary and
then we looked around and there were no
game design documentaries really they
were there like a couple on the internet
but nothing nothing really really big
which blew us away because you know
games are huge they're bigger than
movies they're bigger than music and
their tongue
documentaries on all those so we thought
you know this is a story that probably
should you know be told right now we're
start to be told as soon so we kind of
did like this short little test piece
with Edmund McMillen and Tommy roughness
of Super Meat Boy Fame and we went down
to santa cruz and kind of filmed a
five-minute peace with them for two
purposes one was to kind of like prove
to ourselves that you know there is a
movie like a proof of concept like hey
yeah yeah right exactly ND w two years
but yeah so we shot that that piece and
then that was the piece that we put on
kickstarter in may 2010 and we done like
a couple months of research and you know
had made this little like vertical slice
of what we thought the film could be and
it like exploded and we should mention a
kick start at this point was like it
wasn't like Kickstarter today all right
oh this is when Kickstarter was
underground this is over like before
like Tim Schafer and like the
million-dollar right objects no
absolutely because that really sort of
blue Kickstarter into the lime really
sort of completely lifted the veil on on
Kickstarter this was something that was
getting that sort of uh you know that
sort of ground swelling from the start
would you guys were able to do that way
before all that other you know
popularized ground swell in that like we
were asking for 15,000 which isn't a lot
of money to write documentary but we
ended up with 23 and he was just we got
funded in two days and it was this life
changing moment for us sure like we're
two people from Winnipeg making videos
and all of a sudden they're people all
around the world that like this idea
enough to give us money in advance like
that's crazy pretty crazy yeah yeah yeah
yeah and that kind of like set in motion
the next two years of our lives like we
actually thought we literally thought it
would take a year now which is just
silly and naive and it in we not only
that we thought we could even like knock
off a corporate gig or commercial gig to
help fund the thing like in this year
and now it was like it's been
twenty-four seven Indiana movie since
that day in May 2010 and yeah and then
the Kickstarter just kind of took off
and we thought it would take about 30
days to get our goal it took 48 hours
and then it kind of just kept on going
and it was like this overwhelming kind
of surge of validation and people saying
like yes
please make make this thing like please
tell this story absolutely and yeah it's
been great yeah I mean that the three
again the three games that are profile
their Fez which just came out braid
which really sort of brought you know I
I feel like there's certain games that
sort of become milestones for a certain
genre or movement you look at something
like braid that just took everybody by
storm so the developer of that game
Jonathan Blow you guys sort of feature
him as maybe like the grandfather of
this movement throughout the film and
yeah I mean in it obviously he he i was
10 haina yeah for sure and and that's
the thing like he's still a young dude
and at the same time he's regarded as
this like overseeing you know authority
figure on the entire in dijon row are
sort of giving inside throughout the
film that's peppered through the stories
of love of edmund and and tommy and um
and what Phil of who I just lost my mind
over and we'll get to him in a second
sort of gives John sort of gives insight
as to what these guys are going through
and I found that the film really you
know there's a big debate whether or not
games are art right that's always that
always comes up because Newsweek or the
wall street journal or the New York
Times will do a piece on that and you
know some authority figure who reviews
movies will say oh they're not they're
not art how could that be and I feel
like this is the film that basically is
like look if you don't think games are
already after watching this what is
wrong with you is was that sort of like
an underlying theme that you guys were
happy that was was told yeah kind of
like is but we don't really say games
aren't ever in the phone cheering
address right oh it's definitely not
even mentioned directly but yeah we just
we thought let's just show the process
yeah and to ask you know they're like
any other creator like like what they go
through in the thumbs very similar to
what we went through to make this movie
exactly um yeah like I think it was kind
of like our goal to make something that
you know when people like leave the
theater and if someone happened to say
hey by the way do you think gave her art
they would kind of think back to the
movie and say well you know they went
through all this and I poured so
much of their heart and soul into this
game
then there's all the technicals yeah and
they are in the artistry that actually
goes into making it that you can't draw
any other conclusion but like yeah these
guys were making art yeah that's yeah
but we never wanted to like make a games
our art film sure we wanted to make a
well I guess games art film because look
at it thank you that that and no I mean
it's an it's only a logical sort of
thing to draw from it you watch these
guys put their heart and soul and
literally their lives into these games
and you're sort of like oh my god why
are they doing this to themselves you
know these dudes are in there in it I
mean they go through some really intense
stuff at some point it seems painful you
know they they haven't slept they seem
almost malnourished they just really are
putting every last ounce of their life
force into into what they're creating
and to see them you know maybe not
straightforwardly admit that yes these
games are representations of who they
are themselves you can just tell that
you know the amount of effort that
they're putting in what other conclusion
can you draw from something like that so
i think that the film does a really good
job at sort of examining that and
portraying that arm what's something
that I that blew me away specific and
almost all of the developers echo this
sort of sentiment at some point in the
film was that they would die if they
didn't get this game done I know I know
Tommy says it out right he's like look I
will kill myself if I don't get this
film it if I don't get this a game made
what like what is that you know you guys
are sort of watching this developed
before your eyes and you're sort of
piecing together this story that's
unfolding what did that mean to you guys
when I mean obviously I think you guys
can relate maybe not about the suicide
aspect of it but what did you think of
that as it was unfolding in front here
there is just this intensity about it
you know and I think a lot of people go
through this when they're working on a
project that's like 20 to 25 years long
and they've invested everything they
have sure and if they don't if it
doesn't pull through their screwed right
so but it's bizarre to be on the other
side of the camera
and here somebody so focused and so you
know so stressed that they get to a
point where they're like it would just
be easier to die than just to finish
this yeah just cuz yeah like you make
this game and it's your one year to year
three and every day and making this game
you get up you get up like 10 a.m. or
11am or whenever you get up and then you
shuffle over to the computer and you
spend like 14 hours if it's sure i was
there and then you go back to bed and
then you do the same thing over and over
and over again and if you've been doing
that for like 18 months or two years or
three years like that game that defines
you that process defines you and
everything about that defines you and
then once that game gets threatened or
the process looks like it might not work
out you're left with nothing you're left
with nothing but the or like in your
mind at that time in that crazy man in
the crate yep in the craziness you're
left with the idea that like if this
doesn't happen I've I'm just wasted
three years of my life right and and so
much effort so much energy and I've
could have devoted it something else and
it's scary you know for sure they scary
and that definitely comes through I mean
there's a lot on the line um we'll talk
more about the the passion that some of
these i call them characters in your
film but they're real life people will
get to that specifically phil fish the
the guy behind fez which is I think the
most one of the most entertaining people
that I think unintentionally
entertaining as a better way to put it
we'll talk more about that right after
this break stick around there's a lot
more for for after this this is the 404
mr effers the show where we all sing
song
you
welcome back to the 404 we've got two
fantastic guests on the program the
filmmakers behind the movie indie game
the movie lizanne and James are here
with us so happy you guys are here we're
having a lot of fun with you finding
about what the what people go through in
developing independent games and you
know I think when you mirror the game
industry to the film industry you guys
sort of walk a fine line it feels like
with with the subject matter that you're
dealing with you know a lot of people
say oh you know indie movies really
aren't in d it's just a you know the
biggest example I always give people's
Warner Brothers independent like is that
not a big oxymoron in itself yeah you
look at these independent games I mean
these are two dudes in someone's bedroom
you know these are two dudes who really
are you know scraping for whatever they
can would what do you do you think
there's a big misconception in terms of
what indie gamers are defined as or
indie developers are defined us from
film to two games Oh probably I think
you could probably get a lot more done
like a like independently like as as a
video game artist you know but you know
there seems to be you need to depend on
so many of the people in the crew needs
to be so much bigger right distribution
is just much more you know has made more
gatekeepers in film and it does in video
games although that does seem to be
changing sure but like I think you have
probably more power more latitude to be
independent as a video game designer I
think like completely independent
because all you really need is you know
your ideas your computer in your
software and you can you know put it up
that's it that's it yeah it's like look
at minecraft minecraft is just two guys
or one guy one guy yeah and it's growing
10 yeah and just in Sweden and like a
hundred million it's amazing it's a it's
absolutely amazing um let's talk a
little about phil fish who is behind the
game fez you guys told me an interesting
story about him and what he went through
with his ex partner at their sort of a
development company there was a lot of
legality issues there was a lot
the stuff that was going to prevent um
Phil from showing the game at PAX East I
mean there are some scenes where he
looks like he's just gonna freak out I
mean how much of that what were you guys
thinking during that whole process
because when I was watching it I was
like oh wow there might be a murder
dhaka documented in this film as well
well what was that like I think like we
we showed up in Boston for pax there's
our first time at pax yeah and phil was
staying at like this fancy boston hotel
the langham and we got a room there too
because he was staying there and so we
got this expensive room and we walked
over and we're like okay so you're gonna
get ready to you know get ready and get
the game ready for pax he's like oh no
you may not show it and our reaction was
 yeah we have this exception hotel
you have to show it we're making a film
here you this is part of the movie no no
and we yeah we just we didn't know
everything that was happening with him
yeah and when we showed up there was a
potential that he wouldn't have his
business stuff figured out mm-hmm and
yeah and it was just so stressful for
him because this is the first time he's
showing the game after four years of
development not showing anybody and you
know there was such a big disappointment
in a lot of waiting on his end yeah for
sure yeah and it just speaks at that
moment word like you're you're in the
moment and you are completely defined by
the game and and the game is threatened
at that point and you know you feel
threatened and it you you go you go a
little crazy yeah like knowledge is that
yeah he was in really stretch that's
like the most stressful time of his life
you can tell I mean it looked like he
was just ready to pull his hair out yet
he had his little like graduate moment
to you know and it was just sort of it
was very uh it was it was very telling
of what exactly he was going through
yeah yeah that's really his beard told
the story you know the wackier his beard
guy that directly related to hat what he
was going through in his mind yeah but
it's a really crazy story it's kind of
amazing that like he shared all that
yeah cuz he could have just told us to
screw off and be like you know what I'm
having a hard day here leave me alone
but he sees value in sharing the ups and
downs of what he went through which is
it's really amazing those a whole thesis
of the film kind of like in one of the
reasons why the developers
wanted to be in it because people don't
know they'd like they really have no
idea sure what goes into development and
how like crazy stressful that that can
be and you know like you can explain it
over and over again but you know it
still doesn't stick right like it's just
you know but seeing it hopefully can
kind of you know make it a little more
easy to understand and you know like for
the people that put thought into it like
I think a lot of people don't post on
until like how games made and that's
okay because it's a game just try it
yeah but but yeah yeah when you do not
many people know exactly how much of
these guys are in their games sure yeah
um if there was one thing you guys
really as filmmakers learned from this
whole process what do you think was the
big takeaway for you guys personally
above they'll make you know the or just
about the whole process what you you
know about you know the similarities
filmmaking and game development was
there like a big takeaway for you guys
personally that maybe is not so clear in
in the film itself there like a big
takeaway that you guys were like you
know what I don't know like like going
into it we knew that we were you know
aiming to capture like dramatic hard
stories sure and I think we were still
surprised at how dramatic and tough and
hard the stories were right um yeah but
think one thing like I I wasn't a big
gamer before we got into this I and I'm
not very familiar with coding or any
other process but what was particularly
interesting to me was like how personal
code could be we don't get into a lot of
that in the film but that we have you
know programmers talking on and on about
how the thought process of them you know
making the game is something personal
and his artistic to them which was
surprising to me because I just thought
it was just a bunch of like letters and
numbers and slashes I didn't realize it
was this whole like poetic thing for
that person like they could look at
their code and like know where they were
when they coded that and right you know
kind of like what phase in their life
they're going through they could look at
someone else's code and you know kind of
get an idea of their mentality amazing
what type be like Co matrix you know and
I love those ethically see what's going
on something that I just can't wrap my
head around for sure um chat room is
asking uh what games are you guys really
into I know
and you just said you're not a huge
gamer but are you James are you a gamer
yourself yeah you're playing right now
that you're yeah of is weird we're
making this movie and I haven't touched
a game in so long because I'm like one
of those guys we're like I like to play
one game right and I like to play a lot
of it and i'll lose my life to that game
for like a week or two weeks until like
I reach that kind of saturation point
where I just feel bad for playing it as
much as I do right but at last less game
that did that to me with binding of
isaac which is like related to the movie
cuz the Sharon melons latest game and
that that game had my number for a long
long time and it was uh yeah yeah it was
kind of like a roguelike and it's kind
of like this wonderful way to kind of
dip your toe into the water of
roguelikes sure and kind of get used to
it and in yeah yeah I loved it again
awesome very cool uh the gate the film
