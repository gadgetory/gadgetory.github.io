first look at the Epson XP 420
all-in-one printer so this printer
continues Epsons commitment to that
small in one branding that's Epsons way
of telling you that this is a compact
printer which is true it's a lot smaller
than most of the printers I've reviewed
it's definitely one of the smallest
all-in-one units at scene it's probably
more like the size of a plain single
function inkjet or laser printer and
it's pretty impressive that they were
able to cram so many features into it so
getting to those details this all-in-one
can scan and copy in addition to
printing but the cool part about it is
that you don't actually have to be
tethered to a computer to do those
things anymore thanks to epson's I print
mobile app you can connect through a
smart phone to print your photos
directly from a photo album or you can
use a number of cloud printing features
like Google Cloud Print or Apple air
print to output from a browser or an
iPhone basically Epson is relying on
these partnerships to get consumers used
to the idea that you don't necessarily
have to be next to a computer to print
something out so in addition to those
wireless features you can also just walk
right up to the printer and insert an SD
card from a digital camera or whatever
directly into this reader on the front
you can make light photo edits on this
LCD display then you can print them out
or even upload them to Facebook directly
through the UI so any printer is only as
good as the cost of the ink cartridges
you'll pay to keep it running so what
about those ink prices well Epson offers
extra large capacity cartridges for sale
in addition to bundles which keep costs
low and while those costs are about
average for what you're paying upfront
your mileage may vary according to what
you're printing out you can read more
details in my full review on CNET but
that's going to do it for me I'm Justin
you you just took a first look at the
Epson XP 420 inkjet printer thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
