extinct the good dinosaur tells that
very story set against the most detailed
landscapes ever seen in a Pixar film for
this film we had to be able to see 50
miles into the distance and the camera
had to be moving all the time following
the characters director Pete Sohn wanted
the set to be like another character in
the film so to make the landscapes as
authentic as possible
some were based on real-world locations
like Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park
using hype data from the United States
Geological Survey Pixar created a
virtual model of the environment using
special software add in all this extra
detail of rocks and debris and brush and
grass and and lots and lots of trees and
so we can see miles and miles into the
distance a real-world camera crew Scouts
locations to find the perfect shot Pixar
was able to do the same but virtually
the virtual camera that we use in the
computer we've actually tried to develop
to be essentially an exact duplicate of
a real-world cameras because it's in the
computer they can also break reality and
move the camera wherever they need to
for whatever kind of shot they need but
landscapes need characters to walk
through them like our the dinosaur he
looks cute and cuddly a deliberate
design choice so he stands out against
the environment we really tried to put
just enough realism into the set so that
he felt visceral and dangerous so that
when Arlo is walking through the world
that when you see him in danger that you
feel that danger because you're looking
at a landscape that looks natural and
that's how Pixar makes a good dinosaur
