Natali Morris and it's time to get
loaded windows phone 7 is going to get a
software update the first since the
phone launched in october the update
looked to be a general functional
improvement but microsoft says that it
paves the way for other goodies like cut
and paste and improved marketplace
search the update comes out in early
March there were a lot of apple rumors
coming down the pipeline over the
three-day weekend the first has to do
with the ipad of course experts are
claiming that the launch of ipad 2 is
delayed until june also two separate
patent filings show that the next
version may have a smart bezel allowing
you to perform functions along the
peripheral like you can with the
BlackBerry PlayBook the next rumor has
to do with a new high-speed connection
feature in the macbook pros the new pro
line of apple macbook is due for an
update any day now and it may have
something like Intel's light peak
technology which uses copper insides to
replace all the wireless wires inside of
your machine and finally rumours are
that Apple is working on a television
product other than Apple TV this is
based on a job listing it up also not a
lot to go on here toyota will start
selling electric car chargers in 2012
the company announced that it will put
these charging devices on the market
next year for owners of plug-in hybrid
cars to gas up overnight the Chargers
will be compatible with non toyota cars
too there will be two models one to be
kept on the exterior of your house and
another that's made for garage setup
movie pirates have a new enemy former
Democratic Senator Chris Dodd of
Connecticut he is reportedly about to
become the new chairman of the motion
picture association of america the mpaa
is obviously laser focused on stopping
film piracy at whatever cost in fact as
a senator dodd was supportive of a bill
that gave retroactive immunity to
telecoms that engaged in wiretapping
twitter shut down uber Twitter and
twitch droid for Android claiming that
both Twitter apps violated the company's
API policy the internet was pretty
outraged by this because third-party
clients are largely responsible for
boosting Twitter to its popularity but
now Twitter doesn't seem to want to
share its popular
so they are cannibalizing the clients
that made them which you might think
stinks but it is their right it's their
product after all German researchers
demonstrated a car that was driven by
someone's brain activity the car is
called the brain driver it runs by
software that interprets neural signals
of the driver it isn't actually Road
friendly but it is just a concept that
could help people with disabilities get
around and certainly would put a new
spin on drunk driving and finally a man
in Egypt named his baby daughter
Facebook in his defense he did this
because he was so grateful for the
service that Facebook provided in
helping to facilitate the Egyptian
overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak the
name is an homage to the communication
tool I just hope people don't take it
too literally and try to poker that's
your news of the day i'll see you
tomorrow and remember seen at defcon /
