and we're gonna take a look at the lg BP
620 this is LG's top-of-the-line 3d
blu-ray player for 2012 and it's selling
for about a hundred and thirty dollars
the design is pretty basic
you've got the disc tray on the left a
few front panel buttons and a USB port
on the front flip it around and there's
just a basic set of ports including an
HDMI output an optical audio output and
an Ethernet port there's also built in
Wi-Fi so you don't need an Ethernet jack
in your living room
the included remote is pretty good the
buttons are laid out nicely but there's
no dedicated button for Netflix or the
Smart TV content portal which is a nice
feature that's available on some
competitors the main home page is pretty
simple although the icons for premium
and LG apps are a little confusing
premium is actually where you're gonna
find all the apps you want like Netflix
and Pandora while LG Apps is filled with
a bunch of useless games and apps that
you're never really going to use however
once you get into the premium section
the user interface is very
straightforward it's basically just a
grid of icons and it is the best
interface I've seen for streaming
content on a blu-ray player
LG's selection of streaming services is
pretty good including Netflix Hulu Plus
Pandora and Vudu with MLB TV and ma
coming in a future firmware update the
big missing app though is Amazon Instant
which LG supported last year but it's
not going to be available on 2012
blu-ray players so if you want Amazon on
your blu-ray player you're gonna need to
check out some competing models from
Panasonic and Sony image quality was
excellent on blu-ray movies DVDs and
Netflix but that's to be expected since
all blu-ray players pretty much have the
same image quality these days in terms
of disk loading speeds the LG is about
average although it doesn't have a
QuickStart mode so it takes a little
longer to turn on than some other
players overall the LG BP 620 is a solid
all-around blu-ray player with a great
smart TV interface and 3d compatibility
but it's not quite as good as
Panasonic's DMP BDT 220 which has Amazon
Instant a dedicated Netflix button in a
faster boot up time for the same price
