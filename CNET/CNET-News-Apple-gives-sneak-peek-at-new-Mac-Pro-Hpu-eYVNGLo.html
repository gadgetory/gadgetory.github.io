graphic designers count on products like
Mac Pro to get their work done and our
most advanced users just want to get
their hands on the fastest most
expandable mac we make and then that pro
is really important to delivering on
that we didn't want to just make another
version of the same old desktop idea
that everyone's had like with macbook
air our engineering team has spent quite
a bit of time thinking about the
technology available today and what
could be possible for the future of a
pro desktop what would be a new form
factor new design new capabilities for
another ten years and the engineering
team has come up with something truly
revolutionary truly radical and this
product is so cool well I'm going to go
a little over the top and give it a
grand introduction that is unlike any
introduction we've ever had for product
so I am really pleased to give you our
closest friends the first glimpse of the
next generation of mac pro
can't innovate anymore my ass
this is
thank you
this is a machine unlike anything we've
ever made both inside and out the
processor graphics memory storage are
all built around a new unified thermal
core that even sounds cool inside is
state-of-the-art technology a new
generation intel xeon chip up to 12 core
configs 256 bit wide floating-point pci
express gen3 this is double the cpu
performance of the previous generation
the fastest memory we've ever put in a
product ECC memory 1866 megahertz ddr3
on a four channel controller 60 gigabyte
per second bandwidth that's double the
performance of the previous generation
internal storage is based on flash not
any old flash new pcie-based flash 1.25
gigabytes per second reads a gigabyte
per second right that's two and a half
times faster than any flash we've ever
built it's ten times faster than any
hard drive we put in a mac pro before
all expansion is external you can add
storage arrays you can add expansion
chassis over the brand-new announced
Thunderbolt 2 this 20 gigabit per second
up to six Thunderbolt 2 devices per port
it's backwards compatible with
Thunderbolt 1 and firewire and it's
double the performance of the industry
standard and industry-leading
Thunderbolt one but the place where the
team is probably gone the most crazy and
done something we've never done before
is in graphics this is the first Mac
ever that comes standard with dual
workstation GPUs AMD FirePro graphics in
it you can configure it up to 4096
stream processors 528 gigabytes per
second this is two and a half times the
graphics performance the last generation
and for those of you who use opencl and
you all know you should this deliver
seven teraflops of compute power to
applications of course you want to hook
on the latest third-party displays and
this supports 4k displays
yes multiple streams of 4k displays you
can have up to three 4k displays on the
built-in dual workstation graphics the
final cut pro team is hard at work at a
version of autocad pretend that will
support all the performance and graphics
capabilities of this machine you can be
this guy it is a Mac unlike any we've
ever made it delivers so much more
performance capabilities and expansion
than anything we've made and here it is
alongside the previous generation
the team is packed all this capability
inside one-eighth the volume of the
previous generation the one thing
everyone loved about the old generation
Mac Pro is those handles on the top so
you can move it around to get access to
the i/o well the entire top of the new
generation back pro is a handle just put
your hand in it you can spin it around
get access to the i/o it's all organized
beautifully on the back for you there is
audio for USB 36 firewire to being
driven by 350 are two controllers and
you guys who use this stuff know what
I'm talking about gigabit ethernet hdmi
out and it has a motion sensor so when
you turn it it even lights up to show
you where the i/o is it is a stunning
product this is without doubt the future
of the pro desktop it is coming later
this year did set as a sneak peak it is
designed by brilliant engineers in
California and assembled here in the USA
and for all of you who are dying to see
it put through its paces and what it can
do we have a special session tomorrow a
lunchtime session for all the developers
here where our good friends at Pixar
along with developers from the foundry
are going to show you some amazing
character animation from the upcoming
movie monsters you running on the new
generation Mac Pro and you want to check
it out and that's the Mac Pro back to
you Tim</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
