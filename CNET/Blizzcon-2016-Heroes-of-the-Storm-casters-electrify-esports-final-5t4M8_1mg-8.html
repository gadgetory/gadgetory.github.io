get me we're about to find out who the
2016 fall global championship is for
heroes of the storm but there's a group
of people that we think are a little
underappreciated casters before we dive
in full disclosure everybody my brother
does in fact work for blizzard and was
unfortunately of no use or influence to
me for this piece okay acta casters
these are the people giving play-by-play
and analysis of what you're watching
during an eSports game basically they're
your guides to what's happening on
screen any eSports championship is a big
deal which is why we decided to follow
Wade pencils aka dreadnought to the fall
global championships for heroes of the
storm f'lessan 2016 I cast heroes of the
storm professionally I guess I
originally was a professional player for
the game but then moved towards
commentary at the beginning of this year
a friend of mine actually said that I
should consider getting into commentary
and I decided to give it a shot and it
kind of just blew up from there so what
exactly is a viewer getting when they're
listening to a caster while they watch a
game from an analytical perspective I
can convey to someone who's almost never
seen the game not only what's happening
but the importance right from taking
what the point zero one percentile of
heroes of the storm players know and
translating that to the ninety-nine
point nine percent accurately okay I see
so it's like Vin Scully or chicken or
Bob Costas or Vin Scully you always are
looking for that guy who's been there
who's done that and kind of can give you
everything that you need to know and I
try to be that guy as best as possible
for heroes it's talking about what
you're seeing on a screen sounds easy
it's not heroes of the storm has 61
heroes and Counting all with their own
skills and special abilities each region
has a specific play style so casters
must study which heroes each team might
draft and how they might use them
every game the terminology suddenly
needs to be a little bit more basic but
still appealing to that complex dynamic
that is by far the hardest thing we have
eight regions going to be represented at
blizzcon so keeping track of all those
is going to be kind of difficult it's
pretty apparent that MVP black looks
pretty but everyone expects that from
them how was it it's just that's all I
had it's just I don't I don't know
history was made up sets like this are
awesome forecasters in the moment
because they're exciting and they make
the game really cool to watch but it
doesn't make their job easier a lot of
it was just I changed who the target was
you know I a I don't come in here with
like well I've got all my research done
whatever happens happens it's like I'm
sitting in the back eating a meal while
I'm like reviewing drafts over and over
again the whole time so with another
blizzcon in the books and a ton of
events tournament and championships on
the horizon dread has some goals he'd
like to achieve in the coming year
moving on making a better game hopefully
making a better eSport and trying to
find your place in it I guess
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
