the BlackBerry leap and this business
focus smartphone is aimed at young
career builders who want that Blackberry
pedigree but don't necessarily want to
spend too much you can pick one up
unlock for 275 bucks from Amazon and
blackberry the blackberry leaf is a
plain black slab that looks professional
in a quaint sort of way and there's a
5-inch display with a 1280 by 720 pixel
resolution that's a bit low for a screen
this size but it looks great so that's
not too much of a problem the phone is
also kind of chunky and heavier than it
looks but you certainly won't have
trouble toning it around you can't
remove the battery but blackberry claims
you'll see about 25 hours of heavy use
out of it
that's a bold claim but the blackberry
passport and the blackberry classic both
clocked in around the same levels in our
battery test there are 16 gigs of
storage space but you can add up to 128
gig microSD cards through a port on the
side here there's something missing and
that's the keyboard BlackBerry's made
plenty of touchscreen only devices but
without one the leap doesn't do all that
much to stand out the phone is running
the latest version of blackberry 10 OS
which means your only options for apps
or blackberry world and the Amazon
Appstore that offers a taste of Android
but far less than you find on the Google
Play Store the BlackBerry hub puts all
of your mail texts and messages in one
readily accessible place but the average
young career builder has far more
choices from managing their messaging on
Android and iOS devices you can find off
the BlackBerry system by holding down
this button on the side and it'll answer
questions when is the next Red Sox game
set reminders and do all those kinds of
helpful things but we've had Google now
in iOS Assyria and Windows Phones
Cortana for quite a while now the leaps
virtual keyboard is fast and accurate
and it's a great tech suggestion
function that superimposes suggestions
right up to the keyboard swipe on a word
to slide it in and you'll save precious
screen space and time but Android and
more recently iOS lets you pick whatever
keyboard is right for you which is
arguably more important for most users
if the IT department at your next
corporate job hands you one of these you
aren't going to be disappointed but the
physical keyboard is what sets
BlackBerry devices apart without one the
BlackBerry leap isn't really doing
anything fundamentally better than your
average smartphone and you're dealing
with a limited app selection if there's
something on a blackberry that you can't
get anywhere else and you hate physical
keyboards this might be a phone for you
otherwise you're going to be better
off on a more robust platform i'm nate
be sure to read my full review had seen
that thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
