in this whole hybrid thing do they pay
off is something much better just around
the corner and what do we do with all
those big toxic batteries
I'm Brian Cooley with top 5 greenest
cars that aren't hybrids just good old
gas engine rides that do it lean green
okay I'm gonna give them to you here
with your city your highway and your
average mpg and number five is the mini
29:37 average of 32 this is a car that
often gets overlooked as a green ride
because it's known mostly for great
style fun handling and all those kooky
paint schemes face price just over 20
grand
number 4 is the Mazda 229 city 35
highway 32 average here's the little
cousin to the Ford Fiesta with a
slightly smaller engine but oddly enough
slightly higher fuel consumption mmm and
slightly goofy er looks but if you like
a car that has a permanent smile edged
on its face and starts at just 14 won
this could be the one for you
number 3 is the Ford Fiesta the SF e
trim level with 29 city 40 highway 33
average this is the new Fiesta not the
one you're thinking of from back in the
day and sfe is a special fuel sipping
option package the esters are kind of
dirt cheap by the way starting as low as
13 3/4 the sedan though the hatchback
looks a lot better
number 2 deep breath on this one it's
the VW golf Jetta jetta sportwagen and
audi a3 TDI models here's a whole slew
of German cars that are right up to the
top of the list because all of them use
a very cool four-cylinder turbo diesel
Volkswagen family powertrain and that
delivers 30 in the city 42 on the
highway 34 average and the best part
about these cars is believe it or not
performance you heard me
these are TDI's if you haven't driven a
small modern turbo diesel you're in for
a treat
a treat called torque which is really
what you want more than horsepower for
everyday driving the cheapest way into
this club is a jetta TDI sedan about 23
bass now before we get to our number one
fuel sipping non-hybrid for come
Harrison the cleanest of them all is the
Prius you knew this 51 city 48 highway
50 overall no gas engine car quite gets
near that and a base price of 23 grand
so it's got a price premium built in
there no doubt about it
the only Hybrid that doesn't cost more
than its gas engine version is the
Lincoln MKZ at 34-6 okay the number one
fuel miserly car that isn't a hybrid is
the smart fortwo yeah I know it's not
for everyone
but at 33 city 41 highway 36 overall
it's the fuel sipping as' little ride
that ever got a funny look hard to make
it your only car though unless you live
in a shoe and with the Genki a-- strands
mission since Grizzly Adams spurred his
horse a little too sharply I got to say
though it still has an odd appeal to me
well that's it for this top 5 keep your
eye out for our top 5 hybrids episode
that's coming up soon and see all of our
CNET top fives at top 5 cnet.com i'm
