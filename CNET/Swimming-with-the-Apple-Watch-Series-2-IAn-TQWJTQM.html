much has changed with the Apple watch
series - because it's best new feature
is found below the surface while the
original Apple watch was splash proof
this one has apples blessing to go off
the deep end with you for a swim in the
pool or the ocean what makes this one
waterproof aside from sealing up most of
the ports and openings Apple had to
re-engineer the speaker system to use a
series of vibrations to spit out any
excess water how does it actually work
the first thing you should do before
going in the water is activate the water
lock by swiping up from the main screen
or starting a swim workout in the
activity app if you're starting a pool
swim you'll need to input the length of
the pool and set your goal based on
calories distance or just leave it
open-ended you can still raise to wake
the watch in the water but the screen
won't respond to touch once you're out
of the water turn the digital crown to
unlock the screen and end your workout
you can check out more details from your
swim on the activity app on your phone
your pace 400 yards dominant stroke and
average heart rate although even Apple
warns that this may not always be
accurate underwater because it uses your
arm movement to track activity it may
not always track a lap if you're
swimming on a board unless you're
swimming in open water which we
obviously didn't do here in that case it
uses the GPS to map out your swim as it
would on a run just don't take a scuba
diving or waterskiing where water
pressure may be an issue and make sure
to rinse it with fresh water after it's
been exposed to salt water with so many
dedicated fitness trackers out there
this may not be the best at tracking a
swim but it's definitely the most
versatile and one you can comfortably
wear on your wrist all day long
