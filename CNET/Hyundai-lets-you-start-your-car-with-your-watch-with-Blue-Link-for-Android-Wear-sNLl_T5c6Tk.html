International CES and behind me is a
2015 Hyundai Sonata the kind of car that
you can go to your dealership and buy
today that car comes with a service
called blue link which you can right now
use on your Android smartphone or your
iOS smartphone to do things like lock
your car remotely unlock it remotely
even start and stop your car
what Honda is announcing at the show
this year is an extension that will
allow you to do the same sort of things
through your SmartWatch now I'm wearing
a Samsung gear live here on my wrist and
by launching in the app that they are
demoing here in CES you can do the same
sorts of things so I can now from my
wrist lock the car unlock the car start
the car flash the lights and if I can't
find my car I can actually get
directions right to find us we're gonna
go ahead and try to start the car from
here now you have to enter in a
four-digit pin and the request at this
point goes from the watch to the phone
up to the cloud and then back down to
the car again so it does take a little
bit of time I we're seeing a delays of
about twenty to thirty seconds here in
Las Vegas things might be a little bit
quicker when the networks are a little
bit less stressed than they are here at
the Consumer Electronics Show so we'll
wait for the result and see fingers
crossed
and there we go I just started my car
from my wristwatch which is pretty cool
now the Android wear support is gonna be
available sometime hopefully in the
first quarter of this year Hyundai is
also planning to add support for the
Apple SmartWatch that's gonna be coming
up a little later this year once they
get some hardware they can actually test
on again this is showing off the Hyundai
blue link app running on an Android wear
SmartWatch at the International CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
