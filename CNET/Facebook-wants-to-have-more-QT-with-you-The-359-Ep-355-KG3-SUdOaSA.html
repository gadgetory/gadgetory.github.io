galentine's day everybody I'm BVG and
this is the 359 podcast episode 355
today your host might include and might
not Ben Fox Ruben and Roger Chang I'm
not really here I want to leave a little
mystery to this show I'm trying
something new
there you go we become trace peanut
trace trace him as your your show may
include trace amounts of peanut you know
what I'm just gonna stop making that
joke so what are we talking about news
wise today there's a lot there's a lot
to talk about today we're gonna be
talking about Facebook and YouTube
really trying to retarget their sites to
be a little bit friendlier offer a
little bit more quality time and not so
much controversy we've also got a story
in our blockchain package discussing
using blockchain for food safety and man
yeah Black changed everything gonna save
the world blockchain already saved the
world last Tuesday apparently as always
send in your questions and comments BVG
we'll get to as many as you can at the
end of the show let's be talking about
Wireless and yeah I think if we have
time we'll talk about charging wireless
charging for your like food applying in
your kitchen in your charging in your
kitchen so we'll see if we can get that
if we can't get too well let's talk a
little bit about it after the podcast
recording cool all right yeah let's get
to the podcast and stick around
everybody we'll see you back in the chat
for your questions and comments and 350
minutes and 59 seconds from 3:00 to
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Roger Chang Facebook is continuing its
push to be a place where you just chat
with friends and family about daily
routines and weddings at the code media
conference Monday Facebook execs talked
about retargeting the site for quote
time well-spent and the company Tuesday
introduced a new feature that lets you
create lists for stuff that you want to
do so is this all just like a big PR
stunt because I feel like this is like
this is the new Facebook weird like
cuddly and friendly we're all about
family and we're not we're not about all
that crazy fake news stuff that you
heard oh it totally is but like it's
also important to remember
the new Facebook is also the old old
Facebook right this is where Facebook
where their roots used to be where you
would just kind of like share Twitter
used to be a lot of this too you would
just say like this is this is a sandwich
I ate today I saw mom today stuff like
that so is it gonna work
I don't really know there are now more
than two billion people on Facebook it's
used for all kinds of things so it's
hard to say whether they're trying to
get back to this quality time kind of
stuff if that's going to if that's
really they're gonna put the genie back
in the bottle and I'm really curious how
this sort of jives what their strategy
to push video right they want to make
money off of Facebook they want to
basically take ad dollars away from
YouTube which is the most popular online
video source out there but how does this
whole like commitment to sharing you
know the content that's coming from your
family as opposed to publishers as
opposed to content creators
yeah and high roll clickbait exactly how
is that how coexist so it seems that
their strategy seems to be slightly
different when it comes to video they
talked to Ed code media about the idea
of using their video tab to provide
breaking news so you could potentially
like watch your local news channel or
CNN something like that right on on
video because obviously video is very
important and valuable to them so maybe
they're gonna look at that a little bit
differently YouTube was also by the way
at code media it's YouTube's head talked
about the backlash against the site for
problematic videos and she said that
drawing a line could be tough because
quote on one-sided censorship on the
other it's too much freedom of speech so
obviously they're still trying to work
out that element but I don't know we'll
see how that goes all right so next up
we've got a story on more blockchain as
part of our blockchain decoded package
our colleague Zoey Chung had a great
story on how blockchain is being used to
ensure that the food that you order is
legit that it's not fake and I I didn't
really know there was a fake food
problem apparently it's all over the
place yeah I mean it makes sense to a
certain extent alike there are a lot of
really expensive foods out there and
therefore if somebody could make a
knockoff that's way cheaper then I I
guess that's a way of doing it just a
couple examples extra-virgin olive oil
apparently 80% of the olive oils sold in
the u.s. don't meet the legal standard
at one point IKEA had to recall
meatballs because some of it some of his
meatballs contained a horse meat yeah I
reminded that Nestle had to recall
frozen beef because some of them also
use horse meat horse meat that was
tainted so can you explain to us but the
short amount of time the way yeah yes
how blockchain could actually help solve
some of these issues yeah exactly so
this this company wall night is
basically starting with food baby
products baby formula they create this
essentially a tag a physical tag that
they put on the product or the Box
shipping the product that uses
blockchain to ensure that it is actually
the product that you're buying so it
serve yesterday
Stephen Shanklin wrote piece about how
blockchain serve helps develop trust
because of the way it's the encryption
technology allows for everyone to
basically have the same information
nothing could be corrupted so basically
they're using the same kind of
blockchain encryption technology to
ensure that the food that you're
ordering is not tainted isn't fake and
is legit from the from the point of
origin to your house nice also we wanted
to plug Aaron Carson's story today on
finding your next BFF using tinder like
apps if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on CNN I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm right okay thanks for
listening I'm still having a hard time
swallowing this whole blockchain Bitcoin
business so like what you're telling me
is I need a web service now so that if
I'm eating a meal and I realize like
this isn't sausage this is a bicycle
this is fake food yeah yes okay yes
you're eating a bi so when I was making
the prediction about the smart spoon
that uses an app that tell you what
you're eating in two weeks ago I was
right that is not yet it's not
implausible at all holy I know probably
used blockchain a blockchain powered
spoon counterfeit food sniffing spoon I
think you're onto something I love being
right I love being right I think if
you're already about to eat it it might
be a little too late that's true
I think the idea here is that it's got
food labeling on it that hopefully just
reduces the chances that you know the
counterfeits really get deeper into the
system I guess but they say by the way
the products carrying the wall my label
generally cost about twenty percent more
than they're known on while my labels
goods but a lot of folks particularly in
China were fake food counterfeit food is
a serious problem it's a premium that a
lot people are willing to pay right it's
almost like a form of insurance I think
the thing is is that hopefully this type
of labeling either cuts off the money
for counterfeiters or it becomes so
Universal that that 20% premium starts
to go down it braces because I think a
lot of there there are certain you know
people with more money would be more
willing to pay that kind of thing but it
would be nice if more people I mean this
is a start-up they're just getting into
it they're only in they're really only
they started with baby food so expanding
their categories but you can imagine
once this becomes a broader thing the
prices go down yeah yeah yeah and it
also mentions in the story that this
type of technology is also used to try
to like cut out blood diamonds like when
you're purchasing diamonds yes conflict
diamonds right exactly but like when
you're talking about diamonds you're
already spending a ton of money so
adding a small premium to that yeah I
think I might be a little bit easier for
people to do yesterday's story had that
shank rode mentioned that the beers is
looking or is exploring blockchain tech
to to basically just like wall um I keep
track keep tabs on where these diamonds
are actually coming from we're gonna
talk about wireless charging food let's
do it do it you're desperate to talk
about cool things related okay
I didn't think so either it's a little
yes so yes our headline is how wireless
charging will cook your steak which is
Scotch misleading it's actually true
it's really a look at how wireless
charging will get into our kitchen I
mean this is the whole idea for me of
like the of a cord free life right
getting away from cables that you're
gonna plug in I mean there are a lot of
logistical challenges right putting in
wireless charging plates into your into
your car
like in case you needed to like if you
have to replace your countertop that's
that's a huge outlay
oh yeah it's it's extremely expensive
but I mean you can imagine down the line
as new houses get built like this is
something that could be put into new
homes and then you could you buy a
wireless charge of wireless chargeable
microwave or toaster or whatever yeah
and then yes the pot I mean panini press
there you go no it's because not not
have to deal with like the noise of
plugging in these appliances I would say
the stuff that you don't use as often
like that's why I mentioned the panini
press yeah I pull it out every now and
then right and then you want to put it
back in so plugging it in and plugg it
you know and taking it out and putting
it back in well you only have so many
outlets right you've got multiple
appliances it's sitting on your
countertop I'm still super skeptical the
thing is is that that is kind of an
annoyance but you would spend so much
money yeah China get rid of the coil
think it's a problem for me at least for
several years it's not thing where you
would upgrade your countertop for this I
think it we it'll slowly get built into
countertops or as your upgrade as you're
buying a new house as new construction
takes place that makes more staff but
then my friends would like very easily
steal my toaster they wouldn't show up
and we think it the plug is the only TPS
yeah yeah there's there's an alarm I
don't know no you're right toasters
pretty nice and charges wirelessly so
the surprise of no one there's a
significant amount of disparagement
surrounding Facebook in the chat today
Oh some people have abandoned it let's
go ahead and use that as a jumping off
chart for for comments and questions
Jeffers has facebook is now becoming
myspace outdated and no longer captures
the how its generation of whatever it is
it comes after Millennials also hey Jeff
er what's up to organize Jeffers name
shout out to everyone who's used or
abandoned to their abandon their
Facebook tried alternative methods
Matthew - er what I'm curious for
questions of Jeff or though like what
what do you use now instead of right is
it a grab because that's still Facebook
well if you would give them any like ten
more seconds you've seen that's where I
was going because doctor says I wonder
how people extricate themselves from
Facebook when they have friends and
communicate only via Facebook
and see that's that's me I'm old school
Facebook and yeah I post a fair share of
memes and you know devil's advocate here
the platform isn't the problem we are
the problem right we're terrible
you're all we do we share the same
terrible memes over Russia Russia's come
a big problem too
sure where should rush ins are also
human not Russians just Russia and
whoever's behind all those crazy fake
memes but you're right there's humans
are a big part of the problem the fact
that we're the ones sharing well we ruin
everything there was nothing wrong with
myspace either we butchered that to the
extent that Facebook is a neutral tool
and that we you know it kind of is a
mirror unto ourselves
I would agree I would agree with Brian
on that but the thing is is that it's
still like Facebook
Facebook's executives still need to be
better arbiters they need to be better
judges and I need to do a better job
it's not like a completely neutral
agnostic tool though there are
algorithms in place that inherently
promote one piece of content over
another that's not all human that's some
of that's code totally and the Facebook
I mean that I imagine that
infrastructure that back-end system is
just organza one and Facebook doesn't
have a full grasp of that's why news and
they need to have a better handle on
things like fake news and election
hacking to ensure that what's going on
on the platform is actually on the
up-and-up and isn't just being you know
utilized in like you know nefarious ways
right I mean I guess I I'm not a
Facebook defender but I will continue to
be a Facebook user because it is the
easiest platform for me to communicate
with people that I know they're very far
away in Hawaii I have friends in Japan
and I like to communicate with them
occasionally and being the Facebook is a
pre free platform I still utilize yeah I
should just abandon and become a
whatsapp user or something maybe which
is also owned by face I well
Touche but it it filters out the clutter
it's not a bad line right but I mean
most of the time what I'm enjoy most is
at the end of a long stressful day I hop
on and see what's up and usually the six
people that are still in my
following feed post an old in joke and
it's like I needed that that's how well
look there are folks who use that as
their almost as their video player just
sort of scanning through the feed seeing
what videos are up and just playing them
non-stop so you know it varies I would
also like to mention Facebook had very
recently come out with their quarterly
earnings their revenue was up 49 percent
and their income from operations was up
66 percent net income was up 76 percent
so the time spent was down right yeah
the time spent I believe was down
slightly but they still had more users
so their numbers are very strong they're
not yeah going anywhere and it's
important to recognize the fact that
it's still a very strong business
particularly an advert in online
advertising yeah so a lot of people
recognize that it's kind of a black hole
in many ways but I don't think Facebook
is really in any danger as a business no
no no it's it's not going anywhere
it certainly lost a lot of the Polish
that it once held early as far as I mean
you know it was acclaimed for its sheer
size and reach and now they realize that
reach has been tainted you know a large
extent but yeah I agree with you I it's
not going anywhere like Apple Apple's
having a rough year but they're not
gonna disappeared like they have enough
I mean look at Nintendo they were in the
red there oh god yeah in like the 70s or
something like that and the prodigal son
has returned yeah Nintendo is probably
the strongest it's been ever look I'm
learning business I know we're so proud
of you Michael Brown says what do you
think is the most effective way to be
social on social media is it with people
you know more openness to be social with
random people online that share your
interest you know cellent question very
good Michael that's that's such a good
like it step back and think about like
okay how should I actually be using this
for me in my personal life well I think
everybody finds their own niche right
like yeah I stay in direct contact with
a very select few on the regular on
Facebook and I like being able to be
found you know it's been a pleasant
surprise to reconnect with old friends
using something like Facebook being that
but again I opted in to use that because
I'm not hiding
but then again I found communities
online you know once upon a time last.fm
I was a big music nut so I joined the
community there got active and then more
recently even though not that recently
in comparison
I became an aphid red an imager user um
because I enjoy the comedy on those
sites I don't know anybody involved in
there I don't have any direct friends
but I share interests and I very
selectively join the right boards that I
want to get involved right I'm not just
like trolling across all of Reddit so
you know you find your own path I'm what
do you guys do as far as internet
interactions related so social that's
not work-related I'm almost entirely on
Twitter on Facebook I've pulled back
almost entirely but my feeling is is
that whatsapp I use a lot with my
friends and being involved in like
smaller groups of friends to me if you
are gonna interact with people digitally
and not actually pick up the phone and
call them or send them in which I don't
live ever anymore yeah picking up the
phone but I found I found that you know
spreading out and and meeting a lot of
different people and talking to folks on
reddit or whatever I don't I don't find
as much value in that very personal I
find some value I mean it is
work-related to be honest particularly
on Twitter that's where I do a majority
of my my interactions like you I've got
sort of small private groups online or
whatsapp or Facebook Messenger with
family and friends that I that I tend to
keep sort of a tight circle conversation
around with Facebook I mean I do a
little bit of sort of public engagement
the very I mean most of time I'm posting
you do more than I do I post a lot like
this is where I'm up to the OC baby
photos but they're to a limited number
of folks you actually can see it so I'm
not really publicly engaging with people
do most of that on Twitter yeah I mean
like this is gonna be like a real
bromide but going back to Michael's
question like if you if it makes you
happy to do and you're not harming
somebody else yeah then then it's good
to do on social media you know like
Brian obviously you had a very different
example and you'd spread out more than
you know maybe Roger or I do but and so
I guess it's maybe to each his own which
is just more social than we
we're not well it's not even that it's
alone it's that it's become adopted in
my generation I feel as the cultural
norm to an extent and I don't do it
because I'm lonely I go to these places
because I enjoy the comedy it is about
the comedy mm-hmm it's about the the way
to decompress
I appreciate somebody else's jokes even
revisit the same old jokes yep but it
hits a right tune because it's within a
demographic reach I guess and it's not
always so focused it's not a
psychographic either but you know that's
why I like that's why I'll spend an hour
browsing imager in like two minutes on
Facebook right as I'd rather get cheap
laughs then hear about somebody's
disdain or new child you know what I'm
saying you know exactly what I'm saying
if you're getting something out of it
then sure you know I I don't see
anything wrong with that that's that's
positive yeah okay great question right
yeah we are almost out of time let's
slam through a couple real quick Scott
my it says I was excited again a few
years ago and Facebook launched a
launched paper a whole new layout and
style for the app and for some reason it
went away why did Facebook paper
disappear and Michael Brown is already
pointing out cuz no one used yeah that's
the short and easy answer I would say
that that was kind of that period where
Facebook was experimenting with tons of
different standalone apps they want to
create sort of this this network of
different apps that all kind of link
together and didn't really work out I
mean it obviously messenger does really
well yeah there's a the core Facebook
app but allow yeah well not allow the
other ones survived and I think paper
was just sort of a victim of the fact
that there were just too many apps and
you're like what I need paper for I've
got the core app I would probably say to
that
it was more like news reading related
and with Facebook pulling back on being
a site for news or at least that's how
they're presenting themselves paper died
long before the strap yeah okay that's
true but I don't think that it's it's
harming them at all considering that
they're like we're not that much about
news on it yeah that mean like well they
gotta experiment to some point exactly
or we'd still be using MySpace let's
jump through just a couple more quick
ops
sir enjoy says is this just a case of
the current generation being less and
less communicative and just being more
about showing off their life and their
opinions is everyone just a showboat
these days I this is something I can
tell you see the case because
everybody's got nitrate I don't think
but why would it be generational it's
not personally generational it's
technologically generational because we
are in a place now where the cameras are
so abundant it's so powerful that
everybody can publish something and feel
like a snob I think we all want a show
we all showed off to some point it's
kids like but now you think now we have
the capability to broadcast that and
it's look it's a live stream trophy
I think it's generational to the point
that like I don't think people are even
doing it to be stars that's just that's
because cameras are everywhere that is
the facet of life you live that you are
always around the camera you're always
sharing and that's just that's your norm
right oh my god that's what we're doing
right now what you're talking about
way to you madam kids were growing up
today right that's I mean they are
growing up with in front of a camera all
the time and that just is the norm now
what is the norm for us but socially we
need to readapt and acknowledge that
there needs to be new ways to teach
humility I think right now I'm even
getting a little too so boxy here as I
sometimes do you know when it's become
so easy you have to embrace it you have
to teach how to pull it back harder I
mean I think that cut times that comes
with age and maturity like people learn
over time like I feel like whenever we
say stuff like that we're like the old
guys are like oh those kids don't know
anything no totally gonna figure it out
and in the back of my head right now I'm
just singing like man I was taught
brought up to be like go enjoy the
experience you don't need to tell
everybody about the experience get most
out of it before you start bragging
about it so I think kids have definitely
learned that the Internet is forever and
when you post stupid college party
photos they can come back and bite you
in the ass when you I mean I think you
learned that when you get older yes but
all right they are we do have I just
want to put this in the back your heads
for a later show jeffer ass Twitter made
its first profit ever what
to deal with that well think we need to
talk about that another week
sure so uh all right if you like to
anything you saw or heard here check us
out on CNET our podcast is available on
iTunes tune in stitcher Feedburner
google play music and amazon echo take
care everybody see tomorrow amongst
