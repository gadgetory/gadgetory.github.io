to listen to it very very carefully
it sounds like an ordinary call at first
but trust me the twist at the end is
worth it
good evening hello hello hi I'd like to
reserve a table for Friday the 3rd hold
on one moment mm-hmm okay so Friday
November 3rd how many people for two
people two people yeah what time 5:00
p.m. okay and your name the first name
is Daniel that's da and ie L okay you're
all set okay great thanks see you next
Friday okay thank you fight so did you
pick up on anything unusual there
because as it turns out the guy in that
phone call is a robot specifically
Google assistant specifically you can
ask your Google assistant on your phone
or you rule home to make a reservation
for you and it can call and do it and
that's what it sounds like holy smokes
so think about the implications here
there was hums and ahhs there were
pauses in it it sounded natural back and
forth you could tell it was a robot just
a little bit because there was a little
bit of formality to the phrasing where
there might not have been otherwise but
it sounded like a human that is so cool
and it can do more than just make a
reservation at a set time it can
actually work with more complex tasks if
you give it a range listen to the second
phone call
now happening healthier hi I'm calling
to book a woman's haircut for our client
I'm looking for something on May 3rd
sure give me one couple mm-hmm so what
time are you looking for around at 12:00
p.m. we do not have a 12 p.m. available
the closest we have to that is a 1:15 do
you have anything between 10:00 a.m. and
12:00 p.m. depending on what service she
would like what service is she looking
for just a woman's haircut for now ok we
have a 10 o'clock 10:00 a.m. is fine
okay what's her first name the first
name is Lisa okay perfect so I will see
Lisa at 10 o'clock on May 3rd ok great
thanks great have a great day bye so
again that was a robot how awesome is
that it was able to adapt to a different
time request it was able to remember
what type of hair appointment you wanted
I was able to do all of that just like
it was your human secretary it's a leap
right it's a moon shot and we have the
same questions you do it's what happens
when it hits an extension what happens
if it can't recognize the voice of the
person that's talking to you what if the
person's particularly verbose are
implicit in their language what happens
if it gets put on hold so what we know
is that at the start this thing is going
to be made for simple tasks making a
reservation making an appointment and
anything more complex than that it's
going to no it's not going to be able to
do in other words it's gonna be
self-aware and that's why it's gonna
have this training center in place the
robot is trying to make a call and
unable to complete it it will get kicked
to a call center for a human to finish
up log the error and then hopefully
complete back to you so I obviously
think this thing is so dang cool but you
have to take this plate of Awesomeness
and let's add one scoop of creepy to the
top and another seeping scoop of
skepticism all we heard was that demo we
didn't see a live demo there's still a
lot of features they need to iron out
it's really
cool in theory and it is such a huge
step over what assistants can do now and
you heard it it sounds almost like an
actual person so I'm hoping this is as
good as we want it to be and I suppose
we're gonna see for ourselves pretty
soon goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
