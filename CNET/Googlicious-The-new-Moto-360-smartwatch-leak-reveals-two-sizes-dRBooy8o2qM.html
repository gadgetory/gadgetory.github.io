show temporarily known as blue delicious
yes we'll get your show name ideas but
first let's get into all the happenings
inside the world of Google it's official
Android M stands for marshmallow after
they revealed their brand new statue on
the lawn of building 43 so how about
things that ended up not standing for
like milk shake or maple syrup and
marlboro lights like I really thought a
huge giant sized pack of cigarettes
would have been the look to go for now
the Android developer blog also
announced the availability of the
official android 6.0 sdk and they're
opening up Google Play for publishing
apps as well there's still no official
release date for the next to us but
we've done it before so here's a link
for you to get some of the wallpapers
from marshmallow right now thanks to
phandroid and they look good alright
it's hard to keep things under wraps
forever just ask Motorola now on their
Twitter account this video clip appeared
to just showcase Android where's voice
activation but the actual watch that
appears has never been seen before it
looks like a moto 360 but actually has
two major differences from the current
Moto 360 first it has larger lugs at the
top and bottom where the watch band is
connected and the second difference is
that the watch crown is slightly higher
on the side of the watch the post was
removed a couple hours later clearly a
boo-boo but the watch shown also matches
another booboo from Lenovo CEO who
posted images in march of what was
believed to be prototypes for the next
moto 360 SmartWatch now those prototypes
match the watch design in the video boo
boo there's also reports that the new
Moto 360 may come in two different sizes
after the equivalent of the Brazilian
FCC called ANATEL posted two different
variants listed as 360s and 360 L other
specs revealed the device will come with
Bluetooth le and Wi-Fi and a smaller
battery capacity of 275 milliamp ear
hours for the smaller model and 320 for
the larger similar documentation for the
original moto 360 was found nearly one
year ago to the day so every
points for the new Moto 360 SmartWatch
coming soon but the two different screen
sizes could be the surprise and we'll
keep you all posted alright leaks of the
latest upcoming Nexus phones are
spilling everywhere this image from a
Google+ user of what is believed to be
the LG Nexus 5 matches the LG Nexus 5
renderings from on leaks and you switch
that includes a 5.2 inch screen with a
rear fingerprint scanner and a probe
shooting camera it's expected to have in
october-november debut now on lease and
use which also released renderings based
on detailed blueprints of the rumored
Huawei Nexus 6 phone it will also place
the fingerprint scanner on the rear side
and the report says Huawei is debating
between a 5.7 inch and 5.5 inch screen
the render features the 5.7 inch design
now this phone is also expected in the
october november time frame also google
has announced a new service called
project sunroof that will use its data
sources to help automate researching and
purchasing solar panels for your home
now check this out they can use aerial
shots to help compensate for tree
shading they can build a 3d model of
your rooftop to see how much panel space
you have and collect weather data to
find the optimal setup you need to
generate nearly one hundred percent of a
household electricity usage based on
current pricing this is pretty sweet
stuff that really shows the power of
Google's data project sunroof currently
only works for residents of the San
Francisco Bay Area Fresno California and
Boston Massachusetts and in not so sweet
news project ara Google's modular foam
project has officially announced that
the project has been pushed back to 2016
after originally missing its 2015 target
for a test run in Puerto Rico the team
added they'll be looking at a few
locations in the US for the pilot launch
but again we'll have to wait until next
year all right guys and gals we ask you
the viewers to give us some ideas for
what we might named the show after the
whole google to alphabet change and you
guys and gals came up with some pretty
good stuff now Spencer Lambert says ABC
delicious that's nice Spencer ashlyn
Chandra and said call your show alpha
better get it cuz it's better yeah I get
it and all of you are much smarter than
me who chimed in with either
alpha bits or alpha bites with a nod to
the apple byte you know I like them both
so props to people like Zack Shumway
Spencer Quinn Marlon minus out and many
more because I know you all like seen
your names on screen like that you do
but I will most definitely not go with
Syed's alphabet you wanna my BOB
seriously I think you might have mental
problems so we'll think about it and if
we change the show name you'll know
first all right that's going to do it
