you hey cage right right no Jamie what
are you doing yeah come on that's my
brush are you ready to shoot of course I
am come on what am I not ready well
let's make this one count all right yeah
well that will bite you know we always
make it count high five right there
that's how we do it well my brain it's
my last show well for the day right no
I'm leaving well we'll wait what's
better than the Apple by Jay hey I found
something else okay okay it's not you
it's me I'll see you in the studio what
oh hey there there you are beautiful
what's good brian Tong here and welcome
to the show for everything good and bad
inside the world of Apple but first
congratulations to the royal family and
the birth of his royal highness prince
george alexander louis of cambridge you
know it's only a matter of time until
they named a sandwich after him now on
to the show and the big a better brings
some real heat this fall because google
just announced a flurry of products
aimed directly at them including their
second-generation Nexus 7 it brings a
full 1080p HD display thinner and
slimmer design faster processor NFC and
Bluetooth 4.1 will hurt Apple even more
is if they really bring an iPad Mini
without a Retina display and just an
updated design like the rumors have been
recently suggesting so we'll just have
to wait and see now google also unveiled
their hdmi accessory called the
chromecast that works like airplay and
allows you to mirror content from a
tablet smartphone or computer directly
to your TV it includes youtube netflix
streaming and will eventually add more
apps like pandora but the biggest thing
is that it works with both iOS and
Android devices and it's only 35 bucks
now that's a potential game-changer over
time mine's on pre-order so this guy is
definitely worth keeping your eye on
read it Ryan yeah all right apple
recently announced their fiscal
third-quarter results for 2013 posting a
stronger-than-expected 35.3 billion in
revenue and a profit of six point nine
billion
dollars iphone sales reached over 31
million units compared to 26 million in
the same quarter last year but ipad
sales were down 14.6 million from 17 in
the year-ago quarter yikes and Max were
slightly down at 3.8 million from 4
million now there was no mention of ipod
sales numbers because is becoming less
relevant and you'll always get some good
nuggets from earnings calls and when CEO
Tim Cook was asked about iOS in the car
he said having something in the
automobile is very important if
something people want he went on to say
that Apple could do it in a unique way
better than anyone else and that it was
a key focus for the company and also in
classic apple t's news Apple CFO Peter
Oppenheimer said that Apple will be
having a very busy fall and he said he'd
leave it there and go into more detail
in October so they better just get on it
after what Google just dropped on them
all right in the rumor mills this might
not even be the iWatch but according to
9to5 mac apple has started building a
team of medical center manufacturing and
fitness experts indicating that the
company is looking to move forward to
building a fitness oriented sensor late
in wearable computer now we've talked
about the apple patents in previous
shows four different wearable tech with
multiple health sensors so think of it
of Apple's own version of the Fitbit or
jawbone or Nike FuelBand that we might
see and in the nodeb rumor mills The
Wall Street Journal reports that apple
and its suppliers are testing larger
screens for both the iPad and the iphone
there have been rumors for an iPad as
big as 12.9 inches or an iphone five
point seven inches but we've heard this
same story at least once a year in they
should be doing this but what will
really be bad as if their fall products
are exactly the same size but you guys
want to talk about bad if you head out
to an apple store anytime soon don't do
this
support and that's bad all right in the
quick bytes app release the fourth
version of the developer preview for OS
10 Mavericks we're sending directions
from your Maps app to your phone is
working along with other performance
tweaks and apple announced that the
iTunes Store has eclipsed of 1 billion
podcast subscriptions that's pretty
amazing and I know people don't listen
to every podcast and this is the Apple
bite but I wanted to personally thank
all of you who subscribe and show some
love to our show and I just discovered
this really cool product called tile and
I wanted to share with you guys you can
attach stick or drop this plastic tab
like object called the tile on to any
item you might lose like your keys or
wallet it only works on iOS right now
and it allows you to track and find your
lost items now each tile costs 2495 and
lasts about a year and you can have up
to 10 tiles linked to one account this
is pretty cool i order this for myself
but I reached out to the tile team and
they're giving away five tiles tough
five of you the Apple biters all you
have to do is tell me what you'd put
your tile on what do you lose a lot and
the more creative the better and i'll
pick five winners and announce them on
next week's show alright that's going to
do it for this week send me your emails
to the apple byte at cnet com or my
Twitter at brian Tong thanks for
watching and we'll catch you guys next
time for another bite of the Apple
