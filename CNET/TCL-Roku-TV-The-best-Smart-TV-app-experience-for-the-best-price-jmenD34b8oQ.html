this is the TCL Roku TV that's right
this little TV here it's a 48 inch or
it's also available in the 55 forty and
thirty two inch size this TV right here
basically as a Roku box built into it it
is a brand new Smart TV that includes
the Roku operating system for its smarts
it's actually our favorite operating
system compared to all the others out
there better than apple TV better than
chromecast all the other ones we've
tested and definitely better than any
other Smart TVs we've tested overall
look is fairly standard for an LCD TV it
looks a lot like the current vizio is
with a very thin bezel the bottom edge
is a little bit snazzy-looking with a
slight chrome strip here in this sort of
glass stand base the stand does not
spoil but the glass does lend it a
slightly step-up look compared to some
of the other TVs out there so when you
turn this TV on it's exactly like you're
turning on a Roku box it's even got the
standard roku homepage which we really
like it's a very simple layout consists
of this grid of tiles the main
difference between this and a Roku box
is the presence of a couple of extra
tiles at the top that denote the input
so when you plug something into this
television actually ask you what it is
whether it's a ps3 or cable box
something like that instead of naming it
HDMI one it actually calls it what it is
which is a really cool addition like any
other app tile like a Netflix or an
Amazon Instant you can actually move one
of these inputs around you can also
rename it later so again we really like
the simplicity of this interface beyond
that it's pretty standard Roku you have
the ability to access its 1700 apps
which again far outweighs any other app
store we've seen that's a massive
selection apps including some of the
very best like HBO Go which isn't
available on any other Smart TV platform
aside from Samsung you also get Netflix
YouTube pretty much every other app you
can think of there's actually an app on
this TV that is designed to stream your
local videos and files which is simply
roku hasn't done well in the past you
can also plug a USB stick into this guy
and get videos photos in music that way
speaking connectivity around the back
there's three HDMI ports that USB port
as well as at RF and a standard analog
input which you won't find on the back
however is an Ethernet port another
thing to call it here is the very simple
remote it looks a lot like Roku's
remotes on their boxes there's no
numeric keypad or any other extra
buttons you find on most TV remotes one
nice real cool feature
from this TV is the headphone jack on
the remote we've been told that some
future TVs might have it but this TCL
does not on the downside this TV doesn't
have nearly as many picture settings as
most other TVs we weren't able to hone
its picture quality especially color
quite as well as we'd liked and that's
kind of the Achilles heel here the TCL
is saddled with relatively mediocre
picture quality including relatively
light black levels that inaccurate color
and pretty standard video processing so
all told you're going to get a lot
better picture quality if you mate a
Roku box with a better TV of course the
real strength is the integration of the
Roku experience without the box right
into the TV itself so again if you want
that simple look especially for a
secondary TV the Roku TV is certainly
worth a look and it's also very
inexpensive that's a quick tour the new
Roku TV by TCL I'm David Katz mark
