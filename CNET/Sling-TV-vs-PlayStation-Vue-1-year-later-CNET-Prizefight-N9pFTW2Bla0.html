with one of the hottest battles for cord
cutters it's TV streaming subscription
services try saying that five times real
fast it's a prize five rematch
one year later between sling TV and
playstation view our judges for this
fight are CNET senior editor david man
on fire Katz Meyer and you-know-who
ringa linga ding dong we'll pick a
winner for each round in this five round
Throwdown showdown let's get it on round
one is interface and design fling TV
still keeps its single-row interface
that is simple but a little too simple
it only shows you one channel worth of
shows at a time video on-demand can be
tough to find and there's little
personalization PlayStation View brings
a more complex interface that truly acts
like a TV Guide you can favorite
channels and individual TV shows it
supports multiple profiles for family
members and it has a great search and
filters if you're on a Playstation
it works with either a game controller
or the remote but bottom line round one
goes to playstation view round twos
platform support moves on more devices
that matters with the streaming service
sling TV can be used on almost anything
with support for Roku chromecast Amazon
fire devices Xbox one Android TV Android
devices iOS devices PCs and Macs and now
Apple TV PlayStation View gets support
for the ps3 and ps4 Amazon fire devices
chromecast and iPad and iPhone it just
added Roku and Android devices but if
we're talking overall device support
sling TV takes round 2 next up is
speeches
sly station view acts like a true cable
box
with the ability to pause and rewind
every channel skip commercials on most
channels and you can use its cloud DVR
to save your favorite shows for up to 28
days and the ability for five people to
stream at the same time now sling TV
might have a more flexible pricing
package but that's not a feature it's
channel specific limits hurt a lot so
most channels don't allow you to pause
rewind or fast-forward and you're only
allowed one stream on one device at one
time on one account for those of you
keeping score you let you run five
streams at once
swing TV just won their starting a beta
multi streaming service but it's not an
official feature yet and there's no DVR
functionality at all can you guess who
takes this round PlayStation View round
four is chimp sling TVs basic service
starts off with 27 channels that covers
most of the cable go twos like ESPN CNN
AMC TNT and the food network but it's
lacking CBS and NBC Universal properties
now you can add on extra packages like
sports kids or lifestyle and there's
options for HBO and Cinemax add-ons as
well there's a lot more mixing and
matching to get the channels you really
want now PlayStation views basic access
plan brings 60 plus channels with all
the primetime networks and basically
every broadcasting cable channel you can
get from cable TV any history and
lifetime are the significant emissions
but you can pick an elite package that
pushes it up to 100 plus channels Moe
channels no problem Sony takes another
round the final round is pricing
sling TV starts at $20.00 a month for
the core plant and you can cancel at any
time the additional extra packages cost
$5 a pop and the HBO channel will cost
you $15 a month PlayStation views basic
access plan starts at $30 per month and
you can also cancel at any time but if
you're in a market with local channel
access it's a $40 starting price and it
hits 55 for its highest plan you're
pretty much paying for an actual cable
service but you're getting more channels
a true DVR and other features that make
it a better buy swing TV is cheaper but
there's real value with PlayStation
Bewkes and it takes this last round of
the battle so let's tally it up
things have changed from a year ago and
this time around PlayStation View came
even stronger taking this battle 4
rounds to 1 and is your prize fight
winner these TV streaming services
continue to evolve but playstation view
is the clear winner unless you only
watch the stuff sling TV offers and you
don't care about the other features but
the choice my friends is always up to
you i'm brian tong thanks for watching
we'll catch you all next time for
another prize fight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
