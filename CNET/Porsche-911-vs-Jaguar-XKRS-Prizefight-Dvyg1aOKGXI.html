prizefight now and again that pits two
products that millions of people are
seriously Cross shopping against each
other this is not one of those occasions
I'm Brian Cooley with this prizefight
the all-new 2012 Porsche 911 Carrera S
against the 2012 Jaguar xkr-s about all
they have in common is the s and that's
what makes this so much fun let me give
you my take on how they compare
head-to-head our first category is power
it's the first thing you will talk about
with cars like these and it's patently
unfair on its face I mean we're
comparing the naturally aspirated 911 to
a supercharged Jaguar but a funny thing
happens when you box the numbers the Jag
has 550 horsepower the Porsche 400
torque on the Jag is a monstrous 502
foot-pounds 325 on the 911 but look at 0
to 60 times 4.2 seconds on the Jag 4.3
on the 911 that's because of this the
weight the Jag weighs 30 968 four key
pounds the Porsche
3250 that comes to a power-to-weight
ratio of 7.2 pounds per horse on the Jag
8.1 3 on the Porsche so I'd like to give
it to the Porsche for more elegant
engineering but the Jag comes on like a
freight train and takes it on the
numbers next category is cabin tech
neither of these cars are the paragon of
cabin tech or interface thereof but the
Jag system is a certified mess it's a
cluttered laggy interface pointless and
annoying screen animation and has no aux
jack or bluetooth streaming so if you
don't have an iPhone you're stuck with
CDs the radio or that dummy in the
passenger seat give this one to Porsche
on to styling
the Jag is as the English might say all
tarted up being a specialty model it's
bendy crew it's got a boy eraser body
kit on it and a big ol wing for Christ's
sake doesn't read well but in person
it's a damn good-looking car the 2012
911 is no slouch though it's got a new
longer wheelbase shorter front and rear
overhangs and it's just a little wider
the Jag makes a stronger statement but
after the wow factor wears off I'd
rather be seen in the Porsche give it to
the 911 next category cred Porsche next
now on to practicality you can get a 911
with all four wheels driven the Jag
rear-wheel drive only that makes a big
difference if you live where you get
weather and this is gonna be your only
car on the other hand the 911 has just
vestigial back seats and in deep but
kind of oddly shaped front trunk the Jag
also has cruel little rear seats but
thanks to its lift back design can
swallow some golf clubs and more normal
size luggage it's probably your better
to live with weekend ride so give it to
jag on this one
onto the price and this is a real unfair
comparison the jag xkr-s is basically
132 grand with very few options to move
that number the Carrera
ass is a little under a hundred but the
options can put it up at the Jags price
but by then you're juggling apples and
oranges anyway I think the most telling
factor is that none of us here on the
scenic car tech team could really get
used to spending a hundred and thirty
two thousand dollars on a Jaguar seek
read above and residuals in a couple of
years so save a grip and give the nod to
the nine eleven onto our winner the
score obviously is pretty lopsided four
to two in categories in favor of the 911
but it's actually a lot closer than that
sort of like picking bourbon or ice
cream you just want to say yes we
thought the Jag was going to be a poser
and it's not it's a hot looking road
taming barnburner and you're much more
likely to flip to a stoplight in a 911
and see one right next to you but maybe
there's a reason for that
I'm Brian Cooley thanks for watching
need to kick from me on before hey yeah
god there goes my prostate
