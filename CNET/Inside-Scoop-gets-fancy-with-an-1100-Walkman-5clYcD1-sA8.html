coverage of CES 2015 I'm Bridget Carey
here with Jeff Bakalar and we're coming
to you from the cnet stage at the South
Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center
this is the second day the show floor is
open to the public we're getting more
hands-on time with products and I've
also seen a few interesting headlines
popping up late yesterday headlines that
include pom-poms back pop mouth can't
stay away from mom lives at CES guys at
CES and gets resurrected at CES that's
how it works yeah cuz TCL announced that
they want to bring back palm in some
form or fashion they haven't said what
they actually bought the name palm and
Unseld yeah I was on sale along with
webos LG grabbed the web OS an operating
system for their televisions in the
checkout aisle it's just right there for
the picking and now TCL is saying you
know what get ready we're gonna see what
we're gonna do with it and we're gonna
open it up to people's opinions on what
they want to see because palm has a lot
of emotional baggage you knows people
care a lot about that name and they want
to do something with it it's been
through a lot that brand and it's
interesting that even after all it's
been through there's some willing party
be like I'll take a bet with that yeah
see where that gets me and I like that
they're sort of like crowdsourcing its
its legacy they're like all right let's
see what you want it palm has to be
something though in your handheld so
after it can't be anything else can't
wear anything unless it's on your hand
it's got to be some face palm I like
that all right well install also had a
lot of a crazy weird Tekkit it's an
announcement keynote last night among
them lots of gesture controls facial
recognition software going to a new
level and new chips to put in future
wearables that are so tiny they have
just a small circular battery that can
go into rings it's so small so in cells
always one if you checked out their
booth they always are encouraging people
to invent new things with their chips
because they've been trying to get into
wearables fast because they relate it
into the game and now they're just
rushing in full speed with all sorts of
different things you can wear but
I would say at the at the presentation
they had they had this jacket that can
help the blind sense what's around them
because there are cameras on them now
they showed a lot of things you can do
with these cameras and one of them was
put it on a jacket and the jacket is
essentially seen that you're near me and
it's going to give me a little vibration
to know hey someone's getting close to
this side of you so that's pretty
fascinating it's amazing it's like the
first time I've seen something I mean
it's there hasn't been a lot of
technology in that specific sort of
department and it really is potentially
game-changing for for that specific use
case so it's kind of kind of fantastic
yeah they were gonna put this camera in
your home so you can get a facial
recognition and you can even unlock a
door by just approaching the door right
it's kind of back to the future well
sure home right welcome home Jennifer um
also I think to really spend a lot of
time talking about you know how their
mobile processing is such an important
detail to their you know road map ever
like we said everything that's wearable
uses wants to get a low-powered CPU
driving the functionality in a device
like that you know the smaller you can
make it the less power it demands
because that's a big problem with
wearables the battery life on these
things is usually terrible get that chip
small get it powerful and have that
voltage be so low it's it's really going
to be interesting to see what
applications is used yeah if you if you
a jacket with cameras on it that but
better that sensitive it's definitely
going to be something it doesn't last
very long but maybe they can get that to
be somewhere to a new level smart home
another big topic here absolutely
cameras we're talking a little about
what Intel was doing with being able to
have facial recognition software there
is one smart home camera that I don't
know if they have it right just yet
Nedim oh yeah has one that it can sense
who was home by I guess you would just
sit this by the door somewhere right and
it'll see who and your family came home
and keep track but it's also supposed to
keep track of who left problem is you
can't look at at it to see the say
you're gone because then it thinks
you're here so it just kind of guesses
that you're gone because it hasn't seen
you for a while right so is
and the first time I heard about this is
like all right well maybe they like have
facial recognition and then back of the
head recognition or something like that
because you're gonna be walking away
from this thing but I don't know any
time there is something that is
specifically documenting when I'm in my
house and out of my house even if it's
just information that's supposedly
private to me I'm nervous and this sort
of stuff is what freaks me out at sea
yeah I'm nervous too but then we already
can do this pretty well with geofencing
on our smartphones and when people are
using that with apps already so I think
they're trying to solve a problem that
is Mick causing a bigger problem right
yeah I'm trying to understand where the
security label comes into this I don't
secure with with camera knowing what i'm
watching you at all oh I want to watch
my home not the other way around well
something a little more peaceful it's
probably the new plant sensor from
parrots finally how many plants have I
killed how many prints a few killed
killed a couple actually I'm like it's
like plant homicide in my house so check
this thing out it's a described you know
exactly how this thing works are you
legit basically stick it into the soil
of whatever plant you tell the planet is
so it knows what kind of nutrition it
should be getting based on the kind of
planet isn't you pop in a water bottle
on top here they have a water bottle
just screwed on top so when you're away
like for a week and see yes you won't
kill your plant right and it'll just uh
you know give it a little squirt only
the best water for those plans smart
water of course they have a pot that can
do the same thing too but um you know
the pots more of an investment they
haven't given the price yet for these
things or when it's coming out exactly
the next version should be you know like
there's a lot of people who say you you
should talk to your plans you should say
like nurturing things I got there gonna
be a like video chat with some sort of
like constant positive emotional you
know speech to a plan I think is the
next iteration people are doing that
with their dogs and their drop cams why
not they're talking to their dogs might
as well talk to your absolutely i'm on
board and only smart water none of this
poland spring nonsense only smart water
for these plants what else have you seen
Jeff I'm really impressed with well
impressed is maybe a generous word I
want to talk about the
sony walkman oh yeah so I over the last
couple years I've become somewhat of an
audio file I am very passionate about
great sounding music no compression I'm
a big black head and I'm taking a look
at this zx2 and I'm like wow they they
really went kind of nuts OH with this
Walkman it's eleven hundred dollars I
don't know if even if you love music I
just heard exactly to justify spending
11 hundred dollars on a music player
seems kind of crazy there's other
products on the market that will do
similar things like even my g three can
play flac you know it's not really
something that it struggles with so I
wonder where the justification to spend
eleven hundred dollars you know I get it
it's part of the Sony ecosystem and
there's you know let's talk about high
definition audio now and all right I
think consumers are going wait that's
the thing I mean even though people
really are into it we're into music
should i think in general we're just now
getting to the getting to just touch on
it right and I mean you know if you
value fidelity you're probably familiar
with something like flack already and
you no doubt realized already you don't
need an eleven hundred dollar portable
device to do something like that and now
there's they're streaming flac services
like title they're coming on the scene
so it's you know it's one of those weird
things like where does an eleven hundred
dollar proprietary Sony player coming to
all this but they can do it and that's
why it's here because they just want to
show that alone it's a lot of we're
doing it cuz we can I CES for sure for
sure but you know got to keep that
walkman alive absolutely and also hodes
pulls a lot of emotion just like palmed
I mean you know that Brits that brand
it's that legacy brand that we all grew
up with you know it's it just won't go
away for better or worse um USB has
gotten an update at CES as well it's
funny that the small awkward things are
so exciting anyways but but it's the
most useful so like explain this we were
talking about this yesterday and as I as
the words were coming out of my mouth I
was like you're too excited about usb
Jeff but I am because 3.1 is an upgrade
to 3.0
and you know you have the faster speed
faster read right but what's really
fantastic is the aesthetic no more but
you have to fumble around in your USB
port because 3.1 has no prejudice
against up or down left or right just
plug that in there it does your fine
whatever direction you're facing because
you like I was telling Donald bail
yesterday it doesn't matter which side
it's always going to be the wrong one
when you plug that thing in so now you
don't have to worry about any of that
3.1 is here to save your computing
convenience I embrace it with open arms
it's a great thing when you have an
Apple product now all the chargers they
just work both ways right so I guess
it's coming to USB people would catch on
to that USB 3.2 magnetize that and then
we're done just just just walk away
that's it what plug it in walk away you
know um this whole day has been pretty
interesting with a lot of the quirky
gadgets being shown off yeah I got I got
to take a walk around there what washing
machines are the big thing again to
which is which is a awkward because it's
CES you don't typically think of a big
washing machine to be the big thing for
sure people are still buzzing about that
it's the LG dual washer right where the
bottom wash within a wash a dual load
wash inception yes right you can um
actually buy the bottom washer
separately you don't have to buy the
two-in-one right and you can attach it
to other different types of LG washers
when it comes out later this year but
they didn't say the price but it sounds
like it could be like just three hundred
dollars for that bottom one you should
want it to I mean you're gonna wash your
bottom you should wash your top also I
think should come together like that's
hip check let's see how it's handy CES
tip and then Samsung has a sink inside
of its washer everyone's putting
something in the washer so they have
like a sink on top that just sits there
to hand wash things you know not seeing
a lot of screens and the washers or
screens in the fridges anymore I think
we're walking away from that tech for
the sake of tech right and maybe now
it's just a little bit more useful for I
always thought though that there was
there was a platform for using a screen
in refrigerator where you can have this
sort of display that tells you all the
food in you
fridge like if everything just had RFID
tags like your baloney no yes first of
all yes that goes without saying never
but I really wish there was a way to
like tag all my food and then the
refrigerator says I'll Jeff you don't
here's all your ingredients here's what
you can make you make some chicken parm
you can make like a lasagna situation
he's gonna do that Amazon's gonna do
that I'm sorry I'm gonna figure out a
way already my refrigerator gonna figure
out a way like we will order it for you
thank you for all your information don't
you think this is the year that maybe
perhaps all of these smart appliances
will break through in a way that has
just sort of you know maybe gone from
this little niche sort of enthusiasts
consumer profile to something that I
think a lot of people are now interested
in because it's broken into the
mainstream yeah and they're also talking
with more main hubs in the home with
Google's nest a lot of products came out
saying that they talked with nest and
Ness is that smart thermostat and they
also own the the smart smoke detector to
but a lot of separate companies are
saying you know what we'll be able to
talk to nest whether it's your washing
machine it's your home security camera
it's your door lock so it knows when you
come and go that'll change the
temperature and now everyone's also
talking about Siri because even though
apples never at the show they always
somehow become a topic of the show where
a lot of companies are saying we're
going to have our smart home products
work with Siri and we see that in a
garage door opener we say that in a in a
door lock and also what was the other
one there's there's always like a couple
um ah sounds half of my head but anyways
everyone wants some air filtration
situation yeah well that's it I think I
think we hit a lot of the main job is
going on is going on we're gonna be back
tomorrow and on Thursday we're going to
be coming at nine a.m. pacific noon
eastern we're going to keep highlighting
the latest buzz of the show so you got
to keep watching to here at CES cnet com
today and tomorrow for live coverage
from our show stage thanks for joining
us up next we're going to have the focus
motions
