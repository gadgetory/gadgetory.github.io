subscription-based music service before
finding the one that works for you may
feel a little bit daunting but I'm gonna
show you some of the ins and outs of
this convenient in a portable way to
listen to music so why would you want to
use one of these services anyway well
for one they offer access to multiple
millions of songs also you won't have to
worry about any kind of music library
management since it's all organized for
you in the cloud in addition most
services offer free trials lasting
anywhere from a week to a month with no
long term commitment so what's the
downside well you don't actually own
this music you're basically renting it
for a while and when you in your
subscription your playlists and your
songs you've chosen go away unless you
risa scribe also you won't find every
single song on these services the
Beatles for example are largely
unavailable and new music isn't
immediately available on these services
in addition to artists to actually make
this music don't make much money when
you listen to their stream salt if you
want to support your favorite band or
artist there are much better ways to do
so overall there are way more perks for
these services especially if you're a
music fan so how do they work
well Spotify for example is one of the
more popular music based services and it
works on your tablet your phone or your
computer now you can download it for
free and once you're signed in you can
start searching for songs or artists you
want to listen to as long as you have an
internet connection now you don't have
to pay to listen but if you go the free
route you won't have as much flexibility
as you would if you're subscribed or you
can search for individual songs albums
and artists but if you're not subscribed
you'll have to listen to periodic audio
ads also the free version of Spotify on
your tablet or computer will play any
song you can find now if you're
listening on your phone you won't
actually be able to play specific songs
and you could really only play albums or
playlist in shuffle mode
if you subscribe you won't have to
listen to ads and you can play any song
you can find on any device paying the
fee also lets you download music to
listen to later other services like
radio work much in the same way giving
you some access for free but then
opening up all available features once
you actually start paying there are
plenty of music services out there and
they each have their own advantages and
disadvantages but the great thing is
that you can try most of them for free
and determine which one works best for
you it all speaks to how we consume
media these days paying a monthly fee to
have access to tons of content now may
not work in every medium but for music
it seems pretty tailor-made more tips
