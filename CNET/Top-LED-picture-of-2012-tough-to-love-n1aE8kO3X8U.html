this is the Sony xbox360 five inch
member of the series this is Sony's most
expensive flagship TV for 2012 all the
bells and whistles we'll get into that
in a little bit but let's take a look at
the styling of this TV I really like the
external design of this Sony it's a
beautiful look Sony calls it a
monolithic display like a lot of the
other previous high-end Sony TVs this
one's a little bit different with the
stand it actually has this sort of
circular stand on the bottom here you
can see it's chrome-plated kind of in
circles thus the platform that it's on
and it really makes a nice accent to the
TV itself which seems to float above the
stand of course like the other
monolithic sets it also has a black
bezel looks like a black slab when
turned completely off and one pane of
glass along the front completes the
really nice design Sony's remote on the
other hand isn't quite as nice as on
previous years it looks a little bit
cheap for such a high-end TV but of
course we expect you to replace it with
a universal clicker Sony's feature set
doesn't include the gesture recognition
or fancy remotes found on other high-end
TVs but it does have plenty of smart TV
content the built-in Wi-Fi can access a
whole bunch of different content
suppliers including Netflix Amazon
Instant and a host of smaller niche
services they're a little bit more
difficult to get to Sony did layer all
that content among three different menus
so it can be a little bit difficult to
navigate but all told there's plenty of
content there once you can find it
Sony's picture settings aren't quite as
advanced as some of the other high-end
TVs out there but it does include a
whole host of picture presets of course
adjusting between them can be a little
bit confusing but at least you can make
those adjustments and not have to worry
about dialing in a whole bunch of
different picture settings the default
picture settings on this TV are also
quite accurate of course the standout
feature on this high-end TV is its
backlight this TV has an LED full array
back light which means that unlike most
the edgelet TVs you'll find those LEDs
are arranged behind the panel that
backlight can also be dimmed in
individual sections of the screen which
can really improve black level
performance and all the HX 950 produces
some of the deepest blacks we've ever
seen and the best we've seen this year
from any LED or plasma TV the sets
blacks are inky especially when you turn
out the lights and watch a dark scene it
really does pop plenty of contrast on
this
TV the downside of the local dimming
though is that you do get a little bit
of blooming artifacts if you have like a
lighter image on the screen in a bit
dark background you might see a little
cloud there of course that is a little
bit subtle compared to a lot of the
other artifacts we've seen we'll take it
any day for the improved black levels
the set also has excellent color and
very good video processing on the
downside it doesn't really maintain its
image from off angle as well as we'd
like to see especially for a TV that
gets this dark
all told however the 2d picture quality
the sony is excellent and still among
the best we've ever seen from an LED TV
in terms of 3d performance thx 950
suffers from a lack of 3d glasses
included in the box there's also a
couple artifacts including the
intolerance to head tilt and a little
bit of flicker that we noticed so all
told 3d is a lot more disappointing than
2d and the Sony's backside is as packed
as you'd expect from a flagship TV
there's four HDMI inputs a component
video input a PC input and two USB ports
for photos video and music that's a
quick look at Sony's xbr hx9 50 its
highest end TV for 2012 I'm David Katz
