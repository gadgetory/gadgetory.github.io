beloved Italian comes Beck's Cadillac
replaces their best-selling model and
presto change-o inside a fascinating new
Volvo it's time to check the tech EC
cars differently under the hood but also
check the tech included at no extra cost
the good the bad the bottom line this is
CNET on cars
welcome to see net on cars i'm brian
coulis it is of course the show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
special episode this time we're coming
to you from the Los Angeles Auto Show
2015 if you're seeing this soon enough
this show will turn out to be your guide
once you get here if you're coming to
the show if you're unable to go this is
gonna be your highlight reel I'm gonna
distill this thing all the way down to
the six cars I think are essential here
on this vast show floor starting off
with one that I think is the belle of
the ball the crowd-pleaser
of this entire show this year the Fiat
124 bringing back a legendary name but
on a very different platform in fact not
even Fiats as Emmy Hall shows us
hey everyone it's Emmie hall with CNET
here at the 2015 Los Angeles Auto Show
and 2017 promises to be a very cool year
for those of us that love rear-wheel
drive convertibles that's right I am
talking about the 2017 Fiat 124 spider
Fiat recognize that good thing when they
thought in the new fourth-generation
Mazda mx-5
but here they've given us a 1.4 liter
turbocharged four-cylinder just good for
160 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of
torque now those of you that are keeping
score yes that is more than the mx-5 but
it's just right about in line with Sofia
a Bart power is going to the rear wheels
via a 6-speed manual transmission or a
6-speed automatic and unfortunately this
is not the same six-speed as in the mx-5
so we can't wait to get our hands on it
to see if Fiat has been able to give us
the same crispy short throws that we've
come to expect in a small convertible
roadster now on lookers surely are not
going to confuse the 124 spider for the
mx-5 as the sheet metal is quite
different it really has a throwback more
to the original 1966 versions the
headlights have definitely a more
rounded appearance to them as well as
the horizontal oval grille in the centre
and the rear I've just got a modern take
of the rectangular simple taillights
from the 1960s
of course it's what's under the sheet
metal that makes this car fun to drive
the Fiats got the same multi-link setup
in the rear as well as a double wishbone
suspension in the front as the mx-5 and
it has an electric power steering system
setup and Fiat chose to keep it simple
using the same manual soft top as the
mx-5 the interior of the 124 spider is
pretty much a carbon copy of the mx-5
save for a couple of fiat badging it
uses the same seven-inch touchscreen
with blind spot monitoring and rear
cross-traffic alerts no pricing has been
announced yet but we expect to see this
little baby in showrooms in the summer
of 2016 so mark your calendars
a remarkable collaboration there with
literally the mazda miata platform
underpinning this dramatically different
least in market position model from a
completely different car making brand
Fiat now the best-selling car of Fiats
day back in the 80s was the 124 the
best-selling Cadillac today is the
Cadillac SRX and yet they just sent it
packing replacing it with the new XT 5
here at the Los Angeles Auto Show
Cadillac just unveils a 2017 XT 5 this
is the first of four upcoming crossover
SUV models that Cadillac will use to
kind of revamp its lineup this has a lot
of the styling you see on its current
coupe and sedan cars the ATS ncts and
the coming ct6
with electric power steering and an
adaptive suspension the driver will be
able to choose different modes at the
push of a button from sport to comfort
this car has a 3.6 liter direct-injected
v6 engine the produced of 310 horsepower
now that's mated to an 8-speed automatic
transmission there'll also be a really
interesting all-wheel drive system in
this car that can actually push 100% of
a torque between the front and rear
axles and also do torque vectoring
across the rear axle for better handling
for driver assistance features we get
adaptive cruise control which can bring
the car to a full stop and we also have
a new rear-view mirror system which
actually uses a camera and a display
instead of it just a standard beer
giving the driver a much better view
behind them now for cabin electronics we
get Cadillac SKU infotainment system in
the past that hasn't worked so well but
they say in this bottle we'll get a
faster processor which should make the
response a lot better and we also have
support for apple carplay and android
auto so you can use your smart phone if
you like the 2017 Cadillac XTS goes on
sale of spring of next year and marks a
really new era in Cadillacs model lineup
okay we're just getting started I've got
four more rock star cars coming to you
from here at the show floor in Los
Angeles before we get back into those
we've got an update for you on a recent
smarter driver episode we did that in
just a few weeks since then has become a
front burner issue in Washington where
this robotic technology is moving to the
mainstream quickly the smarter driver is
gonna hear all about the latest unseen
on cars returned
we recently took you through automatic
emergency braking technology that allows
the newest cars to handle part or all of
the braking tasks when they sense that
you and your reactions distractions or
just frozen panic aren't going to cut it
now there's a major update the US
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration just announced it has
made automatic emergency braking a
formal component of the recommended
factors to get a car a 5-star safety
rating
highly coveted in the business this will
start with cars in the 2018 model year
beyond that this announcement moves a EB
well down the road to one day perhaps
being required for at least de facto
standard equipment to that end the feds
have just launched an online tutorial to
educate the average car buyer about this
technology what it's called what it is
this decision is also the biggest step
yet to make a building block of
tomorrow's self-driving cars part of
today's mainstream safety ratings and as
we last reported 10 automakers who sell
more than half the cars and light trucks
in the US have already pledged to make
AE be at least available across their
lines by the way if you see a truck
closing on you and your rear-view mirror
right now you'll be relieved to hear
that the American Trucking Association
is also urging regulators to require a
EB on new big rig soon even if part of
their motivation may lie in achieving
concessions elsewhere in trucking
regulation automatic emergency braking
it's clearly the darling of the new
breed of automated driver assists and it
pays to double check what other
technologies will clear that bar soon
I'm Brian Cooley welcome back to see net
on cars special episode rounding up the
best picks I think here at the Los
Angeles Auto Show
now nobody really shed a lot of tears
about the exit of the ninth-generation
Honda Civic it wasn't exactly a home run
the current tenth generation much better
and even much better than that is the
just-released tenth generation Civic
Coupe Annie Hall takes a look for us hey
everyone its Emma Cole first cena and
i'm here at the 2015 Los Angeles Auto
Show and behind me is the 2016 Honda
Civic Coupe now everything from the
front of the a pillar forward it's just
the same as a sedan what really starts
the magic happening is behind I've got
this very steeply raked roof almost a
fastback kind of look which ends in just
a little tiny flick for a rear spoiler
and these brake lights here in the rear
extend all the way across the rear
spoiler in a very distinctive rear
fascia centered on the 2016 Honda Civic
Coupe is the 2-liter 4-cylinder which is
good for 158 horsepower or 138
pound-feet of torque that is mated to a
standard 6-speed manual transmission or
the continuously variable transmission
and that is good for 41 miles per gallon
out on the highway you can also get any
more peppy 1.5 liter turbocharged
four-cylinder she's got more horsepower
and more torque and unfortunately that's
only available with the CVT inside you
have the same navigation unit that's
found in the Accord and that does
support apple carplay
as well as your Android phone newly
available features include LED
headlights remote start and heated front
seats pricing had yet to be announced
but the 2016 Honda Civic Coupe will be
on sale later in the fall I'm a mija
Christina here at the 2015 Los Angeles
now staying in the same basic category
of car let's shift from the Honda Civic
to the Hyundai Elantra a car that got a
big refresh and relaunch here at Los
Angeles and in the process did what so
many cards do come from relatively
humble roots to start moving up town
antwuan takes a look for us six
best-selling car in the world
characteristics generation in 2015 LA
Auto Joe
Hyundai said that it sold about 10
million Elantra since the nameplates
inception and this new 2017 model looks
poised to sell about a couple million
more now the new 2017 Hyundai Elantra
basically takes everything we liked
about the fifth-generation model and
makes it a little bit better in every
way it's lighter it uses about twice as
much high tensile steel and forty times
more Aeronautics grade adhesive than its
construction so it waves a lot less it's
also larger it's only a little bit
bigger on the outside but on the inside
Hyundai's managed to squeeze a lot more
interior space into the Elantra so much
so that this compact car is now
technically classified as a midsize
sedan it's also a lot smarter inside the
cabin we've got either a seven or an
eight inch version of Hyundai
infotainment system depending on whether
you get navigation or not but we've also
got the latest generation of Hyundai's
bluelink infotainment system that's
gonna allow you to do a lot of cool
things like monitor your team's driving
for speed alerts or curfew or if you've
got an Apple watch or an Android wear
device you can actually start your car
and unlock your door from your wrist
it's all very cool now under the hood
we've got a new 2-liter four-cylinder
engine that makes 147 horsepower and 132
pounds feet of torque it uses a lean
atkinson cycle which allows it to get
what Hyundai estimates to be about 33
miles per gallon combined but that's not
as green as it's gonna get for the new
Elantra in spring 2016 Hyundai will also
debut an eco version of the Elantra
that's going to use a smaller 1.4 liter
turbocharged engine that the automaker
says will do 40 miles per gallon or
better on the highway what's more is
that it's going to be even torque e'er
than this motor right here putting out
about 156 pound-feet so it should still
be pretty fun to drive and for those who
want even more fun
to drive Hyundai says that it's gonna be
putting out a new Elantra sport model
later on that year it's gonna be the
most powerful version of the nameplate
yet I'm open for a 2-liter turbo but we
could see Hyundai with 1.6 liter turbo
in that vehicle
Hyundai's gonna have more details
surrounding the launch pricing and
availability of the 2017 Elantra during
the 2015 car show season so stay tuned
to CNN for more details as they come out
ok out of this whole vast LA Auto Show I
just got two more picks for you on my
short list and we're gonna get to those
as soon as CNET on cars returns with our
LA Auto Show special
welcome back seen that on cars special
edition doing things a little different
this time because we're coming to you
from the LA Auto Show with my list of
six my six picks that I think are the
essential ones to see here at the show
this year including the newly revised
2017 Mercedes SL the SL has always been
a fascinating almost a category of one
if you will there's nothing quite like
it and as we looked at it here this year
it really said I am the s-class that is
fun to drive
giving up almost nothing in tech and
engineering let's take a look when
they've made changes in this 2017 they
didn t radical surgery though they did
do some plastic surgery to the face it
used to be kind of ugly beautiful but
now it's just plain beautiful as
Mercedes does these days they have a
five mode dynamic select control for the
drivetrain personality and those drive
trains are many SL 450 v6 SL 550 v8 SL
63 AMG v8 and the big boy the sl65 AMG
v12 621 horse by the way the 0 to 60
time between them only varies by a
second from top to bottom the pedestrian
s l's if you can call on that get a 9
speed automatic the AMG flavors get a
7-speed automatic now the SL is always
been a high tech engineering showcase
for Mercedes not their biggest car but
they shoehorn almost the most tech into
it note this though they're touting how
apple carplay is gonna be available in a
package not worried about Android auto
arrives in the US spring 2016 we'll get
pricing a lot closer to then on all the
barriers
okay I think I've saved the most
intriguing thing for last it's not even
a car it's just the innards of one the
cabin of one has reimagined by Volvo as
they looked at the self-driving car
beyond it moving down the road to what
we'll be moving inside the car as it
takes over their concept 26 vision of
tomorrow's interior Antoine Goodwin
takes a look for us we were expecting
Volvo to unveil a new concept car a new
model at the LA Auto Show and well
they've brought us part of one this is
their concept 26 and what's very cool
about it is that it's a concept cockpit
that shows us what's gonna happen when
the car start driving themselves what
are our role at the driver gonna be it's
got three different modes the first mode
that we see right here is the drive mode
if your traditional hands on the
steering wheel upright seating position
from here you'll be in control of the
car you'll do all the driving we've got
the vertical census infotainment system
right here on the center console it's
just like your typical FBA platform
Volvo vehicle right now now on the
steering wheel we've got two paddles
that allow you to enter the autopilot
mode so you pull those two paddles the
car goes into its autonomous mode and
the seat slides back the since this
infotainment system is on the center
console so it moves with the driver so
you don't really have to reach for it
and as you see right here this large 25
inch color display flips out because the
car is in autonomous mode you're now
free to do some work or browse some
media the seating position is a little
bit more laid-back and relaxed and
you're moved away from the steering
wheel and it's sort of four tracks into
the instrument cluster the third mode is
going to be the relaxed mode and that's
gonna be when you just want to kick back
and let the car do its own thing while
you relax the seat goes into a very very
laid-back seating position we've got
this little Ottoman that slides out and
the 25 inch display hides itself from
here you can relax while the car drives
itself when you're ready to take control
you just grab those paddles and the car
gives you back control now what happens
if you're kicking it and relaxing and
something happens well the autonomous
system should be smart enough that it'll
be able to pull the vehicle over to a
safe stopping location until you can
two feet back into the upright position
to take control of the car now this is
conceptually based on Volvo's Bob
platform so theoretically it could be in
vehicles as soon as they're ready for
the autonomous driving to catch up to
the technology we see right here I hope
you enjoyed this little special detour
we took with CNET on cars this time
bringing you a snapshot of the LA Auto
Show if there's a piece that we're
missing that you really wanted to see
don't worry we got it go to cars dot
cnet.com we're the largest scenic team
ever deployed to an auto so really
nailed this one
it's all waiting for you there now of
course we're back into our little
Clubhouse just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge with our next episode getting
back to all the features that you know
and love and keep those emails coming
it's on cars at cnet.com I'll see you
next time we check the tech when we get
back off the road</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
