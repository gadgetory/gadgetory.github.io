Sumi das and joining me is Josh
Lowensohn senior writer for cnet Josh
thanks for being with us it's beer okay
so apples corporate legal team is
getting a workout last year it was the
patent trial of the century which they
won this year it's a slightly different
set of players it's Apple versus the DOJ
what is the case what are the charges
sure so last year the Department of
Justice basically sued apple along with
a bunch of book publishers the major
book publishers accusing them of fixing
prices on ebooks so their basic argument
was that when Apple came along prices
for ebooks went from ten dollars up to
twelve thirteen fourteen and fifteen
dollars so the DOJ is really trying to
figure out whether they all work
together then make that happen and how
that really affected the ebooks market
and so far it's just been day one of
opening arguments right yeah this thing
basically just started it's set to the
last about three weeks so both sides
kind of opened up today and then we're
going to see witnesses from both sides
including on Apple's Eddy Cue who runs
the iBookstore and runs iTunes and
iCloud along with some of the CEOs from
the major publishers and Apple was
offered a settlement they've said that
they turned it down they're the only
ones right I mean everybody else settled
out of court yep and a lot of the legal
experts we talked to before the trial
started said that Apple was actually
going to settle it was almost guaranteed
but then last week Tim Cook during
interview said you know what they offer
us a settlement we said we wouldn't sign
it because it basically said that we
were wrong and we we were making bad
decisions and they said they didn't want
to do that they don't want to make that
admission exactly but at the same time
you know the judge in this case and a
pre-trial hearing said you know what I
kind of I'm signing with the DOJ it
looks like Apple doesn't really have
quite the case so that's what kind of
makes this interesting what does Apple
really have up its sleeve that kind of
makes them think they're going to win it
do we have an idea what what their case
might be I mean based on sort of the
responses we've seen so far yeah you
know so far they really say that this is
similar to music before they came along
you know it was kind of scattered people
weren't really making as much money it
was hard for consumers and then they
came along with the iPad and I the
iBookstore and all of a sudden
everything worked out again I don't know
if people going to buy that I think one
of the key problems here is
before they came on books were a lot
cheaper right but apples argument so far
has really been the publishers weren't
really making a lot of money so if you
look at something like that music
publishers a favor exactly if you look
at something like music it made sense
that maybe people weren't getting paid
cuz of piracy and steve jobs at the time
argued that if you price this any lower
people are just going to stop buying it
okay so why is this case significant I
mean we are seeing huge increases in the
amount of people who are reading ebooks
right yeah it's not just about the
product itself of e-books it's also
about how much control company can have
over fixing these prices if that's
indeed what happened if you look at
something like this it's all about a
clause it says one company has to get
the same price as another company as
long as it's lower and that's kind of
been you know it's kind of a semantic
issue but it also kind of takes that
idea and says what else could this be
applied to not just books but also
movies TV shows anything like that any
precedents and if you look at a company
like apple or Amazon or anybody else but
they have their hands in all these
different markets something like this I
can have a very big impact mm-hmm you're
gonna be keeping an eye on this case
absolutely we're gonna be there in court
every day looking forward to that I've
ever Thank You Josh we will check in
with you again for inside scoop I'm Sumi
