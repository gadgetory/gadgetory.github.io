top five favorite bits of technology for
2015 robots droids drones we got it all
coming up it's tomorrow daily
greetings citizen to the Internet
welcome to our daily the best geek talk
show their own universe I'm ashley's
together i'm jeff cannata and this is
our end-of-the-year week where we're
counting down the best of stuff taste to
today's technology yeah it was this was
a very hard-fought list because
literally so to explain how it works
each of us Jeff myself and producer
Logan each got five votes a first place
through fifth place and points
correspond to that so first place got
five points and so on and so forth so
each of us literally picked a different
thing in every single categories are so
much good technology yeah it was a it
was a varied list an eclectic list
tremely varied there was only I think
one or two things that made multiple
people's lists yeah so but we do have a
top five I'm really excited about it so
let's start out with number five it was
the year of the drone this year and the
DJI phantom 3 I was one of our favorite
thing I was something this was actually
DJ phantom the scratching me dude no
it's the it is the droid it does feel
like 2015 is where drones have finally
come into their own yes and so we had to
pick a drone I haven't actually played
with this myself I really wanted to
we've had a chance friend of the show
Michael Hobbs come on and shoot some
drone footage for us which has been
fantastic he has a phantom 3 and they
are really fantastic I I do love a lot
of the features that DJ I has sort of
added on they have these really great
simulations that you can practice so
that you're not flying your
thousand-dollar drone blindly and then
crashing it and going oh I wish I knew
how to fly this thing I feel like I
would do that um but now you're gonna
have to register them so starting
yesterday the FAA says you gotta
register your your phantom cuz it's too
heavy they're they're a little over the
weight that's why 2015 is the air the
drone in at 2016 throne registration
yeah that's a year of 2016 but yeah so
drones were a big part of this year I
mean in almost every single way I mean
they made news for good things and bad
things yeah we saw drones fight fires
autonomously we've seen autonomous
drones we've seen RC drones we've seen I
mean we've seen every kind of drone he
could possibly mr. drones break the law
we saw drones help law enforcement we've
seen Joe rebel
ocean a revolution in wedding videos
actually that's so true anti drone
technology we saw a couple different
kinds of anti-drone technologies I mean
it truly was the year of the drone and
for that the DJI phantom 3 was number
five on our list number four I actually
had to remind everybody that it came out
this year because I am obsessed with
pepper the robot pepper pepper pepper is
the robot to look at okay this is it
really yes not on my list I will say I
know then because most people are not
aware of the capabilities of pepper it's
a companion robot is that ipad stuck to
its chest yeah but it's that's how it's
gonna communicate you know maybe
pictures but i can still talk to you and
stuff it's really awesome and in Japan
they want these to be a companion robot
say these are robots meant to be your
friend they're not meant to be robots
that are going to help an elderly person
get up and go to the bathroom or make
dinner or anything like that like this
robot their their usual to be a patent
ella one I need a robot best friend Jeff
like we want at least vacuum my house no
you need a robot for that as a room
before that was best of 20 2005 maybe
you guys I need a robot that does
something doesn't just carry an iPad
around and ask me to like play you know
3s with isn't friendship something I
guess I guess I guess Frank guess if we
don't have humans to be friends with we
have to have robot pepper the robot
friendship is magic that's my goal next
year to befriend a robot to be best
friends with a robot I don't have nine
thousand dollars for pepper though so
look at you already have your robot
friends I got Genghis but he doesn't say
much she's very quiet it's the quiet
type I am hyper i grant you pepper you
put pepper very high on your list which
is why pitiless I predict you will be
very disappointed with pepper being
you're gonna get a pepper and pepper and
I are gonna be pals we're gonna go
shopping together it's gonna be awesome
gonna be like ma'am ma'am do not bring
that into the store yeah I'm sorry no
shirt no shoes no sentient robots like
that don't bring your vacuum cleaner
into the store me but doesn't even
vacuumed the floor doesn't do anything I
own the corn ago exactly it doesn't even
vacuumed the floor i wish i could get a
pepper and upload Gladys
like a gladys pack to my pepper and just
have her treat me like garbage all the
time then really what's the point but it
would be so fun very strange idea of fun
Ashley I do all right number 33 is
actual fun fun that is a little out of
our price range but the aspirational
aspirational funder the tesla model x
great piece of technology this this
would be number one on my list of things
like covet yes this is a coveted item
Tim Stevens from our new our new road
show yeah site got to test drive this
thing look at the windshield thank you
that is not it yeah I mean this thing is
pretty incredible so this is called the
X because it has those cool x wings that
fold up that you can actually stand up
shoot a Death Star yeah and it will
still fit into a garage with the with
the doors up so cool that extremely
large windshield that has no seems like
a vertical panorama amazing won't that
it's pretty awesome and and the other
thing is is it got very high crash test
ratings or a safe car unless you're
abusing auto pilot which was another
thing that came to the Model X this year
a one man's abuse is another man's using
it right that's very true a lot of
people really enjoyed being able to use
auto pilot I know they're putting in
some checks and balances so that people
aren't going too crazy with it but how
cool the doors are the doors are amazing
you can be stand up and walk into it I
believe they said what was it three
inches on each side of the car and you
still won't hit anything with the with
the doors pretty incredible they're not
going doors there the unfortunate part
is the cost the cost is whoa it is
really up there wildly outside mine I
think for the the insane mode is it like
130 grand I want to say the top end one
is like over a hundred and twenty
thousand dollars which means i won't uh
yeah I couldn't even get that if i sold
a kidney like I couldn't even get it hey
Kenny more extensive hating like I do I
need a golden plate I did a gold plate
my kidneys even then I might a good half
I might have half of the amount of money
i need to buy a tesla model x we really
need the show to take off so tell your
friend about tomorrow game yes i want
lexus sponsors out there excuse me tesla
are you perhaps interested mutters
sponsoring tomorrow deal
cut out the middleman and go right go
right to tell listen Elon we know you're
a big fan of the show that's right just
like Mauro a couple we're not saying we
want them forever I want them forever
Jeff is saying he wants them forever but
I'll just borrow it I'm a long-term loan
there you go is a friend of the show
dollar saying so number two on the list
let's talk about number two it was
something all three of us voted for
which was very exciting I did not bring
my today and I feel like a fool for not
doing so Spiros bb-8 yeah a little bb-8
I have one as well it the thing that I
like about the BBA it not only is it an
adorable awesome Star Wars character but
the tech works it's no worse it's not
bad you wouldn't think that you know
when I first saw the bb-8 I assumed oh
that's gonna be CG that's that's not
something that I could exist in the real
world rolled it out at celebration and
everybody's minds exploded no okay it's
one thing to have a working prop from a
multi-million dollar film that they can
construct one of a kind but to be able
to build it on a small scale and sell it
to people for relatively affordable
prices pretty amazing that's something
to be uh that's something that blew me
away I will admit it's a lot smaller
than I thought it would be yeah when a
noun said I was hoping it'd be a little
bigger I hope I wanted it to be the size
of the one that they sell it target
that's our see that it has its own
little remote control because it's about
10 inches high this was about half that
but I will say it's adorable it works
perfectly like i like i love that you
can make it say yes and no and it does
all the little great bb-8 gestures and
things like that and they said they're
gonna be adding more like as the movie
like releases and stuff so it's great
like you said it's amazing that sphere
was able to translate this into a tiny
affordable toy yeah I'm a one it's not
cheap but it's portable relatively for
it was like a few hundred dollars one
thing I mean it does cut into my Tesla
budget but you know we're working on
that fact it does the me ask you this
question you're the only one of us
between you and I that has pets does it
terrify your my pets want to eat bb-8
they don't have any qualms out that they
are sighthounds and so they're like it's
a small fast thing and it's making noise
a squeaky noise so i need to kill it
yeah so they go after and hit it really
hard and they sent it flying across the
hardwood I'm told the people with cats
it's a delightful cat terroriser that
does seem like a cat terroriser or
delightful cat toy depending on what
your cat likes but yeah I just the dogs
do not like it there there one of them's
afraid of it the other one really wants
to play with it and then just ends up
knocking it into the walls and stuff and
I'm just like oh you're gonna break my
BBA get out of here yeah so I have to
tell him like leave it and then they
they finally stay away but a cool tech
gadgets for 2015 I would say the hottest
toy of the year yeah easily uh number
one was a surprise to me is if I own one
it was to meet it I didn't think I
wanted it and now that now that I have
it I love it and so technically this was
a soft launch a year ago in November but
it really only came out to the public in
June it's the amazonas go the Amazon
echo everybody it's a voice-controlled
cylinder that sits in your house and
always listens to you did I think I
wanted that no that's not creepy at all
oh I love having it in my house yes do I
ask it to play music and it does yes do
when I'm cooking and I need a timer do I
just say hey Alexa set the timer for two
minutes and it does it yeah that's rad
it's super good I think the one thing
that I found most impressive about
Amazon echo is that you don't have to so
Phi you Siri I have to be like hey-hey
Syrian that I have to go through this
whole thing like where I'm enunciated my
words and sometimes Syria doesn't hear
me right it's not great and like even
Google now and Google now on tap is I
mean it's way better than Cirie but it's
still like sometimes you have to really
annunciate especially if you're out and
about and stuff but in my house if
you're using an echo you can literally
speak at it like a normal person a
little person and it it knows like Star
Trek you can have a conversation with
Alexa and it's really nice I can be in
the corner of another room at the room
that Alexa is not even in and I can be
like hey Alexa plays some music and it
will it will hear me and understand and
do it right there's very easy thing some
integration that it's missing well but
you know what if you own an echo every
week you get an email saying hey here's
the new stuff we added which is very
nice sometimes the stuff is not
particularly cool but other times it is
super cool like I can get sports updates
now and I can ask it I can ask you to
tell me a joke
which is not very fun experience but you
know baby steps I just like the fact
that it's expanding its growing is
becoming learn you need to come up with
a database of dad jokes that you can
then send to Alexa and then and then
everyone will get an email that says
Alexa knows dad joe carrera jeff cannata
i like it i forget i got to work on that
I think it's a good partnership amazon
if you're intersted in sponsoring uh
yeah so that was our best technology of
2015 once again there were a lot of
really good candidates we had some
honorable mentions yes that definitely
should have made lists but just you know
top five you can only have five yeah my
honorable mention I got hands-on with or
face on as the case may be at a vent and
that's the Samsung gear VR pretty
impressed you know I'm excited for the
real VR that's coming later but the fact
that you can do that for 99 bucks it's a
winner i'm ready for VR it is really
impressive I really did like that gear
VR when we tried it at believe we tried
it at oculus connect yes really nice and
then producer Logan picked beats 1 radio
he was really impressed with beats 1
radio and sort of bringing back this
idea of like having DJ's with
personalities put together a playlist
and all the shows that they're doing and
everything he really really enjoyed that
and then for me I actually picked the
the newly remodeled sonos play five um
which I'm a huge sonos fan i I've had
their products for ever since they've
since before I had the old play five
like really big ones they've made this
new play five so much better I don't
have one yet in the house cuz I'm like I
don't need it like saving up for that
Tesla of course yeah I'd have to say
about for my Tesla um but yeah the new
play five is it's just so well designed
and it sounds so good and then they also
add it in the true Play functionality we
were able to sort of optimize your
speakers from different places like it
knows where you're on the room it will
optimize the sound and all that stuff's
really great stuff so if you're looking
for wireless audio solution like Sonos
like my number one recommendation but
really excited to see a remodel that was
really big and clunky speaker now it's
like so sleek and it looks so much
better and I mean it's awesome so those
were our honorable mentions yeah that's
art that's art technology does her best
text good swing off good stuff yeah um
you guys feel free to argue with us I'm
sure you brought your list to the show
you were checking it against our stuff
and if you absolutely
our choices drop them drop yours down in
the comments you're probably much better
than we aren't picking your top five
yeah we didn't spit we did pick any cell
phones or anything like that so if you
have like favorite tech tells you I
didn't either I felt this other stuff to
be much more excited it's this year yeah
like there was nothing really innovative
in the phone space like everything was
good like I'm not saying it was bad i
mean the the edge is really nice like
that's a great phone the sick galaxy s6
edge is really nice the iPad pro is nice
like Apple pencils really interesting so
is the samsung Smart Watch like all that
stuff is great but we just really felt
these five were interesting and fun and
something that really we kind of haven't
quite seen before right so I thought was
really really good list very cool when
you see yours tell us ya tell us you
agree and then we'll just like give you
a little internet hug it'll be great uh
you guys can find us all by the Internet
we're out tomorrow daily and sorry it's
all over here it's a right right
underneath feel free to find us online
and come back tomorrow cuz we're gonna
have our top 5 games yes and as I've
touted for the last two days now you
guys might hate us so make sure you stop
by and why best kind of get your get
your rage ready because I have a feeling
there's gonna be some sites in the
comments for tomorrow show we will be
back tomorrow the brand new doc at a
best of 2015 items but until then be
good him until see you guys next time
bye
