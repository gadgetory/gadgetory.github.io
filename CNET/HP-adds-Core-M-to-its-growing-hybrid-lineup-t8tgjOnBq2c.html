at HP's convertible back to school
laptop line these are all full back
style hybrids of this guy right here is
the envy x-360 the 2015 version it's a
15.6 inch screen convertible which is
pretty big for one of these and of
course it bends all the way back like
this or down into a tablet like this you
can also do sort of the kiosk mode or
the are they table tent and this guy
you're going to be able to get current
generation Intel Core i5 and i7
processors it's got a full HD IPS screen
looks good from any angle like that and
it is one of the first systems with that
bang analyst and audio software built in
that listens to the speaker's of each
individual size and model and gives you
some audio tuning that's appropriate to
it and makes it sound better you also
get back lift keys and even discreet
graphics from Nvidia that's something
you very rarely see in a non gaming
laptop these days and very rarely see in
a convertible and this guy is gonna
start that I think a little under $700
HP's other back-to-school convertible is
the Pavilion x360 and these are all
gonna run plus or minus about $500
depending on your configuration this is
the 13 inch version you know 93 or i-5 I
can get a regular HD that's 1366 by 768
or a full HD 1920 by 1080 panel these
are all touch screens because these are
of course convertible laptops like this
that form into kind of a kiosk or a
tablet mode I think much more
interesting than this 13 inch version is
the 11 inch version which I have right
over here and this guy runs Intel's new
core M processor the technically the
same processor in the new 12 inch
macbook and a bunch of other laptops and
of course this is a fan 'less design so
it's gonna be very quiet and run very
cool and again flips over like this and
you can turn it into a little tablet and
take it with you you should all be
available in the kind of back to school
summer timeframe again around $500 plus
or minus 100 or so depending on your
configuration options</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
