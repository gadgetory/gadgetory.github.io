a while you've probably noticed your
batteries been taking somewhat of a hit
and unless you're lugging around one of
these bricks you may get stuck in an
epic gym battle with no power and no
outlets in sight make sure you're
getting the most out of each charge with
these battery saving tips number one
turn on the battery saver the app comes
with a built-in battery saving feature
and since it doesn't affect the game
there's no reason why you shouldn't have
it on all the time tap on the pokeball
on the bottom of the screen tap on
settings now take the box beside the
battery saver option next try Google
maps offline Pokemon Go uses Google Maps
to pinpoint your location within the app
so by downloading the map ahead of time
you'll conserve juice and data as you go
first open the Google Maps app select
the settings menu and tap on offline
areas press the plus sign and pinch the
screen to select the area you want now
hit download now try turning off AR the
augmented reality features a fun way to
interact with your environment but it
also uses the phone's camera which is
another battery hog first you need to
find a Pokemon once you targeted you'll
see an AR toggle appear on the top of
the screen now slide the toggle to the
left and you'll no longer see the street
in front of you and the Pokemon will
actually be easier to trap and lastly
try lowering the brightness of your
screen this one is more of a last resort
move because trying to catch Pokemon in
broad daylight can be tough with a dim
screen go to your display settings or
just slide to view your shortcuts turn
off auto brightness and adjust</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
