Tuesday June 27th I'm some guy and
here's a couple other guys hey good
morning guys
okay hey I got your guy buddy sorry I'm
flying blind here I didn't know I was
doing the podcast until five minutes ago
right so if Ben's comments sound
incoherent even more incoherent really
his normal yeah
stinks so I was at a Facebook holiday
retail event yes they talk about holiday
in June like we're talking about I was I
would say Chris we've got a holiday
coming up I would no no no I mean
holiday as in fourth quarter or holiday
well they seized it by stuff and put it
under whatever tree you want to call it
I don't know some people celebrate this
thing called Christmas not me okay
all right let's get back to the topic I
wouldn't tell we're supposed to be
talking about Super Nintendo we're
talking about the Super NES classic
we'll also be discussing the release of
the public beta of iOS 11 and the
biggest fine that the EU has ever loveed
on a company and it's on Google Google
so we'll talk about that if you have any
questions on a these topics live in the
comments section Brian will pick out the
best and we'll get to them and get to
them in three minutes to 59 seconds from
3 to welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Cheng
I'm Ben Fox ribbon Nintendo dropped the
ball on us and unveiled a
much-anticipated Super NES classic it
will be released on September 29th for
$80 and comes with 21 games including
the previously unreleased star fox 2 I
totally want one but given how rare the
Nintendo class and yes classic was I
could feel like I'm probably not gonna
get one I don't know I'm gonna have to
like punch somebody to get one yeah but
so I mean it's a great lineup I mean I
think very few people would complain
about the lineup of games that are
available here gray one starfox
obviously Mario card Street Fighter all
those things I'm really excited about
Star Fox 2 because it didn't actually
yes I'm out
yeah that's that's sort of the big
surprise but we're just in sort of what
what we're looking what's missing what
what do we want to see from the Super
NES closet okay admittedly I don't think
I had an SNES lame yeah I think I
switched over to second Genesis okay
well I had you know I was I was pretty
hardcore into toejam and Earl okay
whatever other awesome games were on the
Genesis at that time yeah I don't know
it for me a couple games missing from
the list was Chrono Trigger I was really
hoping to get that a final fight game
Earthworm Jim some of those games
classics I spent so much time playing I
mean obviously Nintendo can't cram every
game in there so what I'm hoping what
I'm wishing for is that this thing has
some way to pour it in new games either
downloading a SD card or something yeah
my hope is is that it's also not another
limited edition one-off it's obviously
wait wait that they came out with
another one everybody was hoping that
would happen does feel like that's what
they're doing like if you look at their
comments they're not talking about
whether or not they're gonna sell this
thing after the year they did say that
half they'd have more of a supply but
again they're kind of telegraphic that
this is kind of limited time affair
which is weird right
people want to buy them let them buy
them I just disagree with the notion but
I'm not intend oh so I don't know all
right next up the public beta of iOS 11
is out you can edit live photos methyl
mess with the one page control center
and record your screen but remember the
final version comes out the fall and
you're sort of taking risk by you know
accessing or downloading this public
beta is that do you have Mesirow these
no no wasn't there like one time where
bricked a bunch of people's phones with
like a previous iOS no don't know that
were like an updated that was actually a
final version that was the final
actually but people so after that
happened I know it's seen it this was
this was new to me when I joined see net
was that you know new versions or new
updates of iOS would come out and
everybody would jump up and down like
they're so excited they're they they
have to download it immediately but
generally I like to wait at least a week
or two and especially after the breaking
that seemed to make sense right now that
was again that was the final version
this is just the beta
so there are bound to be glitches I mean
we recommend if you're gonna do this you
don't do this on your primary phone if
you've got like a spare device spare
iPad or whatever you you load iOS 11 out
of that so lastly the EU just slap
Google with a 2.7 billion dollar fine
for manipulating search results so its
own shoppings results would come up over
tribals it's the biggest fine that the
EU has ever levied upon a single company
but realistically 2.7 billion dollars
come and drop in the bucket for Google
it is a drop in the bucket for Google
but it is definitely a big deal I think
to me it sounded like some folks are
waiting for more shoes to drop on this
one where ya the EU could find Google
for even more for other types Android
apps search results there are multiple
investigations going on yeah and so if
they're so dominant in that market that
the EU obviously at least is arguing
that they have they have a credible
argument to keep you know shaking them
down for more money
exactly alright for more of these
stories check us out I'll see that Roger
chant I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks for
listening so go ahead and submit your
wish list for the Super NES classic I'm
with you Roger I'm on tour from Jim yeah
that was a great game such a hard game
it was a really hard what we're at it
let's get both of them
oh yeah which was a solid sequel yep
everything about the soundtrack the
graphics got better there was increased
gameplay and action options mm-hmm
man those were good I never had a Super
Nintendo growing out to Joo I did yeah
yeah yeah yes I had the Genesis as a
hand-me-down from my cousins and I had
the Super NES I switched over to Super
NES cuz Street Fighter came out that
sort of like was the game changer I like
but Genesis had way better version of
Mortal Kombat yeah the controls are a
little wonky er the the controller only
had three buns of the Genesis which kind
of like made playing fighting games
tough if you if you remember like Street
Fighter you need six buttons right so
wait did you not play Street Fighter as
a kid delete some Street fight over this
is really like diving into the recesses
gaming well so basically what there was
like
there's kicking and punching but there's
three levels each alright and so the
Jesse we had three buns the Super
Nintendo did have set remember in the
arcade they would have the six buck
right so with the Super NES you have the
shoulder buttons plus four buttons on
the side so you could actually do it
with Genesis I think you had to like hit
the start button to switch from like
kick to punch or something I feel better
with how how you actually played tree
fighter on the Genesis but it was
because you couldn't do all three bugs
or all three all six buttons right
unless you got one of those turbo
controllers right well you have to buy
the controller which I did not yeah
remember those never like total is
really wonky tip which made playing
Genesis games a little bit tough the bun
would respond let me ask you this um do
do you think people don't really switch
between Microsoft and Sony that much
anymore like you know you're basically a
playstation or an Xbox person these days
because the console wars all over and I
was growing up I was a Genesis did what
a Nintendo kid but I had a neighbor who
had Super Nintendo it was a weird
strategy between my neighborhood friends
and I we all had different consoles all
right one kid had a super eye on Genesis
the kids are on the corner had a
Playstation so we had like all the bases
covered there for a while I mean like
because I went from Atari to NES to
Genesis at some point I had a Gamecube
you you I personally really like jumped
between a bunch of them I know a lot of
people that like to game a lot so they
usually just get both you know like you
get the Xbox and the PlayStation but
yeah I feel like I've actually chosen
your teammate yeah I've been a Xbox
gamer since the beginning I never want
to play and like most of my friends were
all PlayStation users yeah yeah yeah I
bought your Xbox 360 I played it for a
year and I was just like what is this
this isn't this isn't gaming so what
you're saying you're not the demographic
here right
it was just nobody he got he got a
Playstation I got him play I got a ps4
just realize he's not he's not an Xbox
guy he's a PlayStation PlayStation guy
it's fine I wasn't used to the
controller the controller like kind of
felt like it needed a diet I don't know
it was too chunky it's funny cuz I think
that controller is like for me the
optimal control like I think the
PlayStation 1 is way me one it's way too
small too few say so I don't know
triggers are potato and taro my friend
but yo
from Venus you brought but you brought
up this point though earlier that like
we've got this sort of resurrection of
Super Nintendo and Genesis with the
flashback Genesis console also available
coming this year we've got this kind of
slight revival the return of the console
war that part do yep I would be really
interested to see if there's any kind of
correlation between like kids who grew
up Sega Genesis there's a Super Nintendo
the Loyalists like the flashbacks if
they stay that way or if they find that
opportunity to kind of flip or more
importantly if there is some correlation
between I grew up on Sega now I like
Microsoft I grew up on intend to now
like Sony if there's any kind of weird
yeah but yeah if I had to say like I
would be I guess I would call myself a
Nintendo fan and then I migrated to
Microsoft so wonder if I started with
regulars Nintendo Entertainment System
yeah and then I got a game that we all
did
got a Sega Genesis and then graduated to
a Nintendo 64 stuck with Nintendo for a
minute went to GameCube and then
eventually landed on an Xbox 360 and
that's kind of where I slowed down I
haven't bought a console since then
sorry everybody but the cream of the
crop for me was when I got that Sega
Dreamcast that was and that's the one I
Will Survive throughout if the rest of
them burned in a fire I'll go back into
that house fire to save your dream past
Wow yeah and then Dreamcast anything oh
I like Sega just the Dreamcast itself
I like the Dreamcast yeah I mean I
didn't have one my friend I had it some
of my time I played like the 2k NBA
games I just jumped back into playing
Shenmue 2 as you imagined a couple of
times of this podcast I need help if
anybody out there in the chat can help
me I am really suck looking for the well
in his shoe book anyone can help me
let's let's get back to the topic what
else what else would you want to see in
this Super NES Henry Chan in the chat
says Chrono Trigger yes so far from
alone on that one yeah yeah that was for
me sort of like the number one missing
game and yeah this is a great lineup
like I feel like they really kind of
knocked out of the park because the NES
classic
of games there was some hidden this ones
it wasn't all great these are all pretty
solid games I mean though these are all
sort of like I'm just kind of some of
these you could argue are like the best
games of all time I'm just kind of
surprised a Secret of Mana beat out
Chrono Trigger yeah
Oh secret to what our final fan I'm
sorry Final Fantasy 4 technical I think
that is final thoughts before it says 3d
but I think it's no no 4 equals to 2 so
which one is this 3 equals 5 I forget
now it's a weird that weird like I was
just watching the scene I was reading
yeah like this is a good one though
Final Fantasy 3 it is a good one it is a
good one but I'm still like Chrono
Trigger like that's legendary
yeah Danny Green in the chat sets up
Danny Green I grew up with
black-and-white TV with 3 channels we
played real board games back then lol oh
wow project files it up you grew up in
the dark ages blue in be nice wallet and
white TV screen blast in the chat is
still angry about no wireless
controllers
I know you're gonna go straight-up
nostalgia bomb you got to get a tire you
got to trip over some chords you know
those original NES classic horns were
like obscenely short I mean this this is
two feet longer which is still shorter
than the original ones like you
shouldn't go with nostalgia you go with
nostalgia the wired control look like
house like like TVs aren't set up that
way you don't sit 4 feet from your TV
you're right what you did when we were
that age yeah that is up a beam but our
TVs aren't like that hey bored they're
gigantic you know sit three feet in
front of one true there's technically
less risk and sitting in front of an LCD
than there is a miraculous um extension
by damage-wise yeah yeah and that's it
we were talking before about the
peripherals and if they're going to
develop wireless controllers or cable
extenders and after a knee has pulled
the plug so quick on the original
classic I got to thinking like the smart
thing would be a third-party developer
not to specifically develop for a given
system
but to develop a Bluetooth hub with
universal adapters right right so you
could like when you travel overseas and
you get a different outlet and you have
to rotate your power yeah cycle yeah do
something like that with different
plugin caps so you can convert it to
Sega convert it to Nintendo Super
Nintendo yeah
Universal inputs for all those yeah
there were a lot of third-party makers
who just basically got screwed over wend
and kind of decide to pull that Danny
it's classic although there's a huge
stock of these wireless controllers on
the market like also no one needed them
yeah yeah it was too bad about that yeah
so it makes me wonder if these guys are
gonna come back and like make
accessories for this super nice thing
especially knowing that Nintendo is sort
of telegraphing that this is a
limited-time affair Matthew Cox says do
we think it will be another linux box
that will accept a ton of games not by
the sounds of it wasn't the NES classic
like that or yeah but you had no way to
actually put anything into unless you
took it apart you had to hack and you
had to hack it a smart person can hack
just about anything you could do you
will be able to do with the Super NES
you just have to have the proper picnic
'old know how yeah it's not for everyone
it's not gonna be ingrained in it right
user friendly per se and on that note
nitro is requesting us sometime in the
near future to cover the Raspberry Pi oh
yeah I mean we actually have a how-to
out there how to build your own console
with the Raspberry Pi dan Graziano danny
Graziano did it it's a little I think
it's a little outdated cuz actually it's
it's even easier now to do it I think
it's just a matter of like now you just
load the roms in you're like good to go
but yeah we should do one a Raspberry Pi
soon so here's some kid in the chat
named Alfred
oh really looks like he's about 12 or so
yeah he's complaining about chrono
trigger but like he wasn't even born
with chrono trigger water oh yeah we
can't he hasn't disclosed his age we
could just sort of tell by the way he's
writing in all caps that he's guide me
like five years old all right let's talk
a little bit about iOS before we wrap it
up for the day blue in projects so like
will snapchat make it so you can screen
record snaps anymore once iOS 11 is
publicly
that's the thought cuz you can't record
oh yeah iTunes movies on there they
disabled out how they'd work against
other video type oh that's a great
question it's a great question yeah I
feel like it'd be smart for them to try
to disable that because I could get into
danger zone especially with snapchat
because of just general consumer
expectations yep
I'm curious is that has anyone has any
of our readers or viewers actually
downloaded iOS 11 just like I usually
don't I kind of rely on experts like
Scott to to download it on their like
their test iPads yeah not only that but
like I I feel like I don't have multiple
yeah what's at home I just got the one I
feel like the improvements are
especially for the iPad right it's yeah
by all major and drag and drop and stuff
like that like actually make it a more
you know more of a more user yeah more
usable computer fun still not there yet
I would agree I would say it is still
not like I know Apple wants to push this
thing as a almost full fledged semi
full-fledged right Peter but if you're
an iPhone if you're an iPhone user is
there like this one killer thing that
you've been dying to get but you know
that iOS 11 includes probably not it's
probably oh there's a lot of
improvements that are like nice to have
mm-hmm one more from Danny Green before
we wrap it up for the day let's move on
to Google he says I'm guessing somebody
paid Google to bump them up on the
shopping list question is did they make
enough to cover the fine conspiracy
theory well no I think the the issue is
that they actually put their own
shopping services upfront so they were
they were profiting off of you know the
these manipulative search results
personally it was I don't think anyone
pushing
yeah like the whole idea of paying
Google to have like proper or higher
placement that's their whole business
model that's not illegal that that's
just but they have it sort of does it in
a section right that's basically like
paid placement right kind of the
standard business model I mean what the
EU argument is that they basically just
moved for real actual search results or
organic search organic search results
Google's results would put surface above
the triangle which was the primary fear
that everybody had about Google yeah
anyway and you know here's the proof
that yes it has happened and yeah
because it what you see in the Internet
there
a ton of money but at the same time like
it's like we said it's not a huge amount
for Google just yeah in terms of
reference it generated about ninety
billion dollars last year in profit no
revenue in revenue yeah okay I mean
still healthy profit but ninety billion
revenue yeah alright we're just about
out of time for the day but I want to
pitch out some food for thought we're
not gonna answer this right here on this
episode but start thinking about this
you guys are fighting against me on this
it's probably not a secret that the
Nintendo will likely move on and do a
Nintendo 64 in the realm of classic
nostalgia mini boxes maybe yeah and then
they'll probably shut that down too I
think and this is a very personal theory
I have no grounds to back this up that
if they were smart they would continue
this trend they do a Gamecube and then
ultimately once they've pulled these all
off the shelves and lift everybody
blue-balled
that they'll put out an all in one box
wait would you what they do a Wii as
well I think the Wii is to contemporary
personally okay but at some point an
all-in-one box because I mean they've
got the Virtual Console but I would love
to see that if I knew that was coming
down the line I would hold out and I
would buy that all in one box so I get
the Nintendo super 64 GameCube all in
the same box that should be I want to
teach you how to make like a Raspberry
Pi cons no I want to present a slightly
different theory my theory is that they
probably ended with super enhance maybe
a Nintendo 64 classic but they they stop
it there they basically stoked all of
our interest in the stall in these old
games got our whole nostalgia thing
going and then they basically shut it
all down and basically and then forced
you to if you want these games to buy
the switch or buy whatever future
console they make so you can access
these games you can hang let's access
those game but you can't manage you
can't yeah you can't now
and so but making it sort of the sole
place like if you want all these awesome
games from your childhood
gotta buy switch you know it would be
great to is all the Super NES classics
and the NES classics when they do shut
them down they make the ones that you
purchase
stop working oh my god you really have
to but that's just evil you see there's
Satan wow that's a CEO material right
there now I know that's a promoted
food-for-thought everybody just think
about what Nintendo's next steps are
gonna be what competitors next steps are
gonna be especially now the Sega's
putting out massive collections of
classic games on yeah mobile at the
smartest thing
Sega's done in a while I legitimately
think that kind of gives Nintendo or run
for their money
as far as the audience reach try to
place like some of the games like Sonic
what's kind of hard to play on the phone
I'm just ticked that that's once again
online only oh yeah because they all the
ads yeah I'll Glen up a paid for the
damn ads the money I paid for the damn
app and it's still even without the ads
that's dumb I hate that that makes me so
angry but I will give it to them Crazy
Taxi controls and nominally oh yeah yeah
I highly recommend Ebonics really tough
to play on my phone it is because
already that game is suffering from big
sprite small screen yeah and when you're
trying to like get down into smaller
screen it and your thumbs are clogging
up some of that air exactly it is tricky
yeah it but it's always been that way
all the way back to the original
Christian Whitehead ports that's that's
my two cents on it but anyway it's it's
a glorious age for nostalgia indeed it
is
alright let's wrap it up there if you
