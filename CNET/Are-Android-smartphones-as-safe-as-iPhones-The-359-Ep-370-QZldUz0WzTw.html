episode 370 of the 359 podcast on BVG
and your host today are Alfred and Roger
morning morning everybody we got a
pretty stacked plate today and I'm sure
we're gonna get a lot of trolls in the
chat for this one more than usual or
let's just let's just say that the bait
has been clicked music yeah alright just
checking the music always plays what do
we got a complete cyber show today we do
have a complete lots of cyber careful
cyber cyber anyway it's a look it's
gonna be a fully stacked show all about
security we've talked about Google
making the case that it's just it's
Android phones are just as secures
iPhones I will be talking about us
leveling sanctions against Russia for
champion with the elections was not
petya and and more out there's all the
details we'll talk a little bit about
Intel fixing or putting out its Spectre
fix and a look at why IOT still scares
us it's scary right right breaky a lot
of ghosts yes ghost in the machine
there we go alright as always if you
have any questions leave in the comment
section but I will pick up the best and
we'll try to answer them in 3 minutes
and 59 seconds from 3 to welcome to the
359 I'm Roger Chang I'm alpha ring
today's all about security first up
Google is that with the new security
report and claims that Android is just
as secure as the iPhone it says that
there are fewer cases of malware and
flaws the phones are getting better
security updates Alfred you're the
expert here like do you buy this I'm
inclined to believe them on several
parts of it where they talk about how
they've improved security in the App
Store so you won't be able to download
something that actually has a virus from
it from the official App Store they're
enough how they're retrofitting security
so the biggest criticism against Android
security has always been that only what
like 3% of their phones are on the
latest like update and then the rest of
it it's kind of like you're on your own
so they've tried addressing that by only
doing security updates it's before your
security updates would come if likely
patches all right you would only get the
latest security update if you got like
Android or something after and that
would have to go through crazy approvals
with carriers with handset makers in the
long so what they do now instead is like
send updates that are just security only
which is similar to what Apple does with
iOS updates so that I'm also inclined to
believe in them on but there are some
other issues that like they didn't
really point out or kind of like
deflected about so one of the issues
that I had so when they're talking about
where do it we're getting better at app
security they're not that's specifically
only for the Google Play Store and there
there are entire markets out there that
don't have access to that store and have
to silence idle yeah China for example
does not have Google Play so there are
tons of third-party app stores out yeah
and even if you know they're getting
these retrofitted security like features
there are like other ways for you to
breach into like an android device like
specifically through these apps or
something like that so I I take them at
their word for it for like some of these
points but there are other points where
I'm like I know better about this and I
don't really buy it I will say they've
done a good job of offering these
security updates to more devices
although it's there are still plenty of
millions of dollars that probably don't
get these updates as quickly as they
should all right next up the US Treasury
Department just leveled sanctions
against several Russian entities and
individuals this is pertaining to the
u.s. election this is not Pecha even
though electrical grid Alfred you have
most of details yet what's going on here
so they announced this about an hour ago
this is specifically about the election
tampering so some of the entities
include the internet research agency
which a special counsel Bob Mueller
found charges against in February and
also on the not petit attack which they
said the Russian military carried out it
was supposed to be the most destructive
cyber attack in history these are these
are sanctions similar to sanctions that
have been you know sent against Russia
before but these are related to
specifically related to these cyber
attacks that have been going on all
right so it's a big security as I said
Intel's
Allen says it has a fixed respecter
that's coming out new chips and that is
basically patched up existing devices
with software updates CEO is out with a
blog post basically telling you to
update your computer now and Alfred
lastly you wrote this piece or from the
Kaspersky security summit one of the
themes there was the fact that you know
IOT continues to be a big security issue
and specifically older devices right so
should we should we just be afraid all
the time I mean you should you should
look at your older IOT devices
differently so you know everyone talked
about how they're improving IOT for the
future you know politicians talk about
these bills that they're putting out for
things that we're gonna buy soon and
security companies have all these new
solutions for IOT devices and
manufacturers in the future keyword
being the future the idea is that there
are still about eight billion IOT
devices that are out now and when I was
at this conference they were basically
looking at older IOT devices that people
have generally forgotten about and it's
like oh here's this vulnerability and
here's this vulnerability and then when
I reach out to the companies about it
the idea is oh yeah we can't really fix
that or like that's like so old that
like we don't really focus on that
anymore which that is like the bigger
problem here and that's a billion that
is a staggering number all right all the
time we have four more of these stories
just cuz I was seen it I'm dr. Chang I'm
out for ding thanks for listening ah yes
he's good vodka everything I mean sorry
hey BJ back here at 359 I'm not a
Russian spy I was trying to Russian eyes
your name but I couldn't like I can't
figure what what it would be we G PG VG
ski alright so thanks everybody for
joining us I'm gonna go ahead and start
jumping through your comments and
questions in the chat pulling out some
good stuff to keep the conversation
going in the meantime you guys can talk
amongst yourselves so I mean from the
kaspersky conference I mean what was for
you what was the most I guess shocking
or surprising hack definitely definitely
the robot one okay only so yes only
because of the response that I got from
the companies when I reached out to them
what was the response
I reached out to some people that like
wrote the software behind it and they
they basically said usually when you
reach out to a company like oh here
these security issues that we found are
you fixing this or anything like they
usually say we're working on a fix bla
bla bla this response was basically we
built this without security in mind
alright so they
admitted that they built a theory and it
was like the idea was it's not up to us
to implement the security it's up to the
people that put this software in their
robots they basically said like we kind
of wipe their hands of this yeah they're
they're argument was like if a carpenter
builds a home and then the person that
light-like lives in that home doesn't
use a lock on it like how is the
carpenter at fault here well kind of
thing Wow I mean you know what it's
shocking but it's probably true for a
lot of companies they're probably not
thinking about security in mind when
they they give you that sort of can
responsive like we're working on a
Security's party yeah that's probably
the case they're probably like what this
company's thinking we didn't think about
this in the first place
now we're scrambling yeah so that but
the thing is they weren't scrambling
though they were just like yeah this
wasn't we there was some weird line
we're in where it was just basically
like we didn't build security in it
because we'd rather not like mess it's
worse to mess up security than it is to
like try it at haul it ourselves those
the idea that like they're so bad
security they were afraid that if they
tried to add it they would like they
would mess up the whole robot system
itself which it's just like well then
maybe you should make a robot add
response and the problem with this with
the robot one too was that like this is
this is a robot it's pepper which like
they show at CES yeah the time course
cuz it's like oh it's like cool and I
can talk to you I mean it's at malls
it's at like ours yes all this stuff
airports and it could be secure if it
was on its own Wi-Fi network what the
thing is because it's always in these
public places they're not gonna set up
like its own one just for that robot so
yeah that that was like the most
surprising once we also did see a smart
cam one that used to be owned by Samsung
right they demonstrated that one in
front of us where it was like they had
these two smart cameras were both
connected to the cloud and then it was
basically okay we're gonna take footage
from this camera and make you see it
from like yeah even though this camera
that's like right in front of me just
like the movies what movies I don't know
you know when they switch the camera
feeds the security that did happen in
Black Panther I mean that happened to
like yeah yeah so yeah it was weird to
see that like actually happen realized
yeah all right what questions do we got
let's start things off with the almighty
ever-present sir enjoy
enjoy man Google has tightened its Play
Store or malware's for sure but why
aren't they promoting the Android
privacy guard which is only open source
and available mainly in custom roms
that's a great question I don't know why
they're not promote yeah they promoted
its so little that I actually don't know
what that is yeah I mean I've no I have
heard of it but I don't know much about
it because as just said talk about it
too much they probably don't promote it
that much because it's only available in
custom roms it doesn't sound like
something that's coming through that
yeah so like if anything they're
probably trying to discourage from
custom roms because that's half of what
mal where it comes from and you know
that something like that where it calls
itself I need to know more about like
privacy guard but like that is how a lot
of malware spreads through devices where
they promote it as like this like
antivirus kind of thing and it turns out
to actually be the virus that was in my
mobile security story I wrote last
week's is the worst season of black
mirror yet so there there there was a
massive mobile malware campaign that hit
like hundreds of thousands of phones
across like 20 countries and it did it
by spoofing a Android apps for signal
and whatsapp which are supposed to be
like secure communications apps what
they did was they would go to like these
activist groups on Facebook and made a
post like don't use signal it's been
compromised use this is our updated
secure version of it that you can't get
from the app store well and it got like
thousands of people that way so that's
my point like like something that
promotes itself as being secure if it's
like it can also be like Mauer all right
there you go
and like Lakshmi's come Android is safe
too everyone stops downloading dumb
stuff yeah the beautiful utopia that we
hope does well no I mean there's so
there's still flaws in Android that are
exploited to Google's you know Google's
defense I think that bad gotten a lot
better yeah
III would say this is for like their
their argument here is that we're just
as safe if you like like the comments
I'd like if you stop downloading stupid
things like if you just play by our
rules
completely and like don't try anything
stupid then yeah we're like a pretty
safe and that's just like security
hygiene like 101 that's right you know
like don't sideload apps or anything
like that
I mean it's look it's Android being less
secure than iPhone is inherent because
it's not a closed system like yeah Apple
doesn't have or Google doesn't have full
control of anything you could do with
the phone and where you get your apps
yeah that's the that's the thing with
iOS is that like they're not saying like
hey please don't do anything dumb it's
like you can't do anything like that but
I think what Google was trying to say
like and with like this announcement was
more so that we have the same amount of
zero days as other come as our
competitors right in the sense that like
there's no like massive like hack
against it like not related to apps or
anything like that like specifically
zero days because like their biggest
proof was we haven't paid out a large
bug bounty in like years and that's the
idea is that like no hackers have been
able to like come to us with like these
vulnerabilities or anything like that
my argument against that is if it was
really a vulnerability that was worth it
what makes you think that somebody's
gonna come to you and like hey right as
opposed to just exploit it yeah to be
fair though they pay a lot for it that's
the whole idea of bug bounties that
where I pay you more than what you would
get for this if you use it criminally
back into the chat coming in from Servan
should I install any kind of antivirus
app to make my Android more secure and I
think this is actually a good relevant
question in lieu of these updated
security measures so I was it redundant
I think if you have good hygiene about
it then you don't really have to worry
that much but I understand that you know
if you want an extra level of security
just to make sure you know because you
you you don't know like what everything
is going on on your phone is lookout has
actually done a very good job at like
preventing mobile malware attacks I used
to be very skeptical of it but I I've
like dug through their research alone
I've spoken with their researchers I
spoke time for that mobile malware story
- sure they scan your phone like
regularly they check for like
man-in-the-middle attacks if you're on
Wi-Fi I'm like public Wi-Fi or anything
like that
yeah lookout has actually done a fairly
decent job at it I haven't looked into
other like mobile security apps lookout
is definitely up there though but as you
said like really the big thing is having
good security practices yeah downloading
off with third-party apps be mindful of
what you down yeah I'll be mindful what
permissions you give to specific apps
even if they apps you download from
Google I would equate it to like going
to the dentist though where like they
would also tell you like oh if you just
like practice good like dental hygiene
you don't need to worry about anything
but you would still go to your dentist
to like check yeah if there's anything
you might not know good analogy yeah I
never would have thought about it like
that so we have to floss my phone now
yeah like my biggest advice is always to
like practice like the best you know
security hygiene that you can like but
there are some things that you might not
be able to see right here comes a
question from Karl what about Bluetooth
vulnerability ooh
those are like those are pretty rare and
the issue with that is that you first of
all I don't if you have bluetooth on all
the time I don't know why you - I do
oh yeah I don't I don't that's more like
security aside that she's like like a
battery thing for me right yeah I mean
look I have it because I have my
headphones on and I just forget them
turn them off yeah not like I mean to
have them on all the time I just forget
I also use my phone to remote-control a
lot of the stuff around here in the
studio well yeah but like there's been
blue two vulnerabilities like named in
the past but I always go back to the
ideas like it's mostly targeted attacks
in the sense they have to be close
they'd have to be in your Bluetooth
range to do it but they're there there
is an idea that you know they might not
be targeting you because both of you not
told me you both like leave your
Bluetooth on all the time I saw I've
turned them off now just like I assumed
the majority of people do so like I'm
tired all day would worry about if I
yeah but like think about like how many
people have would have their phones with
Bluetooth on at like a Starbucks or
something like that right I could like
walk in and scan for like any like open
like networks like I really do yeah true
here comes a question from BVG in the
room so
what this is another DVD here no I
looked at the screen there's BVG so okay
being a previous iPhone user and having
recently jumped over to the Samsung
train what's up and experiencing both
the App Store in the Play Store in
pretty thorough detail and do do you
think there's ever a chance that Google
will try to restrict the Play Store in
the same fashion that iPhone has that's
one thing to say is the App Store is
much more policed let's call it as far
as I think that's a Pandora's box that
might be going down a dangerous road
that would start to be too exclusive for
the Android ecosystem no no I mean I
mean how many pretty well for the App
Store I don't go has a step up there
they have stepped up but it's still
nowhere near as no bare bones my
argument against against like this like
whole open thing that Android does is
just like how many apps do you really
use any way that you would need like
this like open like network where
millions of apps are flowing in like it
like you really only use like what like
30 to 50 apps on your phone it's that
yeah and it's just like what do you need
like all these haps 4i I think it should
be everyone's not using the same 30 or
40 yeah right that's that's the issues
like there are people who are gonna use
this app that you will never touch and
that's the issue yes that that's a
selling point for Google's because it's
open it'll cater to your very very
specific needs right things like I don't
know if you're mountain climbers were
mountain climbing up I'll never have a
mountain climbing app on my phone but
someone's going to large number of
people will yeah but like that app would
be able to go through like it's a fairly
innocuous example but I mean I'm not
telling like don't ban like niche like
like don't don't allow like niche apps
like that I'm saying more like they
should be like a lot more careful if
like curating them yeah for sure
what's up the John Falcone out the
window peeking in we really need to make
a compilation of falcone look-ins we
should I'll work on that supercut next
week
I have a hundred and fifty three apps on
my phone yes
how many do you use though all of them
really don't we all use our dietary
devices we have remote control cameras
here at the studio there's a lot of
pizza places near my apartment that's
one app though no no there are multiple
app to get the coupons man oh wow dude
just putting that out there all right
there you go
all right let's shift gears over into
cybersecurity from Mike Shaw shift gears
we've been that's the whole shot well I
know but let's talk about IOT sorry your
cybersecurity is only as strong as its
weakest link if you have an IOT device
on your network you have an unlocked
door Alfred you've gone down this path
many times and we've seen so many
devices act as what I've mentioned
before a Pandora's box yeah I wouldn't I
wouldn't throw all IOT devices in that
hole certainly like it's true that IOT
devices are like very bad at security
but I think Amazon and Google have
worked very hard to you know make sure
that like their home assistants don't
really have that many breaches or
anything like that it's really more like
the the smart home gadgets that you'd
get like the third party there yeah I'm
like lesser-known yeah the the amazing
deal that you got on that like smart
light $7.00 lipo probably is not secure
at all and yeah he does have that point
about you know your eye your security's
about as strong as like your weakest
link
right so it doesn't matter if like the
rest of your house is like very sick so
you've got nest and you've got Amazon
everything here and then you've got like
this one Chinese made light bulb yeah
and like vacant most likely access your
network through that no yeah it's a very
good point it's a poison let's what's
what's the right analogy for it link
yeah all right fine we are almost out of
time
I'm trying to think of a good way to
like bring this down and close it out we
we've kind of questioned conversation
yeah I mean do you think what's the
right phrase I want to use on this are
we all screwed I've been on the show
I've been on the show like three days
now talking about like another ioad like
security issue
and I think I've ended all of them we've
just like everything sucks what is going
to be the the rhetorical event
theoretical event that would end up just
crumbling the entire foundation I don't
know because it kind of already happened
with the Mirai botnet attack last like
16 when they shut down Netflix and
Twitter and Spotify for like what like
two-three hours and you know it's these
issues are still here so I I don't know
what its gonna take for a change or
something like that but yeah everything
sucks what what what do you guys do just
on your day-to-day maintenance in your
own IOT devices in cybersecurity what is
your own personal protocol for trying to
keep yourself safe besides keeping your
Bluetooth off I don't have ya IOT
objects I have like I mean that's the
same way I've got well I have I have
like two smart switches that are fairly
name-brand
I won't say what they are and then I've
got like I've got two echos and that's
pretty much it yeah I pretty much only
have voice assistance you guys don't
have that like I love each dollar fridge
in your home no I have the fridge my
landlord gave me yeah and will give me
if this one breaks I just I bought my
own fridge it's a nice fridge it's not
smart at all it's completely dumb oh
yeah your does dispense water and ice
which was huge for me living in most
with in Manhattan apartments with small
fridges that that was a big perv but
like the whole idea of it being smart
and connected and be able to like send
me recipes I didn't care about that
stuff and then the vulnerability issue
was definitely in my mind with thought
about refrigerators thought about
appliances in general so make sure to
brush your smart speaker floss your
phone daily and always wipe front to
back good site data
wipe the data front of the back there
you go the end of the show for the week
week Wow
but you but quick week I know that's
good and bad from breaking news every
morning yeah exhausted let's hope not
even supposed to be on right now what do
you Dante from clerks
do you like David you saw her hurt here
check us out on CNET our podcast is
available in itunes tune in stitcher
Feedburner google play music and the
amazon echo see y'all next week take
care everyone see you Monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
