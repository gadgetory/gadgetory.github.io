Stephen said again this the show we

bad we expand on the topics that we
talked about we add new information
because as the week goes on news stories
come up new things drop we're here to
talk about it all with you we have
people watching live on livestream we

engaging collaborative experience yes
also for you all make sure you call us
we got plenty of calls every week 1 800
61 62 63 8 we get calls when we haven't
done a show I know right you had like a
giant stack of calls this week so that's
awesome Apple by nation runs deep all
your Apple biters okay so let's get to
the show we're gonna we know the Super
Bowl has passed but I think there's one
great story that came from the Super
Bowl and this was tim cook's Super Bowl
pic fiasco so like after after the game
right Tim Cook put up a tweet and it
said something along the lines of Rocky
Mountain Colorado congrats Rocky
Mountain High congrats to the Broncos so
he posted this picture now those of you
that are aren't watching you're gonna
have to bear with me but it was arguably
the worst framed glorious picture of all
time is horrible like he had to be
running he there's no way he was using
an iphone with image optical optical
image stabilization it was a bad it was
a bad like he was in a hurry or
something he was like running across the
field
looks like it was a bad look for Apple
so like everyone started like butchering
them online you're like a nice phone
nice camera hey my android phone doesn't
do that hey my motorola razr takes a
better picture than that I it was that
bad okay it's terrible I even I mean I
saw it I instantly started laughing
needs act like tweet that side sorry
Treena thought it was hilarious like how
do they do that oh right and then quite
honestly I thought with a little magic
of photoshop maybe you know it could be
part of the next iPhone shot on an
iPhone campaign I've the people that are
watching I i put this billboard together
it's very powerful and impactful don't
adjust your screen that's a blur that's
a really blurry picture I can't believe
how long do you how quick do you think
is PR people were texting and being like
hey can you take that picture down you
just we two mr. cook so Tim Cook
literally took down the photo like to
extend the story he was getting hammered
so much about it he took it down and I
think by taking it down even more people
were like what what just happened yeah
right you you end up talking more about
because he took down the photo so
ultimately look we all know well I like
I don't know what what drove him to even
post that I know wasn't drunk he was at
the super busy drugs you know you got
the Super Bowl you have to tweet a
picture but like I don't have you had
picture yeah I mean my mom could take a
better picture if she was falling down
I've seen my pic my kids take better
pictures ever seen anyways uh it it was
not it was not the prettiest look for
Apple but they took care of it by
deleting the tweet I'm sure someone in
the PR chain told them you need to do
that also in not so hot news surrounding
the world of Apple really specifically I
phone sixes the stories continue to gain
momentum and gain steam you may or may
not have heard of what's called a what's
called error 53 now why is this
important to you if you have an iPhone 6
what happens is that touch ID and
Apple's iPhone has this kind of
validation that happens and when people
have repaired their phones and replace
the screens and use third-party parts
the phone isn't able to make a
validation that says these are authentic
apple parts and I know some people are
rolling their eyes but how many times
have you broken do you
have a shattered screen on your phone
for a while no no my wife did though
yeah yeah so how many times I know
people that have broken their screens to
three times they're not gonna go to an
apple store to get it fixed right
they're gonna go to like a third party
guy oh yeah and just a place like way
cheaper right yeah you might buy some on
ebay and install on yourself I had a
dude come here and fix my Apple my iPad
in this office beautiful right beautiful
now here's the thing this is what
happened now by replacing your screen
and if it it's unable to validate this
and air 53 pops up after you've updated
the software so let's say you you got
your screen in place a long time ago and
you went to the latest operating system
it would then to completely break your
phone it would break your phone so bad
that you would not even be able to
recover anything from it was just a
brick that's a nightmare a straight-up
brick that's a big problem now people
took their phones in the stores
initially and what happened is that
Apple said oh we can't help you you're
going to need to buy a new phone could
you imagine that sure let me be mad on
another seven eight hundred bucks seeing
that guy or girl could you imagine that
no don't you have that like that sounds
horrible at the same time I understand
exactly what Apple is doing much like a
car or much like a valuable thing that
you have no company is going to it voids
its warranty right we all know that as
soon as you drive it off the lot it
loses some value right and I don't want
if I was a major a multi-million dollar
company I don't want to be responsible
for someone's third party screen who
might cause other problems right it
makes sense the only thing that bugs me
is the fact that this is the first time
we've ever seen Apple completely brick a
product I completely break it because of
this we didn't know about it until now
now its surface it's it's it's reared
its ugly head so now we know okay I'm
not throwing out any bad apples actually
think this is the right way to handle it
from a policy standpoint don't repair
third-party products or third party or
repairs what Apple is now done moving
forward though according to MacRumors is
that some stores are actually doing
repairs on error 53 iphone 6s oh wow
that's good but you will have to pay an
out of warranty fee to get it repaired
as well as replacement parts for them to
get it back in line that sounds like
it's gonna be a pricey fix man it's
gonna be pride it's going to be pricey I
don't like what
but I get what's happening so this is
the first time that's happened it's
never happened on any of the older model
phones well the iphone 6 they've never
taken a stance where they've completely
bricked the phone yeah I've never I've
never heard this story before Apple
commented on it and basically said look
there is secure there is sensitive data
basically meaning your fingerprint
authorizes payments it's linked to
credit cards and they say that they
don't want that information to be
tampered with hence someone you know
potentially trying to be able to then a
quiet let's say make sense grab
someone's phone and somehow because you
were able to access the parts or swap
them out blah blah yeah to me it's it's
a little flimsy but ultimately Apple has
the right to only work on products that
have their parts that makes sense but
they need to get the message out to
their people buying the phone exactly
that's the biggest issue you just you
have no idea and then you go to a third
party person then all of a sudden you
find out you just spend money to fix
your your screen from a third party and
now you have to buy a new phone
altogether no you know like a total lie
exactly an apple has never done this
before now it's now it's happening they
should have let us know a little bit but
you know I'm ultimately gonna find out
the hard way and people like right now
I'm reading them like on periscope
they're like oh that's a BS excuse using
security I actually don't think it's
completely BS I at it makes sense after
you talk about the fringer your
fingerprint is in there your credit
cards it makes it makes more sense I
just think look a company BMW is not
going to repair their car under warranty
if you replace multiple parts from a
third party company yeah they're just
not so um another issue about breaking
your phone that is just surfaced is a on
an apple phone I can't remember exactly
I believe it's January one nineteen
seventy or it's either january seven
someone just refreshed me but what
happened is another bug has been found
allegedly don't do this on your phone
but if you turn the date back to
nineteen seventy jan one it will break
your phone as well that's weird it's
gonna why is it don't go to nineteen
just don't go to 1970
that just started surfacing today I'm
like what is going on with the Apple
bricks today like this week error 53
1970 get out of town the world's
collapsing just want to let you know BB
care what was it called in two thousand
when everything uh y2k white together
cuz Apple y2k so uh just don't Matt dead
don't be a jerk and do that on your
friends phone don't why would you do
that anyway exactly because you're a
jerk that is why you don't be a jerk be
nice people that this is all karma this
is all gadget tech good love people
karma don't do stupid things okay just
to follow up a thing that they're doing
in store we're talking about the brick
phones apple is also i just want to let
people know they're offering belkin a
belkin screen protector application now
they couldn't have chosen a shorter name
this is the name of the program you
ready for this i'm going to actually to
actually repeat what I say okay I'm
gonna say it once in cd-rs belkin's
screen care plus application system
belkin screen care plus application
system say that five times fast I can
barely talk belkin's screen care plus
applications is a belkin screen care
plus application system okay it's
actually easy I said it twice really
cleanly so what they're doing is they're
allowing you if you buy a belkin true
clear and visit glass screen protector
or their anti-glare screen protector you
have the ability to they will install it
in store there's actually like this
device that you seed your phone in it
puts on the screen protector so that
it's you know it's not like your hand
doing and it's all angled all stupid and
then it covers part of the touch ID
button and you're like I have this sucks
it's actually you know down to the
micron so it's lined up I like that okay
that's cool yeah have a professional do
it sure nope sure that that's a cool
service fine whatever I just think it's
funny that all of a sudden this just
happened in like in a timely way like
pop up right like oh we're gonna offer a
screen protection service your screen
that might have broken that you might
have replaced for a third-party screen
then voided your warranty and then did
not validate your touch ID
now won't you know looking out for you
we're looking out for you it sounds to
me like a recall like what the car
companies do when something in their
cars broke in and they say bring it back
to the dealership will fix it for you
sounds like that without calling it a
recall it's like a preemptive strike
Yeah right it's trying to get ahead of
the curve so just to let you all know
belkin screen protector application
belkin screen care plus application
system get it up available to you right
now all right let's talk about apple TV
some really killer news coming around
the world of Apple TV I like hearing
about this stuff TV OS 9.2 their third
beta has just been released they've done
a few improvements on it that i am down
with dictation support now instead of us
having to type individual letters two
words while we're using the search yes i
know there is see research but
specifically in that text field or text
box when you're looking for things you
can actually now dictate into it which
is nice right instead of having to learn
specific commands the other thing that
you can also do is a in app search for
apps by using dictation as well so like
searching the store you have to usually
scroll through everything now i can say
like crossy road remember i was so anti
cross the road when i first saw it and I
probably do it yeah I know I'm into it
man when I first thought I was like dude
that's just a frog a ripoff and then I
came back the next week I'm like dude
it's a frog or ripoff man it's awesome I
got a right cross erode legit so TV OS
9.2 beta 3 showing us what is coming
down the line once they officially
update the OS but we've talked about
Apple TV and how really there's no TV
streaming subscription service right now
and yes people are clamoring right now
look these features should have been
here day one you're right a lot of stuff
bluetooth keyboard support should have
been there day one uh what else third
party room Oh iphone as the app remote
should've been there day one I said is
little half-baked they're working on
bacon it all the way through no I'm not
making excuses for them it's just I've
just kind of accepted like a that's the
way it is so this is kind of interesting
Apple has been considering many reports
have come out of Apple looking to secure
their own exclusive content much like
netflix has exclusive shows much like
amazon has exclusive shows
they are apparently according to The
Hollywood Reporter they will be doing
their first scripted television series
featuring none other than dr. Dre the
doc dr. Dre I you know what it's very
interesting because he doesn't have any
experience producing television as far
as I know well he's not really producing
it as much this is going to be like a
scripted show that is supposed to be
taking on um it's called vital signs
it's going to be taking on like kind of
like aspects of his life but not really
be something about his wife no they said
its scripted it's going to be a
six-episode vehicle called vital signs
they believe that the show will be
exclusively distributed through Apple
music which then to me is like what
don't put it just directly through Apple
music that makes no sense but then what
I also thought was a little you know
suspect or maybe interesting depending
on what you want the show itself has
been described as a dark drama with no
shortage of violence and sex in fact
filming from Monday and Tuesday featured
an extended orgy scene ooh just like dr.
Dre video but here's the thing like root
you know after Straight Outta Compton
came out there were reports that started
surfacing about how you know dr. James
past with women yeah not so positive
yeah and for them to just basically say
okay we're gonna do a series with dr.
dre they were apple kind of distance
themselves from that right to try and
stay away from the controversy Trey said
oh that was a long time ago you know I'm
a different person is he publicly
apologized women no one really got on
him about it as much but then you're
jumping right in and then doing a series
like this and the Apple is behind it I
find that those two messages and
ideology there's a disconnect reconnect
for sure they're there something's and
at the same time I've got to also say
this is the best show that you could
come out with your first your first show
Apple yeah like this is the kind of lag
refers show this the best thing you can
do what is that other hip-hop show mogul
show I time I Empire and pie
let's not talk about any try they trying
to like ride those coattails empire and
nothing can top empire not i know
there's a what's the other one honest
stars is it called a power something
yeah yeah fifty central power no no no
empires where it's at like for those you
wanna watch empire well here's the thing
what i like the most about Empire is
that they give attention to groups that
have not been able and i'm not just
timeout african-americans or blacks
there they showcase like you know the
lesbian gay community they they show
aspects of culture that we haven't seen
explained thoughtfully smart fully smart
fully i can't even say that makes sense
partly out smartphone in a smart way
they're exploring different avenues of
life and culture that we'd never have
seen on a network television show so I
appreciate that let's go it has nothing
to do with my culture I just like the
fact that they're showing these things
because it opens doors for other
programming in the future to be able to
explore these ideas and be like hey a
national audience will actually watch
this stuff yeah where they haven't
before I'm just surprised like Apple
didn't go after like a huge very
successful TV producer or something in
that movie producer just dr. Dre just
seems like okay Weezy he's already part
of beats we already have them on the
payroll so thank you it's a big TV to
you made that good movie so that's the
rumblings of whatsapp I just think it's
just a little curious and unfortunately
sure you can tag a big name to a show
and everyone's like Oh dr. Dre's doing a
show it's only six episodes it's
basically a pilot I'm gonna be curious
to see how well received it is and if
this chatter about draya's past comes
back to kind of I don't want to say give
this show a black guy but I did but if
that's going to you know hurt this show
yeah they didn't they didn't need to do
that so we'll definitely hear more about
it but I'm not gonna knock on the show
yet I am always one to don't not gonna
let you tried it right ipad pro apple
watch don't knock it unless you tried it
I tried and I knocked it I'm not gonna
little noggin this that's on ebay right
now um so we will see how that all
happens but just kind of some other news
about Apple and involving the apple TV
is the NFL is pretty much like not
auctioning but they're talking to a
riety of different digital partners to
be the official digital streaming
partner for thursday night football now
why is this interesting look at these
names and involved here this is from
variety Apple Google Amazon and Verizon
these are for non-traditional content
providers will amazon I guess you could
say it has original programming yeah but
these are tech companies that are
getting into the content business that's
amazing as media has changed content is
king yes so Apple is basically in a
bidding war Google apparently looks like
one of the frontrunners to to do NFL
thursday night football now anyone that
knows football knows that Thursday games
are pretty much the worst product the
NFL can only choose okay that weakest
teams on a short week everyone is beat
up and it's just like it's honestly like
the last football game you want to watch
yeah tough totally Thursday night I mean
like I was shocked that they even
started doing thursday night football
and when they first did you know I was
like I get monday night football but I
don't know I'm just funny I'm a 49ers
fan who's in pain this year i think that
the Thursday night game was like Niners
bears one time and I'm like I'm like I
am not watching around that was that the
one game than I don't think they won
though it there was I think I can't
remember it was something like I was
just like and change the channel I'm
gonna funny though they're in a bidding
war for thursday night football who had
it before i was like and be so those on
it was on TV but this is yeah
exclusively digital so in the past you
know you sign into an app like an NBC
app or a CBS app or NFL network type you
know dealio and it gives you you use
your cable credentials and allows you to
watch it so they're actually saying no
we're gonna give Apple or Google or
Amazon the exclusive digital streaming
right so you don't even really need to
sign in with any carrier or a cable
operator you just sign in to your apple
account which is probably already signed
in and you start watching Thursday Night
Football hmm so we're gonna see where
this dolly charge a premium on they will
they may they may or may not though
depending on if Apple by Apple sitting
on two hundred billion dollars they pay
enough maybe that's the other way to get
people to come to apple TV exactly knows
so this is what these companies are
thinking um and like we've said Apple is
also still looking to develop more
original TV content
CBS is CEO Leslie Moonves says he has
had not had any recent talks with Apple
over the past three or four months and
that's actually probably bad news if
you're looking for apples TV streaming
service to come around anytime soon if
they haven't talked to the CBS now what
chairman of CBS now our parent company
for the record let me just throw that
out there so y'all don't get crazy on me
which also by the way broke the record
for most streams at the Super Bowl this
year CBS com cbssports com gotta gotta
pimp that out you can't see my eyes
everybody i just gave Stephen beachy guy
rollick I'm like big eye roll really
that's pretty cool though this is cool
now let me something you gotta watch
everything online now so that's true
makes sense transitioning over to some
iphone tidbits the iPhone 5se according
to a report from Macotakara Japanese
based website may come and silver may
come in Space Gray may also come in
bright pink that's not shocking like not
rose gold oh but it's not like rose gold
dude this is like t-mobile pink like
pretty and pink legally blond pink hot
pink hop you like this yeah I mean they
did that with the the imax and ipod
touches nana iphone 5c was not discolor
to maybe or is like bright yellow and
blue I remember so I mean my whole thing
is that I watched you know I feel like
look this is a lower end phone it's not
gonna be the flagship phone so a lot of
parents might get this for their kids
right oh yeah that makes sense yeah
right how many of you out there wouldn't
would want to get an iphone a a pink
iphone for you for your young daughters
or a young young man i mean it's it's
it's a it's a different world now so
anybody can get a pinko phone yeah i
just think that it really more appeal to
the hello kitty market yeah we like
kitty style sticker bling be jewel all
that why not yeah why not I know my
niece's would love that okay also just
to kind of branch over to some other
phone use iphone 7s processor expected
to be manufactured solely by TSMC the
reason why this is interesting is in the
past apples that other manufacturers
work on their a 9 processor but
according to this report TSMC will be
doing that and then
if you want to look down to the future
AT&amp;amp;T has started testing 5g five-point
networks yeah we're 4g home fo fo g
where would you fo de right now see
they're turning on a few of the towers
around here making them 5g basically so
they're testing this out coin reports
it's 10 to 100 times faster than 4g LTE
depending on your area let's be real
it's probably more like 10 * not even
close to a hundred I know it's like it's
a hundred times faster in an isolated
room when you're sitting right next to
it right yeah like when you're 10 feet
away like three bars of like 4g it's
still slow I'm like well why is it so
maybe it's cuz it's 18 I know this
sounds exciting uh it's not coming
anytime soon i think that the report
says I'll 18teen themselves might be
around three or four years until we
actually see 5g in our phone ah so stick
without Wi-Fi yo 2020 Wi-Fi unless it's
bad Wi-Fi actually yeah home Wi-Fi with
a comcast business plan that works that
works a business Wi-Fi that you like
like starbucks Wi-Fi uh not know it's
like 50 people on it not as good no not
as good bus Wi-Fi so don't work I've
actually never been on a bus with Wi-Fi
and havin attempted to try it all the
buses that go to ala me to have Wi-Fi
and it's like it's hit or miss it'll
work really good or it won't so you know
all right um another quick note Apple
music officially on sonos so knows the
super dope but not the most affordable
multi-room speaker system actually
really want to get a so no setup
eventually when I get a house oh yeah I
think it's cool just put speaker all
over here every room lane different
songs in different rooms and that's a
first that's that's a rich guy thing
basically oh yeah yeah I'm thinking
about I'm like yeah I really want a soda
in my room like yeah but that's a that's
a rich guy problem yeah outside in the
bathroom oh yeah my music in my bathroom
is playing different than one of my
living room while my wife is cooking or
my significant others gig that is a rich
person problem we know that what am I
talking about this is stupid okay and I
don't know if this is related at all I
guess I'm sure it is I just show it so
for all you that follow kanye west
easy Jesus he recently had a at madison
square garden right he was showing off
Yeezy season 3 like his fashion line and
he was also plain tracks from his latest
album which has now been is officially
called the life of Pablo you know he had
a twitter contest where he said name of
the album he's changed the album like
five times from like splash two waves or
I don't know what it is like oh yeah
yeah I would waste Twitter when I with
always Khalifa yeah so there's like it's
TLP if you guess it whatever okay people
like shut up are you talking out Kanye
West well he's kind of following the
footsteps of Kim Kardashian and he he
showcased at the easy season three like
this new game okay this new game it's
called only one that of allegedly
reportedly will be available on the App
Store and it's like supposedly his mom
that passed away like on a on like a
Pegasus like flying through the clouds
and it's gonna be a game like it's gonna
be there's an app for that action
there's an app for that it looks pretty
interesting he's totally playing off to
like you internet unicorn yeah yeah so I
just we'll just want to let y'all know
what a kanye west is up to in the tech
world yeah here he is in his 480p video
of you know this is the only video we
can find it so or ATP they streamed it
exclusively on title and it was having
streaming problems the only way to watch
it no the only way you could watch it
was like to turn it down to 20 20 to 40
p 240p to watch the stream i think i saw
a headline about that has a bad read up
to the live stream yeah alright we're
having fun here we're gonna let's go
let's go get some phone calls like last
two weeks ago we all joked about the
iPhone 5se and we wanted you all to come
up with your ideas maybe what you think
the five the SE and the iphone 5s he

of your fun little by iPhone 5se entries
we appreciate we like we just like to
have fun and throw that out there but we
do have a few calls so let's get to them
and we'll talk about it and then we'll
wrap things up hi Brian I Steven callin
to let you know what my opinion is on
the iPhone 5se name is my name is Jack
and I'm from rantoul illinois and i
think the iphone 5s see the SE and that
stands for specially enhanced especially
my badge updated version of the iphone
5s okay specially enhanced hey guys it's
matt from framingham massachusetts and i
was wondering if anybody has else had
noticed the stagnant apps development i
guess you would call it on the Apple TV
but they want I've noticed no past
couple weeks there hasn't really been in
new apps disappeared and I was wondering
if you thought that maybe yeah this was
going to be at render gave just
underdeveloped long longer show thanks
guys hi
you're right on the money that the Apple
TV app store has really not been
refreshed with anything new anything
compelling I think what it comes down
tonight we alluded to this a while back
Apple's now pretty much built so many
devices that developers have to develop
for that they have to choose how they're
going to invest now you can always scale
up and add like a sorry a game like
Jetpack Joyride right that's easy but
new innovative apps I haven't seen it I
thought I'd see a flood of more you know
shopping interactive based app so we
still haven't seen a real true you know
some of that teaser they gave us with
MLB interacting with scores and stats
while watching it we haven't seen that I
think when it comes down to is Apple's
conundrum of where are you going to put
your resources for developers and
developers are responding why haven't we
seen that many apple watch apps they're
like dude we have the iphone we have
multiple sized screens for the iphones
we have the Apple TV we have the ipad
pro like people aren't really making
specific apps for space for specifically
for the ipad pro still right yeah you're
seeing the same thing happened with the
Apple TV and ultimately the largest
platforms that we have out there is just
the basic iOS phone and Android yeah and
that's where they're gonna put them on
I'm sorry I'm sorry you know windows
mobile like Windows Mobile is a great
iOS they don't have developers jumping
on board because the market isn't there
and their apps all look really cheesy
too and like very simple you know yeah
the developers just have to get excited
about it that's why they have the world
developers worldwide developers
conference get them all pumped up you
know so but you like you can see how
that marriage between developer and
hardware it doesn't mean anything if no
one's developing on your platform yeah
you could have the greatest phone of all
time the greatest product and if no one
develops for it it doesn't mean squat
yep so what typically when you see a
game for the first time come out
typically they'll put it on iOS first
where do you see kind of some of these
crazy apps that gain steam like a
periscope for example you see it on iOS
first they bring android support a
little later
but that's what has happened and what
continues to happen yeah so it's a
bummer but yeah I agree with you I I
haven't seen much I keep on searching
hoping but nothing has popped up all
right let's give our next call this is
the last call by the way hello um I'd
like to know if maybe it would be worth
it to upgrade from my iphone4 to an
iphone success thank you by clicking on
ends call which is why you should update
upgrade good success cuz you cannot end
your call wait wait how long how this
goes on for another minute Brian it's
another 56 seconds I'd be like hey come
on hang up the phone okay it's your own
an iphone 4 which arguably for the
record I have said was one of the best
designed iPhones I love it- antennagate
right yeah it was before but that was
right it was sturdy it i just thought it
had a killer design if they just took
that design and made it the current size
of screen a little thinner i would be
all over it i love the iphone floor
design yes if it fits so perfectly in
your hand to know yeah yeah we do
everything in one hand it was a good
deal yeah so um yeah upgrade your phone
man i think that that's yeah that's a
good call mmm i think i think i'm gonna
lean towards that direction all right is
that going to do for this event doesn't
man awesome so then everybody thank you
so much for listening to continue to
support the show we continue to do it we
have fun doing it again the number to
