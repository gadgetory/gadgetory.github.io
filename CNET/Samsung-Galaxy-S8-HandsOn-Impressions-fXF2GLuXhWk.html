a year ago you had a flat screen in a
physical home button with a fingerprint
reader now as the galaxy s 8 you have a
screen that curves on both sides no
physical home button and a fingerprint
reader on the back you're also taller
narrower and managed to have a larger
screen than even that ill-fated Galaxy
Note 7 and your supersize sibling known
as the s8 plus provides a whopping six
point two inches of screen space on top
of that you're light and easy to use
even with one hand you are looking good
I don't mind the fact that you traded
your home button for an on screen
control it maximizes the screen real
estate and I can still launch Google
assistant in my recent apps I also like
this refreshed look you've got going on
and that current version of Android 7.1
but can we talk about that fingerprint
scanner for a minute it is far too close
to the camera lens which means smudge
City I've also got a little bone to pick
with Bixby your new digital assistant
it's cool that it can work with the
phone settings surface cards a lot like
Google now and even identify text and
objects through the camera but it's
going to be limited at first and not
every demo worked when I tried it of
course you were running pre-final
software and Bixby is updating all the
time but it sure did leave a bad taste
now how about your camera pressing the
power button twice to launch it worked
really well and there are some new ways
to interact with camera tools like
zooming in and out snapping a pic and
decorating my friends I also dig the
selfie cams ability to autofocus which
will be useful for large group shots but
I did notice that you're sticking with
your 112 megapixel lens when some fans
were hoping for more luckily you're also
keeping that water-resistant body and
wireless charging capability plus you've
added faster face unlocking a way to
control smart home appliances and the
ability to turn into a workstation
through the new Samsung dec stock plus a
few other tidbits here and there I've
got a say Galaxy s8 your new design
looks really elegant the competition is
fierce and Bixby feels incomplete we'll
just have to wait to see how you perform
once you launch for real</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
