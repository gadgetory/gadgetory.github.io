Samsung Galaxy book to the Microsoft
Surface pro it's a big and powerful
Windows 10 tablet that has a keyboard
cover and stylus
unlike the surface though it includes
the accessories with the base price
which starts at $1,300 yeah it's
expensive but so is the Microsoft
Surface the 12-inch galaxy book features
a fanless 7th gen Intel Core i5
processor and a beautiful Super AMOLED
screen which is comparable to some
high-end TVs it's not necessarily made
for binge watching as much as it is
working on the go but if you find
yourself occasionally using it as a
portable TV I wouldn't blame you it is a
little heavy for handheld use though so
you'll want to use the stand the galaxy
book depends on its keyboard case of the
kickstand so it's limited to a few
different configurations in comparison
the circus has a built-in kickstand that
sits in any position on the plus-side
since you don't have the extra girth of
a built-in kickstand you get a rather
svelte looking large tablet the rounded
edges on the galaxy book also make it
look more like an iPad pro than a boxy
surface the keyboard accessory itself is
fine
it's comfortable enough and I really
liked the buttery smooth texture of the
chassis
but it felt floppy to type on if not on
a completely flat surface to be fair
this is typical of folio type keyboards
and one of the big reasons why the
kickstand on the surface is such an
elegant alternative performance-wise it
did pretty well at multitasking using
split screen mode and having multiple
apps running at the same time didn't
cause any problems chrome was a little
buggy and crashed at times in typical
Microsoft manner edge browser performed
a lot smoother the top half of the
tablet did get a little hot after long
periods of heavy use since I mostly used
it while propped up on the sand I wasn't
too bothered we haven't finished battery
testing on it but results look promising
Samsung estimates an 11 hour battery
life and after 2 runs it's averaging
about ten point two hours while
comparable to the surface line the
keyboard accessory for the Samsung
Galaxy book just doesn't live up to the
streamlined design of the Microsoft
Surface tablet but if you don't care
about that the galaxy book is a great
option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
