teakettle can land you in some pretty
hot water we decided to take a look at
the i' kettle from Smarter an internet
of things connected device where you can
boil water from an app on your phone
IOT devices have become increasingly
notorious for how easy they are to hack
and we brought in Jason heart from
gemalto security to give us a
demonstration it turns out there's a lot
worse things that could happen than
somebody boiling your water without your
permission so what happens if a smart
tea kettle gets hacked so there's
actually two problems here the first one
is actually the attacker taking control
of you
smart tea kettle but also using the
kettle itself to gain access to your
home Wi-Fi which you spent you know a
lot of money and time and effort
securing your home Wi-Fi network so no
matter how secure you make your home
Wi-Fi network it doesn't matter if it's
encrypted or if your password is 16
characters long
if this smart tea kettle or any insecure
Internet of Things devices is connected
to it it can be easily hacked as Jason
demonstrated but first some tea we're
just sending remote commands to the
kettle in this case the kettle has six
or seven different commands the
temperature on or off that's it so what
command did you just send to have it
boil we just sent at which is the
command to say you know at ready for
this in this particular coding language
+ hello kettle equals 0 1 2 switch the
kettle on
as you can see Jason was able to send a
command from his laptop to the smart
kettle after busting through the stupid
simple password 6 zeros it's
particularly bad considering that you
can't change the password on this smart
kettle but what's worse is that once a
hacker like Jason is in your kettle he's
got the rest of your house - and someone
can just come along remotely extract
that private Wi-Fi key and then use it
against the network itself you know this
is basic stuff once an attacker has your
home Wi-Fi network the hacker pretty
much has access to everything your home
network is as strong as your weakest
link even if that low boiling point
comes from a tea kettle
