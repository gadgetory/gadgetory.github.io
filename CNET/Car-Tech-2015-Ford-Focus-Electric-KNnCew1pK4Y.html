hatchback it even kind of tastes like a
standard Ford Focus hatchback but if I
were to hop behind the wheel and fire it
up right now it realized that it doesn't
sound anything like a regular Ford Focus
hatchback and that's because this is the
2015 Ford Focus Electric and it doesn't
use a single lick of gas let's hop
behind the wheel and check the text now
here in the cabin you've got pretty much
standard fare Ford Focus interior you've
got the MyFord Touch infotainment system
here and you can check out our previous
reviews of the standard Focus to see our
sort of so-so feelings about that but
over here you've got a very interesting
my Ford touch instrument cluster on one
side you've got a mirror of your
infotainment data and on the other side
you've got a variety of tools that are
going to help you to mind the cars
battery life and range you have a bunch
of different views that you kind of
scroll through using this d-pad on the
steering wheel and that's going to let
you see things like your historical data
and how much battery life you have left
all of these systems are going to be
built around what Ford calls a range
budget and that's at the beginning of
every trip the computer going to
evaluate your range and give you an idea
of how much range you can expect to get
and as you drive and turn on the climate
control system or step on the throttle a
little too much it's going to add or
subtract from that range to let you know
how good you're doing
now when you plug the Ford Focus
Electric into the wall using its
charging port right there on the front
fender that electricity is going to come
in to the onboard charger where it's
going to be converted and then fit back
into the trunk to a 20-3 kilowatt-hour
lithium-ion battery pack where it's
going to be stored that process is going
to take anywhere between three point six
hours and 20 hours depending on whether
you use a 240 volt fast charger or just
plug it into the wall in your garage now
when you're ready to hit the road the
focus is 107 kilowatt electric motor
which is underneath the onboard charger
is going to pull that power from the
battery pack and put about 143
horsepower to the road and about 184
pound-feet of torque you're good for
about 81 miles according to the EPA if
you drive it with a nice light foot now
as is the case with most electric
vehicles not the pedal on this thing
you'll find that it takes off with a lot
more augusto than you think a wimpy
green eco car probably should and that's
because electric vehicles litter all of
their torque instantaneously there's no
winding up the maximum torque at 4500
rpm like you having a gasoline engine
it's all there all immediately of course
you won't want to do a lot of petal
matting in this vehicle if you want to
get anywhere near the 81 miles
prescribed range by the EPA now there
are a lot of advantages to driving an EB
I mean it's a green car there's a lot of
pork but there are a couple of
compromises that come along with it in
the back of your head or always kind of
keeping my eye on the range and looking
for places that you can potentially
charge the vehicle and then of course
paying attention to a lot of auxilary
systems that are going to have an impact
on the range that may not affect the
gasoline vehicle I mean I've never paid
attention to what I fit my climate
controls to before I got into an e V and
I saw that turning the air conditioner
on takes about a five-mile hit off of
your estimated range
now I think part of the appeal of the
2015 Ford Focus Electric is well that it
doesn't draw a lot of attention to
itself it looks like a regular hatchback
aside from the smaller grille in this
charging port right here no one's going
to be able to tell that you're saving
the world one gallon of gas at a time I
kind of like flying under the radar in
that way the other thing I like is the
price and it's easy to price this 2015
Ford Focus Electric because there are no
options twenty-nine 170 gets you out the
door but there are thousands of dollars
in tax incentives they can get your net
price just for those twenty thousand
dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
