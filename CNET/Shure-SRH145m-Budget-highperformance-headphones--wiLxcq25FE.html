budget on your headphone that cost
slightly less than $50 online and sounds
really good for the money
hi I'm David Carr noise and we're always
on lookout for good values in the
headphone category and this sure model
is among the better ones at least in
terms of sound quality before I tell you
about that performance I should clarify
that the m+ version of the headphone has
an integrated Apple friendly inline
remote and microphone while this
standard SRH 145 has no remote and cost
a little less
meanwhile the SRH 144 has a semi-open
back design that allows more sound in
from the outside world all three models
sound virtually the same I can't say I
was blown away by the design of these
shores and they really do have a budget
look and feel to them by that I mean
they're pretty generic however they do
seem pretty sturdily built are a
lightweight and comfortable wear
especially for and on-ear headphone as I
said the sound quality is impressive for
the price point they deliver smooth
relatively accurate sound with good
detail while the bass is it incredibly
powerful it does have good definition
and the headphone should work well with
a variety of music I personally would
spend the extra dough to get this model
but for those who don't care about the
integrated remote and microphone can
save $10 by going with the standard SRH
145 for the SRH 144 they may not be
swanky but they fit well and deliver
strong performance for a reasonable
price I'm David Carr Noy thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
