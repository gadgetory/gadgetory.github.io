military intelligence it seems a concept
that pulls at opposite poles let's try
to make the case for the 2011 BMW 750i
active hybrid
I tell you I don't know what to make of
the six-figure hybrid luck so today like
the hybrid s-class hybrid Lexus LS or
the new Panamera Hybrid isn't it just a
lot of fashion worse apologize 'm not to
be sure all these big battery cars
emphasize performance without penalty
not absolute green inside this car you
got the usual BMW 7 layout with several
cues that tell you this guy's a hybrid
it still having a hard time getting used
to that but let's get to it first of all
I've got the split screen setup with my
hybrid layout on the right you don't
have to have that up there but it's an
interesting reminder that this car has
got the electronics the battery the
regeneration the electric boost all
going and it's a very simple graphic
unlike a lot of the Japanese cars that
kill you with a master's in electrical
engineering when they show you the
hybrid layout we know our sources we've
got CD we've got an aux Jack that
standard I do have an optional USB ipod
deal over here you got to pay more for
that okay this is interesting some new
stuff here under BMW Assist which is
their kind of their OnStar of sorts
there's something I want to show you got
a concierge service you can calm you got
roadside assistance but this is
something new here's BMW search when you
dig into that you get some internet
services you've got a built in cellular
radio in the car once you get into it
you've got this home screen you've got a
bunch of business quotes on the top they
know who the 7-series buyer is news will
let you get some very simple news
headlines but not to read them because
that's a little dangerous it lets you
have them read to you kind of like a
really shabby podcast but the most
interesting tool here is the first one
business search this is getting into the
future how navigation systems and
communication are gonna work I can look
up whatever I'm interested in and once
you find what you're looking for this is
a really quick way to get there click
once click again for start guidance and
off I go to get a cool refreshing drink
one choice in the transmission 8-speed
automatic we've seen this guy before
sport mode is over here but there's
another sport mode that's his dynamic
drive control stuff here and that's
where you've got four modes you've got a
comfort mode here where everything's
kind of lackadaisical easy throttle
response soft suspension you move to
normal and well things are more normal
then you go to sport where you've got
the choice to configure this does it
sporty up the chassis the drivetrain the
driver and the chassis and finally Sport
Plus is the most aggressive set of
settings and there's nothing to
configure there it takes everything to
its most taut holds rpms the hardest
gives you the most response on the
throttle tightens up the dynamic
suspension the most the head-up display
is standard on the hybrid 7 and it's the
best in the business
to the point that it seems only BMW
takes this technology seriously today
this is also one of the first BMWs to
support the new integration of Twitter
Facebook and web radio stations in I
Drive it uses apple's ipod out
technology but the look is still very
much i drive not ios as we saw during
its debut at the Geneva Auto Show you
need to have an iPhone of course and the
smart phone cradle for it for the whole
system to work the only way that you pay
for the joy of ownership you also pay in
the rear end it's not yours no kind of
both there's the problem that's the
active hybrid power unit that little
carpet is known sits there as long as
you own the car that's the electronics
box for this hybrid unfortunately it's
kind of big and it sticks into what's
already an included trunk space now
we're a 7 hybrid have to earn its keep
is here in the engine room
we start off with a 4.4 liter v8 direct
injection double vanos variable valve
Bob Loblaw that's kind of standard BMW
stuff right now including the direct
injection technology then your RAM the
electric assist into that and things get
really interesting 455 horsepower 515
foot-pounds of torque
like that number zero to 64 this forty
eight hundred pound sob is 4.7 seconds
that's almost an act of God 17:26 is the
mpg not
actly studying but again this car is not
going after the Prius oh by the way
while we're here
proof that the Germans never got over
losing that war they've installed these
brain hook to kill you when you're
working on it they even put a little
funny label here saying don't lift your
head up you might get a link you might
see part of your brain hanging here
dripping blood departure that again
works by spotting lane lines reading how
the car is driving and giving you a
rational purchase let's compare the
here's the dirty little secret about
BMWs 7a 7 hybrid delivers 17 26 mpg and
the zero to 60 and 4.7 for a base price
of around 102 3a 740i delivers almost
identical 1725 mpg 0 to 60 in 5.8 while
basing at 70 thousand six almost 32
grand less now equipment does vary
between them but neither is slumming it
so the 7 hybrid
is 1.1 seconds faster at a cost of
nearly 29 hundred dollars per tenth I'd
get the 740 I'd hardly missed the 1.1
seconds in a sprint and even after
loading up a few extra options for
parity I'd have around 20 grand left to
go buy some carbon credits or something
okay let's price for 2011 BMW
ActiveHybrid 750 I good one base price
is 103 with delivery so when you do that
calculation will you figure out how many
years it will take to earn back the
hybrid premium based on fuel savings the
number on this car is like 74 years so
let's ignore that you buy it for other
reasons it's a speedy big guy
the major options you're going to want
are the driver assistance package 1350
for the lane departure warning and also
the Blind Spot Assist technologies the
HUD is built-in the head-up display that
come to the car standard most everything
else does as well but 400 more for the
iPod USB jacks it's an insult I know but
you're gonna want to do it
2200 gets you the rear seat
entertainment system not really
interesting to me but some folks still
like that sort of thing at least the
screens are really wide you're going to
pay 2600 for the night vision with
pedestrian detection again I'm not sold
on that either and the deal of them all
is that multi-camera package for 350
that's like Tata Nano pricing ie don't
get that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
