welcome to the Apple byte the s Edition
for everything good and bad inside the
world of Apple now the iPhone 6s reviews
are in and the consensus is real
positive with 3d touch and the camera
being the two standout features that
everyone is talking about now I'll get
my hands on it just like you this
weekend but the reviews confirm what I
believe from the start
3d touch is going to change how you use
your phone once you have it you won't
want to phone without it and it's just
scratching the surface
I know sure sounds like I'm drinking the
kool-aid but like the saying goes don't
knock it until you've tried it
the same goes for boba now we know the
iPhone is expected to arrive this Friday
for those of you that pre-ordered it but
if you live in certain parts of
Philadelphia and New York City that
won't be the case the Bega has started
sending emails to customers who might be
affected by the shutdown of deliveries
and pickups on Thursday and Friday due
to Pope Francis's visit to the United
States come on Pope you had to come
visit on iPhone Friday now on behalf of
my Apple biters in Philly and the NYC
I'm sorry but you're getting a bad apple
and if I somehow get struck by lightning
or I'm no longer hosting the show next
week you'll know why but maybe you're a
lucky dust like visual designer Adrienne
Alpern from San Diego California somehow
someway her rose gold iPhone slipped
through and she received it five days
before launch so she's showing it off
taking pictures with it and her dog and
just taunting us with more pictures I
mean what did you but she still needs to
learn to shoot video in landscape mode I
know let's be honest just jealous now
Apple is taking steps to remove
malicious code added to some commonly
used apps like WeChat after the first
large-scale attack on Apple's App Store
a counterfeit version of Apple's Xcode
that's normally used for building apps
is being called Xcode ghost and was
downloaded by several developers to
build their apps which were then
released into the App Store now a lot of
times des will go to outside sites to
download Xcode because Apple servers are
hammered when they release new versions
that's how Xcode ghost ended up being
downloaded and you
WeChat has been updated and fixed like
many others but Apple claims there is no
evidence to suggest that Xcode ghost has
been used for anything malicious such as
transmitting personal identification
info but right now security firm eyes
says about 4000 apps have been
compromised and it's up to Apple to
remove them and notify users sounds like
fun
alright Apple has also released a new
iOS 9 software update nine point 0.1 is
now available and adds a few bug fixes
but many of you have pointed out how the
iPads podcast app from Apple still does
not have an option to play a video
podcast fullscreen look here where's the
button to go fullscreen nowhere really
Apple that's an easy bad apple I'll
write a new teardown by I fix it gets us
inside the guts of the new Apple TV no
big surprises here but it can be fun to
look at some of these pics featuring its
dual core 8 processor in red on the top
of the logic board and why not just tear
the Siri remote apart as well
cool now Apple has also released the
second TV OS beta for developers and a
couple new details have come out of it
developers steve town smith says the old
apple remote will still work with the
new Apple TV meaning the new Apple TV
still has an IR receiver which is good
for home theater junkies with universal
remotes also the new Apple TV and it's
Siri remote can sense when you pick it
up and will automatically turn on the
Apple TV if it was in sleep mode so you
don't have to press a button to start it
up all the time anymore and maybe you're
not impressed with all the Apple videos
coming out this year and you're already
looking to the future according to The
Wall Street Journal Apple has designated
its Apple car as a committed project
with a target shipping date of 2019 the
fruit company has been investigating an
Apple branded car over the past year
it's been making plenty of hires within
the automobile industry and even
recently met with California's DMV to
talk about self-driving cars according
to the Guardian now internally it's
called project Titan and the group has
been given the green light to triple the
600 person team and it will be
interesting to see how this all comes
together down the road promise off stop
all right and in some gadgets coming
soon that I have
to show you have you ever wanted to text
someone while you were holding an
umbrella but it's just not that easy
well
check this out from Korean company KT
design it's called the phone Brella and
it's amazing rested on your wrist and
have access to both hands for typing
while staying dry no details when this
will go on sale but I am getting one and
we're also living in the age of selfies
the iPhone 6s is getting a beefed up
selfie cam but will it allow us to take
better selfies with our dogs the answer
is no but this will it's a Kickstarter
called the pooch selfie it's a phone
mount that holds a tennis ball which is
pretty much like crack for a dog and
look how good the results are see now
you can really take advantage of the
iPhone successes new selfie cam all
right that's gonna do it for this week's
show email me at the Apple bite at
cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tom for
hair tips thanks so much for watching

another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
