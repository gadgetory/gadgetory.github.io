and it's time to get loaded Amazon
slashed the price of the Wi-Fi only
Kindle to 114 dollars but only if you
agree to an ad-supported model you can
still buy the non ad-supported one for
139 dollars but if you want to save
yourself $25 you can buy one that will
advertise to you every so often the
model is called the Kindle with special
offers and Cena editors did not find
these ads too intrusive I'm just
wondering why they only give you $25 off
for this deal could this Barrett Google
launched a trivia contest that allows
you to Google to find answers this is
kind of fun a Google a day is a site
that gives you a daily puzzle that can
be solved with some clever google
searching the questions will be featured
on a Google Ad a calm and printed on the
weekdays above the New York Times
crossword puzzle the answers will be
revealed the following day the legal
battle between Facebook founder Mark
Zuckerberg and the Winklevoss twins has
come to an end
the twins sued Zuckerberg for allegedly
stealing their idea for creating the
site now a Court has ruled that they
have to shut up already and accept their
settlement do not feel sorry for them
though the settlement is 465 million
dollars Google is going to invest 168
million dollars in an alternative power
project the project comes from a company
called BrightSource
energy it involves building a solar
power plant in the Mojave Desert that is
projected to light 140 thousand homes
when it is completed in 2013 Google is
not the only financial backer of this
project the US Department of Energy has
also loaned 1.8 billion dollars to the
effort an Illinois senator is plenty to
introduce a law that would require sales
tax on all online shopping this is
something we could see proposed after
tax day Democratic senator dick durbin
plans to introduce the bill that puts an
end to tax free shopping on places like
Amazon or overstock right now you don't
have to pay sales tax if you buy from an
out-of-state vendor Durbin says this
gives online retailers an unfair
advantage over brick-and-mortar
retailers Sony introduced two new o le
d-- monitors they
not cheap but they are a lot less than
the first generation of these monitors
which sold for between 16 and $29,000
the new lineup of super high-def
monitors includes a 25 inch model for
$7,400 and a 17 inch model for $4,900
they are expected out in the second half
of this year that's your news of the day
I will see you tomorrow
