partnered with AT&amp;amp;T to release a rugged
version of the galaxy s7 the galaxy s7
active has all of the same specs as the
original model it still has that
beautiful quad HD display a speedy
quad-core processor a microSD card slot
for more storage and a 12 megapixel rear
camera but the active is bulkier and has
a plasticky feel it's kind of like if
you put a huge case around the normal s7
so yeah you lose that beautiful metal
and glass design but the active can take
quite the beating in addition to being
both dust and water resistant the active
has a military-grade body and shatter
resistant screen which allows it to
withstand drops of up to 5 feet this is
the kind of device you don't have to
worry about when you're hiking at the
beach or just walking down the street
but what really excites me is the
battery the active is equipped with the
largest battery samsung has ever put in
a smartphone it's 4,000 milliamps that's
1,000 milliamps more than the normal s7
and in our battery test it ran for over
21 hours which to be frank is quite
incredible so overall the active is like
a galaxy s7 on steroids
it's bulkier can withstand drops and
will last a full day whether you're
active or just playing clumsy that's
seven active could be an appealing phone
for you but all of these extra features
come with a higher price the s7 active
cost $100 more than the normal s7 you
can pick it up for seven hundred ninety
five dollars or thirty monthly payments
of $26
