the first build microfactory with the
low-profile food disposer so if the name
didn't already tip you off this disposer
is a lot shorter than your standard
garbage disposal that means a couple of
things first it means that you have more
storage space under your sink or kitchen
supplies or anything else and because it
has a lower profile when you drop
something like silverware spoon or fork
inside there's a better chance that
it'll be sticking out so that you can
grab it without having to turn it off
and kind of fish around for it another
interesting thing is that it's wider
than a standard disposal which means
that it's moving faster and will cut up
your food more efficiently it also has
only one rotating blade instead of two
because of how quickly this disposal
rotate it doesn't need a built-in pump
to push out water either it just uses
that force to expel the water another
cool feature is that the motor is
brushless and it's able to sense stalls
before they happen so if your disposal
is heading toward a potential problem it
might know in advance and keep it from
happening so that any annoying calls to
a plumber that costs you a bunch of
money can be avoided we're also told
it's much easier to install than a
traditional disposal this disposal will
be available on first bill calm in a
couple of months thanks for watching I'm
Megan warden
