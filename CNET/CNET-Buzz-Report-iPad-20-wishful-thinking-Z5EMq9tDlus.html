buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's multi-touch speeding Toyota's and
how to build a better iPad first though
the gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the nexus one Google's anointed
android phone became the first phone
ever to defeat the iphone 3gs in a prize
fight you could call it the comeback kid
because google's nexus one takes this
battle 4.5 to 4.4 and is your prize
fight winner and this week it got a new
software upgrade that gives it multi
touch capability on that you get better
google maps google goggles and some
improved 3d capabilities too and it
definitely stands alone at the top of
the android heap for now because it's
the only phone that will be getting that
particular upgrade the multi-touch so
thanks for that Google I have a droid
but nexus one it is I guess yeah and now
for the news you probably heard a lot
this week about Toyota recalling many
models due to faulty accelerator pedals
and then now there's possibly a braking
problem too well and also this week
Steve Wozniak co-founder of Apple waded
into the fray revealing that he has what
he calls a software problem with his
prius it causes some acceleration issues
and apparently he couldn't get anyone at
Toyota or the Transportation Safety
Board to take his calls so then the next
thing you know he's rambling about it on
CNN and finally toyota says they'll give
them a call explain what what you think
the cause of this problem you're driving
along your put your car let's say at 55
miles an hour in cruise control and all
of a sudden the car accelerates you
didn't do anything why does that happen
nope that's not the issue it's a little
more of a procedure of upping the speed
up in the speed and then suddenly it
just sort of went like it thought you
told it to go to infinity and it
accelerate smoothly and it's only
happened to me on freeways that you know
using the cruise control but I mean plus
it does state clearly in the Toyota
manual that if you have potentially
fatal or just terrifying problems with
cruise control or acceleration you
should immediately contact
Wolf Blitzer for assistance in other
news remember when we were all
speculating about what the ipad would be
like and that was so much more fun than
what the ipad actually turned out to be
well good news now we have ipad 2 point
0 rumors fox news channel reported that
the ipad is definitely coming to verizon
the mission repair blog got a shipment
of ipad parts and noted a spot in the
frame that could easily accommodate the
front-facing webcam we all want and
TechCrunch quotes their usual kissing
cousin source tree reporting that an
iPad running OS 10 may be in the works
so okay let's review an iPad running OS
10 with 3g from verizon and a camera for
skyping with Grandma wow that iPad
sounds great if only wishing could make
it so push harder internet now don't
worry I already know you're going to
send me nasty grams for knocking the
iPad or even appearing to knock the ipad
i am prepared and gadget on the other
hand announced this week that it had had
enough of nasty comments about its apple
coverage and would be turning off
comments on the blog completely just for
a little timeout yeah this just in and
gadgets shocked to discover internet
full of ill-mannered trolls when did
that happen yeah when did that happen
like when the first BBS's came online in
the late 70s learn to play noobs and
finally plenty of material for this
week's
President Obama announced a budget
proposal this week that ends NASA's
mission to return to the moon but he did
allocate even more funding to NASA and
he asked the agency to focus on cool new
space technology I mean after all the
moon is so 60s so NASA said it will
spend the next five years or so working
on robotic missions to the moon to Mars
and to nearby asteroids in hopes of you
know like finding us a new home probably
and that's good because we're going to
need to get off this rock down side the
robots that they send into space will
eventually encounter an event horizon
become self-aware and then come back to
kill us all before we get a chance to
flee how do I know this is going to
happen because there's already a Cylon
base station headed our way oh sure
they'll tell you that the Hubble
telescope just picked up images of two
asteroids that collided and fused
together creating a fascinating contrail
of space dust and an unusual x-shaped
pattern hide your head in the sand all
you want NASA but they're coming and
they have a plan unlike the ones on TV
and that's the buzz report for this week
everyone I'm Molly wood and thank you
