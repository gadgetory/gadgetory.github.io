pen real quick I'm just going to walk
you through the features it has a tail
eraser it has this beautiful stiction to
it so when you do a race from the back
isn't that funny we finally put an
eraser on it we give you a thousand and
twenty four points of pressure on the
tip of this pen thousand twenty four so
when you press down and you know how
that ink naturally flows out of your pen
it'll flow out of this pen too you'll
feel that it's beautiful we give you a
full year of battery life there's two
reasons for that one you know something
about pens every now and then if you use
it a lot you change the ink that seems
reasonable that's the metaphor we don't
want a rechargeable solution for you
because we don't want you to lose that
product up that productivity moment if
you're in your flow you don't want to
stop you want to worry that's what this
pen is for but I wanted to show you what
we're doing with this pen check this out
so simple now let me show you the
integration of the pen because that's
what this is all about how you use the
pen not just talking about the features
of the pen I'm going to stand right here
I'm going to click the pen and you're
going to see what happens when OneNote
opens up do you guys see that just a one
click and here's one note I can write
look how smooth the ink is coming out of
my pen and then I can just erase you can
see that easy erasing off the back and
it feels like an eraser so that really
brings it to life and then at any given
time you guys have used this you can
double click the pen and if you double
click the pen what happens is OneNote
makes a decision and this is that
integration of office and one over on
this product by the way there isn't a
product on the planet that runs off of
some one note as good as this product
it's unreal now I can take whatever I
want up this screen do you see how I
clip that and I came to life let it go
into drops into OneNote just like that
and now I can ink on it and I can send
this information to my kids or whoever I
wanted to you've seen that that's pretty
cool
there's one more step here if you look
down at the bottom is Cortana this is
Windows 10 if I hold down my pen now in
the most natural form I'm in it I have a
tablet how do I want to call her how do
I call Cortana you just hold the pen
watch down here in the corner there tell
me about the Microsoft store in
Manhattan
there it is came up which is kind of
nice then you can see it there it is the
search results where all I do is hold
the button and I get back my search
results that seems pretty smart but now
I have edge that now I can write this is
the beauty of the product so now at any
time I can now write on the web the way
I want to is that pretty cool so this is
edge caring from here
now what happened with all that content
what happens it goes to my Lumia 950 and
those things are connected and it is an
absolute beautiful thing but why do you
do all this what's the point it's not
just for the Microsoft applications it's
for others and we're seeing developers
being spired right now traditional apps
like Lightroom Photoshop Illustrator all
touch and pen enabled awesome we're
introducing five colors of the surface
pen I hope you like them I think they're
beautiful but even more important we're
introducing interchangeable pen tips it
changes everything it's like a ballpoint
pen to a felt-tip pen to even a pencil
take a look it feels phenomenal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
