from tp-link now this is the very first
round on the market that support the new
802.1 a dy5 center or a tea or short and
that means it's not going to be the only
one that will be soon other routers from
other vendors supporting the same
standard but I bet that other we don't
have the same collapsible antennas like
this you can see take a look I can do
this all day nah anyhow it is a very
fast Wi-Fi standard with the top speed
of up to 7 gigabit per second but has
many tear now this router for example
supporting only up to 4.6 bits per
second but that's already crazy fast
there are two things that we should know
number one
ad operates on the 60 gigahertz
frequency band and that media has very
short range now with this router for
example it tops out at about 20 25 feet
and it cannot vanish straight wall so it
is only good for devices with being
close proximity with the router and the
second thing is you know to benefit from
the ad speed you need at least two
clients sharing the same ad Wi-Fi
standard and that's hard because right
now there are very few of them on the
market so few that even I as just one
this laptop right here I take a look
it's connecting to the router here right
now at 2.3 gigabit per second but
there's nothing between the two actually
reply or even benefit a connection that
fast now because of a short range ad is
not supposed to replace 802.1 a c and
that's when the router here can also
work as a regular AC router with the top
speed on the five-year-old figure c band
of up to 1.7 gigabit per second and on
the 2.4 good band up to 800 megabits per
second
now obviously in will we'll use it we'll
never have those numbers for many reason
and this rudder he has the top sustain
real one speed up some 550 megabit per
second in my testing making it about the
average among high-end rather it has
decent range to topping about 160 feet
away with a few wounds in the middle
obviously at your home you might see
different result depending on how your
home is shape the router here is quite
easy to you and has similar feature as
other high-end router such as VPN server
QoS and even a good pressure control and
it shares simply high price of about
three hundred twenty dollars so it's not
a great deal but not too bad deal either
and if your site about the new ad
standard well it is the only toy on the
market for now so get it before they are
more charging now seriously get it if
you have or plan to have a few ad
clients at home one thing though
make sure have a place at home to put it
because seriously is huge which is not a
problem for me because somehow I hear
that all the time think whatever maybe
that's because I'm down low and this is
the talon 8,700 router from tibula
