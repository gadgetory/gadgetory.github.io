this is the Nokia ozo a 360 degrees
stereoscopic camera encased in a smooth
grey sphere each lens has a 195 degree
field of view with an aperture at F 2.4
behind them our 2 K by 2 K synchronous
sensors capturing footage at 30 frames a
second audio is recorded with 8
microphones capturing sound from every
angle there's a price tag to match all
these specs an eye watering forty-five
thousand US dollars apart from the
camera this digital cartridge is
essential it has the battery and a media
module with 500 gigabytes of storage
this one is an extra five thousand
dollars but there's even more to invest
to connect the camera you need an SDI
cable a Thunderbolt cable and a
Blackmagic Ultra Studio mini recorder
you guessed it none of these are
included everything is controlled
through the ozo remote app that runs
only on certain high-end Mac's the black
magic box converts the signal from the
camera and allows you to preview the
shot and set exposure the app lets you
adjust shutter speed color temperature
and start or stop recording you can also
select to shoot with just the four
cameras in the middle ring or all eight
having to carry around the entire camera
setup which comes in this rolling case
and the computer can be kind of
cumbersome so we hope that they'll be
introducing a phone app sometime soon
but there is an advantage to having all
of this gear and that's confidence
because you can monitor and set
everything up and know you've got the
shot before you start recording
we took the ozo on two main shoots the
first one we mounted all 9.3 pounds of
it on the inside of a car
the second was at the green toys
manufacturing plant two very different
situations that put the ozo to the test
from changing lighting conditions to
lots of movements make sure to check out
the results for yourself in full 360
processing footage takes time and it
resource-intensive to give you an idea
one minute of video takes seven hours to
make a final stitch the post-production
is a whole other discussion as well
which you can find out more about on the
scene at article
so overall the ozo isn't a camera for
you and me but as a professional
filmmaking tool it's bound to open up
possibilities that are just the tip of
the VR iceberg</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
