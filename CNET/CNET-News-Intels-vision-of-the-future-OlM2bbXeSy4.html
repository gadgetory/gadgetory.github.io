offers the chance to embark on a little
future gazing the event highlights
research projects in the works at Intel
Labs it's sprung up around something
called ubiquitous computing which it
sounds kind of geeky and nerdy it's not
that big a deal what it says is that
computing will just be everywhere and
we're kind of living in that world where
we all have smartphones we all have
little fit bits and Nike Fuel band zazz
the notion of wearable technology so we
have computing all around us so what
does it mean when everything's
intelligence that includes something as
basic as store shelves this shelf edge
technology simplifies grocery shopping
users list their preferences in a
smartphone application everything from
food allergies to what kind of car you
own as you enter the store the
technology recognizes your smartphone
via bluetooth and then displays
information personalized for you each
display has a sensor and changes based
on the shoppers preferences so for
example if you're allergic to nuts
you'll see a thumbs down sign for any
products you should avoid since the
technology knows what you drive it could
tell you which car part to buy it could
even suggest a wine that pairs well with
the salmon you purchased for dinner the
displays are also dynamic swipe and you
can read product reviews or watch a
video parents can create smarter baby
monitors by controlling devices based
upon their child's behavior this
technology recognizes when your baby is
unhappy and could turn on a crib toy
that plays calming music or when your
baby is crying and alert could be sent
to your smartphone
the goal of this research project is to
reduce vehicle accidents and this notion
of gossiping cards like what if your
cars could gossip back and forth and
talk to each other and wouldn't it be
great if we could use our vehicles to
keep us safe how can veto LEDs on this
scooter transmit information such as
speed and whether the driver is breaking
or turning a sensor on the second
scooter detects that information and
sends alerts to the dashboard this
technology uses another tactic to
increase driver safety minimizing
distraction cameras track the drivers
gaze morning them when their eyes aren't
on the road for longer than a couple of
seconds but what's more unique is that
researchers are tracking whether drivers
are munthali distracted using near
functional infrared spectrometer
technology I'm checking my mirrors I
know what's going on ahead of me I see
brake lights up ahead those are sorts of
things that would register information
your brain is processing or cognitive
perspective and if we get a handle on
that and we can use that information you
know potentially for safety applications
but also just making the driving
experience better the challenge for
Intel now is to get these technologies
out of the lab and into our hands in San
Francisco I'm Sumi das cnet.com for CBS
