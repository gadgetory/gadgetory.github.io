specialized jets to flexible third racks
modern dishwashers could do some pretty
cool things and this $400 Kenmore can do
none of them it doesn't even have some
basic features like a countdown timer
stem holders for wine glasses or
foldable tines but 400 dollars is an
entry-level price and you might even be
able to find it on sale for less than
that and here's the good news
it'll clean your dishes you're gonna
want to rinse or scrape your dishes
before you load them but that's pretty
standard on everything but the very best
dishwashers we've tested space can get a
little cramped even with only 10 place
settings and this guy supposedly fits 12
so it missed some bowls on the
tightly-packed upper rack and left some
peanut butter on the knives but again
rinse your dishes you'll be happy with
how they turn out the exterior and
interior of the dishwasher look very
ordinary but it could blend in with your
cabinets and it has a fine mix of cycles
in terms of bang for your buck this $400
dishwasher does enough to be worth your
consideration if you're shopping on a
budget it even outperforms models that
cost two to three times as much so even
though it lacks features this Kenmore
proves that you don't have to spend a
lot to buy cleaning power</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
