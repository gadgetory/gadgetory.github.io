and he's going to show us the new boxee
beta which is going into closed preview
on Monday the seventh of December all
right take it away hey everybody so this
is andrew with boxxy this is our brand
new beta home screen and for those of
you who already know boxy you'll
remember that the menu was kind of
hidden on the left-hand side and we had
some social recommendations as well as
your history and a variety of things
across the screen so what we've done is
kind of pull out that menu and give you
access to your photos or your music your
movies or TV shows your apps and the
file so this is just going to let you go
through the files on your hard drive in
case you can't find something and then
we've built in these three different
columns so the first is your feed that's
a knack tivity stream of recommendations
from your friends not only on boxee but
also it's going to pull in stuff from
Twitter or Facebook if you let us so
you'll be able to get all those links
that people share two photos or music or
movies on on those different social
networking sites in Tubac see the
featured area right here is going to be
where we announce new content partners
and we're content partners can kind of
sponsor new shows or new movies they
want to promote and then lastly over
here here's your cue so this is stuff
that you're saving for later just like a
normal q but similar to a tebow season
pass you'll actually be able to add a
show to your favorites and anytime a new
episode comes out you'll get it in your
queue so it'll always be relevant to you
so if we jump into TV shows you notice
this is very different than what you had
on the Alpha we've implemented and
brought in a lot of different TV shows
from netflix and other sources across
the internet and build a TV library that
you can search so if I know I want to go
si si si I can just start typing it and
we'll make some recommendations there's
CSI right there click on it get a little
brief description and then boxing's
going to break it down and show me
what's available online and I can hop
right into an episode
either via netflix or actually in this
case i know this one is available on CBS
so we're we're essentially getting to
that point where instead of having to
know what app you want to go into you
just have to know what you want to watch
and then you can search for it and we'll
pull up wherever it's available so
here's a bunch of TV shows i have i can
stream on the internet can also stream
stuff for my hard drive so these are all
things that I either have locally or
I've added to my TV shows so I get a
notice whenever any new episodes come
out and we're running right now on what
platform so we're on a mac mini okay
great I'll know as 10 Snow Leopard all
right so tell us about availability so
we're making the the beta available in
pre-release between december soda and
CES we hope so we'll be letting in a
couple hundred people every every week
maybe a little more than that every week
just to kind of test things out get bug
reports test out some of the new
features that we've a minute and then
we'll make it available publicly in
early early 2010 hopefully at CES okay
great and oh one last thing so this is
the new kind of global homescreen new
global menu so you can quickly get to
your queue your feed settings we've got
the main menu up in the middle and then
these are shortcuts so if you have a
favorite show like daily show you can
put it here it'll always be here you can
hop right in and get to the latest
episode right away all right great and
it still does photos and home movies and
movies and stuff like that yeah photos
music movies TV shows everything okay
great Andrew thanks a lot yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
