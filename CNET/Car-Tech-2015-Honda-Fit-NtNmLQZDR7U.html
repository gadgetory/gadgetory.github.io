new in a lot of ways starting with a
very obvious and substantial redesign
more than they've ever done to the fit
before as long as it's been selling in
the US market now to my eye I kind of
missed the clean chisel II looks it had
before it looks a little more fancy on
purpose and maybe kind of suburban but I
bet it'll sell better as a result
dimensionally it's longer between the
wheels but shorter whisker to tail
translator what that means is you've got
a car that's a little bit shorter little
easier to drive the maneuver with more
room where you sit and the same cargo
space which honda says is really good
for its class the last fit was kind of
this technology wasteland in fact it
didn't even have Bluetooth hands-free
standard kind of the last car not made
in a totalitarian country that didn't
now it is standard along with a backup
camera optionally you can get a 7-inch
LCD head unit for all your media and
infotainment you can get Lane watch this
camera on the right mirror that looks
back as you make a right turn keeping
you apart from militant cyclists and out
back LED taillights give this car more
modern and more upscale look as well for
about the same money now under the
covers honda is moving this vehicle from
being produced in japan to being built
in mexico that's going to let them get a
lot more capacity which they hope
they'll need it's also going to help
them with the bane of Japanese
automakers lately that you can exchange
rate this guy hits the market spring of
2014
