obviously we're looking to the future
the future of PC gaming right now it
seems to be very rearm
based at least that's pushing people to
look at high-end hardware that maybe
they wouldn't have before how do you
educate people about what VR needs how
do you deal with what we call VR sticker
shock where you realize that you need
you know a desktop GPU and and all these
components that maybe you didn't think
you needed for this yeah you know yards
are really exciting time for us and I
mean it was very well prepared for VR
because a lot of the challenges that VR
introduces like the setup of VR the
technology needs a VR we've been solving
those problems for PC gamers for twenty
years now that slum so and and VR today
most of the experiences are games
Tomoe to a large extent right and it's
around solving immersion it's around
making it easier for folks to get in to
the VR to get it set up correctly and
then if something goes wrong for them to
be supported properly as well is is
breaking VR out of sort of the the 1% a
question of getting new gear that works
with sort of more mainstream components
or is it a question of getting the
higher-end components down into smaller
more portable and less expensive and
more mainstream systems it's everything
it's everything you look at the history
of Alienware right and it started with
these big bulky amazing products that
are behind you and we still have
products like that today that serve a
certain need and they offer a certain
benefit but what's really helped propel
the business and the industry in general
is how we've taken the performance of
those types of products and we've made
them practical for folks everywhere in
their life whether it be in their living
room whether it be in school or work
whether it be as a desktop replacement
that they can take over to a friend's
house whether it be strapped to their
back so they can have a fully mobile VR
experience so we've actually partnered
with a company in Australia zero latency
VR where they've done exactly that they
put an ad in we're alpha with the dk2
and a battery pack and a vest and they
run around a warehouse and they play a
first-person shooter game all against
each other in VR I'm very confident VR
is not going to follow in the tracks of
3d the immersion factor of VR
unrivaled right now and the the most
telling thing for me that the most sunny
moment that gives me confidence in VRS
future is when you take somebody who's
never experienced VR and they experience
it and you see their reaction and their
amazement from it and the genuineness of
that the authenticity of it that those
things are are very telling of an
opportunity of this all I can tell you
with confidence is we have never let off
the gas pedal when it comes to
innovation Alex and Nelson instilled
this in the company from day one they
prove to us their commitment by taking
the profits of the company and
reinvesting it into product development
into invention and into innovation and
you've seen us whether we were private
and an independent company whether we
were acquired by DOE and a public
company now we're acquired by Dell and a
private company again you've seen that
commitment over and over and over again
with the focus on PC gamers and we've
never wavered from that commitment now
we have a focus on PC gamers and VR
users and in a lot of ways they're
similar but there are some discreet
differences between them and you can bet
and count on us doing the same in the
future I think that once a PC gamer
adopts the VR and AR you know they're
gonna be the ones influencing other
people yeah once one guy in the block
has it and has everybody over just tell
three more absolutely absolutely
are we in a golden age of PC gaming
right now and is that surprising after
all the ups and downs over the years I
thought PC GigE was dead I know right
xbox came out PC gaming has proven time
and time again that it can withstand a
lot of pressures and threats and a lot
of it I believe is attributed to because
of the openness of the platform and the
opportunity for innovation and we've
seen the waves now in our 20 year
history as although we've all seen it
right but it's remained consistent
what are you playing right now what's
what's got your attention no you first
you go first man you know I'm an old guy
so I'm I'm still is the same game or two
at a time although I can fit in I'm I'm
an MMO guy you know I've been for a long
time and I'm still playing Lord of the
Rings Online and Star Wars like wow if
you do the fake Star Wars Galaxies no
that's impossible that was done well my
Alex by the way my steam profile speaks
for itself and hours played city skyline
I'm still playing it girl SimCity was a
disappointment for me so I went to City
skyline I loved it paradox has done a
great job with that game and then I have
a four year old and a six year old so we
play a lot of broforce speedrunners on
the Alpha actually on our on our TV and
then yesterday I got a 2001 cocktail
arcade machine and my kids went crazy
over it I've never received so many hugs
and high-fives in my life so yesterday
we were playing pac-man Galaga centipede
Frogger all of those games so I actually
had pictures on my phone of them playing
himself that's where I'm at right
awesome yeah very limited time on sky
that's it no that's I've actually been
waiting for this for some time and
really because I'm such a simulator guy
I've been waiting for VR to come I've
been you know just I can't wait in fact
I was thinking about buying one of those
CSX chairs you know or to do the racing
stuff you know but no one said the two
games I'm still playing fallout 4 and
division yeah all right cool thank you
so much for joining us in its gradual
agent on 20 years of alien well thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
