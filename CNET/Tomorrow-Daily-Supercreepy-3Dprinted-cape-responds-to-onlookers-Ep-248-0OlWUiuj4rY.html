tomorrow daily the best ski talk show in
the known universe step this is not
quite a talk show these are our
miniature episodes until our brand-new
tomorrow daily set gets finished so we
have been talking all last week about
who the new host is well I think it's
time to finally tell you guys a few of
you got it right I said used to or still
works with cnet J name stars oj and it's
a guy that's right three of you I think
got it right jeff cannata dlc we have
concerns totally rad show all that great
stuff that he's done and is doing right
now he's going to come be our co-host
we're super excited to have Jeff on
board and like we said we will get that
going as soon as our set gets
constructed in this beautiful new studio
but for now let's say the headlines good
news everyone there's water on Mars sort
of so no need to bury the lead today
NASA announced there is liquid water on
Mars and they have some pretty
compelling evidence to back it up long
story short a team spotted dark streaks
that they called recurring slope lineae
or RSL on Mars a surface that looked an
awful lot like liquid water does when it
goes downhill they discovered that back
in 2011 and with the help of the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter they were able to
decide that in fact those lines are
liquid water flowing and dissolving on
Mars's surface now we've known for a
while that Mars has water in the form of
ice caps but this marks the first time
that NASA is confirming liquid water
actually exists on Mars a whether the
water comes from Mars is thin atmosphere
or from some sort of underground aquifer
or other water source we're not quite
sure but we do know that the streaks on
the surface are hydrated salts with
molecular water inside their structure
it's more abundant when Mars is
experiencing warmer temperatures which
lines up with how water actually changes
with our temperatures here on earth now
unfortunately the existence of this
salty briny liquid water doesn't
actually confirm microbial life on Mars
but it's still a really cool thing to
see NASA confirm an idea that they've
had for a while now okay so now let's go
from really cool things happening on
Mars to super creepy things happening
here on earth and by that I mean caress
of the gays ok this is the creepy escape
I have ever seen in my life it's a
little bit of fashion from designer bay
nas fur ahi and it's a 3d printed cape
that has a hidden camera on board so
when it notices that you're staring at
it it actually changes shape and
responds in kind it's made of varying 3d
printed materials with different levels
of flexibility so it kind of looks like
it's alive when it's moving and the
designer says the Cape quote responds
accordingly depending on who's looking
at it which would suggest to me some
potential for maybe a gender or age
recognition kind of interesting thing I
don't know I mean it's all super weird
and I'm not really sure about it and all
I know is that if I saw this cape on the
street and I looked at it and it started
moving I start screaming kill it with
fire and I look for something really
heavy to bludgeon the person wearing it
with just putting it out there which
brings us to our hashtag of the day
which is TD Cape we want to know if you
were a superhero what was your name be
number one and number two if you had a
living Cape what exactly would it do for
you that would be so special ok so now
that we've talked about that and I
cannot wait to hear your responses we
need to discuss high heels now this one
that goes out to all my ladies out there
a Japanese designer might have figured
out a way to get me and other people who
hate wearing high heels to put them on
this is from designer yasuyuki Yamada he
is a bio mechatronics researcher at chuo
University in Tokyo and he has come up
with an idea for women's high heels that
he says is way more ergonomic and will
actually alleviate a lot of the tendon
pain that high heel where suffer from
pretty interesting stuff the cool shoes
are called yay chica and they have a
really neat design on the hill that's
composed of two curved planes Yamato
went the extra mile to test the impact
of his design actually using motion
capture analysis of a woman walking in
the heels and comparing them to her
walking in a different pair of standard
high heels wow it does look like these
actually help women wearing high heels
which is pretty cool now we'll see
llamadas updated
an improved design at Tokyo design week
next month in October but for now I'm
already super into this design and I
totally want a pair because it'll kind
of in a very small way make me feel like
that amazing assassin lady in Kingsman
the Secret Service okay guys we already
talked about the news we've done the
headlines let's talk about using lasers
to shave this is back at our hacking I'm
gonna introduce you to a product that
I'm not really sure about no I your
opinion on it this is called the scarp
laser razor and it does exactly what it
says it does its creators say it's a
razor shaped aluminum device that
replaces a typical razor at the end with
a laser to shave your hair off this
seems like a terrible idea you guys they
say the prototype does not actually burn
your hair off which is what I thought it
did originally it actually apparently
cuts it exactly its skin level for an
incredibly close and smooth shave once
again this is according to its creators
they say the laser on board will last
about 50,000 hours could be used without
water could be very good for the
environment because then we wouldn't be
throwing away all of these razors they
wouldn't be in landfills all that kind
of stuff but honestly I'm not really
sold yet because I don't quite relish
the idea of taking a laser to my body
because I have not a trained
professional and I think that that is an
important thing to remember also the
video does not really depict a close
shave with an actual working prototype
so they have a render that is kind of
like okay yeah it's SuperDuper smooth
well yeah it's a render of course it's
smooth but then in practicality when
they show the guy using the laser that
they want to use to cut his hair off
looks pretty jaggedy the hair is not
very smooth I don't know only 160
thousand dollars which seems like kind
of a lot of money except they've already
blown past that by about four times or
more they've raised over seven hundred
thousand dollars so this thing is
happening and if you want one you can
get on board for about 160 bucks as for
me I think I will wait for version two
point O so on that note let's check out
our photog refer the day
our phone talker for the day is and I'm
gonna pronounce this the way I would
imagine Odin saying it in the Thor
movies Thor gear third gear took this
picture with his one plus one and he
writes to us and says hi TD crew my name
is Thor gear which in Icelandic means
Thor's a weapon that's the best name in
the universe I took this picture on a
one plus one while picking berries with
my girlfriend near ray yeah kvick in
Iceland the picture shows the Icelandic
flora and all its diversity and glory
best regards Thor gear al-thawra gr uh
Thor's weapon can we just call you
Thor's weapon or Thor let's just call
you Thor for short Thor this picture is
amazing number one and two we love the
1+1 it really does take incredible
pictures especially in macro which is
what you've done here if you guys want
to send in your phone tog raphy just
like Thor did Thor's weapon you can
email us tomorrow at cnet com you can
also check out the show online where

Facebook sent over user feedback you can
always find me and producer Logan I'm at
Ashley a scab on Twitter and produce
Logan is at Logan muy now now note we
will be back tomorrow with the brand new
docket of weird wonderful science back
in science fiction but until then vegan
