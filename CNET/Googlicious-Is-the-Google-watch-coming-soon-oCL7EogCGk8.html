welcome to google issue it's everything
google that we could pack inside of a
show each week now everyone's getting
into the watch action and the biggest
buzz is coming from nine to five Google
which reports that Google is putting the
final touches on a SmartWatch of their
own now details are slim but google now
functionality is rumored to be at the
core of the watch it would really be
perfect to adapt its interface on to a
smaller screen with its information for
weather sports and businesses nearby and
according to their sources Google is
focusing on longer battery life with
Bluetooth 4.1 activity which supports
low power connections and it's the
biggest issue facing these smart watches
for every company now it's being
referred to as the Nexus watch codename
gem well not that gem and it's likely
rumored to release with Google's Android
KitKat announcement according to the
article now we're still waiting for a
SmartWatch concept that does it right
and this already sounds like it's moving
in the right direction and we've also
seen even more leaked pics of Android
4.4 KitKat and recently a new video is
showing off Google's latest mobile OS in
action running on you know what the
hotly-anticipated Nexus 5 again it's not
a major significant overhaul visually
but from what we've already heard and
seen feature wise it's going to be a
nice step up now sticking with Android
hardware right now it's the HTC One max
it's been officially announced and all
the leaks and rumors specs were on the
money but its most unique feature is its
fingerprint sensor that can unlock the
phone like the iPhone it is on the back
side but even better you can assign
different fingers to open different apps
and you can switch on the device with
that app loaded that's some pretty slick
stuff now it brings a 5.9 full 1080p HD
display storage is 16 or 32 gigs with an
SD card slot for expandable memory
you'll still get dual speakers but no
Beats Audio technology after their deal
expired and something a little curious
for android users a removable back plate
without a removable battery HTC says the
battery is directly behind the display
and the processor and other components
are right behind it making it impossible
to give users access
it's a kind of a tease now curve
displays are the new black for android
phones in I have nothing wrong with
curves we saw the galaxy round that was
announced last week curving left to
right and it has this interesting role
effect to check information when it's
laying flat and it will be released in
Korea first now LG has already said that
bendable an unbreakable smartphone
displays are already in production and
we talked about the LG G flex last week
but engadget has come across a trio of
renders of the actual device that will
be coming out sometime next month
according to sources and it's been
confirmed to be a 6 inch screen and
they're putting their own twist on the
curve from top to bottom now the major
benefits of a curved screen on a phone
remains to be seen maybe manufacturers
are getting bored or doing it because
they can but maybe you guys really into
it well we want to hear what you have to
say curves or no curves so email us at a
Google licious at cnet com or you guys
could just tweet me at brian Tong will
post a couple of your thoughts next week
all right some of you have asked for
this and there are so many devices out
there but it's always fun to throw out a
little top 5 list so we're calling it
the hot list and there's really no
science to it it's just my opinion
what's the hottest android phones out on
the market right now based on obviously
their hotness so here we go at number
five it's the Moto X with its
customization that still makes this
appealing but really honorable mention
goes to the motorola droid maxx that's
really a better phone but the Moto X
just has more buzz right now at number
four the LG g2 LG really put out a
winner with this one number three the
galaxy s4 is arguably the most popular
Android phone but it doesn't mean it's
the hottest right now number two I may
be partial to this but I still love the
ACC one design and it takes the spot
with its new rainbow colors bringing
back some attention to it and a number
one it may not be the best seller I'm
not buying one but the note 3 feature
freak of nature is really the hottest
phone on the market right now so you
guys can feel free to send me all kinds
of horrible emails unless you agree with
everything I said here alright that's
gonna do for this week's show thanks so
much for watching all the Google
goodness this week and we'll see you
guys next time for another fix of Google
ish
