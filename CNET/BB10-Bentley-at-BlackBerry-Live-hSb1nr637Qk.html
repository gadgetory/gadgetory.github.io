got an application at runs on my
blackberry jam vol now that's you

which is kind of based be interested
another thing that I like that idea
from my car on my blackberry 10 device
but when there's a software update man
that's all i have to do is hit budget
wherever i have to be and notify the car
that the updates man
and then the car will get that message
I'll start downloading in this case new
maps from North America so here we are
we're actually seeing the phone dr
update stupid car which is running
collector to suffer yep all using the
same very cool and you can also do video
conferencing too yeah that's another
feature that the hell you guys had
so we're going to give it a shot you
know this guy may be eating lunch right
now so well I sure if it's actually
going to happen but it's the show
network is working so as you can see
we're getting a phone call here we're
trying to call this the person here on
the phone from the car and you get to
see it on the screen so other features
are you get notifications like email and
text messages yeah oh hey look hey how's
it going very cool did you get me any
lunch so he's fiddling with the with the
phone here but you can tell you can
basically have a video chat from your
car though we definitely recommend you
pull over before you start chatting yeah
well the zendikar decide discovers that
it's in motion it will fall back to an
audio only oh gosh there's a way to
distract emotional something especially
