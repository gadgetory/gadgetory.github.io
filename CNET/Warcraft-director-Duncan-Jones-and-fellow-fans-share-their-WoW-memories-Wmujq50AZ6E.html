hands automatically go to the keys that
I'm used to play i I've been obviously a
player of the Warcraft games right from
the start but into World of Warcraft was
was basically I used to be running
killed for a game called ultima online
as that game started to wind down we
were looking for a new game to do so we
moved across the world warcraft I
started playing a game called runescape
and one of my friends told me why are
you playing this there's a better game
out there Cold War Craft why don't you
try that I actually got into the game
through my manager in retail that's
working at game at a time I had a bit of
a addicted manager and what he'd reach
an agreement where he'd spare me the
disgrace of having to deal with irate
customers if I got off the shop floor
and power leveled one of his characters
for him obviously there was kind of a
division amongst the client as to
whether we should split on whether we
should be hauled or alliance so I kind
of had this Sophie's Choice moment where
I had to decide which which side I would
go with as the as the group of real real
world friends and players had kind of
divided themselves out so it became a
tauren warrior and I really like that
starting area it was really fun and I
really like my character she was female
she was black and white and so I called
a free gianna it's just like a Frisian
cow there were a lot of cow puns going
around with Torah names at that time
yeah and mage gnome and yes I bounced
around everywhere inglot the rogue apex
the warrior siphoned the Warlock I would
always play as generally once what's
called a tank which is sort of our
heavily armored character which is up up
front for you know to take all the
damage and hopefully deliver as much as
possible as well I wouldn't say that was
much of a lira Leroy but I was I was
certainly
you know I I was good at standing in one
place and bashing stuff what can I say
I'm gonna get to the highest reputation
for our tarik valid all you do is stay
there you have the doing can have to
participate and you went gang reputation
however while has a Idol timer so after
five minutes it will kick you out I
would set the timer my watch for four
minutes in 30 seconds and then go to
sleep soon i watch agua I run to my
computer hit the space bar which mate
makes your character jump and then it
would reset the timer we basically told
all the bars of the world started in
stormwind as am to organs and we would
drink virtual beer and regular be at the
same time until the hour worgen selves
are standing on the tables in all these
bars throwing up and there we a as our
virtual characters got virtually drunk
and virtually threw up we then got
virtually thrown out of this virtual bar
there must be some entrepreneurial way
of making gold no one else's thought I
took all my characters clothes off and
sort of dance and I thought spoke aloud
so that other characters could see like
sea shanties and stuff and I was
basically busking I thought if I singing
off shanties and maybe I'll get gold
that way while you're on the your mount
you could just type / peggle and a pedal
landlord pump up so like that became my
main thing for ages I do journeys that
were like them to a point and back to
play peggle i don't ask me why i didn't
just play peggle outside of it
there were two people in our guild who
one of them proposed to the other in
game and that was really cute so we all
came together and did like this little
engagement party in game which was
really fun it was a lovely experience
being in a world that just felt full of
other people all doing their own things
like beetling around and crafting things
and selling stuff just exploring the
world I just remember being amazed that
that there's this virtual world it was
it was it was so big and theoretically
you could walk across it from one end to
the other in in real time and it would
take you ages but you could do it
it was like Saturday afternoon around
four o'clock and I realized that I
hadn't eaten since Friday nights the
pressure to keep up with the gear that
we needed and preparing for raids it was
quite difficult with a full-time job PVE
stuff wasn't getting you anything you
were doing it over and over again and
you had to go and take on the lich king
or do x and y against the giant boss and
that was kind of like I don't really
want to do that it was kinda like a
second job so it would be at work I'd be
here for like 10 hours right and then I
would go home and I was like I gotta do
this I gotta do this I do my dailies i
realized that i was turning down
real-life events and stuff because i'd
said that i would like tanker raid that
night or something and if you don't you
know if you don't show up then how are
you gonna get on a raid the next night I
ran out of time quite literally I mean I
was spending a lot of time doing it and
it then and then work really sort of
became very busy and active and I just
had to kind of let it go if I wanted to
if I wanted to pursue the career I was
hoping to do some very very happy times
and I can't ever feel that there was
also like it immense time and personal
potential wasted it's such an addictive
quality and I look back and it's weird
because I look back on and really fondly
but I would never ever go back again
you know i would say don't play it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
