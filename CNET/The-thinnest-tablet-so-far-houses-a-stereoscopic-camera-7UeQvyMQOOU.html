android tablet with the stylish flair
and unique photography chops in fact it
might be one of the best tablets out
there I'm xiomara Blanco for cnet let's
take a closer look currently the venue 8
7000 is the skinniest tablet available
at six millimeters thin it's slimmer
than the ipad air tube and weighing in
at a little over half a pound it's also
lighter the eight incher barely has any
bezels saved for the one that houses the
speaker and 2-megapixel front-facing
camera despite its slenderness it's
sturdy aluminum body feels solid and
comfortable when holding it the dell
venue 8 7000 runs a mostly pure version
of Android KitKat 4.4 with an expected
upgrade to lollipop 5.0 soon it houses
an Intel Atom quad-core processor 2
gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes of
internal storage and a microSD card
reader it boasts an 8.4 inch LED display
with a 2560 by 1600 pixel resolution
that looks vividly sharp and colorful
Amy graphics and HD video are
impressively crystal-clear basic tasks
like searching the web streaming video
and playing simple mobile games run
without a hitch even large games and
apps load swiftly the performance is
typically fast lagging is more frequent
than I like especially when downloading
apps and switching screen orientations
the main attraction to this tablet is
its intel realsense snapshot depth
camera it's similar to electro camera
and offers unique photo capabilities for
a tablet there are three lenses on the
back that provide depth information
which after taking the image allows you
to change the focal point the ability to
choose your point of focus after you
take the picture can come in handy not
just for the arty farty folks but also
for those who want to take a quick photo
and worry about the details later the
venue 8 7000 also comes pre-loaded with
powerful photo editing software so if
you do want to let your inner tablet
photographer out you can definitely do
so taking a photo using the realsense
camera is a little awkward the tablet
has to be held with the big bezel on top
and the dell
upside down because otherwise your hands
can easily block the cameras aside from
being confusing the issue with holding
the tablet like this is that it's easy
and common to accidentally press the
discrete power and volume buttons
there's definitely a learning curve to
using the camera though as a photography
enthusiast I've enjoyed trying to master
I'm still getting to know the tablet so
for an in-depth look check out my full
review I'm xiomara Blanco frisina and
this has been a first look at the dell
venue 8 7000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
