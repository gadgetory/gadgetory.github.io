buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's phones at the gym Facebook's new
privacy settings again and the invasion
of the Walmart people but first it's the
gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the motorola droid shadow this
little beauty looks to be basically the
droid two and the rumors are that it can
be headed to verizon this summer it has
a 4.3 inch touchscreen which is huge
like the evo an 8 megapixel camera that
takes 720p video it's running the one
gigahertz Snapdragon processor it has 16
gigs of internal memory and we know all
these specs because supposedly a verizon
employee left the phone in a company gym
and the gym employee who found it knew
enough to ask for the specs and then
call a gadget blog yeah nice lost it in
a bar left it at the gym I'm sure the
next big phone coming down the pike will
just be left in a taxi that's
conveniently headed for cnet's offices
actually could somebody make that happen
that would be pretty cool we like a
scoop and now for the news facebook
rolled out its simplified privacy
settings this week and now hopes that we
will all just quit our bitching and go
away please because they heard us we
recognize that we've changed a lot of
things so you've spent a lot of time
reviewing your feedback so we could
address your concerns the number one
thing we've heard is that there just
needs to be simpler ways to control your
information we agree in a nutshell
facebook's privacy settings are now all
on one page so that's good you have more
control over public information and
facebook won't force you to make your
interests part of a publicly available
page anymore and you can opt out of all
the applications and websites that might
be sharing your information without your
knowledge so you could just use Facebook
as a way to communicate privately with a
network of friends just like the
original plan so here's how easy it is
now you just go to this one page under
privacy settings and then you can kind
of choose from these presets so you've
got an everything preset you have
friends of friends
settings super private friends only
preset you have their recommended
sharing settings or you can totally
customize oh the application thing yeah
that's just kind of a little text link
like way down here because they don't
really want you to turn that off we come
on in other news this week the
Department of Justice is reportedly
looking into whether Apple unfairly
threw its weight around the digital
music business music industry sources
say that Apple threatened to not promote
songs if those songs were also promoted
at amazon and since itunes controls
seventy percent of the digital music
market the DOJ is looking into whether
Apple might have unfairly used its
monopoly to squash competition which I
would argue is the entire point of
having a monopoly but I guess that's why
we have laws it's a fine line also an
apple and the new iphone is coming and
they are clearing out the old ones the
16 gigabyte iphone 3gs is now ninety
seven dollars at walmart with a new
contract that's right iphones getting a
rollback heck almost any Walmart shopper
could probably afford one now also in
preparation for the new iphone ATT
raised its early termination fee on
smartphones from $175 to a whopping
three hundred twenty-five dollars to be
fair verizon charges even more but
somehow it doesn't seem so bad because
of how if you have a verizon phone you
can actually make phone calls and also
get phone calls and send text messages
stop me if you've heard this before okay
but come on AT&amp;amp;T is trying the company
set up a Wi-Fi hotspot in Times Square
supposedly to relieve pressure on its
network and to prepare for the flood of
new iPhones that will stress that 3g
network even more see but if the idea is
that New Yorkers have a lot of iphones
and they're gonna buy a lot of new ones
and why put a hot spot in Times Square I
thought there weren't any New Yorkers in
Times Square maybe it's for the Walmart
people
and finally let's have a look at what's
clogging the tubes this week it's the oh
so clever BP global PR Twitter account
no it's not a real BP account but if
you're going to make jokes about a
horrible ecologically disastrous oil
spill this is the way to do it see but
it's not just mockery those clever
Devils also made t-shirts that they're
selling for twenty-five dollars and the
proceeds from the shirt go to healthy
Gulf org and that's how you do it pretty
slick guys I get it because of it ya
know I'll just leave that to them and
that's the buzz report for this week
everyone I'm Hollywood and thank you for
watching hi I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the bus report the show about the tech
news that everyone is talking about this
week it's scurvy you bastard hahaha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
