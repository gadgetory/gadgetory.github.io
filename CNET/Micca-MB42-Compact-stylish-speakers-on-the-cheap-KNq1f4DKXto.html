speaker you may be surprised to find
there's a handful of ultra budget models
available for $60 and even less even
more surprising is that some of them
actually sound pretty good especially if
you compare them to the tiny bluetooth
speakers that are becoming so common
hey I'm Matthew Muscovy ak for CNET and
the Micha MB 42 is one of the most
affordable bookshelf speakers out there
selling for just $60 and what really
sets it apart from other budget speakers
is its stylish design there are all
kinds of nice touches like the rounded
edges on the cabinet there's a faux wood
grain finish and even the build quality
feels pretty solid in your hand it's
also much smaller than other popular
speakers in this price range when you
put it next to the mana price mb/s 650
there's no question which speaker has a
nicer look that surprising level of
quality also carries over to the binding
post speaker connectors on the back
rather than the cheap spring clips found
on other budget price speakers there's
not much else to the MB 42s there's no
built-in wireless technology like
Bluetooth Wi-Fi or airplay nor is there
any kind of integrated amplification
that means you're going to need a
separate amplifier but luckily there are
some cheap options available like the
$18.00 lop ILP 20 20 a plug in your
phone with an adapter cable wire up the
speakers and you're good to go
the only catch with the mica MB 42 is
that they don't sound quite as good as
some larger bookshelf speakers that cost
about the same like the monoprice MBS
650 in the Dayton audio b65 - the mica
sound pretty good on their own but heads
ahead you do notice they're a little
less detailed and the sound is a little
thinner and if you listen to hard rock
the MB 42s can sound a little string
when you crank up the volume it's not
surprising that the bigger speaker sound
better but you should be aware that you
can get better sound quality for the
same price if that's what you're looking
for but that doesn't mean you should
totally dismiss the MB 42 s if style and
size are more important the mic is
easily win over its boxy budget speaker
competitors and ultimately it may come
down to where you plan on putting the
budget speakers mono prices m vs 6
50s look at home in a basement or
adhiraj but the mica NB 42s
are probably a better fit for an office
or a den I'm Matthew moscovia and these
are the Micah and b42 bookshelf speakers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
