Star Wars story if you want to just hear
what was good about the movie jump to
this timecode there may be very minor
spoilers for solo within this video
coming that number five is the throw
away Big Boss in the beginning of the
movie there's some exposition we were
introduced to what should be a big boss
then after the first few minutes that
big boss is replaced by another big bed
maybe the original big boss's role will
be explored in a prequel to the spin-off
and number four it's predictable
I'm not saying solo is predictable
because you know where the characters
end up the potential twists in solo are
relatively easy to spot they kind of hit
you over the head with foreshadowing
solo doesn't have to be like Westworld
intricate but maybe it could have been a
little bit more complex and number three
solo is light on plot so here's the
structure of the solo movie heist chase
heist chase heist chase and then a heist
and then the final fight now that might
not exactly be correct but it's roughly
right while solo looks great visually it
just doesn't have much of a story if
this is a video game I think people
would have the same complaints it's a
little too repetitive without much story
did it mention it was repetitive and
number two are the low stakes okay so
you're no han solo Lando and Chewie are
safe nothing entirely horrible can
happen to them in the solo movie because
we know their story thanks to Star Wars
but here's the thing
I've watched Paddington - it's a movie
about a talking bear living with the
family and you know nothing could really
happen to Paddington but the writing
creates suspense and you fear for the
lead in a children's movie that hardly
ever happens in solo the stakes are so
low in solo yeah I heard that too it's
hard to get invested in the movie before
we get to number one let's talk about
what worked in solo the visual and
practical effects were great without an
over-reliance on CG then there are some
fanservice elements that will make any
Star Wars fan smile Hans Ark throughout
the film was good if not a little
underdeveloped Paul Bettany's work was
really fun but the best thing about solo
was Lando played by Donald Glover he
might have been so good that he stole
the movie
that's probably why Lucasfilm president
Kathleen Kennedy says a spin-off for
Lando is in the cards and the worst
thing about solo is it's just a cog we
now have this giant Star Wars machine
the originals the prequels the sequels
and the side stories are all a part of
it these Star Wars stories movies have
the opportunity to be different than the
Skywalker saga roll one brought a
grittiness to Star Wars solo does not
really bring anything new to the greater
Star Wars universe it's just another cog
that fits in with the Star Wars machine
does that make solo a bad movie
no it's not a bad movie it's actually
pretty solid but when you leave
characters a sneaky smuggler you have
some rich material to mine but solo
really didn't do that did you enjoy solo
a Star Wars story let me know what to
think of the movie am I as a colonel see
you online
