it is Tuesday Tuesday June 13th there we
go so 239 of the 359 podcast as I'm
doing terrible at my job already ah
we live on periscope periscope is now
working today oh well I'm sorry
periscope it is Ferris I'll get over it
yeah I'm over it I'm over it it was Ben
Fox Rubin Roger Chang and we are
hustling today because we still got III
going on we have to talk about that we
got plenty of talk about we're gonna be
rolling through our review of the
surface laptop we're gonna be talking
about VR arcades and a venmo killer from
the bank's the Ben's gonna run through
for us that's all guys zel yes I will
get you up to Scott to worry if you have
any questions on these topics uh leave a
comment section Brian will pick up the
best and we'll get to them I'm three
minutes 59 seconds from three - uh
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Ben Fox Rubin the official review of the
surface laptop is out in our own Dan
Ackerman is a fan got slim modern design
is portable enough to be travel friendly
but the one question mark is whether not
the decision to use fabric which is
called Alcantara
cheetara was a good idea man what do you
think it sounds like a fun idea I guess
or it's a little bit different right
definitely different I it's it's the
problem is as Dan mentions in his review
it's not like you can reupholster a
laptop or a apps you can maybe there
will be new machi imagine college kids
with you know cheeto stain fingers just
basically screwing over the whole
surface so uh the the this fabric is
apparently used in like automotive stuff
and boats so it's not like it's this
like super cheap or crappy material
right however it may be this like first
gen concept that they'll throw out
eventually because everybody's kind of
scratching their heads over it you know
like do I really want to spend a
thousand dollars on a laptop that's
going to last five maybe seven eight
years right with fabric on it now do you
think that they've got an opening here
with you know the MacBook Air hasn't
really been updated in a while in a
significant way does that be that we've
got you know with that
I guess off has an opening for people to
actually go and maybe sort of I don't
know do you really buy that like the
idea that people are going to switch
over to Microsoft or to switch over to
Windows just because the MacBook Air
hasn't been updated I think that's
really hard to say I mean it's it is
definitely affordable definitely going
after that market
yeah it's but it sure will see the
question is is this going to get people
that would generally go for like the
Dell XPS or a Lenovo laptop is that
something that they're actually going to
be really interested in I don't know a
guy like Lenovo ones I've seen the ones
that kind of flip over like the yoga
yeah kind of like that I prefer that
flexibility this is a traditional laptop
there's no very basic yeah you know but
doesn't fold over it doesn't turn into a
tablet it's just a laptop yeah so I
don't know so anyway let me tell you all
about gel Zell do you know have you
heard of this do you know what it is
what is this like a musical so it's a
new peer-to-peer payment services from
now what I would have guessed so from a
consortium of banks that the company
behind it is called early warning so
it's already it seems kind of stuffy or
a little bit yeah only warning soundly
warning that sounds like something I'd
want to avoid yeah yeah they do risk
management for bank financial services
we get a real sexy territory but at the
same time the really interesting part of
Zell and why I'm telling you about it is
because apparently by the end of this
month 86 million people will be able to
use it right within their mobile banking
apps you're just going to be able to
open up Chase or Wells Fargo app and
then you'll be able to like I can send
you five dollars or if I won I can tell
you don't have to be a a chase member as
well right now it's see you a mile
radius count could be good I could
transfer money to your Chase yes exactly
it's supposed to be all like throughout
this network that all the bank's have
been utilizing do you think this is
potentially fatal to venmo which is
really I mean that's what the baby right
maybe I I think that so venmo has been
putting on a very brave face over this
whole thing saying like you know the
real enemy here is cash and checks so we
welcome somebody like sell but at the
same time I think that they might be a
little bit nervous that's the
competition yeah yeah that the bank's
have actually shown up over this whole
thing alright lastly you sure got to
check
out av arcade yes in arcade uh which
mixes VR headset with movie magic
sensors and props deliver and more
immersive experience that you get at
home uh you know he was pretty blown
away by this
I need he said that you know this may be
what finally gets people into the are
how many times are we gonna say that no
it could be a lot and you look at the
video now that's five years you look at
the video now like you can see uh Ian
basically walking around floor boy like
he's walking around this plank
he actually as he's describing this like
as he's walking across that plank he was
sweating he's feeling real anxiety it's
kinda cool that she fooled him into
thinking he was in this world that's
really what VR the promise of VR is all
about right I like the idea of somebody
jury-rigging
their um living room to try to do the
same thing but into cheap to like go to
the arcade right but at the same time I
think this is a really smart idea to
create something like a VR arcade yeah
so what did you happen do you guys do
you guys spend time in arcades is good
of course especially on the boardwalk
man that's what you do what was your
game of choice oh my god I don't even
remember you know the like the thing
where you throw the ball down the ramp
what the skee-ball skee-ball thing okay
I bet video game I was gonna say Street
Fighter 2 but alright skee-ball works
there's the TMNT alright oh yes of
course yeah the for player one yeah that
was awesome
alright from these stories check us out
and Cena I'm Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox
Ruben thanks for listening nobody went a
little over there I'm not sure it's fine
I think we're like way over right the
tiger legs at the time didn't work today
but I'll get over it alright so let's
talk arcade yeah yeah yeah skee-ball
that doesn't count we're talking I know
fine I talked about arcade to the first
thing you thought evil I don't know what
about like video games we had four
minutes I was I was trying to you know
dance as fast as I could
skeeball Doug be in the chances I've
literally dreamt about this I think he's
excited yeah about the V arcade expand
was be fun come on I gotta get it
terrible for her to go though I don't
know how Ian got through that I'd be on
the floor you say he was really stressed
he was sweating he was actually kind of
ahead of my
panic attack like walk across that
planets it's free cuz it looks like
you're whatever ten story 20 stories of
the grounds it's kind of it is a fun
idea to integrate like actual physical
objects yep really as Samsung's actually
do that for a while I remember they
demonstrated with their gear gear VR
headset a you were skateboarding
basically was VR VR footage of someone
skateboarding they put you on a
skateboard that was kind of like had
limited motion but you could sort of
like yeah rock it back and forth you
felt like you're on a skateboard and it
was you know it was a Mersenne enough
that you if you stop thinking too hard
like you kind of see yourself
skateboarding down the street uh this
seems like it takes it to another
experience like you could pull up in a
drawer and grab a gun and there's
actually a fiscal gun there that's it's
pretty cool yeah I think that it's also
something that if people don't really
want to shell out the kind of money that
they need to feel like a heavy-duty VR
kid they can just go to the VR arcade
down the street right plunk down I don't
know 5 bucks 10 bucks like play a couple
games when I was twenty bucks right yeah
which sounds a little high to most
whatever yeah yeah one of the other
ideas that I was just thinking of is
like what if they did like a like a
haunted house like a whole VR oh yeah I
mean there's already like a haunted
house game or there's some sort of like
spooky VR yeah yeah we played a zombie
game there's a Ghostbusters one and Time
Square there was oh it looks for you
yeah yeah I think that would be our
least ride it out during Halloween right
the proton pack was yeah yeah that's
right yeah that's great yeah that is
pretty sweet I just you mentioned Ninja
Turtles turtles in time oh yeah give me
great swords and let me play that game
in VR Oh totally how many classic arcade
games would translate to VR you couldn't
do like Street Fighter or something I
don't know you can actually a guy did a
skill set you know yeah you need
something where you don't really need
the skill set to dissipate what's the
one where you're you're like constantly
ducking behind stuff and then you're
you're shooting things I was terminator
time timesplitters time splitters yeah I
was it would be great in VR all that
means that the one where you step on the
pedal the duck yes yeah yeah although
that's an eye room there was a few like
that but there was a bunch it was
probably one of the more more notables
yeah all right before we get too far off
topic we're too late
let's talk about the surface laptop and
jeffer in the chat is asking when you
guys open up the surface laptop doesn't
fall backwards I hear it's screen heavy
now I don't know if you guys have had
any hands-on but I saw myself
Ackerman messing around with it's not
that heavy no I said I waited I played
around with it Vidya didn't see bad bad
it seems pretty typical for like like a
touchscreen laptop though where like it
doesn't sit completely in place when
you're kind of tapping on it although oh
yeah yeah yeah it's not super stable
right but that's that's biggest ideas
like you've got one finger your keyboard
the other finger tapping I guess yeah
hold it out something like that I don't
know I like I I mean we use Mac's so we
don't really incorporate touchscreen or
our daily routine which is too bad we
just said I don't care not really that
I'm over it yeah totally over that Mouse
as always Danny Green our boy Danny yeah
OnPoint yo pimp your laptop with tufted
leather cover what's the problem
you can you cover that outside it the
problem is making like the palm rest
area fabric cuz that's the part that's
dirty you know you can break it sweat it
kicking your
Cheetos it absorb whatever what's the
resale value on it if it gets completely
worn out and it's just like it doesn't
look good after a while and it does not
happen to like a metal well I don't know
I will say it does like my MacBook Air
you can see where the palm rest is yeah
but the colored it's not like it's
something worn through no no but there's
a bit of discoloration what's that it's
the new show that shine is gone from it
yeah yeah alright uh while we're on the
topic you mentioned we've got Mac books
their company sanctioned Mac books
versus the surface laptop Jonathan Jong
thoughts on 13-inch MacBook Pro versus
the surface laptop go nice and broad uh
well the surface laptop does have a
touch bar so that's one that's a thing
in this yeah in this favor yeah but no
it's a you know they're they're pretty
comparable machines I want I want to see
I want comparable I want to say that if
the surface laptop is more like the
MacBook Air like a souped up MacBook Air
suppose for the same price the magnet
pro is more expensive ya know a couple
hundred dollars more has a couple more
ports this one doesn't have USB c4
announced I don't know it I don't think
the difference is it's hard to compare
the two because two subjective well no
it's just yeah if you're in a Windows
you're gonna get this if you're in the
back or Mac OS you're gonna get MacBook
right I don't know the question for me
is is like so with the surface pro
Microsoft did like a really fantastic
job like really pushing through the 2 &amp;amp;
1 hybrids right you know it's it's a
tablet with like the clip on keyboard
what exactly are they going to do with
this one to actually push forward the
concept of a touchscreen laptop I mean
it's not fabric I mean like even Dan
points on his review like this is it's
one of many laptops out there's sort of
its it doesn't break any new ground I
mean it works with the nut pencil the
yeah pencil
yeah the surface stylus yeah wait the
pencil pencils the Apple yeah come on
man careful come on
I think the only thing that's gonna be a
deciding factor out of somebody whose
loyalty already lies with one
manufacturing operating system versus
the other yeah is probably surely that
material because I know myself as cool
as that surface looks I'm very nervous
about it because I like to eat and drink
and do things around my laptop that
right you probably shouldn't do around a
laptop in general but worst-case
scenario it happens on a hard surface
you flip it over you wipe it off you're
probably okay you stain your laptop yeah
has that ever been a phrase it's been
uttered before I it's a stupid thing to
get wound up about is that really a
deal-breaker of course not are you
talking about we spent like weeks
talking about the fact of like weird
like the touch button is on the galaxy s
gonna smudge right that is what this
podcast is all about the minutiae we
just spent our time of minutiae right
buying time at the same time that's why
I would probably think that if you're in
the market I would still think that
you'd probably want to get the Dell XPS
13 I think that that's probably like
still gold standard you know
run-of-the-mill basic laptop that runs
on Windows there's a lot of people how
much I guess I don't know off the top of
my head but cheaper than it's been doing
really well it's Dells
selling a lot of those all right so we
have to do a quick show today because we
got to go get ready for Nintendo at e3
but before we go Danny Green's asking
what kind of fees are there for zel oh
good no fees none of these I mean like
it does vary by bank so you do want to
actually check like with your bank
before you actually do it but the big
selling point is is that it's supposed
to be ubiquitous and it's supposed to be
free so I could send you money you could
send me money it's throughout the US
this is not international and it's not
yet well say with are there plans for
international I asked them about this
yesterday and they said no plans at the
moment but it's certainly conceivable
idea sure I invested I know is
international no memo is also us only
gets into thorny or territory when you
actually start a p2p payment service
international there is there an
international one out there I mean like
there's there's money transfer services
like zoom but you guys don't you you got
a fees for that yeah and like your name
has to be more attached to it you have
to like because of the criminal and
terrorist aspects you have to be there
have to be more safe guard safeguards in
place as opposed to like me just sending
you know Brian five bucks and then you
know kind of nobody is there a social
network element like venmo
no they very intentionally avoided the
social network element of it because
they're trying to make this much broader
supposed to be as I mentioned in my
story venmo for everyone which maybe
they'll get more soccer moms and you
know trekker dad's you know digital
payments I don't know I hate it at first
but I kind of learn to like that social
network element yeah am i paying back
it's like thanks write my stories that's
I thought that's what I say alright
let's go ahead and close it up for the
day so we can run and get ready for a
Nintendo yeah III continues yeah on and
on and forever and always I'm excited a
but Super NES MIDI maybe I don't know
we'll see
fingers cry so yeah me just say we'll
see alright if you like they these are
