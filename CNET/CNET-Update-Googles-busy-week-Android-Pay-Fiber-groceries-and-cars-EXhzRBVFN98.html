ways than one I'm Bridget Carey this is
your CNET update Apple is dominating the
tech news with all of its shiny new
gadgets but its arch-nemesis Google has
been quite busy with its own projects
Google launched Android pay giving
select Android phones the ability to
make payments in stores when tapped to a
sensor during checkout
it's a rebranding of Google Wallet which
of course has been out for years now but
it faced many challenges and it wasn't
adopted by all phones or carriers in
contrast Android pay works with all
Android devices that have a special NFC
chip and that they're running KitKat 4.4
or a newer version of the operating
system it works with any mobile carrier
as well as major credit cards and many
banks and credit unions later in the
year Google's gonna open up Android pay
for shopping on mobile apps and it'll
also let you add loyalty cards and try
to pay is a separate app you have to
download from the Google Play app store
but some new phones will have a
pre-installed so if you're wondering
what happened to Google Wallet
well that app is still around but now
it's only used as a way to send money to
your friends meanwhile the company says
it's thinking about expanding the Google
Fiber high-speed internet service to
three more cities San Diego Irvine
California and Louisville Kentucky but
it's not a guarantee Google is really
just starting talks with city leaders to
figure out logistics fiber offers speeds
of one gigabit a second which is about a
hundred times faster than average u.s.
broadband speeds
Google Fiber is only in three US cities
now with six others coming soon and even
more listed as potential expansions and
that's not the only fiber Google wants
to bring to your home I'm talking about
dietary fiber because Google may soon
deliver fresh food groceries to your
door according to bloomberg Google is
starting to test grocery deliveries at
two US cities one of them is San
Francisco that would give Amazon and
instacart some new competition and
someday maybe it'll be delivered by a
self-driving car because Google just
hired an auto industry veteran as its
chief executive to run itself
driving car business John krafchick
president of online car shopping website
true car will be CEO of self-driving
vehicles he's a mechanical engineer with
experience at Ford and Hyundai last week
Google did say it was planning to make a
few hundred self-driving cars and of
course we can't go a whole show without
mentioning some iPhone news because you
know iPhone Apple says pre-orders of the
new iPhone 6s and 6s plus are on pace to
surpass the last year's first weekend
orders of 10 million now this year for
the first time customers in China could
pre-order the iPhone at launch so that
certainly helps get those presale
numbers higher that's it for this tech
news update but you can keep up with all
