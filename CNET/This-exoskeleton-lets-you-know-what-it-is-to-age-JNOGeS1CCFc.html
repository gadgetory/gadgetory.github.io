on Maya's akhtar under all of this gear
this is 40 pounds of an aging suit it's
an exoskeleton and it's got essentially
brakes and right now what's happening is
they're adjusting the amount of
resistance on my knees to give me an
idea of what it's like to feel older so
I'm walking on the beach here which is
not a walk on a beach okay and there's a
lot more force on my legs so walking I'm
exhausted I've been wearing this suit
just for about 10 minutes to show the
idea behind this whole suit this whole
concept is to get a conversation about
aging happening it's definitely the one
of the crazier things I've seen at CES
2016 there's other things you can do I
can try it out later you're gonna mess
with my eyes when I'm seeing you through
two cameras and I have these things over
my ears so they can actually have
hearing loss vision loss more issues
with my joints if they want to mess with
the faders again because they have full
control of that trying to move my legs
or super heavy this is like nightmare
material but it does give me an idea
what it's like to be older so if I'm
looking at places to live or places to
be perhaps stairs become way more
difficult walking around on show fours
way more difficult when you laugh at
people who have segways maybe it's not
so funny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
