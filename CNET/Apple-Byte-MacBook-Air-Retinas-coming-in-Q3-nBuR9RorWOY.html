welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now there's lots of news this week so
let's get to the show the Taiwanese
newspaper The Economic Times reports
that apple is lining up suppliers for
the next gen macbook air that will
launch in the third quarter of this year
now that's been the typical pattern for
new apple laptop announcements now
according to the report the next heir
will receive internal performance
upgrades with Intel's latest Haswell
platform but also a facelift with new
external features that were not
explained in any way shape or form and
the possibility of a Retina Display we
know the retina display requires a lot
more power so if they can figure out the
battery life issues I think we'll see it
and if they can't well we won't but you
know what they say once you go retina
you can't go back in all right now apple
says that a small group of their
employees computers were hacked recently
through a vulnerability in the Java
browser plug-in after they visited the
popular iphone dev SDK forum there were
no reports of them visiting naughty
sites now apple says the infected
machines were also isolated and there
was no evidence that any data left Apple
which is really a big disappointment for
people just begging for any i watch
information Apple then released a java
update for mac OS 10 that includes a
malware removal tool now early reports
suggested the hackers who targeted apple
were from china but then investigators
now believe the criminals were based in
Eastern Europe instead you know we're
good at bootlegging and hacking but
China Eastern Europe you know pretty
much the same thing now rumor news didja
Times reports that apple supplier AU
Optronics has improved their poor ipad
mini display production there now caught
up and working on their next project the
new display for the next gen ipad mini
digit I'm says they have already begun
work on the new panel which is believed
to be and really better be a retina
display and you guys know what they say
about retina it's sharp now new data
from Strategy Analytics
that apple's iphone 5 and iphone 4s are
the world's two most popular smartphones
the numbers found that the iphone 5
shift more than 27 million units during
the holiday quarter the 4s is believed
to have shipped more than 17 million and
the samsung galaxy s3 shipped more than
15 million phones but just because
you're the most popular phone doesn't
mean you're the best phone on the market
and I still shouldn't have to tell you
guys that the s3 is really still a
better overall phone so maybe you're
tired of your iphone 5 and it's screen
is still too small and you use iOS 6
almost exactly like you used a OS 5 well
you guys should give the iphone 5 inch
papercraft model a chance to see if you
really want that bigger screen now the
good people at macrumors work with
cheese redesign to create a really cool
papercraft mock-up you can download at
the link on the screen and just make
sure you print it to actual size but
check this out all Apple has to do is
scale up the current 4-inch iphone
screen to 5 inches the display would end
up the same 1136 x 640 resolution but
it's pixels per inch would drop down at
264 which is the same as the current
full-size ipad now you know I enjoy arts
and crafts and I still want a larger
screen and really enjoyed the size of
the iphone but I just wasn't a fan of
its durability and there could be
another threat to Apple a recent rumor
report says google plans to open its own
retail stores across the united states
to show off their growing number of
products now Google has already set up
chrome mini stores inside of us best
buys and retailers in the UK and it's an
interesting move to expand its brand
even more and you know we can probably
expect to see Chromebooks and Google's
Nexus tens 7s and fours and the rest of
the space will sell advertising now
check this out a really cool segment on
the BBC's children show Blue Peter
featured Apple designer Jony ive who has
awarded their highest accolade a gold
badge by the show it's the
longest-running children show for over
50 years and encourages kids to make
things from ordinary household objects
I've watched it as a child during the
segment I've talked about the thinking
that goes into naming a product if we're
thinking of lunch books would be really
careful about
not having the word box already you know
give you a bunch of ideas that could be
quite narrow because you think of a box
as being square and like a cute and so
we're quite careful with the words we
use because those can sort of determine
that the path that you go down well
that's kind of odd because I just how do
you put the letter I in front of
everything alright guys that's going to
do for this week's episode email us at
the apple byte at cnet com or hit me up
on Twitter and we'll read some of your
questions or really any personal
comments you would like to express next
week i'm brian Tong thanks for watching
we'll catch you guys next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
