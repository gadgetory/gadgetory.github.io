the apple pie for all the good at-bat
inside the world of Apple now before we
get to the stories we wanted to take a
moment to celebrate the 30th anniversary
of the Macintosh that's right it's the
PC that started a revolution and really
put apple on the map on January
twenty-fifth nineteen eighty-four now
the Macintosh also starred in one of the
most memorable super bowl commercials of
all time and half of your watching this
work even born yet but if you missed out
you can still hunt them down for around
15 hundred dollars on ebay if you're
lucky for a piece of Apple history
alright let's get to the show and if you
haven't noticed technology has made huge
leaps and bounds since 1984 you know
just a tiny bit but according to
multiple reports iris scanning might be
the next edition to apples biometric
roadmap with the recent high reigns
especially with biometrics being rumored
to have a key role in Apple's upcoming
eyewash Samsung has already confirmed
they're developing their own iris
scanning tech for upcoming smartphones
as well now iris scanning has already
been adopted in other countries and
would also be faster compared to touch
ID since you don't need to make physical
contact with the surface and sometimes a
wet finger does not give an accurate
reading now it's not expected to be
ready for the next iphone release Apple
could even use the current tech already
built in their phone to make it happen
but it's still not coming anytime soon
and we'll keep an eye on this story for
you all right Apple seated the fourth
beta for iOS 7.1 to developers with
subtle interface tweaks like slide to
lock and slide to power off having new
animations but the Vegas leak comes from
developers Steven crown Smith who posted
images of what appears to be an update
for Apple's iOS in the car interface the
purported images now feature a darker
header that highlights text better
compared to the current images on
apple's website with mercedes-benz honda
and nissan listed as some of the initial
launch partners now mobile operating
systems in the car is going to be just
another battleground between Apple and
Google in 2014 and if Toyota will
actually produce this ft-1 concept with
iOS just
me I will promise to drive it every day
for the rest of my life and let's not
forget our obligatory iphone 6 rumor of
the week according to Cowan and company
analysts they claim the iphone 6 is
locked in to ship with a four point
eight inch display it will include the
faster 802 11 AC Wi-Fi standard and will
offer other key software innovations and
I have never heard that one before
alright let's check out the quick bytes
it's been snowing in the East Coast and
no one knows this better than Apple's
fifth avenue store in New York after a
snow blower accidentally knocked into
its blast cute facade and shattered one
of its large glass panels the COS
replaced that panel roughly 450,000
dollars and that hurts daddy but don't
worry the store is of course still open
also according to a Belgian retailer
apple's mac mini that's been right for
an update since the last one in october
of 2012 will be coming by the end of
februari now this has not been confirmed
anywhere else but the Mac Mini is the
only mac that still hasn't transitioned
over to Intel's Haswell chipset and
apples Mac Pro shipping estimates have
now slipped out all the way to march in
many countries including the US mexico
and canada but if you can't get your
hands on one right away just do what
this german mac user did now he created
his own mac pro hackintosh replica using
yes and actual trash can now check out
these pictures they show off some of the
detail and work that went into making it
it's not nearly as powerful as apple's
mac pro but it's an impressive job
either way with a little bit of that red
spray paint detail and guys we're doing
another apple byte giveaway this week
check out this sweet thin folio case
with keyboard for the ipad air from our
friends at kensington is perfect for
