United States has always been dead last
in new headlight technology not because
we're stupid but because our regulations
have been u.s. vehicle regulations
forever didn't allow designers to use
new light sources new ways of shaping
the light didn't even allow them to use
covered fared in headlights long after
Asian and European manufacturers were
allowed to do so we've always been in
the dark ages here what we had were
these sealed beam headlights basically
glorified flashlight bulbs if you ask me
the either had a pair of sevens or four
fives and that was it
things have changed okay first off HID
or high-intensity discharge this is kind
of a general term for lights that use as
a source of illumination an arc instead
of a burning filament the way sealed
beam headlight stick frankly those old
seal beams aren't a whole lot different
than burning a candle now more
specifically HIDs are usually xenon
headlights that means they have a xenon
gas field capsule which the gas is being
excited by a couple of nodes electrical
nodes passing very high voltage across a
gap you'll see a sticker off and under
the hood showing you a high voltage
warning bi-xenon simply means that xenon
arc technology is used for both low and
high beams LED is the newest headlight
tech in production though only on a few
cars still LEDs offer strong though not
the highest light output but combine
that with the lowest power consumption
and the greatest flexibility in design
you can style them into almost any
surface on a car but LED light output is
quite sensitive to swings in temperature
that's a problem on the road so this
helps make them complicated to engineer
a part of white LED headlights remain
pricey either 1600 bucks extra on an
Audi
eight for example laser headlights are
coming if you believe BMW I'm pleased to
report this will not be like mounting a
couple of huge laser cat toys on front
of your car instead the lasers actually
point back at a set of tiny mirrors in
the housing that then reflect that laser
light out on the road the benefits here
are incredible precision and flexibility
of brightness and beam shape and
reportedly even lower power consumption
than LED NES like the lasers at a 70s
rock concert these can project shapes in
the air like a warning triangle near
your car when it's disabled the first
big change in beam shaping happened in
the 80s with lenses old sealed beams
used faceted lenses on the front to
shape the beam new technologies began to
rely on a faceted reflector behind the
bulb you can spot the difference right
away by a clear lens on the front that
basically just keeps dirt and water out
headlight leveling became common soon
after and it can be done either
automatically or via a simple manual
system with a spin wheel either way it's
meant to compensate for vehicle loading
that tends to cast the headlights up
into the sky adaptive or steerable front
headlights maintain direction of the
lights where your steering wheel is
pointed this goes back to early tatras
and even the Tucker though with limited
success until modern technology got rid
of the motors and linkages they used to
use and dropped in more reliable modern
actuators about ten years
another beam shaping tech you can easily
spot is a projector lamps very prominent
on a lot of acura cars for example this
place is a convex eyeball looking lens
in front of the light source to throw
the light aided by a mechanical shield
between the lens and the bulb that moves
up and down to change the cutoff between
high and low beam and Audi's about to
roll out matrix beam headlights that
would use addressable LED arrays to send
high beam light all over the road all
the time except making carve-outs on the
beam when it detects oncoming traffic so
no more separate low and high beam at
all Europeans will get this $3,000
option first Americans may have to wait
a while because of a decades-old law
that says headlights in this country
must have high and low beam modes and
generally there's a big discussion of
the car business now about defaulting
all cars to high beam and using low beam
as the conditional mode instead of vice
versa the way it is today okay bottom
line now like some of the avenues of car
tech these days headlight technology is
becoming more and more the domain of the
car maker and less something you're
going to graft on later using
aftermarket parts one notable exception
though are high intensity discharge
xenon kits there are a ton of those out
there you might try retrofitting to your
car be careful on the install they
generate some wicked voltage but in
terms of things like steerable
headlights LED headlights Laser
headlights obviously you're not going to
install those on your existing car
you're gonna get them on a car when you
buy it
