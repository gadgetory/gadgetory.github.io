read more Facebook I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update as Facebook is
turning 10 years old it seems like it
was yesterday when college grads freaked
out about the network opening access to
their parents and not long after
everyone was deleting their keg party
pictures because suddenly the site was
being used for job hunting after a
decade and one point 23 billion users
later facebook is being used by an
entirely different generation that has
grown up with smartphone messaging apps
to avoid fading from existence like
myspace and friendster Facebook is put
in a focus on becoming more of a utility
for content on your phone instead of
just a place to message your friends on
Monday it launched a separate app called
paper it displays your Facebook feed as
well as articles from major news outlets
the facebook paper app launched to
positive reviews but not everyone's
happy with paper especially the original
well-known app called paper that lets
you sketch on your iPad yes the company
behind the original paper app wrote a
blog post calling facebook a bully by
taking their established app name the
original paper app is so well known that
in 2012 it was named as the best app of
the year by Apple in other news the
online television service area is
expanding to San Antonio this month
bringing the service to a total of
twelve metro areas Aereo is a cheap
subscription service it starts at eight
dollars a month and it lets you stream
over-the-air broadcast channels to your
computer your tablet even your
big-screen TV using something like an
Apple TV it also lets you record TV
shows last week Aereo's sold out of
capacity for New York City seems there
was a rush of people signing up to watch
the Superbowl and winter olympics Aereo
is fighting legal battles against media
companies that claim the video service
is infringing on their copyrights by
providing these broadcast signals
there's a new smartphone game obsession
and unless you enjoy being driven insane
with frustration then I recommend
staying away from flappy bird it's a
simple concept of tapping your finger
with the right
timing to avoid having your bird hit a
pipe a pipe that looks like it's from
Super Mario Brothers but it is quite
hard the free app has skyrocket to
popularity last week on iOS and Android
even though it's been around since may
of 2013 this mindless game serves no
point and it will suck you in with the
belief that maybe you can figure it out
while you keep trying nothing of value
will be accomplished in your day you've
been warned that's your tech news update
but you get more details at cnet com /
updates from our studios in New York I'm
