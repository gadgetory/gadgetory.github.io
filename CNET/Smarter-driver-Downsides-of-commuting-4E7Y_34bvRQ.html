commuting is one of the lesser studied
sedentary health risks out there
certainly compared to the much more
touted ones like being a couch potato in
front of the television or having office
jobs where you just sit in front of a
computer all day yet from 1960 to 2000
we nearly traveled the number of people
commuting by car and grew the percentage
by nearly 75% and the time duration of
that commute has lengthened nearly 30
percent a Washington University st.
Louis study with the National Institutes
of Health did take a look over 4300
people were surveyed and the pattern was
simple more minutes at baseline
metabolism and lower cardio fitness a
higher body mass index waist size and
blood pressure more time in the car on
your butt means less time doing
something above baseline metabolism but
even worse it's also stressful time
doing too little
the study also noted that commuting
typically correlates with living in the
suburbs a place where almost everything
is environmentally engineered for lower
exertion and activity unless of course
you think about going to the gym which
you probably drive to and then drive to
Cinnabon after no wonder new york city
folks weigh on average six or seven
pounds less than the rest of us add the
fact that there's an entire fast-food
industry
aimed at people in cars and you can see
the correlation if not causation with
the idea that commuting is not merely
health neutral so a few tips for the
smarter and ostensively healthier driver
first of all skip the drive-thru even
though it's built for cars
second of all try to get some walking in
during your commute even if it's just
part of a multi-modal commute and
realize that your commute directly
subtracts time from activity time so
count up the minutes that you commit
each day and try and find that exact
number three times a week to be active</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
