here a wii mini fresh and ready to be
unboxed now Nintendo has a new Wii U has
actually been out for well over a year
but the Wii has been around and even
though they're not making really any new
games for it there's a shrunken down
lower priced version that is going on
sale in the US this holiday called the
Wii mini and it's $99 and what do you
get in the package you're getting well
let's find out you're getting a Wii mini
and you're getting a Mario Kart game and
let's see it's a small box and has a
Nintendo style packaging the design well
right in the front you can see there's
Mario Kart Wii staring you right in the
face and the instructions say the
packaging of the Wii mini itself almost
looks like the Nintendo 2ds has a matte
black style to it so you lift this up
here's your standard documentation and
the power brick is kind of the same as
always it's a big power brick put that
down there and inside is the wii mini
this is it it's very light open it up
here and yeah it definitely has a rough
kind of matte plastic feel all around
almost like an ABS plastic almost feels
like a bit of an NES style as opposed to
the Wii angled sides so definitely a
different feel and as far as putting in
discs go that's right you put them in a
little top hatch so has a bit of an
old-school feel and there are no
controller ports on this this connects
wirelessly so you've got a you know
video connector port on the back you've
got a USB port
you've got the Wii sensor bar connector
and the power and a sync button on the
side pretty bare-bones so it's pretty
basic stuff and the Wii mini does not go
online so you're not going to be
accessing anals Virtual Console games
you'll be playing just disk-based Wii
games
not GameCube games either and then in
here at the bottom we've got the Wiimote
which is red and comes in a protective
rubber case lest you throw it at your TV
they really don't want you doing that
and here is a nunchuck as well which is
included also red so you've got a shiny
red we set here and inside here is a
video cable but it is not HDMI this is
composite it's your standard old-school
TV connector here so if you want HDMI or
even if you want to connect out with HD
with your youth you know you're more
advanced connecting cables you want to
buy a separate video connection kit or
buy an HDMI converter which you can find
available in Amazon other places they
lurk out there and two batteries so
that's it that well and the censor bar
unless we forget the censor bar has
always been around you need that to
connect to Wii Remote so that is the
entire package or a compactly packed in
there of the Wii mini stay tuned for a
full review on SEANET will give this
thing a whirl and talk about what it
feels like I feel it does feel light</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
