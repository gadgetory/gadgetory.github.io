show that covers everything related to
alphabet Inc alphabet happens to own all
kinds of companies including Google X
loon wing and the Phoenix Suns okay
not the Suns I'm your guide I as a car
and you are the outstanding audience
today we're talking about more Android
phones
wham-o in China and a boatload of stuff
on assistant but our top story is
something we never ever have discussed
on this show before the Google pixel 3
is leaked again yeah again first stop
pixel park for the first time ever it
seems like the pixel 3xl leaked amazing
right over on YouTube a user by the name
of in digi posted an unboxing video
showing off what looks to be a white
pixel 3 XL the rear of the phone has a
kind of two-tone look with a shiny top
and a matte bottom in the box are also a
pair of wired USBC headphones a
headphone adapter a USBC 2a adapter and
a plug to charge the phone in the video
the phone is turned on it shows a date
of Friday July 6th but the video was
published on August 24th oh but there's
more noted Bleeker elder Murtaza n--
published photos of his unboxing of the
pixel 3 XL at mobile review calm he says
he has a prototype version meant for
developers which was sent to him by an
anonymous person Bert azan also posted
pictures of the pixel next to the Huawei
P 20 Pro and the note 9 so you can get a
better sense of scale he says the pixel
3 XL has a 6.2 inch OLED screen which
could be a little brighter in his post
for taz√≥n also mentions that Google is
developing 7 smartphones here's the
breakdown two of them are the 3rd gen
pixel one has a flexible screen which
may arrive in the year 2020 and for
other models seem to be updated pixels
he says that by October two of those
four should be ready so when were the
pixel to be officially unveiled a
Bloomberg report says Google will hold a
media event on October 9th in New York
City this conflicts with the previous
report that said pixel day would be
October 4th by the way some of you in
the audience have suggested that maybe
maybe Google is trying to swerve us the
amount of leaks we've seen is
kind of ridiculous maybe this is all a
deliberate misdirection
I really hope so because that not on the
top with a little alien / robot face
it's just silly over to Android evidence
Xiaomi unveiled the poco phone f1 here
are the specs snapdragon 845 processor
dual rear cameras 20 megapixel
front-facing camera 6.1 8 inch screen
and a four thousand milliamp hour
battery
it starts at $300 that's right 300 there
are some trade-offs for that price it's
got a plastic body the screen is 1080
resolution no wireless charging or any
notable water resistance but it's 300
bucks what do you expect the poco phone
is not expected to hit the US but it is
headed to India in some news you
probably don't care about there are more
details about the red hydrogen 1 phone
that's the phone with what red calls a
holographic screen the alphabet citizens
have made it known that they are not
impressed by this and they think it's
just like the Nintendo 3ds beginning
August 31st red will give the houdini
developers model to a number of
pre-order customers then on October 9th
which may or may not be pixel day more
red hydrogen one devices will ship then
on November 2nd you'll find the red
hydrogen 1 and wireless carrier stores
it will cost just one thousand to two
hundred and ninety five dollars let's go
to assistant Ally
bang and Alton announced that it's
BeoSound one and BeoSound
two speakers will include Google
assistant you can get the BeoSound one
beginning in September for one thousand
seven hundred and fifty dollars it's
battery-powered if you want to dock
it'll cost you an extra one hundred and
seventy five dollars the Bo sound -
which stays plugged in costs two
thousand two hundred and fifty dollars
the - arrives in October some quick math
you could buy forty five Google home
minis for the price of one Bo sound -
but look at the Bo sound it's so pretty
are you gonna buy one of these things
let me know in the comments Google is
also testing out a new feature in
assistant you can ask it tell me
something good and then assistant will
give you a two to three scented summary

problems education and other positive
stories Google says tell me something
good is an experimental feature for the
u.s. LG is building in Google assistant
to its LG tone portable audio products
they will also have real-time
translation abilities using Google
Translate the tone devices have a
dedicated assistant button so you don't
have to use the wake word all the time
there's a new Google smart display say
hello to the JBL link view it uses the
same software as the Lenovo smart
display CNET's Andrew Gebhardt says the
250 dollar JBL link view sounds great
playing music but oddly you can't adjust
the EQ settings yet if you're wondering
where you would need a smart display
like the link view Andrew says it works
best as a kitchen assistant thanks to a
great guided recipe system one more
piece of Google assistant news the
product page for the JBL link bar is now
up at B&amp;amp;H photo $400 will get you a 100
watt sound bar which also has Android TV
and assistant built-in it also has
chromecast built in and can operate as a
Bluetooth speaker as well pre-orders
start in October time for a little stop
over at way more way

consulting way mo is listed as a
shareholder in the company China money
networks cited China's national
enterprise credit information publicity
system as its source on to comment Co

shine a spotlight on the most amazing
audience in the world you guys last time

location even with location history
