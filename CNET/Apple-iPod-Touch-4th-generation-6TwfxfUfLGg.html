giving you a first look at the
fourth-generation Apple iPod Touch now
this is type of Li not the first first
look this is probably the second or
third first look
since this design of the iPod Touch has
been around for this is I think going on
its third year you get 16 gigabytes of
storage for $199 and this is the most
affordable entry point into Apple's iOS
ecosystem now this probably one of the
most underrated iPods out there next to
the iPod Classic personally though this
is probably the iPod I would buy myself
the price is right at $199 for $249 you
can bump up to a 32 gigabyte capacity
it's a time-tested design it has the old
30 pin connector on the bottom so it's
going to work with a ton of accessories
that are already out there on the market
and you get all the fun of iOS you get
the most recent version of iOS all the
apps all the games you get bluetooth on
here airplay Nike+ integration all the
stuff you're used to seeing on iPod
Touch or an iPhone or an iPad which you
get in this small design and like I said
it's the price is perfect you're also
getting twice the capacity that you got
on last year's model which was offered
$199 just eight gigabytes this time
you're getting 16 gigabytes for the same
amount it's a good deal so there's a
newer iPod touch out there the fifth
generation which gives you a larger
4-inch screen it's got a better camera
on the back a lighter thinner design but
it's $100 more then you're gonna be
paying for this for me the 3.5 inch
screen isn't that much smaller the
processor to me what I'm not for my
needs isn't that much faster
you're getting all the same stuff that
you love about iOS but just in a more
affordable package I say the downside of
going with this version of the iPod
Touch and instead of the most recent set
you're dealing with a slightly heavier
design a smaller screen slower processor
if you're really into games you want
stay on the cutting edge go with the
faster processor in the fifth generation
iPod Touch this to me is like the my
iPod Classic this is a time-tested
design it's been around for a while a
lot of great software for this a lot of
great apps a lot of great things you can
do with an iPod Touch $199 is a great
selling point so there you go that's the
4th generation Apple iPod touch it's not
the fastest it's not the flashiest it's
not
the latest or the biggest but at $199 I
can accept a lot of those sacrifices for
a great product for cnet.com I'm Donald
Bell giving a second first look at the
fourth generation Apple iPod touch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
