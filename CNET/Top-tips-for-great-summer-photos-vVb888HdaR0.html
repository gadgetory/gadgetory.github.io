that camera and start getting creative
with your photography I'm going to show
you a couple of cool quick tips that you
can use when taking photos in summary
situations so you can get the most out
of your photography whether using a DSLR
compact or a smartphone first up is
don't be afraid of your camera's inbuilt
flash so obviously you're not going to
be wanting to use flash when you're in
indoor situations but when you're
outdoors it's actually really useful say
for example you have a subject with a
really strong backlight so if the Sun is
right behind what you're taking a photo
of if you turn on your camera's flash
you'll be able to expose for the
background and also illuminate your
subject so they don't end up silhouette
it or as a shadow there's a reason why
photographers get up at the crack of
dawn and that's to make the most of
natural light during what's called
golden hour there's also blue hour to
take advantage of as well and there are
plenty of apps and tools to help you
know when that's going to happen in your
location there's one in particular that
I love it's on iOS and it's just called
golden hour it's free and it gives you x
of sunrise and sunset so you can plan
accordingly there's also plenty of
options on Android too when you're out
on holiday and taking snaps of family
and friends it's pretty easy to forget
to put yourself in the photo apart from
taking selfies with your smartphone and
holding your camera at arm's reach
consider investing in a tripod something
small and portable like a gorilla pod
and then use the self-timer option on
your camera there's also some apps and
tools that help you trigger your camera
using a smartphone finally make natural
light your friend use something like a
reflector to help bounce light from your
light source usually the Sun onto your
subjects face for a nice even
illumination you can use an actual
reflector or something like a pocket
reflector for a compact size or if you
can't be bothered spending the cash you
can really easily DIY it grab a piece of
white styrofoam or a piece of cardboard
and then put
tin foil over it this will pretty much
simulate the effect of an expensive
reflector for zero dollars and you have
yourself an instant reflector for
bouncing available life those are some
quick tips on how to make the most out
of your summer holiday photos if you
