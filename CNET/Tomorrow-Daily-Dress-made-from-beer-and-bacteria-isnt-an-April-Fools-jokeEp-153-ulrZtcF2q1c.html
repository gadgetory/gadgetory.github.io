remote locations access to the internet
with drones and lasers and april fools
is tomorrow but we have a roundup of
some of the jokes that people are going
to be playing tomorrow so that are
already online today and a dress made
from beer everyone rejoiced people
who've wanted a dress made from beer
party of one samar daily
greetings citizen to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley scaled Remy's always killin
eyes what up kill I was worth at pier
dress today speaking of which I know I
did too and then that would've been
super awkward even like showing up to
the Oscars in the same gown so it's your
birthday it is my birthday Ashley's
birthday today and Logan producer Logan
and I decided we'd get her this a tower
of cupcakes very delightful I can't wait
to eat all of them at the same in the
same city you have to wait till the end
of the show I do have to wait till the
end of the show we got really exciting
um April Fool's like we got a little bit
of a head start on that we did so I
assume that's one of the things you guys
are here to see so let's should we just
get started do it so Before we jump in
April Fool's gags there is something
that is not enable fools gag that
actually a few people have asked like
please tell me this is an april fool's
gag unfortunately no but i'll explain
why it's totally fine and you should be
that word it sounds like an april fools
thing it kind of sounds like an april
fool's joke but last week at facebook's
f8 conference they announced that they
had successfully completed a test flight
of a drone that is going to offer
internet to people in remote places so
this is kind of an interesting concept
we've seen you know Project loon that
Google's Project to bring max remote
places internet access via balloons like
remote-controlled balloons yeah it's
crazy so this is via drone so it's
similar but kind of different um this
they did a small scale on are unarmed no
unmanned aerial vehicle I was probably
on arm too um it was a small scale
version of the actual craft which
actually is kind of big it's uh it
doesn't weigh any more than a small car
but the wingspan is as wide as a Boeing
737 so it's like really like the
wingspan is huge it look like they're
gonna need actual permits to fly this oh
yeah of course and there's safety issues
and feasibility issues and all this
stuff but the cool thing is is these
will be solar-powered in the future like
when they actually if they if and when
they do launch these things into the sky
they'll be solar powered so they
theoretically could be
in the sky like four weeks or months
which is kind of neat um they would the
drones called akela akela a qu IL a
acute aquia and they want to have the
first test flight the summer of the
full-size model so they did this little
small-scale version they said it was
successful they wanted to test for
aerodynamic stuff like that and it'll
fly our kind of go around at about sixty
thousand and ninety thousand feet up
which is pretty high up there and the
idea is that it would be equipped with
these like sort of lasers that would be
mown an impt like a backbone of internet
access beam down internet to remote
areas in in the world so I know Project
loon a lot of project loons kind of
processes they were saying we could give
internet access not only to places that
are really remote but we could also give
it to places that have suffered a
catastrophe so if there's a tsunami or
an earthquake or something like that
they could bring these balloons like
remote control them over there and give
internet so Facebook kind of wants to do
the same thing obviously what imagine
part of it is a little bit because you
know they have not collected everybody
into Facebook they want all six billion
people using facebook like that and
giving them internet access when they
didn't have it before it's probably a
good way to do that get some goodwill
going then go they gave me internet
access maybe I'll sign up for facebook
um but yeah so pretty interesting no no
launch dates no no word on like when
this might actually be happening it
could be years from now it could be good
being a couple years I don't know it
depends on again safety testing
feasibility testing they really have to
see if this thing is something that
could be sustainable so but really
interesting and you shouldn't really be
that terrified about it because if
you're watching this show you probably
live somewhere where you will never see
one of these Facebook drones even if
they did end up going into into service
that's that'd be cool if they just
beamed tomorrow daily into your house if
you were loved in a remote area yeah
just a daily I'm like that and like
remote like huts and houses so get like
all over the place and then maybe like
this is what the Internet's for forget
it I don't want it take it back Facebook
unfriend I'd like to unfriend my entire
internet are you ready for a push oh
that sounded like an April Fool's joke
but uh so obviously April Fool's is
tomorrow depending on when you're
watching this
episode maybe it's today b-but we
already have a head start at some of
these things they some people get them
started early so that they can on April
first go april fools so here we have
three tek ones to talk about the first
one is from google and has to do with
google maps because they always screw
around with google maps they did a
Pokemon one I think last year this one
is is you can play pacman inside your
your browser for google maps you can
even do it on your phone work lovingly
calling this pack maps but you can find
your neighborhood and play pac-man as if
you know yeah it's basically that movie
pixels but not terrible so there you go
that's not your first one so you can
just try that Google Maps and then
there'll be a little pacnet icon you
click the button and it turns your map
into it into pac-man so there you go so
that's the first one very simple very
easy very fun yeah you're you know
anybody can enjoy this next one is like
a press release from Samsung I kind of
lie but a brand new phone and it's not
just a phone it is a knife this is the
Samsung Galaxy blade edge it's the new
phone they're making fun of themselves
which is what I like about this one
because they have that edge farms yeah
so this one they have this whole press
release for it see there's a there's
little factoids but there's a whole
press release and they like really get
into it they're like they're like uh
renders your knives obsolete it can it
can cut food and has all the latest
features it has a diamond edge it uses
analyze it analyzes your your hand to
find out how much weight the the knife
needs to weigh fireproof waterproof as a
finger protection so you don't cut
yourself foldable handle it's ridiculous
come on they really think it all the way
through a tiny get samsung galaxy
cleaver yeah they're saying that you
scan your thumbprint on the phone and
then it will register that it will never
cut you because it'll know when it's
your head everything they think it all
the way through the press releases is
pretty funny but lastly let's talk about
how far Google went okay as far as to
fake a press conference I mean obviously
it's a video principle but it but you
can hear like people coughing but they
have a press conference for the google
panda oh look look at this press
conference they did there's even like
people live their phone
yeah it's so great but this is the
google panda it's basically kind of like
your little mobile ask google thing
you're okay Google you look at it and
you ask it like how what what are nimbus
clouds you like I love you but here's
what Nimmi was clubs so it's like oh
that's good for anyone um I love that
they uploaded this to their Google Japan
youtube account with subtitles in in
Japanese when people are speaking
English and in English from people are
speaking Japanese this is fantastic yeah
look they may they mimicked a press
conference so perfectly they iLike again
when they described why why and how it
works they're like well you know the fur
is so that it's shockproof and you can
drop it on the ground and they're like
black and white because and foot and
furry because you know all the threads
of technology buying together it's great
then they also at the end introduced
well we're releasing the the google
panda five and the much larger google
panda six so there you go that's great
those are the first ones that we found
if you guys find any other ones maybe
hit us up on twitter at tomorrow daily
yeah yeah that's a marketer send us some
and that's a hashtag of the day Oh
where's Kiwi all right TD fold you can
hit us up on Twitter you can even send
us an email send us a link to whatever
it is that you got either fooled by her
you thought was really clever we're
dying to hear what you find and and and
catch on the internet because there's
always lots of it tomorrow and also one
of the ones that i saw that was a week
in the making was a whole bunch of
websites picked up on this there's a
rumor going around that like oh there
was a leak that spotify was going to get
sold in exactly one week from you know
today which was last Wednesday they're
like it's going to get sold exactly one
week from today for 14 billion dollars
and then it turned think that was like
they had to like set it up a week in
advance okay oh it's exactly a week from
today then people kind of picked up
there was probably ones you know what
are you I know you hate april fools I
mean for deep-seated reason I do but I
don't know if I really like ones that
are just kind of like they're gonna sell
Spotify April Fool's I call him on that
wasn't fun Google bit ly real effort
Google and Samsung put some real effort
into it they're they're great like when
they were explained they had like they
had the panda bear on a stool
and they're like its shock resistant
because we built the fur into it and
they have this little robot we're she's
a panda bear off and it falls and it
goes like this and i also have like
grids of what the panda bear looks like
it's so sensors but this said have fun
with it thinkgeek is obviously every
year they have always have the best man
and not only do they have like some
really cool items you're like wait they
should have that than they make and then
they make it yeah if you like say I want
I'm game for that stuff if you finally
work look here it is here's I'm pushing
the bear off the grid it's so high tech
I love when they put effort into it
maybe ours tomorrow we'll have effort in
20 if we do one if we do you love did
you know who almond is tomorrow daily I
don't know I'm stupid let's go to the
next one alright last story I'll make it
quick a few years ago there was a wine
dress I don't some of you might have
seen iJustine wearing it there was like
an AOL feature on it but the this wine
dress was made of like fermented wine
and bacteria and the same designer and
same designer and same scientists as a
visual artist and a scientist
collaborating together on this made a
beer dress so this dress is actually
this is it this is a dress made of beer
which is kind of cool so here is how it
works there the material they're calling
it Nana lowes microbial cellulose it
uses fermented beer and bacteria and
hair and what they do is they add this
bacteria called assetto vector to beer
and that makes the bacteria convert the
beer and a solid fibers and it's going
to be so so it makes these solid fibers
now the wine dress had to always be
moist it always had to be like really
and it it was kind of stinky it looked
like fruit roll-ups it was really gross
like wet fruit roll-up so it was kind of
gross looking this actually looks
relatively wearable and apparently there
are no odors there is a lot of
flexibility in this like the other one
is very skin tight like it's basically
like I mean literally put some fruit
roll-ups on yourself and make a dress
and that was what it was this is much
more kind of accessible to most people
they say oh I could wear that like I
might wear something made out of that
type of material you have any factoids
for this because I'm wondering like how
much beer it took them to make this did
they not release anything like that I
haven't said anything yet it's gonna be
on display at the world expo in Italy so
people can go see it and like check it
out and they'll probably talk a little
more about the process I know
we get sent to the world expo I don't
think so I don't think in Italy no um
but they hope that be the goal of this
as we like to do oh yeah yeah we got
another goal the goal here side's art it
besides art is that someday maybe this
this process might replace really costly
an aggressive agriculture like cotton so
cotton is it an extremely large like
crop you have to make a lot of cod and
be able to make clothes and so it's a
lot of aggressive agriculture that
happens around it to just create cotton
in and of itself and so they were saying
that maybe in the future this might
replace that and we all be wearing beer
clothes oh don't worry and fear close
tonight maybe we'll someday how do you
wash it is this washable uh it seems
like it's a fabric so I I don't yet it's
a water it turns into beer that way she
turns back into Barry what are you sure
it was spilled beer on it that just
turns in a beer it cancels itself out i
don't know that's pretty interesting
they're tackling that as a solution to
to cut yeah like this did this team of
this scientist and his visual artists
are really fascinating like they they're
just really interested in like this kind
of process of sort of adding bacteria to
different sort of liquids and seeing
what happens and this is sort of one of
the things that they kind of struck upon
and again disclaimer everybody I did as
much research as I could into this this
broke like like days ago so I'm hoping
that it's not an April Fool's gag but
you know who knows maybe it is I have
knowing well if they have the video it's
gonna be at an expo like nobody wins on
this one like they had the wine dress
yeah why wouldn't they why wouldn't this
be real so I assumed this was I'm
guessing based on the story I'm guessing
this is a real thing make me a mr. Pibb
dress oh that would be delightful or
shirt shirt or suit you don't have to
make it a dress suit I'd love to see you
too mr. Pibb suit oh I'll be pretty good
all right hip mr. Pibb we're gonna take
a quick break we'll be right back we
have a round of new releases some good
ones this week and then we have your
user feedback and our photogra for the
day but before we go check out this this
sheep herder that is a drone
welcome back to the show everybody I you
know somebody on YouTube just really
briefly before you jump into new
releases someone I'm YouTube made a
comment of like I can't take these too
seriously and I actually wrote back and
I was like if you are looking to take
people seriously you have come to the
wrong place sir not to do it not here
not here really not ever move along I'm
sorry to have fun I said yeah inform
there are people much better at being
taken taking people seriously our
viewers that watch that enjoy the show
they get what we're trying to do here
which is send a promotion I can't even
take myself seriously you sir we're not
do we don't do serious you sir are
looking at the wrong show very true ok
so it's Tuesday which means it's like
kind of one of our favorite parts of the
week which is we could talk about all
the stuff that's gonna make our wallet
card get to it new releases
always when your voice cracks just was
roll way to roll that just go with it
I'm really excited for you this is an
important time in your life I will be
miss get a hunt down I gonna hunt a wolf
or something like right it got a bear
get take a ride on a bear uh so you like
Metroidvania games right like 2d action
sidescroller force yeah who doesn't so
there was there's this great game called
axiom verge I don't know if you've ever
heard of it oh it's coming out today for
ps4 they're gonna release it for windows
pc though and also a PlayStation Vita
later so keep an eye out for that but
it's getting great reviews I have not
played it yet I plan on it I fully plan
on picking this up it's actually I think
it's on sale if you're a PlayStation
Plus member it's like a couple bucks off
as a 20 of us totally metroid 100% like
Metroidvania um and it's it's pretty
cool there are some reviewers who like a
giant bomb which never gives out five
stars for anything gave this 5 stars
she's pretty awesome i love it um yeah
so this is it's getting great reviews it
is totally a Metroid / kao slaves
Metroidvania side scroller such a good
good game highly recommended I if you
love this type of game how much is it
twenty bucks that's not bad totally
reasonable and a lot of work went into
it and it's not on pc yet but it will
yeah but it will be um and they're these
developers are just they are literally
like the best in the game at making that
type of game so what else it they may I
assure you it's another game just like
it's in the same see franchise but it
was like it was a it was a while ago I
want to say it was like maybe 10 years
cause any touch of my indie games as I
should be so um I kind of em not but I
know about this I know about is a grace
particularly good good pick Super Kick
um and then also if you're single enough
this comes out from mobile I came out a
few days ago and it's actually getting
really good reviews and I I'm very
hesitant always to recommend like free
to play in app purchase games especially
ones that are from really big companies
like Disney but Star Wars rebels recon
missions is apparently getting really
awesome reviews it's a platformer and
you played on your phone yeah it's like
a full-on platform watch you'll see it
you'll see some of the gameplay see look
it's on your phone look how nice that
looks yeah it looks pretty good
ours rebels and it's there's some in-app
purchases but from what I've read you
really it's like eight bucks to unlock
like most of the game's content that you
would need to like finish it and then on
top of that another thing I really liked
was and you guys will be really excited
about this iOS Android and Windows Phone
yeah everybody wins I failed on all
three platforms and it's also available
I think for like windows so it's in the
windows marketplace like if you don't
have either any of those smartphones but
yeah I thought that was pretty cool
that's great you know you haven't tried
it out yet haven't tried it out yet but
I actually when I saw the trailer for
and I was like oh this actually wait
folks is a lot of money by the way for a
cell phone yet current currently see I
disagree with that but i have a whole I
have a whole rant about like giving
developers the money that they have
earned like making a game and so it
depends to me how much replay abilities
in the game and also like I'd give
jetpack drive given jetpack joyride like
twenty dollars at this point just like
just buying coins and stuff because I'm
like well the developers have earned my
money look I bought I bought GTA on
there like all the duties Final Fantasy
debug it's free play so it's like you
play it for free and a few if you don't
want to pay anymore you don't respect
yeah so and then also uh I don't know
how many people are super jacked about
this movie but furious 7 comes out this
yeah so get in our cars it's all above
film family family family family now
let's jump this car from one building
into another everybody that's seen its
mind has been blown and I'm talking
about out I'm talking about like I met
up with this guy who's like this really
snobby movie guy that I like that's my
friend she loved he's like I'm telling
you it is crazy he goes I've seen them
all I'm telling you this is crazy Vin
Diesel says this is gonna win Best
Picture Best Picture Helen Mirren says
she wants to be in a basket furious
movie uh there everyone's saying the
paul walker thing was handled perfectly
I can't really think of a reason not to
see this you have to go to the theater
and see guilty movies every now and
again to this is a guilty pleasure mood
guilty pleasure movie I love Luda I know
Luda look at this machine guns on the
side of a bus all this as you're jumping
out of planes yeah if you if you go see
this you know exactly what you're
getting I love it you want to go have
fun at the movies
and go strawberries show up Regas just
everybody ever that is awesome and then
the Fast and Furious movies not too for
us to get to to distract on this have
been getting better and better in their
own respect I think starting to
understand what they are I've seen none
of them and i plan on an entire marathon
before i go see ferry seven like this we
can have a little movie marathons all
the spoiler free yet it's about family
I've heard that I've heard it's about
family it's a bad family I am Groot this
is also about family it's about fair you
guys are our fam hey fam hey get my next
day okay we r group okay so we asked you
guys use the hashtag TD 64 to tell us
what game would absolutely ruin you if
it was available in a browser to play as
opposed to a lot of responses a lot of
responses and really good ones I have to
say though if you have not yet played
that that demo that HD demo it is gone
Nintendo cease and desist that thing
into oblivion the 40 mm Mario is gone I
actually got into it with somebody in
the comments in the YouTube but let's
get to you all right uh Walter wrote i
would want to play mario kart 8 in my
browser multiplayer that would possibly
caused me to OD on gaming oh my god
would never end and never end yep Neil
wrote in and said i would love
minesweeper available for everyone to
play so much fun I think I feel like
that probably can't play that in a
browser with that this is you learning
that it probably does exist so at
Michael wrote in and said and a couple
other people did too mario super mario
RPG legend of the seven stars i fully
back and endorse that that one because
that is one of my all-time favorite
mario games that I feel is very
underrated and nobody ever remembers it
but I remember it it's a great game do
you remember that game yes you're like
malo and gino and like all it though
it's really hard you made by square enix
yes way to bring that back i haven't
played it we do that uh and then over on
youtube Michael one two three four to
five to 11 TD 64 i would pick pokemon or
mario kart 8 so another vote from our oh
man i think the pokemon would be good
too pokemon be gonna do and then Greg
road on via email and said beam writer
descent good show thanks
but I mean if he wants it to be in
browser probably is pretty good right
there were some good ones on YouTube
that I got into it with somebody that
was like what game was that they were
like oh someone would say smash brothers
is available available I was like well
no we were talking about in browser said
someone tells him that anywhere ash
brothers yeah 3 and I don't have a 3ds
so I'd need to buy the game and the 3
d's i play it and then I'd need to
connect to you but it's on the browser I
just would be in browser immediately
well great choices shockingly everyone
still stuck to nintendo we didn't say it
had to be I could have said fallout but
I try to think outside the kale box fair
enough so take the box anyway thanks for
submissions a lot a lot of them really
good at a time and a lot of really good
