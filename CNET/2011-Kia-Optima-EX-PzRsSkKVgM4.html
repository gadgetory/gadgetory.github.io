but the look is real different we'll see
about the rest as we drive a 2011 Optima
e.x and check the tech Mondays on roll
these days but less is being said about
its corporate cousin Kia until lately
Kia was mostly seen as a cheaper version
of a Hyundai that's not cool but now
that Hyundai underpinnings are a good
thing Kia's building on that with its
own bold styling thanks to nabbing
former outie design boss Peter Schreyer
he's the guy who did the TT while this
is the sibling of the Sonata it shares
little of that car as swoopy external
looks instead the optimist kind of bold
more handsome of the two sort of a demi
sob two Hyundai's Demi Lexus inside the
same applies the Kia exhibits the now
rare driver centered cockpit layout that
most cars have given up now the first
thing you notice in this Optima is it
ain't a sonata in the cabin that's not
I've got a whole different thing with
this Darth Vader mask and the kind of
weird face down here it's very centered
this car is totally cockpit oriented it
reminds me a lot of a Saab cabin I don't
know where they picked up that design
motif but you've got the 3-ring thing
it's very hyundai-kia but this sort of
angled cockpit panel a lot of folks have
commented to me hey I don't see that
very often and I like it so it's a very
driver centric setting you've got a
steering wheel crammed with lots of
interesting buttons they're useful media
on the Left cruise control on the right
eco trip and reset on the left we'll
talk about that in a minute
and here's your voice command your
Bluetooth controls over here by the way
the Bluetooth rig is standard on this
Optima EX let's go to the head unit
you've got your single CD slot right
here which also digest
mp3 cds though not WMA I don't think
here's your navigation screen pretty
good resolution that's optional by the
way we'll talk about the pricing a
little later but you've got touchscreen
voice command as I mentioned but not
really kind of any sort of standardized
controller there's no howdy MMI or BMW
idrive it's either touch or voice or
you've got some dedicated buttons but
this is not a master jog wheel nothing
like that lots of buttons for the nav
system it gets a little bit fuzzy here
you have map and voice not quite sure
why those are all on one button little
odd destination is a destination screen
route is a separate set of route options
you see they kind of split this up a
little bit much for my tastes but it's
easy to use and notice the response is
quite quick on this guy to do a
destination address it's real simple and
it moves quickly I like that
now let's go to our media options am/fm
no HD radio available on this car any
way shape or form satellite radio is the
serious flavor the media button brings
you up to our phone which is bluetooth
streaming as well as the Bluetooth
hands-free I talked about we've also got
the CD option in here if I didn't have
my ipod plugged in which is another
option
I do have these two connectors down here
standard analog aux and I've got the USB
jack the only weird thing is Haeundae
key I still use this guy which you're
not going to find at Best Buy if you
lose it it's a USB aux signees connector
they move audio over one connector do
control and charging over another the
game while the sound out of there is a
six speaker kind of generic audio system
bass or we had the Infinity rig which is
obviously noted up here it's part of a
premium package by the way gives you a
variety of settings you know you get a
mid control which I don't think the base
rig has auto volume control might not be
on the base rig aside from that it's not
fancy the transmission is one choice
only on this guy it's a six-speed
Automatic through automatic it's not a
CVT it's not an automated manual it's
got a little sport shifting gate here on
the left which isn't all that sporty
they all work about the same
okay the last cool thing in this car
which is kind of mid tech is this roof
well roofs won over me won over them
you've got this control right here which
does a dual power rollback of the
screens and then slides this big glass
panel up over the second row they still
end
with a pretty good glass-top overhead or
better yet if you're going to be a
little more magnanimous just bring your
panel forward and give it a little kick
up to tilt and then everyone gets a full
glass overhead now what's most
interesting about this engine is not
that it's a 2.4 liter sidesaddle inline
4 seen about a million of those but
these 3 letters GDI gasoline direct
injection kind of cutting-edge stuff
especially for a car in this price class
the Sonata has the same powertrain
there's also a turbo by the way and a
hybrid coming on this Optima but we'll
cover those in another video here are
the numbers 200 horsepower out of this
guy 186 foot-pounds of torque 0 to 60 is
about 9 point 4 seconds for this 3,300
pound car and the mileage is pretty darn
good
24:34 ok on the road this car's not
terribly impressive on paper with 200
horsepower but the power is ready and
willing it's what a car like this needs
to have is power across a wide range of
rpms and it does have that the
combination of the direct injection and
the other technologies being used here
like this eco we've got going on give
you a really good fuel economy for a
biggish car at the same time it's not a
gutless car now the Eco button down here
that I mentioned what that does is
modify throttle response shift points on
the transmission and air conditioning
which means the air conditioner is going
to engage less often as I understand it
all of those lead to better fuel economy
through different means when it's in
Drive and you're in Eco you definitely
feel a difference the car gets a little
non-responsive but for drivers that want
to maximize their mpg they don't care if
you're cruising down a boulevard perfect
mode to be in but I found driving around
town and eco mode was annoying it made
the car kind of rubbery and numb so pink
I popped out of it most of the time that
said what am I seeing here in my average
nineteen point nine mpg I've probably
been more city than highway by far up
and down a lot of hills and like I say
out of eco mode so I'm pushing it down
toward the bottom of its average range
the steering is very heavily weighted on
center so once you come off center it
doesn't really want to stay there wants
to go back to center very strongly which
all cars do the thing is this one is
very heavily weighted back down toward
the middle I bring this up because in
Long sort of leisurely driving on curved
highways or boulevards you kind of need
two hands to keep it in the curve one
hand will get fatigued and that kind of
takes away from the everyday driving
comfort a little bit but overall it's
nice to see I'll put together a new
entrant to go up against Camry and
Accord and not one that makes you think
okay what can it do being a second-rate
car now you just have to grade it as a
first-rate car okay let's price this
Optima again it's a 2011 e.x they only
come front-wheel drive it's kind of the
mid trim there is an S EXO sporty or one
above it and like I mentioned there's
also a hybrid and a turbo for another
time this guy will base it 23 2 to go
see that style you got really one
package and maybe one other to think
about the one you got to get is the tech
package 2,000 bucks that gets you the
navigation system that whole super
speedy interface Sirius satellite radio
the better infinity sound the backup
camera for 2 grand kind of a steal then
there's this Premium Package to get you
the panoramic roof which I like and
heated and cooled front seats power
passenger's seat and the rather novel
heated rear seats I think I'd go for
that too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
