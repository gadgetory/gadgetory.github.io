it's time to get loaded Apple updated
their imac line today the systems start
at twelve hundred dollars and depending
on the configuration they will come with
Intel's Core i3 i5 and i7 processors and
the ati radeon HD 5750 apple also added
a new 12-core mac pro and a brand new
product called the magic trackpad it's
priced at seventy dollars and lets you
use multi touch on a desktop like you
would on a macbook these are out on the
Apple Store today google has a new set
of apps designed for the US government
this is the first of its kind to receive
federal Information Security Management
Act certification from the government
which means the information stored and
exchanged is secure Google Apps for
government stores Gmail and calendar
data in a separate system exclusively
for the government the service is now
available to any federal state or local
government in the u.s. iphone 4 is
coming to 17 more countries on friday
starting July thirtieth Apple will begin
selling the smartphone to select
countries around the world including
Australia Canada the Netherlands Hong
Kong Sweden and many more South Korea
was said to get the phone at the same
time but was excluded due to regulatory
issues from the South Korean government
they'll be available both in retail
stores and online the company also says
the white version of the iphone 4 will
be delayed until later on this year and
Microsoft wants to get gamers out of the
house every once in a while the company
has a deal with movietickets.com that
will let you purchase tickets from the
Xbox console the service would place
movie ads on Xbox Live and players can
click on an ad prompting them to use
their phone to activate a microsoft tag
for buying movie tickets HP is ditching
windows 7 on its future smartphones to
focus on its own web OS software HP is
still going to use Windows 7 for its
upcoming slate tablet when it's
available but no word on what HP will
call the new line of smartphones the
Library of Congress says you can go
ahead and jailbreak your eyes
if you feel so inclined they ruled
yesterday that jailbreaking a smartphone
is permissible under the Digital
Millennium Copyright acts fair use
provisions Apple prohibits iphone users
from jailbreaking but the Electronic
Frontier Foundation stated that an
iphone user is the owner of the firmware
and that jailbreaking is for
non-commercial private use of the phone
so now jailbreakers can continue what
they've been doing that's your news for
now i'm marco sayo with cnet thanks for
