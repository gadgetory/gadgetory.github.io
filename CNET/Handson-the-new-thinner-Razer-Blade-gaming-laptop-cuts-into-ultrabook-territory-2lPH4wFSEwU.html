going on in the world of PC gaming right
now well you've got new Intel processors
on the horizon and you've got companies
that are trying to redefine Windows 8 in
the middle of that you got Razer who has
made some pretty aggressive products now
they've just announced a brand-new
laptop another razor blade this is a
classic gaming laptop but it's very thin
and we've got one right here
and you can see right here it is thin
it's really thin and in fact at his
dimensions that resemble the Retina
Display MacBook Pro in terms of how
compact and solid feeling it is it's all
aluminum and it's matte black and it's
kind of like a dream maybe macbook pro
dedicated to gaming and what you've got
inside our specs that to fit a
higher-end type of laptop a quad core
Core i7 processor that's fourth
generation we can't even get into the
specifics of that until an embargo
that's coming soon and we've got
graphics in here NVIDIA GTX 765 M
GeForce graphics with 2 gigabytes of
gddr5 memory inside so which is pretty
nice 8 gigabytes of RAM and a
solid-state hard drive in here not
standard mechanical hard drive starting
128 gigabytes you can go up to 256 or
512 they notice some things here the
price is $17.99 so that's high but if
you're comparing it to stuff like the
$2,000 Retina Display MacBook Pro or do
high-end gaming laptops it's not as high
4.1 pounds so it's not super light but
it is something that fits pretty easily
into a backpack and it has a 14 inch
1600 by 900 display as you can see here
the display is matte but it is not touch
a lot of gaming laptops seem to be going
in this direction avoiding touch because
gamers may not necessarily want it it
does have a standard trackpad beneath
with its own dedicated click buttons and
a full backlit keyboard here it's got
synapse 2.0 for those who connect to
razors programmable ecosystem but there
are no extra macro buttons and nothing
like a touchscreen over here there are
dual stereo speakers on the side that
are Dolby equip they're nice and loud
serve surprising
when you first hear them and a little
power button right up there what's it
missing well it doesn't have an optical
drive it doesn't have an Ethernet jack
it has three USB 3.0 ports and it has
HDMI kind of bare-bones
but if you're looking at it as a gaming
device on the go maybe that's the style
I would have preferred an Ethernet jack
I'm sure a lot of people would and
there's no dongle in the box so you'll
have to find a solution there is this
going to be a success we'll have to see
I mean Razer had some pretty
experimental designs before but the nice
thing throughout all of those products
has been a really nice attention to
detail and design this is probably the
most accessible product that razors made
in terms of computer hardware so where
does that put the razor blade it is a
very nice design will you miss the
touchscreen
who knows stay tuned for a full review
coming up soon I'm Scott Stein with the
new 14-inch razor blade from razor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
