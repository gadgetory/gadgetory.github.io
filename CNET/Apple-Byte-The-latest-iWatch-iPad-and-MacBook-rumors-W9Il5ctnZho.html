the Apple by for everything good and bad
inside the world of Apple now I know
last week kind of felt like a Google
bite but we have a bunch of stories this
week so let's get started now we've
heard all the talk about Apple working
with music labels to lock in deals for
their upcoming I radio service but
according to cnet one of the issues
holding up negotiations has to do with
the economics of skipping songs now
Apple and sony are still trying to
hammer out details for how much Apple
would pay for songs that people listen
to a fraction of and then skip see the
big a service resembles Pandora more
than anything else but has the iTunes
machine and advertising that will give
labels more revenue streams and this is
the real sexy stuff that goes on behind
the scenes now Apple's reached an
agreement with universal music they're
close with warner and they've been
pushing hard to get their service out
this summer but with Pandora Spotify and
even Google getting into music streaming
we'll see how different this service
really is now there's also new tidbits
about iOS 7 from nine to five Mac they
report that Apple plans to increase its
integration of third-party social
networks including Flickr and Vimeo now
Twitter and Facebook are already plugged
into the iOS and users will be able to
sign into the social networks through
the settings and we'll have full sharing
access vmail would be the first video
partner plugged into iOS after Apple
remove their preloaded YouTube app also
you guys heard about this Tim Cook
recently appeared at a Senate hearing to
dress claims that Apple uses gimmicks
and tax loopholes you swear that the
testimony you're about to give now the
hearing didn't lead to any real
resolution and there was a lot of back
and forth but we do have footage from
inside the event we recommend a dramatic
simplification of the corporate tax code
we don't depend on tax gimmicks we don't
move intellectual property offshore and
use it to sell our products back to the
United States to avoid taxes we don't
stash money on some Caribbean island
this reform should be revenue neutral
eliminate all corporate tax expenditures
or corporate income tax rates and
implement a reasonable tax that allows
the free flow of capital back to United
States we know Apple isn't the only
major company withholdings or operations
in Ireland known for their friendly
corporate tax rates and the hearing
wrapped up when John McCain jokingly
asked why the hell I have to keep
updating the apps on my iphone all the
time and why you don't fix that
everybody who are senior public servants
hard at work all right let's do a quick
rumor mill update we're still expecting
to see a macbook speed bump refresh at
WWDC this year it's happened the past
couple of years so there's no surprise
there and don't buy one right now please
also didja Times reports that production
of apples fifth-generation 9.7 inch iPad
will begin soon with volume production
in July the iPad will still have the
same retina display resolution but it
will be built on a thinner piece of
glass at 0.2 millimeters compared to
0.25 on the last gen and it will only
use one LED for backlighting instead of
to the report claims the changes will
contribute to making the 5th gen ipad
twenty five to thirty three percent
lighter than the fourth gen and even if
the iWatch hype has died down some which
I'm totally okay with Japanese blog
Macotakara says Apple is currently
testing 1.5 inch o LED displays for the
rumored iWatch that could possibly
launched in december will see also apple
said they intended to manufacture one of
its existing Mac lines exclusively here
in the US and Tim Cook revealed it will
be in Texas the Longhorn state now cook
added they're investing 100 million
dollars the product will be assembled in
Texas it will include components made in
Illinois and Florida and rely on
equipment produced in Kentucky and
Michigan they also say the new name of
the product line will be the ameri map
