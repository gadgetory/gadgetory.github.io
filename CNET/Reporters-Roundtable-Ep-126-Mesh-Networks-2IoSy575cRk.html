needleman in San Francisco today I'm
going to ask you to indulge me in
covering one of my favorite technology
topics which is mesh networking the
connection between your wireless devices
in the global communications network is
a tenuous thing Wi-Fi links are great
when they work but gadgets spend a lot
of time out of range and cellular links
they're dependent on commercial and
surprisingly vulnerable cell towers
while few of us in the developed world
have experienced a critical lack of
connectivity in our lives it can happen
at any time and it can be
life-threatening during a natural
disaster the communications
infrastructure can fail due to power
outages or panic-driven overuse when a
repressive government threatens a
population usually the first thing they
try to control is their citizens
communications with each other and the
outside world mesh networks in theory
are more robust than point-to-point
communications in a mesh network any
device with a connection can share that
connection with other devices it's hard
to shut down or censor a mesh network by
strangling it at just one point it's
also hard to spy on what's happening on
a mesh network which is one reason the
technology is used for military
communications can mesh networks make
our existing Wi-Fi and cellular networks
more robust cheaper and safer can they
give voice to the oppressed or the
sensor today we're looking at the latest
mesh technology products and the
interesting places they could take the
communications industry
our guests today are too long time
experts in mesh networking technology
first three sri krishna whose the
founding CTO of the mesh networking
company tropos which was just acquired
by the power infrastructure company ABB
congratulations thank you now that she
has left tropos he's trying to bring
mesh technology to people around the
world we're going to discuss what that
means as the show goes on again congrats
and welcome thank you also joining us is
misha benoliel the CEO and co-founder of
open garden a consumer mesh networking
company that's trying to bring mesh to a
different group of people which is you
and me welcome to you and
congratulations on your great showing at
the TechCrunch event a couple of months
ago so I want to do what I like doing
here which is start from first
principles and then build up from there
so let's discuss technically what is a
mesh network and why we need it I mean
let's start with you mesh networks are a
technology that has have been existing
for a while now and it's completely
timely for mesh networks to improve
connectivity for everybody today and
when you see the limitations we have
with 3g 4g technologies Wi-Fi network
access mesh networks can help a lot to
improve the situation and bring to every
consumer ubiquitous access to the
internet but but in a technologically in
a nutshell what is it instead of my
phone connecting to a tower my phone
connects to another phone three how's
that that's right so the original mesh
networks were designed in the military
to for survivable communication so that
soldiers could communicate with each
other in the most harshest conditions
and they have some very powerful radios
that they connect to it so that they can
communicate our tens of kilometers and
get back you know sit and talk and get
the data and these are without any
infrastructure because the seven
soldiers can't have any infrastructure
when they're in a battlefield situation
so that's what the idea of a mesh
network is and so we had since the
initial application of mesh networks
military they have been many different
variations of mesh networks that have
been used throughout the world both for
cities as well as for small-scale inside
buildings you know in for utility core
utilities across very large areas so and
as well as the peer-to-peer meshes like
like open garden where people are trying
to connect with each other so I guess
the idea here is that one device can
connect to touch down to two or connect
to the rest of the internet through
another device somewhere that is
connected to that is that has a touch
point and as I understand it when I
first heard about this technology many
years ago I thought wow this is Magic
why aren't we all using this and then I
started to talk to guys like you and
understood that there are technological
challenges of actually building a mesh
network that in theory it's great but
there are problems with computational
overhead and battery life can you talk
about that a little bit absolutely so
when we started opening Island we had
the face many technical challenges first
we had to enable devices to recognize
themselves seamlessly and avoid
processes like discoverability or
pairing because if you want a mesh
network to be efficient you want to be
able to access to someone else device to
to have connectivity without any
interaction with your own device or the
any other interaction for the person who
is going to provide you with
connectivity so the first this were the
first barrier we encountered when we
released the whore software before we
will install software and we found a way
to avoid discoverability and pairing and
one use case we can describe here is
let's say you are in a space where you
have access to a Wi-Fi network I arrived
into that space and I don't have access
to the Wi-Fi network because it is a
password protected my carrier is not
providing providing me coverage and I
want to access to the internet then if
you have open garden software installed
on one of your device it can be your
phone or it can be your laptop then I
will be able through my laptop also my
phone
access to that Wi-Fi access point so so
basically it not only provides me with
access to the internet but can also
increase the range of access for this
Wi-Fi hotspots because I can be hopping
onto a device that's then connected to
another device that has access to this
Wi-Fi this Wi-Fi hotspot wow that sent
as a consumer okay so let's dive into
open garden a little bit in the consumer
applications of this and then then we'll
get into these other the repressed
consumers that sounds to me like
paradise like a a communicators paradise
where as long as I have access and other
people can use it as long as somebody
else's access then I can use that but it
also sets off alarm bells to me in terms
of my devices already have very limited
battery power and now I'm could be
sharing my connection with other people
and using my battery life and then I
cannot imagine that the providers of
gated connectivity whether it's a paid
Wi-Fi hotspot or my cellular carrier are
cool with the idea of me repurposing
re-enabling people that are not
subscribers to use their network so
let's talk about first the the consumer
device impact and then get into
economics so there are batteries
obviously an important point when you
comes to mesh networks and most
specifically when it it is an
application like our application that is
installed on a mobile phone so we when
we arrive in the place where there is
density of devices you are the mesh
actually can create good opportunities
for battery conception and I give you a
very simple example let's say your your
phone is full on battery and my phone is
very low on battery and I want to access
to the internet then instead of using my
expensive link which will use my 3g or
4g radio interface i will just use a
bluetooth link to your
phone which is full on battery and then
be able to access to the Internet my
phone is for you you are French aren't
you because this is such a socialist
idea so now we take your empty battery
in my full battery now we both got half
battery life left but I'm the paying
customer and I don't know I don't know
you so you think that the people will go
for this they will they will suffer
hidden battery in order to help to be
because so first in that scenario I
extend my battery life obviously is
going to take some of your battery yes
okay go ahead and there comes there is a
we want to create a system with credits
so basically and this will require more
iterations it is not implemented yet
into how software but the more we
advance into the implementation of the
features of the software we will test
and create credit ecosystem so the more
you give whether it's bites or it could
be also jewels if we fall for battery
usage the more credits you get and those
users and energy jewels absolutely okay
and then you can use the dis credits
when you need connectivity when you
don't have access to an available Wi-Fi
hotspot or if you are traveling for
example and you want to avoid expensive
roaming charges and why not also reward
users when they give some of their
battery to some other users interesting
but that we require iterations obviously
and we are not there yet but we are
that's where we are going now I know
you've looked at this from the point the
economics in the political perspective
from the carriers and Sri I imagine you
have as well I mean tropos was it's now
doing power infrastructure but it was
broader than that yes when you started
so so talk about the economic and
business angle of sharing network
connectivity and this is this issue goes
beyond mesh I mean when people started
opening up hot Wi-Fi hotspots in their
homes the the ISPs began to get really
upset that people would be sharing their
Wi-Fi with people they didn't know so
how does this play out yes I think
that's a very good question and vicious
points about credits is also very in
every spot on and the carrier's actually
welcomed the use of Wi-Fi now because
their networks
overloaded with the data and in fact
it's a one of the advantages of meshes
it's actually more power efficient and
the reason is that when you're
communicating with the cell tower that's
miles away your cell phone has to burn a
lot of power just to send like a voice
signal whereas if you're hopping through
several intermediate points just to get
that cellphone or going through Wi-Fi
it's a much closer link and with much
less battery power so you can get much
longer battery life much less strain on
the cellular network and so they're
actually welcoming alternate approaches
to offload their network and so now the
carriers are actually willing to embrace
these new sort of off network approaches
and I think that's where but you know
companies like the do peer-to-peer
meshes or do you know a Wi-Fi based
solutions will actually benefit the
carrier's mmm can use on much inspector
have you worked with carriers Misha yes
I worked with Cheerios in the past mo in
the voice over IP above but for open
garden but for been gallon we we started
discussions with many mobile carriers we
have agreements in place to start test
with some of them and what Sri was
pointing out is a is very relevant is
that today would we arrive to a point
where there is a limit with the spectrum
that is available and the only way to
improve the wireless networks is to
increase the density of of Microsoft or
hotspots and I think is really under
understood that today because what they
are now rolling out there that their 4g
infrastructure but the next step will be
probably to increase the number of
microcells to improve connectivity and
coverage and what we do is open garden
is we fall into that category where we
turn every device into a hotspot or
micro cell and by multiplying the
density of these devices then we improve
the network itself becomes more reliable
can have impact on the less battery
conception has a Sri mentioned mentioned
and obviously provide you with better
connectivity and faster connectivity how
so you launched this product is it in
release or beta right now so the product
is still in beta it was launched during
TechCrunch in New York end of May 2012
and we have a month later a close to
150,000 users now are there any
Geographic concentrations so more than
half of how users are in the US large
cities mainly and the second country now
is India and then countries in Europe
like France UK and then in South America
Brazil any big cities in the US where I
means the New York San Francisco the
usual suspects or they're like weird
pockets or not the usual suspects ok now
I want to get on to 32 you just one
second here open garden is available on
OS 10 so in window so for laptops and on
Android but it's not available yet on
iOS which which strikes me as kind of
the obvious place where we want this
there what when are we going to be able
to get the bypass ATT verizon on our for
cellular for data on an iOS so obviously
we want to go on iOS and we started with
an open platform and Android is perfect
to build the disciplic ation and to
arrive to a point where we have a really
great user experience completely
polished user experience and when we
arrive to that point then we will start
working and figuring out how we can
release the application for your iOS we
have a lot of demands already from users
on iOS and we want to do it when the
timing is right and we believe we still
have to work and improve the product but
I mean it can happen next year yeah but
it's obviously we want to go on iOS yeah
cool all right well let's from the first
world problem of going to a conference
or not being able to get a solid
connection to the real world of people
who need to communicate in order to save
lives or perhaps their entire country I
want to talk about what what you've been
working on since you left troppo so you
sent me this paper about about using
mesh net
working as a way to route around
intentional blockage of communication
that's right talk talk to us more about
that yes having built about 850 cities
across the world at her post networks
using Wi-Fi meshes I've learned a lot
about what makes them work and where
they don't work and and so the there are
certain physical limitations to the
current Wi-Fi based mesh networks which
the reason Wi-Fi is great is that the
cost is so low it's everywhere and
that's one thing that's made it so
successful around the world it's also
available in unlicensed spectrum which
is available in much all every country
around the world so anybody can be free
to operate without any license and the
the challenge of Wi-Fi is that it is it
doesn't actually so users really want to
take this and then spread it all over
the world but they can't because of the
limitations of the physical layer that
the links can only go so far and they
require a lot of power it for a
battery-powered device to actually
communicate over distances greater than
500 feet even 500 feet is a lot for a
Wi-Fi device battery-powered Wi-Fi
device and what I've been looking at is
that you know I see the energy that
people have to build these these meshes
and what they really want is something
where they can just employ a network
anywhere in the world and start
communicating over large distances like
the military like the military does in
fact the military has been doing this
for decades in fat for troops for over
10 kilometers getting you know a voice
and video and and they they operate from
20 megahertz to 2.5 gigahertz or
twenty-five hundred megahertz they have
radios that scale all that that spectrum
and then essentially have complete
freedom of operation these are called
small unit operations situational
awareness radios and and that you can
look it up on the internet and they have
a tremendous flexibility however that's
because they're the military they don't
they can you know pretty much in a time
of need they can operate in any in
anything and so the what they also have
is they have techniques where their
radio techniques that that can if we
applied in the unlicensed bactrim can
actually go ten times as far and ten
times as fast and so compared to Wi-Fi
and in many kids so 10 times the
coverage area of Wi-Fi because of the
sequence spread spectrum in the
frequency hopping in the way that
they've the techniques they developed
however that's not part of the Wi-Fi
standard and they can scale down to very
large long links and so that I think the
taking that kind of military or thinking
and and combining it with the biggest
trend in the world right now and
technology is the smartphone that you
know the smartphone is intimate even
impacting everyone including the
military they're having to adapt to the
smartphone that they're there now
realizing that their radios are you have
to somehow connect with with the
smartphones and because everyone has one
and and so but the limitation of the
smartphone is that it requires a
cellular network is that there in the
many parts of the world don't have
either they don't have a free cellular
network or they don't have a cellular
network at all so many countries there's
three hundreds of million people just
don't have access to cellular networks
it's hard to imagine in this world where
you know we carry yourself we're always
in with text messages and with video and
so on but there are hundreds of million
people in world that don't have access
to that and there's another even there's
over a billion people who don't have
access to basic websites that we all
take for granted the United States so
they can't get information because of
government censorship so in all these
sort of situations i think the a new
kind of radio layer that supports the
social mesh concept which could really
make a tremendous impact in the reach of
these networks and so a lot of the
problems we see right now could be just
solved with the technology and what's
been limiting it so far is that these
technologies that the military use have
been very expensive they've been you
know maybe perhaps several thousand
dollars per per unit and now with the
smartphone in our hand we have so much
processing power in these devices
compared to 10 years ago that we can
actually put we can actually build very
powerful mesh networks from a processing
standpoint and you combine that with
them the Wi-Fi radio concept is actually
20 years old the basic standard is 20
years old there are much better with the
new processing capabilities and with the
the new cost of RF chips coming down so
much for the cost of a for tens of
dollars you can actually build a much
more powerful radio that sits you know
just like this battery pack here you
know if you connect it to your my
phone and you have this very powerful
radio that can connect just like the
military videos and now when we talk
about this first you talk about using
this in instances where governments are
actively trying to deny people access to
the internet too so they so to prevent
another Arab Spring for example by
blocking access to twitter or shutting
down the cell towers or firewalling a
country right and you think that this
technology can route around that yes I
think what these so for example if you
look what's happening in Syria there are
a small number of activists that are
using satellite connections and they
they happen to be the satellite which is
a very costly very low speed and for a
very few number of people and as a
result what's happening is that the
government's are going in and trying to
target the machines that are running on
these satellite connection so they're
very vulnerable because there's so few
of them but when you have a technology
like Wi-Fi at that Wi-Fi scale but much
more powerful the scale there's no way
to stop that many radios out there and
so you know it's just sort of it there's
a security in numbers if you have much
larger proliferation of the devices you
know you can you can overcome any pretty
much no no government will be able to
stop it so you're working on a new
up-to-date radio hardware technology
hardware software networking technology
it's all kind you can't really separate
yes are you guys competing know so I'm
actually what I did is I wrote the paper
so we haven't we're not building it yet
and so it was just paper and i typically
communications magazine so we're looking
at to see how this is gonna I think
there's a technological inevitability I
don't know exactly how it's going to
unfold but the the power of these
smartphones combined with the RF
technology that's been developed the
last ten years at some point is going to
change the way we do networking and go
ahead I think I mean Sri and I are
sharing the same vision and the reason
why we launched open garden is because
the original vision was to take
advantage of the density and the
proliferation of smartphones like Sri
said which is a big difference like 10
years ago from from now is every
smartphone every form is a is a computer
is a router and has
the capability to support mesh
networking that's right and with the
ecosystem of the apps on smartphones
today you just transform your phone into
a mesh device just by installing an app
and when you install open garden on your
smartphone it turns your smartphone into
into a mesh device and has long has you
have another device with open garden
running at close distance or in
proximity then these two devices we
start to interconnect now as I said at
the top of the show I've been fascinated
by this technology for many many years
and and over time I have seen businesses
experiment with shared infrastructure
shared resources the one that springs to
mind his phone fon which was a shared
telephony Network it would replace your
router in your house with one that was
phone enabled and you know you could
share that there's another one one of my
favorite companies from a launch event I
think it was called space monkey where
they're building a storage mesh where
they'll sell you one gigabyte of storage
and a hard drive that you put in your on
your network in your house but it's
actually two gigabyte drive and the
other gig is shared with the mesh with
the other users fascinating idea over
the years I have seen none of these
technologies get critical traction as
there always seemed to be the province
of geeks now Surrey in your case you're
talking about routing around that
particular problem by making it in
literally life or death from people but
me showing in yours how do you break out
of wow that sounds really cool and it
solves but it only solves a problem I
have once in a while and make this a
really broad consumer technology to the
extent that the carrier's sit up and
take and take notice so if you take the
two examples you mentioned the phone and
the space monkey phone one of the things
they have to overcome was the the
hardware basically they tried at the
beginning to work on it with a software
solution but i think the the hardware
was not ready to
for this solution at that time and the
phone still has to deploy a number of
hardware devices to be able to deploy
the network and that actually Martin is
doing a great job and icing now they
reach like four million hotspot over the
globally and I believe that the work
that he is doing and basically Wi-Fi
networks are very good complementary
solution to to the peer-to-peer mesh
application we are we are developing
because when you create a mesh network
you always need aflam to the internet
whether it is through a carrier with a
cell tower whether it is through a Wi-Fi
infrastructure and in her case why we
launched and we think it is timely it's
because of the density of smartphones
today and we are not a hardware solution
and we don't want to be a hardware
player we are a software solution and
when it comes to software and to mobile
apps I mean just you are just two clicks
away from getting your phone or your
device because it can be also a
smartphone a tablet or a laptop to
become part of the mesh network and be
an emission networking device so it's a
very easy process there is no more
barrier of the hardware mm-hmm sorry
sure yes I think as you pointed out and
make sure that the the big change that's
happened in the last five years is the
smartphone and availability smartphones
that people are carrying on there you
know with them all the time and and so
that opens up a new opportunity for
Wi-Fi and within the constraints of
Wi-Fi these Wi-Fi these meshes these
peer-to-peer meshes will actually begin
to become more and more available
throughout the world and and that i
think the the complementary the thing is
that Wi-Fi itself as a standard is very
limited and so and there's nothing we
can do about that it's a great thing
about it is it's the cost is so low it's
everywhere the problem is that the
limitations of the physical layer
prevent it from really communicating at
a long distance and so there it is
technologically possible to build radios
and unlicensed that have 10 times the
coverage area now with new technology
and and so eventually that will make its
way into consumer devices at some point
for example cordless phones
use on licensed spectrum and they have
much longer ranges and that's just an
example of how what's possible you know
but I think you can do much better using
the military approaches that have been
designed for military radios and and
that it remains to be seen how that will
unfold fascinating stuff so if we want
to get mesh networking technology in our
lives right now there are a couple ways
to do it let's talk about that obviously
you can download and run open garden on
your laptop computer or on your Android
smartphone and it sounds like kind of a
no-brainer you were telling me that you
know if you're not if you're just
running in the background it actually
doesn't impact your battery life very
much at all yes did the impact of the
application itself is very low you don't
you don't you don't perceive it on your
phone alright so let's let's give it a
shot and build a cooperative Network I
sounds totally cool to me now when you
were at atropos you were involved in
building these metro scale mesh networks
and power companies are using these
right now correct is that correct so how
is mesh being used right now kind of
behind the scenes that we don't see yes
so for example smart meters are being
deployed across the world in two meter
your residential usage and those have to
go they'll have to communicate back to a
power company and the way that's
happening is over mesh networks so
they're connecting to networks that
where the mesh nodes are powered on the
street lamps or powered on fixed areas
where they have power and they they
communicate relay from hop hop to hop
back two to the power compute the
computers that the server's of the power
of the power company and then the the
new home control automation products I
think zigbee mm-hmm those are actually
little ultra-low power mesh network
that's right that's right and those are
designed for very long battery life to
convey small amounts of information
repeatedly over a long time like 10
years right and so those are in the home
and low-power devices so you wrote this
paper on kind of new technologies and
mesh in as a tool for providing more
people with connectivity and a touchdown
to the global net what's your prognosis
what he thinks can happen first of all
do you think there could be another Arab
Spring given what a potentially
repressive leaders know about technology
today I you know it's it's a great
question and I
can't answer definitively one way or the
other that's a very own people but I
think there's a lot of things pointing
to the answer being it quite quite
possible because the technology is
moving now in a direction where
everybody can get very powerful
communication resources in their hand
and and I think I'm looking for the next
ten years to see how that's going to
make it make it possible where and so
when we wrote the paper in a Sherpa
communications we were just asking the
question can you build a network that
cannot be that's indestructible I
wireless mesh network that everybody can
have access to you know I think a lot of
the problems in the world can be solved
if you can have ustream everywhere in
the world you know without being blocked
so Wi-Fi or cellular networks or
anything a government can take a very
powerful transmitter and just jam the
networks that none of it can operate and
that's that's just the vulnerability of
commercial radios right now is that they
can be shut down similarly the Internet
can be shut down by by limiting by
filtering the packets at any point in
the entry point of network so many
countries like Iran or or other
countries are they can they can control
the communications such that they only
let the things that they want in and out
going in but technologically that that
opportunity seems to be the limit very
limited because if you have the power to
communicate with everyone all the time
and there's that one of the advantages
mesh networks as you can set them up and
there can be thousands of different
links there's no way for a government to
control that many independent wireless
links they can just you know so so it
they may want to control these links but
they may be facing a sort of an
unstoppable technological trend where
there would be thousands of ways
alternate routes in and out of these
countries and and there's no way for
them to stop it it's fascinating stuff
sri sri krishna founding CTO of tropos
tell me tell people where we can find
this paper what should we Google to find
it sure you can google my name and
social mesh social my social mesh yeah
and it's published a night Ripley
