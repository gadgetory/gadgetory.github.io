about all the most interesting news
across movies TV shows and games this
week Google has announced project stream
this is a technical test that Google
says will push the limits of what's
possible when streaming games through
your browser they're kicking off the
experiment by partnering with Ubisoft to
let gamers stream Assassin's Creed
Odyssey without a console the program
kicks off on October 10th of this year
and runs all the way through January of
2019 and if you want to apply there are
some requirements first you got to have
a laptop or desktop PC so that you can
play the game via Chrome browser you
have to be over the age of 17 you got to
live in the United States and lastly you
have to have a connection speed of over
25 megabytes a second if you meet all
those criteria and you do get into the
test great news Sasa's Creed Odyssey
will be provided to you for free
all of those things sound great but is
project stream a big deal and even if it
isn't how could it affect the future of
the video game industry well let's talk
about it it is a big deal because it's
console free that is a huge money saver
for a lot of people on top of that it
could eliminate a lot of cross play
issues particularly you Sony looking at
you you also don't have to download
games no pre installations none of that
stuff you just pick it up start
streaming immediately and play the game
and lastly this opens up mobile gaming
for people who have laptops that aren't
gamer laptops I see you Razer fans but
it opens it up for everybody else to be
able to play triple-a games on the go so
how is it not quite a big deal well
first thing is the average internet
connection of a US citizen is about
eighteen point seven megabytes per
second and for comparison
Netflix is recommendation for one single
4k stream is 25 megabytes per second
just like project stream for now the
highest quality for project stream is
1080p resolution at 60 frames a second
but that could get better over time on
top of that multiplayer is still a
massive question mark a lot of you guys
made it abundantly clear on our backward
compatibility episode that you love
having physical copies of your games and
last
console exclusives are still probably
gonna be a thing exclusives can be major
drivers of console purchases so I doubt
Sony or Microsoft would be interested in
putting blockbusters like spider-man or
the next Halo on another platform so
those are the arguments for or against
project stream I'm really curious about
your thoughts drop those down in the
comments but let's talk about the future
at this point what could project stream
be gunning for in terms of an end game
we've come up with three different ideas
or theories that we think are the
likeliest number one being google has
not yet announced some type of hardware
that would work with project stream that
is as affordable and easy to use as a
chromecast it would work kind of like an
Nvidia shield but instead of streaming
from your PC it would stream directly
from Google servers this would be a
super interesting move on Google's part
and also the most aggressive it would
certainly set up some kind of showdown
between Microsoft Sony and Google and if
you're wondering why I haven't mentioned
Nintendo well I don't think this is of
too much concern to them nor would they
be interested in it since the company
traditionally keeps to itself and the
switch is really its own animal that
brings me to option number two which is
that Google licenses out project stream
to console manufacturers so they don't
have to make any hardware this is an
interesting choice one that is
definitely in everybody plays nice
option if you want to feel good on the
inside and could potentially allow for
somebody like Microsoft for example to
let you log in and link your Xbox Live
account and play any games that you've
purchased via the Chrome browser super
interesting but there's always a third
option and this is the option I think is
the most likely which is Google uses
project stream to launch its own
subscription service this is kind of
like a Netflix meets team for games and
it would partner with developers and
publishers instead of the big three
console makers I am terribly intrigued
by this idea and I would love to see it
happen but it does come with its own set
of challenges
namely companies like Blizzard and EA
already have game launchers and I don't
think they're interested in sharing any
of those profits with a company like
Google
so maybe scratch that part of it however
if Google can
you buy or contract out a game
development team to create some really
amazing platform exclusives we might be
looking at a gaming Netflix and that is
really really exciting so I am super
looking forward to what project stream
has in store oh I am so curious what you
guys think a project stream are you
interested in it what do you think their
goal is drop those thoughts down in the
cold
please thanks so much for watching don't
forget to put those thoughts down in the
comments on project stream I'm going on
vacation for a few weeks we will be back
with brand-new episodes in November
until then you can watch last week's
episode right up here and for more
