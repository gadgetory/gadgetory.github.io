holding in my hand is this a some sort
of old-fashioned atari lynx or next
generation game handheld no it's an iPod
touch docked into the Moga ace power
this is an iOS game controller that's
gonna be available now cost 100 bucks
but it turns your iPhone or iPod touch
with a lightning connector into a little
handheld game system now how does this
magic work well there's actually a whole
set of instructions in iOS 7 that allow
any game if it wants to to connect to a
third party controller like this one
this includes the ability to use all the
controls that you would expect maybe on
a 3ds on a PS Vita or on any sort of
next gen or current gen game console and
be able to boil them down into a little
handheld that also has a battery pack
for recharging it fits the iPhone 5 the
iPhone 5c the iPhone 5s and the 5th
generation iPod Touch now in order to
attach an iPod or iPhones you just slot
it out and potentially use one of three
two different connectors with this now
because this connects of lightning there
are some pastor options that you
wouldn't get with Bluetooth the
headphone port is blocked up here but
you do get headphone pass there at the
bottom of the controller and if you want
to recharge this it accepts microUSB the
charging option of choice for many
people to recharge this entire system
and get that battery pack up to snuff
when not in use the ACE Power compresses
down into a little travel form which
looks like a little controller be kind
of awesome if you could just hold it and
play like this but unfortunately it's
not meant to work like that it only is
meant to connect with your iPhone or
iPod Touch in this mode sorry
this type of controller capability has
been available on Android for a while so
maybe Android users are saying what's
the big deal
Nvidia shield and all those things like
it but there hasn't been anything like
that on iOS and iOS frankly has the
better game library the Moga ace power
really demonstrates that you can now
connect a full game controller onto an
iPod onto an iPhone maybe in the future
to an iPad and do all the things you
thought games should do
a hundred dollars is expensive but if
you think of it as a stocking stuffer
for someone who's game adicted in your
family it's not too high price to pay
compared to consoles
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
Moga ace power available now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
