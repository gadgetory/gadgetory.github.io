to come out with two smart grills weber
and Charbroil we have them right here
and we thought what better way to test
them out than to have a cookout let's
check it out right now I'm using the
$800 Charbroil smart chef tru-infrared
this is a gas grill with three main
burners plus a side burner for sauces
and other hot dishes there are two ports
to attach temperature probes inside is a
warming rack and removable cast iron
grates that are porcelain enameled you
also get pretty good build quality with
a chassis made of steel and a sturdy
metal handle so the Charbroil comes with
an app that connects via Wi-Fi and that
lets you see the food that you're
cooking and the temperatures that your
meat is actually at and from there you
can also see the temperature inside the
grill you can also see whether the
burners are on or off you can also set
up multiple probes and see timers for
food that you're cooking and get alerts
for when your food is done the
char-broil did a pretty good job cooking
the food that we gave it it did very
well with burgers that came out nice and
juicy they didn't have a lot of char on
them which is something that's we prefer
but it definitely had a lot of flavor
and was very good the one thing I don't
like about the char-broil is it creates
a lot of smoke and a lot of grease
things tend to splatter outside of the
hood you have to clean it up often and
you just get a lot of mess that you have
to deal with and that's kind of an and
over here we have the $850 Weber Genesis
- it has three propane gas burners but
no side burner but it feels incredibly
well built the parts are heavy solid
almost industrial there's more space in
situ and the warming rack is adjustable
unlike the Charbroil the Weber has smart
functions - it connects to its own
whoever app keep in mind Weber smart
functions cost extra you have to pay an
additional $100 to get the iGrow 3
accessory as far as cooking goes the
Weber is a bit of a race car and burns
really hot if you want it and it also
goes really low if you need it though
you have to play with it to get it just
right so as far as app control I
definitely like the Weber better because
it's more responsive I get to see
exactly what the temperature is there's
no lag there's no delay the char-broil
has a little bit of a delay when you
open the app to see what temperature
the grille of that so all in all after
you factor in the cooking performance
smart capabilities build quality better
by is the Charbroil
but the Weber is definitely a premium
product that certainly be happy with
just spend a little more money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
