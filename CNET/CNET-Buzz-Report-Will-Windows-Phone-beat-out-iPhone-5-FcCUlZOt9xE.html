buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
Netflix is sorry you feel that way
iphone5 fever is bigger than Bieber and
sweet sweet mangoes in the fall but
first it's the gadget of the week the
gadget of the week is the new macbook
air I cannot tell you how many people
have been I am Emil V week saying when
is the new air coming please let Apple
take my money well it seems like it was
worth the wait the 13-inch model earned
a coveted editor's choice award here at
cnet it has a 1.7 gigahertz current
generation Intel Core i5 processor a 128
gig solid state hard drive and it comes
with OS 10 lion plus of course it's
super thin and gorgeous and if just the
performance and looks weren't enough
Apple is doing its usual upgrade
enticement by restoring the backlit
keyboard that it took out of the
original macbook air just to make you
feel like a sucker yeah it's still kind
of working though because it's so hot
and now the news in its earning report
this week sensitive little netflix says
it just hates to upset its customers
with that jagan dis rate hike and it
understands that this decision will
cause some of you to quit the service
and Netflix is just really sorry
although netflix says most of you won't
quit and the extra money that Netflix
rakes in from the hike will let it reach
the magical goal of 1 billion dollars in
revenue during a single quarter yeah so
yay for Netflix and they're still
totally tone deaf PR department also
you're so welcome guys of course if you
are a former Netflix customer looking to
satisfy your fix for streaming video
other companies are coming out of the
woodwork to help even walmart remember
how walmart bought online video rental
store voodoo about a year and a half ago
well now they're integrating voodoo into
walmart com so you'll be able to buy or
rent digital copies of movies that are
available from voodoo streaming library
although i checked and they don't have
blood freak either
come on Studios in Apple news this week
it's looking more and more likely that
the iphone 5 will hit this September
according to MacRumors Apple will be
bumping up its staff in its US retail
stores early this fall and apples also
bringing back former employees to work
part-time and boy genius report said
AT&amp;amp;T has been getting its employees
ready for more foot traffic in September
even incoming verizon CEO Lowell McAdam
recently said that he expects the next
iPhone to debut in the fall it's really
happening people it's happening I wonder
if it will also be available in white at
the lunch what's wrong with me actually
a new survey from pricegrabber finds
that thirty-five percent of its
customers are willing to buy the iphone
5 sight unseen if it's coming out they
want it affects some of them are even in
line now although they may want to wait
just a minute because windows phone
mango or seven and a half has been
released to manufacturers and microsoft
says it's coming this fall mango
apparently has over 500 new features and
according to some analysts even though
you think you don't care about mango
right now come 2015 it'll be the second
biggest mobile OS in the world start
caring people by the time they get to
Windows Phone kumquat you are going to
be hooked and finally instead of
clogging the tubes a new segment that
I'm calling the balls on China late last
week it was discovered that five fake
apple stores were operating the chinese
city of kunming and now pc magazine
reports that another fake store has been
photographed in chengdu now they look
exactly like Apple stores even down to
the employee lanyards and t-shirt in
fact some employees said they thought
they were working at a real Apple store
ok now this week two of the five kunming
stores have been shut down could get
this it's not because they were fake
it's because they didn't have the right
business licenses Chinese officials say
that the Western media is over playing
the issue I mean after all they say the
apple stuff in the stores that they're
selling is totally real what's the big
deal also Chinese
official said they're investigating
whether Apple has filed the proper
paperwork in China to have it store
design and layout protected by their
loss can you imagine Steve Jobs face I
mean I know it's not right but dude the
balls on China and that's the buzz
report for this week everyone I'm
Hollywood and thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
