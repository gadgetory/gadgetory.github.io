huge hit when it came out for iOS
devices in February 2010 the game
quickly became a favorite for it's cute
but challenging tower defense game play
but today we finally have the
long-awaited sequel plants vs. zombies 2
it's about time the object of the game
is the same as the original plant
different types of offensive and
defensive plants to try to prevent
zombies for making it all the way to the
left side of the screen to grow your
plants you need Sun and some powers
gains you're planting sunflowers that
generate every few seconds but where you
were defending your house from a zombie
attack in the original plants vs zombies
2 gives you additional settings with the
introduction of time travel now you'll
travel back in time to new worlds that
include ancient Egypt and a
pirate-themed level called pirate seas
there are three worlds to unlock in this
first version of the game but popcap
games promises more new worlds to coddle
plants vs zombies 2 is very easy to pick
up and play for just about anyone but it
can also get extremely challenging and
the sequel the developers have added new
features and give you a few extra
options when the big waves of zombies
are on the attack a new plant food
button lets you supercharged one of your
plants to do extra damage when in a
pinch each plant type reacts differently
to plant food so you'll have to
experiment to find the best combinations
there are also new powers you can only
use for a short time by spending your
earned coins the power pinch lets you
pinch to decapitate zombies the power
toss lets you launch a group of zombies
into the air then fling them off the
screen the powers app lets you hold your
finger down on zombies to electrocute
multiple enemies these new powers are
great for difficult levels but you have
to be careful not to spend too much of
your coins plants vs. zombies 2 is a
free game in the app store and popcap
says you can complete the entire game
without spending a penny but about five
percent of the content is hidden behind
in-app purchase as you swipe through the
in-game Almanac you'll notice only a
couple of the locked plants or for
purchase only while most are unlockable
by going to the right location on the
map upgrades like the power moves I
talked about before are mostly
unlockable as well but for an extra
boost of Sun power for example you can
add an additional 25 son at the
out of a level by purchasing the bonus
selection the other upgrades are set up
in the same way so really the stuff
behind the paywall is usually for a
bonus on top of what you already get but
i have to admit there are some plants
that might be worth spending a little
cash on i'm looking at you snow peas
overall plants vs zombies 2 is a
fantastic sequel to an already great
title with new plants new worlds to
explore and new emergency powers will be
easy to get sucked back into this
extremely addictive pit thanks everyone
for watching this first look at plants
vs zombies 2 i'm jason parker for cnet
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
