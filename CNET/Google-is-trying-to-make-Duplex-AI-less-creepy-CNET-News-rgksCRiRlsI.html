assistant actually calling a real salon
to schedule the appointment for you
let's listen depending on what service
she was like what service is she looking
for okay we have a 10 o'clock echo
potato how may I help you
hi I'm the Google assistant calling to
make a reservation for a client this
automated call will be recorded can i
book a table for Tuesday the 12th okay
cool we've always been thinking about
how should the system kind of introduce
itself and the way that we think about
it is really having four key elements
first is starting by saying what the
purpose of the call is because for the
business that's really the important
that you're calling for a reservation or
what are you calling for second is
disclosing that this calls from Google
third that is from an automated system
so not just a human operator at Google
but an automated system and then forth
and states that require it
we will disclose that we're recording
the call great and when did you say they
want to come in today at 7:00 p.m.
hey let me check making those systems
sound and feel more natural you have a
higher success rate of of completing the
call successfully for kind of the
business side and the customer side and
so as we kind of study that look for
ways to make it natural we came upon
this idea that linguists call speech
disfluencies as ohms and ahhs that we
all use out every day in conversation as
linguists have studied this they found
that those words or non words actually
play a crucial role in helping the
conversation to continue and so they
play some really important purposes in
our system to help both sides of the
conversation kind of
though that the other side still
listening or introduced things like
Corrections and clarifications hey
Google look at table for two a telco
gotaro on Tuesday at 7:00 we're testing
we're gonna go kind of slow take it step
at a time so we're starting by testing
with a group of trusted testers a fairly
small group and a set of partner
businesses that we work with really to
get feedback both from those and
end-users and from the businesses and
how they respond to this kind of
technology all right I'll call it a book
under your name and phone number and
I'll update you in the next 15 minutes
is that okay
perfect thanks a lot of the concerns
that we heard about duplex and good
concerns as we announced at i/o but some
of them were kind of around Wow has
Google created a general AI that can
have any conversation and act like a
person and how will keep them know what
it is and I wanted to make clear that
Runa made clear that it's very far from
what we've actually done what we've
actually done is trained very deep
models that know how to do very narrow
tasks holiday hours restaurant
reservations booking a haircut
appointment those are really the three
things that you can do so if you think
duplex is like a human it's a very
interesting human that can only do those
three things I don't have seven but we
can do eight where the system doesn't
know what the right next step is and so
within the calls what you'll hear is the
system will try a couple times usually
to kind of bring it back to what it
understands so you know if you're
talking system and you say well
something it doesn't you know something
crazy oh your Google what's the weather
tomorrow what you'll hear the system do
is say something like oh I'm not sure I
understand but could I get a table for
four on Tuesday right so kind of try to
bring back if that doesn't work the
system is able to signal a human
operator and that human operator can
either come in and just step in on the
call and so what you'll hear is someone
saying sorry it sounds like our
automated system was having trouble
completing the reservation this is this
Dave on the human and
you know can let's continue the
conversation or alternatively they can
the the automation can simply bow out
and say I'm not sure we're getting
through this so let me have someone call
you back and then have the human call
back okay
we'll see Anna Tuesday thank you okay
awesome thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
