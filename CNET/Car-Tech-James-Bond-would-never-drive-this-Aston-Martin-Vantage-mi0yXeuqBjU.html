River Kwai James Bond movies so many
good things that the British have been
involved in so what the hell happened
here let's drive the 2012 Aston Martin
Vantage Roadster and check the
ill-conceived poorly executed overpriced
tech
so what is an Aston Martin Vantage it's
the smallest Aston Martin it's a
handmade car and this one's a roadster
we've got a cloth power top nothing too
tricky not a metal retractable but it
works well gets out of the way and
leaves you with a small but usable trunk
so if the looks of this car are all it's
got going for it let me show you all the
things it doesn't have going for it
starting with that the insult who the
hell puts that in a car like this this
tells me one of two things either Aston
Martin is so stupid they don't know that
that is a horrendous interface or
they're sneering at their customers
saying Oh give him their little screen
like their little iPhone gadget
technology is not a gadget anymore guys
it's central to your product now this
little helper display does all your
media and telephony its glare field very
small and rams an awful lot into a small
place my climate control status outdoor
temperature phone status where the winds
blowing
do I have Dolby pl2 on and my source and
content readouts you can do Bluetooth
calls in this car but that's optional I
mean after all it's only 136 grand let's
not throw in the Bluetooth you won't be
streaming Bluetooth stereo audio because
that's simply not available so go ahead
and put your phone down here in the
phone cradle except it won't fit and
then there's this what is this I have no
idea I scoured the manual
I tried fitting it everywhere it doesn't
really fit anywhere it might just be a
sex toy the last reviewer left here this
is called the trinket holder in other
words is where you put your wedding ring
when you're out at the bar cruising for
Cougars behind here are some strange
little binnacle 'he's there's one behind
me here that has the world's crappiest
toolkit and then there's one over here
that goes to nothing Oh check this out
very nice fancy cigarette lighter holder
except it's not it's the wrong diameter
apparently that's a special custom
holder for a Lambie brand pen which the
last reviewer apparently stole now Aston
does this bizarro thing with
transmission and key they make this
obsessively fancy crystal key they also
have something called the emotion
controller it's right here in the manual
they don't tell you what it is and as
far as I know it's a unicorn you put
this thing in to start the car and hold
it down and then the world's strangest
transmission controller reverse start
trol drive in this weird sort of layout
with the key in the middle once you get
the car up and running you look over to
your instrument panel you look at your
gauges and you get mad look at the fuel
gauge or the temperature gauge they use
white markings on a bright aluminum
bezel you can't read the markings in any
conditions so all I can tell is that I'm
somewhere between full and empty the
speedometer goes to 220 the car goes to
180 you'll be going to maybe a hundred
so why waste all that space on the gauge
making it impossible to tell if I'm
going 55 the best I can tell us I'm in
between 40 and 60 the tachometer goes
counterclockwise does anything else in
the Western world increase going
counterclockwise the final insult in
this vehicle as you prepare to pull away
is that you really don't fit we have the
top down for shooting the video but I'd
still have the top down even in the rain
because that's the only way I fit in
this car this car is for a little man
before we hit the road let's check out
the engine bay where the story does
brighten considerably this is one
beautiful motor it's a real engines made
of real engine parts I'm not seeing tons
of plastic shrouds everywhere 4.7 liter
v8 as you can see 420 horsepower about
346 foot-pounds of torque
gets this 3700 pound car to 60 in about
4.7 seconds while delivering 1421 MPG
bad enough to earn you a $1,300 gas
guzzler tax however the weight of this
car is actually pretty spelt given what
it is part of that's from what you see
in here in the engine but you can pick
up on the aluminum magnesium the bonded
construction some steel panels all kinds
of different construction technologies
put this car together and it's really
quite impressive
from that aspect
so here's our the real trouble of this
car arises when you drive it remember we
have this six-speed dual-clutch
automated manual transmission apparently
dating from the 90s it's a piece of crap
the car falls flat on its face between
every gear I don't care if you're heavy
on the throttle light on the throttle
barely on the throttle middle on the
throttles self shifting on the paddles
regular mode sport mode this thing
drives like a fifteen-year-old learning
to drive a stick it's a disaster
the brutal shame is this car handles
really well and I think it's got a great
engine I have no idea I can't get to the
engine because this crap gearbox is
completely in the way I'm just really
shocked this car was approved for
production and I'm being quite honest
put the car in sport mode here it does
remap the throttle so you get more
aggressive acceleration it supposedly
unleashes more torque I'm not sure what
it does there may be a green that's the
valvetrain and it also opens up some
valving in the exhaust system to give it
a real throat now as you can see this
car rides like a truck and there is no
suspension settings on it it's just the
suspension sporty really hard so here in
was a broken car which for a hundred and
seven thousand dollars is inexcusable
and I know this car is handmade and that
counts for something
but in this day and age it's no longer
quaint to have things that creak and
rattle and weird wind noise back here
that's just not funny anymore it's not
charming
Pallas Christ in Vantage Roadster about
a hundred forty thousand with delivery
of $2,100 and gas guzzler tax of $1,300
then there are some options 750 for
Bluetooth really I'm pretty sure I'm
reading the option sheet right that
navigation thingy is 2700 who priced
this stuff any Youngman now save
yourself five thousand dollars by
getting rid of that soviet-era gearbox
and going with the standard 6-speed
manual the other thing we have is the
$1600 Aston Martin premium sound it
sounds pretty good I can't imagine you
want to step up eighty three hundred
dollars more to the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
system in an open car
