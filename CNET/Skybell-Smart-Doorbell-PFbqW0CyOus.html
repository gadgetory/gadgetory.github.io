talking to Andrew Thomas he's the
co-founder of skybell it's a Wi-Fi
connected doorbell for your home Andrew
can you tell us a little bit about what
you got here yeah so Skyfall is a Wi-Fi
video doorbell so when someone presses
that button you're gonna get a push
notification and you can receive that
push notification whether on your home
Wi-Fi network you're out your office
Wi-Fi network or let's say you're just
on the go maybe you're in the car stuck
in traffic you can get it on your
cellular plan really cool this is gonna
be great for me because I just moved
into a new apartment and there's a
doorbell down below but I can never see
who's actually there so now this is
gonna keep you from having to walk down
a couple flights of stairs and that's
really convenient exactly so it's really
convenient for folks like you that
wanted to see who's there maybe they
don't want to walk down a flight of
stairs yeah it gives it feeling a safety
for some people that just want to know
they want the assurance I want to be
able to see who's on the other end of my
door before I answer it so can you tell
me a little bit about the installation
process and how that works yeah it's
real quick and easy so skybilz gonna
replace your current doorbell and theirs
same two wires that connect your
doorbell right now we'll just connect
two skybell one power is the trailer
connects to the transformer for power
the other one connects to your doorbell
chime that makes the actual dingdong
sound in your house you actually you can
actually turn that off with the silent
mode with skybell from the app if you
don't want to hear your doorbell chime
okay very cool so tell me more about the
app if you have a multi person household
and you want to share the functionality
can you do that absolutely so you can
have any number of sky bells on the same
account or you can have multiple users
for the same sky Bell so if you have a
spouse both of them can get the the
video feed on their respective mobile
devices for the same sky Bell really
cool see you've been in the game for a
while now this is actually the second
version of the sky bill what upgrades
are you working on for the second one we
did some big upgrades for the second
version primarily with the Wi-Fi module
so there's a faster stronger Wi-Fi
performance there's also more memory
which lets us plan a lot of cool
features that are coming we also have a
wide-angle lens which gives us more
viewing angle for your doorstep we also
get higher clarity out of this camera
too
it's things like that some more features
that are coming out that we're really
excited about with version 2 very cool I
like to push talk feature but there's
also a really cool feature that I like
which is the ability to take screenshots
or whoever is at the door yeah it's
great so when you see the video feed in
the app on your smart phone you can see
here and talk to the person at your door
but like you said you can also take a
screenshot it's a simple button and it
captures whatever the camera sees so if
you want to record who's at your door
you just hit that button it seems it
right to your phone and if you want to
talk to them you just hold the button
talk to them and then you release it and
they can talk back to you
very cool again this is Justin you from
CNET checking out the skybell version to
we'll talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
