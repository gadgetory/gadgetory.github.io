all been merging together I don't know
what what date it is what time it is so
what week is this that you're by
yourself week sex is like yes week six
or seven yes like a marsh passed away
yeah 86 are you growing potatoes and
you're living a red actually baking
bread week six I lost another cat funny
story actually when I was on the show
last week apparently peony calls me up
the next day and was like I heard you on
the podcast and it was weird because one
of one of her friends friends who is a
fan of this show okay heard that episode
and realized when I was talking about
peony that I was talking about her Oh
his friends friend that they hadn't met
you know they had met maybe a few days
prior and actually came up to her and
asked her like is your boyfriend this
guy Justin but she didn't and that guy
didn't know that I had previously been
on the podcast so imagine listening to a
podcast that you know you have no
affiliation with so he joy so he said
listening after I left yeah yeah and uh
and all of a sudden this person is
talking about somebody you know that's
weird very crazy so shout out to that
guy have no idea what his name is but
Chuck's friend what's up you have a lot
of like situations like that it happens
to you it doesn't happen to me it
doesn't happen or us you're the guy that
that has these things happen to you
we're like oh come on i was walking down
the street and this guy on a bike he
dropped his keys in front of me and I
picked him up and I gave it to me it
goes are you Justin you from the 44 and
I was like yeah he's like hold on he
goes into his back pocket he's got a
picture of your mom it's like I went to
high school with what
and that happens to you so weird i did i
was playing call of duty about a week
ago with some guys that like friend of a
friend but like gamer friends like
randoms total randoms and they're like
are you r us from poly on and I first of
all I'd never gave them my first name
that's never gave like all they had was
my gamertag which sort of implies for us
but whatever and it was like a weird
moment like that's and I've had a few
like on the street things but like it is
I like it's nice but like is it's
strange it's like a weird thing yeah I
you know I just don't want to get
kidnapped yeah cuz you're really
valuable like the ransom alone would be
at least twenty dollars no I don't think
the reason for kidnapping Jeff would be
to get ransom sex I think you'd just be
like the torture torture me okay I went
right to sex yeah sure sure Justin's
face was like oh god this is how my face
puke yeah just hearing you talk to you
guys talking to people torture torture I
guess that happens there was that movie
the room which I guess is the equivalent
of like torture but it seems like just
the kidnapped someone to torture them
and I have like a monetary end goal
seems very self-centered I think that
distich do that defines liked Rumania
yeah that's scary yeah that's when
you're building a separate place around
your house speaking of which I saw Chloe
on the other day oh you did yeah did you
guys watch that weekend Chloe no no I
didn't see the movie I really want to
see it yeah ok so the consular freeze
well every totally I mean it's a brand
new movie so okay it was really good to
us we talked about how much I like the
original cloverfield and Ryan gave me on
a for it because it's not a good
movie yes it's not a good movie but the
concept was kind of interesting i think
as New Yorkers people didn't like it
because they got from like 96 street
down to whatever prints in like two
seconds underneath what I didn't like
about it is that they didn't leave yet
it really try to leave late hail broke
in the middle of Brooklyn Bridge and
they couldn't leave you I would swim
across the Hudson understand it swim
across the Hudson if Cloverfield monster
was ripping up Chelsea Yemen is so big
what is gonna hit you I guess but it's
not like I'm gonna sit here and wait it
out because I've know right away like
all men air force is gonna come and bomb
the out of
and either get out of here they don't
know it's not like they're broadcasting
on cue 143 the compiler anyway anyway
anyway so 10 Cloverfield Lane good is
pretty interesting yeah so the story i
guess if people haven't watched the
trailer is that it is technically a
sequel to cloverfield right and i want
and if you do but you up have a sport
like if you want here any i won't yeah
baby stick like five minutes at here
yeah i mean i will Jamie that was in the
trailer okay but yet the concepts
interesting cuz its kind of this new
style of storytelling that we've seen in
like fear of the walking dead we're on
the story exists in the same universe
whereas the first movie but it sort of
talks about it different it said a point
of it happens sure exactly yeah um but
it's it's definitely story within a
story because then you have John Goodman
you see this in the trailer on the story
is that a girl wakes up and uh you know
she's told by this guy that she was in a
car crash and she is underneath this uh
this guy's house in sort of a safe house
by doomsday prepper yeah and he says
that something crazy has happened above
ground and that she can't escape this
this hatch this basement and the story
kind of goes from there and she figures
out whether or not this guy John Goodman
is actually creepy and is trying to do
weird things or if something bad
actually happened in social so you
enjoyed it so I really enjoyed yeah it's
been getting great review had had I
totally agree with them it's very
compelling I know people have said it's
like very Hitchcockian in that way I
great super sorry you know psychological
and like a like who do you trust I guess
I I saw ex machina and I got that vibe
from ex machina so I guess sort of in
the similar vein of that yeah yeah
jungermann plays such a good creepy guy
yes I love him to death uh I don't know
that X market ex machina I did but I
knew right come on you knew right away
Oscar Isaac was like bad news but that
was not the mystery of that no but he
was still bad there was certainly a
moment in that movie again spoilers if
you haven't seen ex machina were like he
the main guy doesn't know Tom Hall
Gleason doesn't know if he's a rope like
right right yeah whatever that was fun
writes like a lot of success start
dancing yeah it's the greatest scene in
the movie it's very good it's pretty
good shot in Iceland beautiful but yeah
go watch 10 Cloverfield Lane even if you
didn't like the first one or in fact if
you didn't watch the first one you
still yeah as a man you still watch it
is John Goodman just the coracle monster
in a big suit yeah the wigs out how
great he looks great as a lot of weight
I love diamond I looking forward to in a
few weeks maybe we can come back and
just talk about what you think happens
in the movie okay there's some
interesting stuff he was my thing the
only thing I found fascinating about the
original Cloverfield was all of the
supposed Easter eggs that likely that
that hinted at well exactly was like a
weird japanese company yes i shall show
like that there's uh there's easter eggs
that I over i think in a lot of JJ
abrams stuff there's stuff were like
they're splashes in the water and sad
for the amulet was that that i want to
know show me give me that like you need
some of that without spoiling it again
on those it pop up in this mug you soon
yeah something i don't know how you
would care if you didn't like the first
movie why you would hear about this
because I'm more intrigued about like I
like I just mythology yeah I want to
know the massage okay but you don't like
the characters you didn't like no I
thought that was a very stupid movie but
I want I want to know like what people
have liked to get here yeah but people
didn't like the first movie I think
because of the way it was shot to is
already can play Giles is getting people
kind of nauseous in the theater which
object case here rights justifiable that
movie is almost designed to make you
sick i feel like uh the Muppet take a
like said look to me the most intriguing
stuff is what did what is this way I did
this happen him where has all this
footage connected you found the footage
like that's did they ever explain that
in blair witch they don't did you say
like this was recovered yeah i see
that's why like I don't think Blair
Witch is amazing either but I think the
idea the idea that was very original
when it came out yeah the Cloverfield
was the same thing I think they're sort
of hinting at the fact that man might
have created that monster because they
they showed some toxic sewage and things
like that I don't like when Godzilla was
the new Godzilla right all right that
was terrible yes bad um alright I like
this because it leads really perfectly
into some of the more weird stuff and
that's like the theme of today's show
it's just like weird stuff that we just
don't know what it is we've talked about
stuff like that before like remember
that story we're like the disk
guy found on a park bench I'll be like
popped it in and they had a whole you
know like weird video this cryptic video
and it was a marketing stunt no it
wasn't anything it was just like some
artists it had went up being like an
artist yeah uh it was gone I went on
forever and ever and ever and now Justin
it comes up to me today and he's like
dude it just like we have to talk about
this today and I just looked at I just
glanced at it uh it's called Julie
rubicon yeah and I just I'm gonna hand
it over to you man blow our minds what
is this well this this link got sent
into my inbox on Tuesday and it was a
link to a Facebook post that was just
labeled Julie rubicon and in the
subsequent days after I read it I kind
of figured that this story would blow up
because it's such an interesting tale
and i've been googling it over the past
few days just this week and no one's
really talked about it so i thought that
you know after Jeff invited me on this
morning that I would bring it up because
I want to know what you guys think about
it and whether or not this story is true
um so on tuesday i got this link right
at this facebook post is from a guy
named robin Sloane who'd you get the
link from a friend okay source all right
I got it a couple of the people got it
as well I think Jason Kottke also got it
um this guy robin sloan the author he
tells a really interesting story that
goes deep into how much facebook knows
about the world right think about all
the information and the data they're
pulling in from our personal lives how
much we volunteer it's no surprise that
you know facebook and obviously take the
stuff and offer insights into the world
right commenting on advanced or you know
figuring out stuff that that has
happened analyzing things and maybe even
potentially predicting the future and
that's what this story's done trends
yeah yeah so Robin sloan worked for this
advertising team in menlo park and he
worked specifically within the partner
intelligence group at Facebook codenamed
pig and that offers large advertising
clients the ability to see you know how
much they their brand has impacted the
world and how much people are talking
about sure and so obviously a big
advertising companies will pay a lot of
money to get these insights and you're
basically looking at what Robin
describes as a view of
billion users from like 30,000 feet okay
so using pig you can type in all kinds
of queries for stuff you want to know
about the trends right like you know how
are the adidas yeezy is doing this year
or that's a smoker yeah the sneaker
right from Kanye right at Kanye's
sneaker or anything right you put in
seanad or anything so around april of
last year robin says that he was
entering search terms for a children's
footwear brand into pig right and pig
brought up all kinds of graphs and stuff
for for data spikes and popularity and
when he was looking at it as he was
typing in the information for this
children's footwear brand he
accidentally forgot to enter the end
date for when he wanted to see the graph
oh no right and so that was a mistake
and when the graph got brought up after
that it was left open ended and it
actually showed that the graph ended in
October of 2016 when he scrolled all the
way to the right so obviously that's in
the future so what the hell right and
anyway so it kept going so that the
graph kept going this was in April of
2015 so it showed more than a year into
the future of children in variation not
just a straight graph and the more I can
pretty can sit I'm looking at the fairly
consistent really consistent so their
kids he's like on a chill until of a
June first that you could see that if
you scroll to the right on this graph
June first shows a big big spike June
first of 2015 which was at the time
three months into the future so this
children's footwear brand called vernix
right nothing happens with the brand
then three months later on june first
2015 the exact date vernix announced
that it was being bought out by nike
know so after that happened obviously
the conversation spiked like crazy all
right so let's let's pause for a second
so what that story implies yeah is that
Facebook Pig predicted the acquisition
predicted the acquisition who knows
based on you know stock market
speculation right like how do people
pick
stocks are and how much we should know
it's like it's not it's not like a
little dance well but it's not like a
little spike it's like a 10 X huge white
huge spike right if from this graph it's
a it's a roughly of 4x and spike and
again we're looking at some were I I
guess assuming that this guy but
obviously this all came out after the
fact is there's no way it would publish
it before the fact is why would you
write Facebook close it down immediately
right but again we're like sort of
assuming that this guy didn't just hoax
the hell out of it right okay so there's
more to the story though yeah keep going
this is fun after he realizes this when
June first comes around and they got
bought out by Nike he had a big wall
moment right what to do with this much
power so he decided to enter in other
queries to see if this was this tool is
indeed accurate and he did the same
thing to predict the NBA Finals for last
year that's okay that's a huge potential
potential revenue scoffing right you
know we're talking about back to the
future style predictions and it didn't
predict the winner not all I'm sorry it
did predict the winner but not just that
it actually showed the exact score and
how much the players were or were
succeeding in my search showed that the
war is won then this is where I stop
believing hold on after the Hat stay
with me here after that he decided to
really extend his reach for this tool
and him and a co-worker Julie rubicon
wait is that a real name that is a real
name supposedly uh they decided to start
making money by buying and selling
stocks of companies using these graphs
and search terms as predictors of the
future and he says that they made a
thousand dollars first betting on a
spike for a company called Volkswagen
I've heard of in September of last year
and so they saw a huge spike then and
prior to that had no idea what it well
there's another question so Volkswagen
was the ones that got caught for their
emissions thing really so was there a
dip that's what we're talking about so
they saw a huge spike in September of
last year for Volkswagen but that that's
not an angel by short sell the stock
based on that see the problem with these
graphs that it only
is that there are conversations being
had around it does topics not
necessarily whether it's good or bad
right so so when our claim the stocks
based on this information you gotta say
well is it good or bad the Volkswagen
you have to make ok talk about and
chances are Volkswagen I cut most car
companies are not gonna have that much
of a spike read something really bad
actually Tesla's right right you're
right that's a good point i would think
any sort of massive publicity would be
rooted in something to the function
right career so yeah yeah yeah
absolutely and so they ended up being
right and they netted a thousand dollars
each bank so then shorty Volkswagen
short shorting that's I know about this
now cuz i watch the big short last week
and i know i know the entire stock
market go okay uh so that was a big
success for them but after that it
wasn't a hundred percent they start of
betting on other stuff they actually
lost money as quickly as they made it so
because of that reason that it could be
negative or positive news it's not
absolute and they ended up losing a
little bit of money but the real
compelling part of the story and i don't
want to give it away because i think you
should go and read it yourself i'm not
really doing the story justice by
explaining it here but the long and
short of the end of it without giving
anything away is that they decided to
put their own names into this tool
alright then push they put Robin Sloan
and they put Julie rubicon into the tool
Robbins alone nothing right zero spikes
okay but when they entered in Julie
rubicon it showed a big spike in March
of 2016 when the story breaks when the
story breaks on this on Tuesday uh-uh
March what was it like 13th or something
so this is an great fiction and so the
real thing about this is that
conversation spike spikes according to
this tool when uh championships are
decided right through basketball games
or it could be companies collapse or it
could be when people die right select
big celebrity right when they did Julie
rubicon Julie rubicon wasn't a celebrity
so now so I don't want to ruin the
ending for you but if you want to know
what happened Julie rubicon and what
that tool
did and why he published this on the
exact date that the spike happened about
jewelry con you should go and read it
and um maybe you guys can tweet out the
link to it or put it in the show notes
but it's pretty crazy and I pretty sure
that this story isn't isn't true
obviously this guy Robin Sloane after
doing a little bit of research has
published a few books that are fiction
yeah so it's not hard to assume that
this guy just took a very interesting
topic and wrote a good story about it
yeah and that's how I think you have to
look at it this I think you look at the
tech Julie rubicon as the name of your
face I would pick something a little
more generic than that if you want to be
able like that sounds particularly yeah
I think he's trying to hide it too much
I just think like this is a great work
of fiction it's really good definitely I
wasn't built out into a large story and
maybe even a movie but I wish seen it
fiction was this first one it's also not
completely implausible that a tool maybe
not officially developed by the company
but you know a rogue project by an
engineer something could be rigged up to
do back then it definitely plays on like
the idea of like you know Big Brother II
it's a black mirror yeah yeah exactly
it's like real it's really cool I like
the idea was great yeah I mean that's
kind of what we talked about all the
time with Twitter how it's you know
could be looked at as the collective
unconscious of society or I guess you
know their users and I'm interests to
see what other kind of stuff that maybe
people could pull out of it yeah it was
um that show that was the prequel to
battlestar galactica that wasn't very
good at Caprica it was called and came
out right after battle Battlestar
Galactica came out and they talked about
essentially reviving people's
consciousness is through their social
impede iya impact so someone dies you
could essentially resurrect them in a
robot body in this case using all of the
data they've put online and that's
enough to essentially get you pretty
damn close so I mean all this stuff is
very cool this actually reminds me of I
think reddits what is it no sleep the
subway laboriously where it's written
and you like you're like half thinking
like is this a real story yeah all that
stuff so all of no sleep is definitively
fiction yes you're right but like it's
all a lot of italy's that i've seen has
been written like the my crew count true
accountant crazy stuff to happen these
people i think uh it's totally in the
vein of black mayor
stuff I think that is because I think
we're we're kind of do for like the next
renaissance of not paranoia uh fiction
but like maybe you know it's almost like
the Red Scare stuff like in the one was
McCarthyism if fifties right I feel like
we're we're approaching that next and I
hate to call it a Renaissance because
Renaissance implies like a glory sort of
thing but like I think we're due for
that sort of stuff when it comes to
intercept and I think sure this story
only works because of the projections of
um you know that Facebook has yeah
you're like ninety percent there in
terms of believing it because it's like
this is stuff you've been hearing about
oh of course they're reading all right
so of course I have all this data and it
may use it to make money right
definitely it's all supported by like
those moments those true life aha
moments you have like when you discover
Google history hmm like the first time I
discovered google location history and I
was like I was like looking like where I
flew that day and where I traveled and
like I went back to the day Dylan was
born and we like relive that since I
stem yeah what happened because we went
back and forth to the hospital that day
yeah and I was at work and I came back
and like just watch wherever you go yeah
it is very easy to to create a narrative
around your location and it's very
bizarre I i have i've been like sort of
marinating an idea in my head for a
little while of like seeing my kid when
he's 30 or like when i'm gone right yeah
and he then is it like for whatever
reason all of our our generations
history is released online and like you
just have generations of kids who are
like able to search dad's search history
oh yeah think about like the about stuff
like that but like thats dark but think
about that right like think about you
becoming your chew your children be
coming of age and like for whatever
reason all that's out well they're
really cause there's no there's no rest
like you know especially right now
what's going on with the with the iphone
stuff in the FBI like
there's no reason to believe anything we
ever did on line up until now is safe
wherever care especially if you have a
gmail account right so I think like yeah
that's a crazy future and like it won't
matter cuz we'll all be dead yeah like
when everyone's information will be out
there to be kind of an equalizing rays
which kind of like makes me believe I
kind of lifted this idea from this comic
i read about the cloud bursting and how
like everyone has to wear masks but to
to camouflage their their true identity
yeah but uh but yeah like imagine your
kid when he's in it or whoever whatever
and like says oh man dad was into some
dark stuff but it's also weird because
they're our kids will be the only
they'll look at us and are like internet
history and will be the last generation
that has the weird 10-year gap where
nothing happened at the beginning right
like that's it like we are gonna be like
their generation of whatever 15 sure
15th way so their generation from the
minute they're born to the minute they
die will be recorded online right but we
have this the last like little gap where
that we weird let's call that something
we've seen both sides right right so
we're like we straddle that line in
nexus of whatever it is I feel like
right now is like the middle point too
yeah where it's like the first I'll be
34 in a week alright so that the first
17 years of my life was kind of offline
yeah and now the last 17 ad if you will
is a ai ai d88 now we don't want that ah
but yeah like that's that's freakin
nutty yeah yeah I getting too heady yeah
what do you think I need to delete my
browser it's it's already it's already
there right yeah all like all that stuff
has been done yeah see that's that's the
thing about you know going back to that
FBI Apple story too is I feel like
everyone is open to the idea of a future
like that and they don't see it as
dystopic because it's that whole
argument about what I don't have
anything to hide oh that is the work
that is a bad argument to have yet I
don't remember why though I think it you
know every time I
I think about why I don't want my
private information out there how I
really don't have anything to hide
that's that's just a singular case right
and yes it's a singular case where
you're not a terrorist right right or
it's it's assuming that in the future I
really don't have anything I'd know so
if you can look at it one dimensional
yeah right and say I'm not a terrorist I
have no criminal ambitions our history
right but I've searched some pretty
effed up stuff on the internet yeah I
mean privacy isn't just for stuff that
you would be embarrassed to see leaked
out you know there's there's a reason
why we have doors on bathrooms and stuff
yeah you you you want your dignity as if
locks on your doors there's there's you
know and the last bastion of freedom we
may have is within our own brain and you
know and that's like dark web Russ's
eyes just blew up what it was that
trouble you like did you guys hot box
this room before we still reported a lot
oh you just oh that what you thought
that was just like a skunk loose in here
no I mean you're right like that's the
idea is that it's the last place that
it's like quote safe and then we start
getting into 1984 territory with Ron
crime etcetera etcetera um precogs pre
pre crime well it's effed up recon
that's what this jewelry essentially
free Primus it's it's cool stuff i like
it i think uh it's funny because like a
lot of people just to bring it down to
reality there for a second here and well
don't worry we'll take off again in a
second but i think like the biggest
thing that something like Twitter like
all the adversity twitter has been
facing in the last ten months because of
its inability to really become the mega
blockbuster you know revenue generating
Silicon Valley darling is based around
the fact that like oh well they have so
much data on the world they should be
able to sell that data uh and and and
turn a profit just based on like how
valuable data is right at its core yeah
it's like kind of not what's happened
well and it's also difficult because the
since their user base is not growing
they're not seen as like an updated
resource for like where the world is at
so if the users are elsewhere especially
younger users which is the case you're
not getting what advertisers one which
is water younger users into right now so
not as valuable and they're not gaining
users yeah that's that's the issue
they're running into oh man it's very
it's weird i I just I don't know I how's
that the doctor the other day and I'm
like man is there gonna like doctors
make mistakes yes free make mistakes a
lot and I wonder if there will be a time
where we're just like do you believe
doctors used to be human beings you
believe like we left our lives in the
hands of actual um you know human beings
like imperfect people yeah people who
did not always know the right answer
that or that change their minds yeah we
left it to chance there was a here so
here's a phrase you won't hear in a
hundred years second opinion oh my right
unless unless you don't trust the Apple
OS opinion and you want the windows OS
doctor but it's the best it's the most
up-to-date version we have or you would
have an aggregate opinion f a bunch of
robots right you'd have like a yelp
review of a specific doctor and their
percentage of accuracy based on whatever
it's just right you know i don't know
it's it's really yeah black mirror yep
that's what it is all right should we
should we skip ahead a little bit let's
do you wanna you want to take a shower
you want to take a cold shower to shock
shock the system just a tiny bit i want
to talk about VR oh yeah because that
has nothing to do with our completely
dystopian future so VR is is real in
2016 it's actually hear all the
experiences I've had I'm I'm just kind
of lukewarm about really yeah you
haven't had like a mind-blowing yeah
could this is crazy VR experience may
not be the oculus yeah just first time
that's what I'm saying the first have
you used the vive I haven't used the
vibe I've tried the rift but I was blown
away by it I mean that first experience
Grey's always the same you should use
the vibe we have i'm gonna go i'm gonna
play right after this alright well to
film you to make you look awful I look
like the controller yeah hold okay so
you even use anything I haven't used
that at all
PlayStation the PlayStation VR pricing
and availability information was
released this week and it's going to go
for four hundred dollars right well it's
obviously an add-on you need a ps4 and
then you're also going to need a camera
that is not included in that bundle
right and n controllers I would say to
make things easy for people to
understand it's going to cost you five
hundred dollars which is what they just
announced the bundle which essentially
comes with everything you could possibly
need apart from your ps4 so effectively
the psv our calls $500 right but that
you know assumes you have a ps4 right
but the oculus assumes you have a
computer as does the vibe right which a
gaming computer no less not oh yeah your
old work computer definitely serious
graphics card is required for those two
things so I don't know I just think like
and I want to get your tick because I
know you're not really into any of the
gaming sort of stuff yeah but you
understand the three options right you
understand what's there what what to you
what feels like the most accessible
thing like cardboard I mean yeah that's
probably the most accessible but for me
as a non-gamer there's still a lot of
stuff to get excited about with virtual
reality i was looking at this app uh
forgiveness i was called a public
speaking for cardboard okay and you
could download it for your google
cardboard or whatever google glass and
it basically shows you a room full of
people that resume said you know it's
basically a virtual room that lets you
practice speaking in front of a group
and you can apply audience members
actually try to do things to distract i
go like they would in a normal situation
not maybe not heckle cough but they'll
cough yeah don't get up and walk around
room or go to the bathroom and stuff
like that and that's kind of cool
because it has nothing to do with gaming
although it is kind of a gamey type
environment or is that your people read
up like that's great and i would
actually use that because i don't know
if i told you guys but I'm going to a
wedding uh next next month when we know
about the band party that's right
talking about that but I'm also
officiating my friend oh you are yeah
yeah and so oh yeah obviously that's
terrifying and if I could actually do
this to maybe simulate a thing and then
potentially in the future even we
does like overlay bases on top of that
audience more likely we are going to be
there in the world so you actually have
to glance down here no really I'm like
that super cool yeah I think the biggest
thing is that people don't I think the
other applications the non gaming
applications are what people don't
really understand yet and you came to me
that's the coolest stuff you can't
really wrap your head around it in the
same way that like when the internet
came out I was like why don't I just
call people on the phone yeah like in
this case why don't I just like get a
few friends around and stand in front of
it like a crowd but you can't like I
think it's so early and people are just
really starting to dig into like the
possibilities yeah you can't even a man
t vynn imagine like where thing like I
would never think of that it's a great
idea I mean even something as basic as
uh you know sitting in a movie theater
and having whatever video you play on
your right device show up as like right
super giant or like you have a fear of
flying and you could like being a plane
and do like fear flying adjustment
whatever yeah like this a lot of really
cool applications for that yeah the
thing that's cool about VR is like it's
one thing to think about the sci-fi
stuff but it for me the coolest thing is
like understanding that like VR only
works when it convincingly tricks your
brain yeah and there's like a few
parameters that have to be mia for that
to work sure and i just love the fact
that like that's all vr is is brain
trickery yeah like that's all it is yeah
all it is is like putting a screen on
your face with enough of a peripheral
yeah sort of vision and the latency low
enough that your body believes that your
head moving and the image moving in sync
with that is close enough to how it is
in reality right well for people to
haven't tried out the stuff which one do
you think does the best or do they all
do it really well I think the best
technical demonstration out there is
vibe yeah that's what I've heard is I
think because vibe out of the box does
the spatial stuff we're like oculus is
at its start is only a head tracker I
think move does through spatial stuffs
well it does but it's also based off
what is arguably an inferior technology
right so that's the issue it's like a
functionally you wouldn't
able to run oculus on like a
four-hundred-dollar 300 our PC it
wouldn't be powerful enough and that's
effectively what they're doing with the
ps4 and not only that you have to run on
the ps4 you have to run games at 90
frames a second um and so the end result
is that the graphics you're not going to
get realistic graphics on PlayStation VR
you'll get like ps3 maybe yeah I think
it need to be prepared for the for the
sort of the D rezzing that's gonna
happen and then and there is a way a way
around that like I played a really good
battle zone demo for PlayStation VR that
like used heavily stylized graphics kind
of like Nintendo very colorful very like
you know emblematic of like a stylized
look and so those work great but if
you're looking like to be fooled into
thinking you're in reality I think
you're gonna have to look at oculus
survive for something and even that
stuff for me yeah it's always off I have
issues like again and I don't know if I
don't know if I talked about on this
show or beast casts or whatever the hell
I talked about it but I think like for
me the VR you know sort of like birth
that we're experiencing right now for me
I feel like it's so cool because I know
what's going to be in like 10 years hmm
where it's like when we first got on the
internet it was like oh yeah I get this
could be faster like you didn't
contemplate that yeah like when you
first got online you weren't like all
men 15 years from now when there's like
3d video on the internet and it 1080p
it's gonna be great you didn't you
didn't know but now the starting point
at which vr is that you can easily tell
like oh wait the headsets going to be
way better Elijah yeah the peripherals
are going to be way better right now
there's like this John Malkovich like
portal thing yeah where you can kind of
see like the horizon do you mean like
yeah uh and that that will get better
the viewing angle will get better the
head tickets but and the resolution for
me which is a huge thing oh yeah when
that's like 8k right in your eye it's
gonna be like swim goggles it's gonna be
tiny yeah but I but I'm saying for now
it is like in the future it's basically
gonna be like tiny some got the form
factor of yeah that's a big part of it I
think your be able to wear like
sunglasses in
they'll just project the image on your
right contacts like on your retina or
contact but it needs the sio at least
accurate need to be a seal so you have
the outside well right yeah yeah right
but if it's being projected onto your
retina I bet they could like or contact
lens that they could do it in a way what
you wouldn't see beyond it maybe I just
think that's what's fun to think about
because we have that knowledge like we
know where things could go yeah so
that's why I kind of remain positive and
optimistic about unless it all tanks and
non-voice them which is also a
possibility makes you sad do you guys
think that's more of a possibility with
the the stuff that you actually have to
actively play um you know where you're
walking around in a virtual environment
stuff do you think people actually want
that or I think people want like a
sitting down game I think it's like you
look at it like the app store like
marketplace like people want to mix of
stuff they want applications that are
useful for work they want games they
want entertainment stuff like I think it
will be a mix I don't know that you're
going to see a 10 million selling VR
game certainly not in the first few
years because hey you need a broader
market place and be yeah it's it's it's
a really tough sell it's like hard to
get people to wear something about Owens
something that's so huge and expensive
so I think we'll see but at the very
least I hope if these don't sell well if
they tank whatever I hope some like tiny
company somewhere has just like a
boutique business of just like doing VR
stuff because I feel like that's you
might not build a 10 billion dollar
industry on that but you know as like a
business as a small business I think it
could survive at once people start
building out their houses and placing
furniture around their their their homes
yeah to accommodate these games what's
crazy to me is that even though it kind
of seems like it's it's happened really
fast we're already starting to build out
a separate room in cnet in the office
just for a virtual reality testing which
is basically just gonna have to be an
empty padded room yeah which is nuts
because you know we don't really have
too much space here now so we're kind of
talking inside baseball but you know
which room wouldn't work right and
that's insane I never thought that we
would actually have that in my time here
if it takes off like it's reasonable to
think like when
you're buying a house like well which
house will be the VR right yeah and it
would have to be a safe room too because
a lot of time you see me walking around
blind yeah it's a holodeck assessment
Lisa Howard yeah it's as close as we're
going to get for a long time if it
doesn't take I wonder what will happen
two years from now if vive and/or oculus
doesn't take off because I think
regardless i do think PlayStation VR
will do well because of the installation
base because so many people because they
have 35 million playable wells out there
yeah but well it's relative like look at
the Vita so Vita had PlayStation
branding you think it do really well and
it didn't and essentially Sony's
forgotten about it doesn't support it
anymore for the most part so you know
who knows its heart it's hard to say I
hope that's not the case i think gonna
be great um yeah I mean really this
thing I just one like my parents to try
it out totally yeah I can't what alone I
realize doing is too young but like I
want to melt the brain of a little kids
okay like how amazing would that be to
watch a little kid doing vr over this
thing no one under 12 should do it
that's probably true i think i said no
112 should wear vr cuz i didnt care i'm
still gonna like put it on his face i
played a video game with with my niece
very first time it was amazing ah before
anybody rights in I will not put it on
my kid's face i just want i will next
time i visit i'm gonna sneak it in yeah
i just strapped on don't say shut up or
get it's just like yeah I want my dad to
like total you it and I want him to
freak out because like for the long for
my entire life I've tried to like get my
dad to give the slightest bit of a
about games yeah he's like does it does
not care I feel that doesn't get it he
doesn't care yeah um like I guess with a
lot of things i'm into he just doesn't
get it um but like he's the one who
bought me an Atari when I was two so
like that wasn't kiddies into games no
that's good I you to go where he was
when I was too he was 30 yeah right yeah
so like he he was uh he didn't just buy
it because he thought it was a kid's toy
he definitely bought it for himself you
yea big it was
like a this is like the future of life
baby toys yeah I didn't think like that
so I just have this like you know
difficulty in understanding why where
the divide was like what my dad played
arkanoid when we were growing out and
and just like totally lost interest yes
probably cuz the controller started
getting really difficult and yet part of
it do a bunch of other things at once it
wasn't just moving forward and back you
to strafe but like that was why I grew
up for me it's got you complicated brain
is not so I didn't want to play and it
wasn't fun right you're not the only
friend I have who is completely devoid
of gaming it and look I'll give you the
benefit of doubt you tried you tried ps2
we used to do those ps2 like things with
you which conan now does yeah have you
seen that how it was like it's a video
series where he intentionally toxic
games right clueless gamer yeah we came
up with a lot of good ideas so um so
like I get that but like I have friends
to who were just like yep the second
games went 3d I stopped because my brain
couldn't handle it so I don't know who
knows all right what's up can I talk to
you guys a little bit about virtual
reality audio yeah I wanted a I don't
know do we have time I want to do a
little show and tell oh my god this
product that I haven't had a chance to
write about on seen it yet I have a few
out of briefing for it yeah I have it in
my pocket right now oh I thought you're
just very much as soon as it's right
here and lock it so on hey you're not
watching this no one is it looks like a
mini glasses case yes it looks like a
mini glasses case but these are the here
active listening bluetooth earbuds okay
so we've been seeing a lot of those pop
up lately I think you know there's like
a braggy dash and onkyo has their own
bluetooth earbuds but these are
different because they don't actually
play music and but they look like it
because they go your bow so he opens it
up and there's like all these LEDs that
looks all it looks like a Star Trek
little star trek think those LEDs
indicate batteries but on yet what's
unique about the system is that these
earbuds don't play music they filter
incoming sounds and allow you to
basically equalize your world they
describe it as Bionic ears which i think
is really great marketing and yeah so
that other noise cancelling they are
noise cancelling but that's actually the
least interesting thing that they do and
I want one of you guys to put these in
now because there
app that I can start up and demo it for
you everywhere both of them so you wear
both of them that one is the left one
and you just kind of stick it in and
then twist up to engage the seal so they
look like they're basically in-ear
monitors so that yeah they're kind of
like bit they look like bigger earbuds
but they're completely wireless there's
no wiring I don't number warning that's
fine I'll just throw those tips away
yeah you just got burned those tips okay
also you're gross they connect to each
other via bluetooth and then they
connect to this phone by bluetooth to
right and there's an app that you can
run so he doesn't hear anything so you
can you can hear that you can hear yes
they're not engaged right now right and
engaged they uh they basically have
microphones in each ear bud okay and
there's signal processing that happens
to all the sounds and get filtered in
and so um look I'll show you this app
this is of one of the modes this is um
the noise attenuation rights if you want
to cancel noise you just drag down this
slider here and it should be a lot
quieter it is a lot kinda still hear
them but yeah you could still hear a
little bit but this will reducing the
level down 22 death so just to describe
Justin as an app that's basically like a
slider slider for decibels right for
decimals and just when it you just
brought it down from plus 6 decibels
down to minus 22 now Russ is but here
let me put you back up and the cool
thing about this what I think is the the
most innovative is that there's no
latency so look I'm turning the volume
oops I'm turning the volume up now and
it should have gotten really loud for
you but look at my mouth when I'm
talking no latency right so it's
instance you're saying that dressing
happens right away and that's very
important process mouth is a gig it's
really crazy it's interesting right yeah
I had the same reaction during a demo
and it's similar to what we were talking
about before as the first time using
oculus right it's modifying your world
but you don't see that transaction
happen right and so that's so that's one
of them here I'll bring you down to zero
so we can EQ again now if you really
want to get into the yeah yeah just like
looking around thing cuz if if one of
your earbuds is facing the source of the
noise also your voice sounds like my
voice sounds super crazy right now right
but if wonder your buzz is facing the
source of noise that's what's going to
be pick
up and increasing this side is much
quieter than normal like your normal air
would be really your word directional
yeah and you I mean you're wearing a
form of hearing it right basically yeah
yeah similar technology and uh so this
is sort of gets down into the details of
your live eq in where you can adjust
frequencies are based on the exact uh
hurts ratings so you could go Super Bass
ears yes your base E and then on their
precepts as well so they're larger
vision is that eventually they want you
to they want everybody to be wearing
these all the time right kind of like uh
that movie her right but that I mean
okay and you know since people have
different preferences for what they want
to hear and don't hear um that's where
you're really gonna find the utility
here and so they describe to me this use
case where say you're at a show right
you're watching a live band play and
you're unfortunately positioned right in
front of one of the speakers so it's
really loud but you don't want to wear
earplugs because that'll ruin the audio
experience I guess maybe you can turn
down the bass on you know in the future
you'll be able to adjust the direction
of where the sound is coming in so that
you can virtually stand in the sweet
shop guys and you um so here let me
boost you up a little bit and you could
do things like add bass you can even
produce an echo to so again no latency I
wish we had video because well my
shaking his head and that's racist echo
will yes there's echo on here turn that
off there's flange which you can adjust
which makes my voice probably really
warbly and it kind of sounds like I'm
drunk are you drunk or something yeah
that's bizarre so I mean anybody want
that I mean these are just kind of mess
around right and in the future it'll be
a lot different and then here are the
presets for things like an eight-track
you know they have partnerships with
places or I think they're working on
partnerships places like Carnegie Hall
okay to where they'll eq per seat so if
you're sitting all the way to the right
then make it sound like you're in the
center cool left center etc how how much
of an amplification can you do it's a
only plus accessible that's crazy so he
just turned on a setting that makes it
sound like we're in a jolly big venue
that's Carnegie Hall well that's not
what the actual venue sounds like
awkward but its reflection it's it's
cool it's really cool yeah it's it's
pretty crazy and up one of the stories
that
founder was talking to me about it all
right I can't I need to try this did did
you get gross no they're not you been
all rights away which so this I've never
forgotten so wait Justin explain to me
how this works right yeah like does it
just do these both talk to each other so
those connect to each other by bluetooth
okay and which is you know exactly the
same technology as other bluetooth
earbuds um except I think they do it a
lot better because the sound doesn't cut
out like other ones do yeah and then
there's a Bluetooth connection that
comes here as well um so the yet when I
was getting the demo okay the the
founder Noah Croft craft Croft I'm not
sure uh he was telling me this
interesting store where he was using
them in his office and he boosted the
sound 2 plus 6 decibels right and he
could actually eavesdrop on the people
that were talking and having
conversations outside of his office you
know walking around hanging out as best
buy so that's where the bionic ear
part comes in perhaps you could boost
that well be me all on your at zero
decibels right now ok this is noise
cancelling it's probably got a lot
quietly the underwater act yeah and then
this is probably very loud for you cuz
they just boosted its accessible see so
it's not super loud it's not really
really that but I mean I can do like the
fans going on behind my it's a little
more sense than yeah was crazy i was
listening I was wearing them while I was
raining the other day and I could hear
every drop of rain that was on my
backpack on my hat everything says it's
very very cute yeah I me some of those
wacky effects so here I'll eat this is
another section that I didn't show you
guys get this tune out oh so if you're
standing next to a busy street or your
job way station or bad your shitty
person that they actually have that for
a loud office so on i think that brings
down the frequency of most calming voice
and it's giving me a little bit of white
noise now the other thing mm-hmm yes a
lot of people know listen to music on
their desk to drown out loud coworkers
hopefully in the future you wanted to do
that restaurants okay um as well so
here's the restaurant setting and
that'll take crowd noises and clanking
of
um you know dishes and what you do that
big hall setting yeah okay yeah you want
Carnegie Hall there you go you probably
is that crazy is it it's crazy it seems
like we're all in completely separate
will you and yet can't even talk right
now about the cross it's like 100 all in
different corners this one is
stratosphere and so you probably hear
like a room you know your balls yeah
that's actually exactly how they
described it to me is true maybe you
want to be in a different setting the
mindset yeah see the echo yeah me the
most amazing part is really the the lack
of latency it's just you kind of forget
after a while when you're wearing that
well that's very impressive engineering
feat they couldn't take me off echo oh
my god they couldn't uh they couldn't
have released this with a delay right it
went okay wait that doesn't work yeah
right yeah this is fascinating is there
a little a literal delay and we just
can't hear it I'm not there might be
probably like I'm undetectable what was
that I don't know is that this no no I
don't we just heard a beep compromise at
the podcast um I wonder if uh so how do
these work do you think one talks to the
other because they both can't bind to
the bluetooth yeah yeah so I think
that's how um their version of Bluetooth
that they're using works is that you can
have multiple you can okay yeah it's
very cool just yeah that's great awesome
it's the same thing with we were talking
about before with the virtual reality
headsets is that this is cool for now
but um when you see the application of
how they're gonna use it technology
that's going to be really cool they
partnered with South by Southwest and
coachella as well upcoming to sort of
give concert goers a very unique
experience where I think about in the
future maybe they'll have artists
actually tune uh you know for the crowd
themselves right so like I want my music
to sound exactly like this with these
frequencies boosted a little extra base
here and there and you can really
customize a sound like that or you know
musicians that are playing their own
instruments or think about how maybe you
can use it to listen to music at home
sure over speakers and then you know
boost your EQ that I mean how many times
are you in a situation where you're like
and I just need to I need to be able to
hear something that I just normally you
know it's really now the kid like I need
to know I want to know when he's crying
totally and I know it's not like I was
like oh you could use a monitor but like
sometimes that's not what you want to do
ah it's really neat alright but let's
let's cut to the chase how much are
these so they're 250 especially not that
I always expect more not too bad you
can't listen to music through it so to
keep that in mind you know they're not a
headphone you should I aim to well
that's because it's a lifestyle sort of
thing and so they're not really trying
to UM they're not trying to be a
headphone that can also do these other
thing how hard could it be if I'm
sending do yeah they can it's not that
they don't have the technology I feel
like they could and maybe they're just
not happy with garlic the quality or
whatever like this is just for
real-world stuff all right yeah yeah
exactly yeah but maybe there may be like
the next model it'll also be a bluetooth
you would imagine that's cross their
mind oh that's absolutely right i think
is yeah it's definitely the first thing
yes decision yeah yeah that's where sure
but i'm looking forward to a time in the
future where we can maybe just isolate
certain you know maybe pair this with
another set of headphones and you guys
can have a conversation in a loud bar
right you know or some other venue and
here as if they're whispering in your
yeah that's super cool when did when did
the warmer these guys here they were
here couple weeks ago um yeah so
definitely go and check them out it's
the company is called doppler labs and
the the device itself is called here
h.e.r ichi re a TRS rh e re yeah it's
not confusing at all well well i'll link
to that in the show notes finally before
we say goodbye this i saw this headline
i just wanted to touch on this just for
a second because it's in the same kind
of vain yea high definition vinyl HD
vinyl was announced yesterday he thinks
these guttenberg freaking wants to kill
somebody no actually I feel like he
might he might like it for certain
applications so yesterday yeah this was
announced that HD vinyl was patented by
some country in the in Europe oda it was
Austria yeah rebate digital filed a
patent for HD vinyl and their
justification for it is that you know
you can forego the pro
cessive of you know lacquering and
making a an acetate of a vinyl before
you produce it very complicated process
to produce a vinyl record yeah and uh
this new process they patented uses 3d
based topographical mapping and a laser
to cut the grooves so um a lot of times
why did take this wrong I think this is
an obvious lie because they overshot and
just went full digital yeah that's a
thing they're like why are we trying to
innovate on this performance and and you
let say ironic part 2 i'm sure that's
what steve will bring up if you guys
talked about it is that the majority of
music right now is recorded digital is
really matter if you're doing that right
like in a la only way right yeah it's
kind of going backwards like hooking up
uh the cooking up a turntable to a sonos
system or something yeah it's it's crazy
they they're saying imagine a record
that has thirty percent more capacity
and yeah the percent greater volume
that's legitimate I do think that
they'll be able to fit more on there and
absolutely produce vinyl faster which is
a huge that's a huge speed bump right
now for the industry like record store
day just happen to know a lot of stores
and distributors hate that day because
it pushes the rest of their release
schedule back because they just can't it
just can't push out the amount of
supplies yeah quick enough yeah so if
they can do it faster um that might be
good for the entire industry I'm a
double the fidelity yeah be cool and
it's backwards compatible they're
claiming so you hopefully won't have to
invest in a new turntable if it was so
that's like forward compatible yeah yeah
we'll see about that yeah fork metal
that's weird I don't know they could be
it could be another one of those
gimmicks you know I know that HD is
definitely a term that gets thrown
around especially these days with uh
with claims of higher quality and
especially audio in general you have to
be worried about stuff like this that
makes claims of having you know
percentages are better all yeah fidelity
because a lot of that stuff is just
subjective yeah that's all mark an
announcer was dependent on the rest of
your equipment to yeah so it's it could
potentially sound better but there's
other benefits too that's cool man yeah
I'm loving it well it's been great dude
yeah it's not about a good we did good
work today yeah yeah an episode think we
covered every this is all the weird
stuff a lot of weird stuff and that's

Twitter as well go to Lake Travis okay
ah and don't tell anyone you're Jewish
kidding I'm kidding you can juzer
welcome there it's the only place in
Texas so my perfect i'm not quick before
we say goodbye oh I want to ask you and
maybe our listening audience and perhaps
I should have front-loaded it because
who knows who's still sticking around
listen to the end of the podcast but my
birthday's coming up next oh ok and I
you know some the people who are close
to me what you know I never have
anything to tell anybody what I want
yeah I'm the war I'm the worst person to
have to buy a gift for because i'm so
lame yeah right everyone agrees Jeff to
order la mia very terrible yes what if
you had to buy me something what would
you buy me what should I ask for wish I
get I mean if you're if you don't care
about how it seems amazon gift card is
like the best thing ever it is boring
but that's the problem is like I at
least for me I have the same problem you
do which is to say like I don't know
what I want right now but two weeks from
now I might want like a new whatever
give me monies I want you to give me a
lottery what the problem the problem
with buying gifts for people in
receiving gifts is that we can get all
the stuff that we want so what you
should be asking for his experiences
right like i like it so that score I'd
like when subpoenas birthday was in
December and uh I got her a gift card
for one of the sensory deprivation
chamber I am I don't know if you want to
ask for that but if you got something to
do then that's definitely an option one
thing I always wanted to do that have
you guys thought about that before
he thought about doing it but it seems
like it'd be too crazy torturous right
uh well they say older bordered they say
that you have all kinds of mental remedy
don't drown Jeff I know you're not gonna
drug that's the point is that it's
filled with so much epson's chula to
refloat it was a whole movie about
sensory deprivation yeah it was called I
don't know creepy water diet is based on
silent yeah but that's the thing is when
you have that Silas they say that you
can you'll have all these crazy um you
know epiphanies about your life right
open up memories that you've previously
treated there's a reason i hear ya i
have a lot of stuff lurking on any
surface there's a reason they're a lot
yeah steamer trunk worked very hard to
push those yeah appreciate it you know
but you or the other thing you should
ask for is maybe like a 23andme analysis
that would be awesome so i know i have a
disposition for something awful when I
was you know you'll die in five yeah
great you want to know that on your
birthday oh you don't know what 23 means
no it's that like DNA testing thing they
tell you about your like you know ya
penzi for drugs and thank you like oh
the odds are you gonna be addicted to
heroin yeah what I got apne said peonies
basically said never try heroin because
your body will love it yeah you'll have
a great experience but don't do it cuz
you won't stop I'm pretty sure you can
generalize that with every I don't love
it more than others the problem is
stopping right I think that's her I
guess so uh it's also never starting to
let's not know it's not endorsing not
even once well I don't know I maybe
people can like tweet you ideas for yes
what yeah I like the experiences ideas
they're like music tickets or whatever
fear if you're into that yeah that seems
like a good thing right cuz physical
things like I have everything I yeah
right that's thing you have everything
you want even that stuff is like viable
like it's the one time things like a
piece of art or something works like do
you're not gonna get this ending you and
by yourself yet I want something
irreplaceable yeah okay right is that
