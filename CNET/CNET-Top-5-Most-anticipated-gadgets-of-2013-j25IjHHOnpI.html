five I'm Donnell Bell I just got back
from a fairly underwhelming week at the
Consumer Electronics Show CES I mean I
saw some beautiful TVs that cost more
than my car I played with the helicopter
that you can control with your mind and
I ate with a Bluetooth Fork plenty of
cool stuff but nothing that's really
going on my 2013 shopping list
fortunately there are plenty of products
expected this year that are worth
getting excited about here are my top 5
picks that will keep 2013 interesting
starting off at number 5 Google glass
Google's augmented reality glasses are
expected to hit software developers
early this year and with any luck early
adopters will have something to buy
before the year is done I mean if you
think you're addicted to the Internet
now just wait until Facebook is
literally on your face even if this
thing is a dud it's gonna make for an
interesting year at number four an iPad
Mini with a Retina display it's a pretty
safe bet the Apple will refresh their
iPad Mini in this year by giving it a
higher resolution screen the competition
is 7 inch tablets right now is fierce
and if Apple wants to keep their tablet
lead they really need to make that iPad
Mini something to shout about but maybe
they were too busy thinking about number
three the Apple HDTV now the rumors on
this all-in-one Apple TV have been
tossed around for years now but there
are a number of signs pointing to a 2013
release the TV manufacturer is busy
dialing an Ultra HD and oh le D TVs this
would be the perfect time for Apple to
disrupt the market with their own take
on things whether you actually buy it or
not is another question but more
exciting than that and probably more
affordable is number two the Sony
Playstation 4
now the PlayStation 3 has been with us
since 2006 and even though Sony has
slimmed it down a bit
is still due for a serious overhaul the
rumors are picking this as a quad-core
machine with a 1 gigahertz graphics card
whatever it is if it's going to maintain
Sony's lead with hardcore gaming for the
next 7 years you can bet that Sony's
gonna throw in everything they've got
now before we get to number one let me
prepare you for the most annoying gadget
of 2013 the iPhone 5s or whatever this
year's iPhone is going to be called
historically this is Apple's off year
for the iPhone so just like the 3GS of
the 4s this year's iPhone is probably
going to look just like the iPhone 5 but
with some slightly improved specs in
spite of that it will receive more hype
than last year's Mayan apocalypse so
brace yourself also take some comfort in
the gadget that will probably be at the
top of every family's holiday wish list
for this year at number one the xbox 720
yes folks the game console wars of 2013
will be epic Xbox 360 is currently the
number one selling console worldwide and
the next generation is bound to be a big
deal we're also expecting a new
generation of Kinect to go with it that
can track up to four people as they all
accidentally destroy your living room so
those are the top five technologies I'm
looking forward to in 2013 if you have
one to add to the list or if you take an
issue with how I rank them head over to
top 5 cnn.com and leave me a comment or
flamey directly over on twitter i'm
