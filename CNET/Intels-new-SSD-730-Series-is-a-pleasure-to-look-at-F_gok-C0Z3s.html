latest SSD 730 from Intel this is the
standard 2.5 inch solid state drive or
SSD you can use this in place of a
regular hard drive like this one right
here or even this one and what you do
you get a huge jump in performance
really huge now this new drive here is
made of aluminum casings and is feeling
very solid even though is very light
over here you can see there's a standard
SATA port right here to hook it to a
computer and on top it is a very
attractive man sketch as a logo making
it such a pleasure to look at the new
drive here supporting the ladies sha
sickly feet per second we'd also work
with older revision of SATA and that
means it works in virtually all
application where a regular hard rice
Edu's in 10 say that the new Drive offer
outstanding endurance or program or
raised cycles now with ossd is a fight
liner webcam you can write to them
before they become bad and with this one
here in 10 guarantee you can write up to
70 gigabyte per day on it every day for
five years before it becomes unreliable
now to put that in perspective even I
don't write even one third of that per
day and definitely not every day many
other SSD offer which is about 20 gig
per day and that's already plenty so in
other words chances are something else
in a computer gonna break before the
drive here becomes bad now that's a
great part the not so impressive part is
the power consumption the new Intel
drive here used up to 1.5 what when idle
and up to 5.5 what when in operation and
that is more than actually the regular
laptop hard drive and that means the new
SSD here is not exactly great for your
laptop's battery life now interpret
performance in my testing this one did
quite well right in a middle of the SSD
chart about SSD that is very small
difference when compared to the huge
gain when you move from a hard drive
so we know i like it and fight with the
suggested price of $249 for 240 gigabyte
or four hundred and eighty-nine dollars
for 480 gigabyte hopefully and very
likely the sweet prize is going to be
much lower which has always been the
case of SSD and that's also because on
the market right now there are other SSD
that are faster but also cheaper now for
more on this SSD 730 serie here check
out my phone with vs capcom or just go
and get it if you're not to impress
about the performance well do what I do
get another one and put the two of them
in rate 0 yes you can do that and then
and only then you are allowed to use
this included sticker you see when it
comes to performance money can really do
you some happiness I know because well I
don't know and it has been the first
look as the SSD 730 series from Intel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
