everything google that we can pack
inside of a show boobs released the
latest android developer preview to last
week and we've seen new tweaks to the UI
support for Vulcans api for high
performance graphics and more but ARS
technica was able to dig deeper and
found that you can register an app as a
vr listener or VR helper that will allow
specific apps to run in a virtual
reality mode concrete evidence is still
hard to come by and the hints are still
pretty vague but the information
reported on Google working for their own
Android via our platform a couple months
ago we've also heard rumors Google is
doing their own smartphone based VR
headset like the gear VR as well as a
Google branded standalone headset now
cardboard really was just an entry point
for them and there is no doubt that
Google wants to be a significant player
in this VR space launch are short cuts
were also another part of the Android
and developer preview and website
phandroid was able to create a working
demo of the feature that shows off a
very iOS like feature now in the demo
you can see that swiping down on
something like the weather app shows an
extended weather forecast and tapping on
part of that drop-down will take you to
the specific part of the app I know some
of you are thinking 3d touch well
Google's want your shortcuts allow you
to perform actions quicker with specific
actions related to the app kind of like
this thing we've seen called you guessed
it 3d touch but we knew really this was
eventually coming to other platforms
like Android also some of those more
things in the new android dev preview
include tweaks like folders that still
appear as a circular icon but now show
the first four apps in that folder
there's also quick access to a
calculator in the notifications pull
down an updated camera app is here with
slightly tweaked interface and something
as simple as a new icon on the app
switcher screen but the biggest update
you all care about Unicode 9 support for
emojis and skin tone variations here's
what they all look like they've even
taken some of the generic blob looking
emojis and made them actually look more
like people all right new content is
coming to Google's play music and
podcasts are now available but only in
the US and Canada for now it might
take a couple days to roll out to you
and it seems a little late to the party
since really most people have already
found their podcast app of choice but
it's still a nice addition I'm also a
huge fan of 360 video then one of my
favorite gadgets right now is the pocket
friendly Ricoh theta s 360 camera the
platform is getting a huge push after
google recently announced support for
360 degree live streaming with spatial
audio support and it's coming to youtube
this is just going to be amazing for
experiences like concerts or live events
that really work well with this and it
can't wait to see how this takes off and
finally the LG g5 reviews dropped last
week while I was gone and the general
consensus is that it's still a great
android phone and it's modular design
add some new and fun functionality but
this feature isn't compelling enough to
make it the top phone to get so our own
Cena crew that had no experience with
the LG g5 got to take a crack at trying
out its modular design so check this out
here's a little clip I'm not looking I
can't see anything what could I look
down an hour i canno mais nao ok so wait
what's the point of this first it's like
a puzzle I swear I'm not this
technically stupid I come on work oh
wait was it merely just pulling it
really hard yeah
Oh real people took longer than that cuz
he's freaking Korean it's a Korean phone
that's right you know you can trust
someone who takes over a minute to put a
phone accessory together all right
that's gonna do it for this week you can
email us at Google issues at cnet com or
tweet me at brian Tong thanks so much
watch it will catch you all next time
for some more of that Google Isha's
