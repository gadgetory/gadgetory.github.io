versions there's the 4.2 inch version
and the three point six inch version as
well these are two Wi-Fi only devices we
first saw them at Mobile World Congress
in February but now we're seeing them
another announced here for the u.s. now
the smaller version is already available
in best buy for a hundred fifty dollars
and this larger version the 4.2 inch
will be available on May thirteenth for
about two hundred dollars now they're
the versions are mostly the same this is
the successor to the previous samsung
galaxy player in four inch and five inch
versions there are some differences
especially with this larger more
high-end 4.2 inch version the speaker
grill is on the front so that when
you're listening to audio the sound
doesn't get muffled with the speaker
girl on the back when you put it down
also there are some full games
pre-loaded on here there's a gyroscope
inside so you'll be able to play those
games and also move the phone around
it'll be a much more satisfying
experience than before in addition
there's bluetooth 3.0 on here so if
you've got another bluetooth 3.0 device
you will be able to stream music from
the player to that device otherwise it
operates a lot like a phone without a
phone almost like the android answer to
the ipod it's running the android 2.3
gingerbread operating system you'll
notice that the screen on the larger
version the 4.2 inch version here is
much clearer than the smaller version
the 3.6 that's because the larger
version has a wvga resolution the
smaller version has h vga resolution
pretty noticeable when you pulled them
up side by side it's got a 2 megapixel
camera on the back a VGA front-facing
camera and basically a lot of the
different apps that you would expect in
a smartphone but of course there's no
cellular connection
so it's not a smartphone but you will be
able to connect it to Wi-Fi and to use a
lot of the apps on here so this is your
first look at the samsung galaxy players
in 4.2 and 3.64 see that I'm just
evolving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
