game consoles xbox one and playstation 4
and the whole console space will be
different for them ladies and gentlemen
I'm thrilled to introduce the
PlayStation call we're thrilled to
unveil the ultimate all-in-one home
entertainment system the new xbox and
playstation do much more than just play
games with greater power and realism
that you would expect they also make a
much broader play for the entire
constituency of the living room moving
more into entertainment media even
communications and doing so with
different interfaces than just the
familiar controller xbox on xbox one
instantly recognized me and gets me to
my own personal home screen a new set of
universal gestures to control your
entire TV experience both the xbox one
and the PlayStation pool can log you in
through facial recognition the Xbox does
it through the Kinect camera that comes
included with the system and for the
PlayStation 4 you need the PlayStation
camera that's a sixty-dollar anton but i
think it's well worth it and playstation
4 does not know who i am but if i take
the hat off now I'm me again it does
motion tracking so if you're walking
around a room having a skype call will
follow you it actually tracks your
heartbeat you know if you're having an
exercise game and i can say xbox show
fantasy and now i get my fantasy players
right alongside gaming is a huge
business long ago leaving behind such
stalwarts as theatrical movie
presentational radio broadcasting
certainly my revenue in the u.s. 79
billion dollars in total revenue in 2012
expected to jump to maybe 93 billion
when 2013 is all said and done and
substantially more in 20 14 and 15 the
lion's share of that is console-based
although the pc is still a strong second
and mobile gaming is coming on like mad
as you know but if you just look at
online gaming through consoles that
alone 165 million regular users by 2017
we're dealing with large numbers in
almost every avenue you don't just get
that by doing high-end gaming go to TV
forty-two percent of console owners use
them to watch movies nineteen percent to
watch TV shows show the guy especially
the way the xbox one brings in DVR
ability live TV and pay-tv the usage
curves ought to stay pretty stout so the
xbox and playstation of a very
interesting space and somewhat to
themselves consoles are one of the few
areas or Apple Google and Samsung don't
call the shots and as games and movies
and even television shows begin to share
technologies looks and motifs they
leverage each other and make each other
bigger it becomes one big entertainment
pie and the game consoles are well
positioned to be in the middle of it now
specifically I'd launch at least
Microsoft's Xbox one seems more focused
on TV integration whereas Sony's
PlayStation is keeping a bigger foot
over in the gaming side but also
leveraging hard it's 4k output ability
because somebody wants to sell 4k TVs
Microsoft does not and both these
devices are important plays by Microsoft
and Sony to become kings in second
screen and by that I mean formal second
screen where the content on each screen
is synced tied and relevant to each
other as opposed to informal second
screen that we already do a lot of that
would be more like checking facebook
while you're watching an unrelated TV
show advertisers are in love with the
possibilities of second screen and
Microsoft and Sony would love to come to
them with a pre-built audience that is
already using their ecosystem of mobiles
televisions and consoles in the middle
now a big risk to this grandiose vision
of consoles taking over the
lies in products we already have if
set-top boxes mobiles that talk to tvs
optical discs and pay-tv proved
insurmountable because of their
relatively low cost low commitment costs
and ability to evolve quickly that could
put a real damper on what these
companies think they're going to do in
the living room so here's a four-point
plan for the game consoles to attack the
living room first embrace and support
the content I already subscribe to and
use don't make me reinvent the wheel
secondly support the mobile devices that
I carry not just the ones you make third
go get a new digital covenant with
Hollywood get me the stuff I want at a
great price on demand and do it before
Apple does and forth get out there and
make the interface and the whole device
experience as simple as TV used to be if
game consoles can pull that off in their
living room presentation they will
indeed be an American household
