car chase bad guys
it is the sinister anonymous black
Mercedes sedan but this Mercedes e-class
is packin a clean diesel so I guess it's
the official vehicle of eco-conscious
green thinking Hollywood card shades bad
guys I'm Anna Swan good one
let's hop behind the wheel of this 2014
e250 BlueTEC and check the tech
now in the cabin you've got a nice blend
of materials and some nice seats which
is pretty much what you'd expect from a
car that starts at about 51,000 dollars
but Mercedes is gonna nickel-and-dime
you want some of the options for example
this push button starter $650 option
that's something that comes standard on
a Hyundai Veloster you'll also pay extra
for the ventilation and the seats and a
little bit extra for this driver's seat
which has massage settings and some
active bolsters that are going to kind
of cup your side's when you go into a
corner it's a little weird but I do like
that feature and I don't mind paying a
little bit more for it
now the standard infotainment system in
this car is going to be Mercedes's
command system and haven't changed very
much in the past ten years and that's a
very bad thing because we don't really
like the thinner face a lot and it's
kind of hard sometimes to tell exactly
where things are hidden in this
navigation system for example if you
want to stop a route you don't go into
route you go under destination you want
to change your audio source you pop into
your audio source and then you don't get
a list of sources you have to come down
underneath this sort of drop-down menu
and scroll through all of your audio
sources and admittedly there are a lot
of audio sources we have ipod
connectivity but Mercedes still uses a
30 pin connector and you can't plug
lightning to USB adapter into the
standard USB port so you're gonna have
to buy a 30 pin two lightning adapter
and that's gonna actually give you some
pretty bad sound quality and we don't
really like the fact that Mercedes is
doing that but you also get a pretty
good voice command to this vehicle you
can actually press a button and say the
entire address and one go the problem is
that when you're on the road and you've
got road noise I found the system needs
a lot of correcting you can also get
Mercedes as Mercedes
apps and their embrace telematics system
in this vehicle that's gonna add things
like Facebook integration or Yelp
integrations but we found that it's
really sluggish and really annoying and
you definitely don't want to spend your
money on it now the tech that you won't
want to skip is the safety tech we've
actually got one package a driver
assistance package that's going to add a
lot of this in one fell swoop and in
that you're going to get Mercedes with
Distronic plus system that's their
adaptive cruise control / pre collision
detection system that's going to use a
forward-facing cameras and radar to a
look out of the front of the vehicle and
maintain a safe driving distance
from the vehicle in front of you and if
a pedestrian steps out in front of you
can detect that too and even bring the
vehicle to a stop if you're going at a
slow enough speed or slow you down a
little bit for this you don't completely
plow over the guy
now that Distronic plus system is also
going to tie in Mercedes's
steering assistant system and lane keep
assist systems so that when you activate
the adaptive cruise control those
systems come on automatically it doesn't
just beep at you when you start cruising
out of your lane and into the next one
it'll actually add a little bit of
steering to actively keep you in the
middle of the lane we've also got
another option package that's gonna add
Mercedes's Park Assist system that's
there automatic parallel parking system
that you can activate to allow this
vehicle to steer itself into a parking
spot and that's also going to add a
really cool around view camera system
similar to the one that we've seen on
Infiniti and Nissan vehicles but it adds
a couple of different camera view is a
detailed front view a detailed rear view
and you kind of scroll through those
with the command wheel and it's really
good for just kind of nudging and
squeezing your car into a really tight
spot those cameras are very cool
you're gonna take control of the 7-speed
automatic transmission not with a
console mounted shift lever but with
this steering column outer lever it's a
little bit of a three on the tree here
but instead of one two third gear you've
got the Park reverse neutral and drive
now the e-class is a big sedan with a
lot of room in the engine bay for a big
engine but don't let this giant plastic
cover fool you underneath it is a pretty
small 2.1 litre twin-turbo diesel engine
that's a four-cylinder engine the output
is going to be 195 horsepower which is
pretty impressive if you're comparing it
to a Honda Accord but that torque is
gonna be 369 pound feet of torque coming
out of the thing and that's impressive
no matter how you slice it that's gonna
be made it to a-1 option 7-speed
automatic transmission and that's gonna
get you an estimated 28 miles per gallon
in the city but this is a diesel it's
meant for cruising so the big number
here is the 45 miles per gallon that you
would expect to get on the highway when
you just kind of cruising down the road
that's a really good fuel economy number
for a vehicle of this size now while
we're at the front of the vehicle let's
take a minute to look at the headlamps
we've got equipped a $1500 headlamp
package that's gonna add LED headlamps
that's a full LED array to replace the
standard HID lights now these lights are
going to steer into the turns when you
turn the wheel when you're going down
the road we've also got a $0 option
which is a rarity in this car at the
Sport Package it's gonna add a
sport-tuned suspension and a unique
front end with a unique grille and the
sort of chrome the front wing now I'm on
the road in the 8250 BlueTEC and man it
is nice to be a bad guy this is a
comfortable car now the interesting
thing about the diesel engine is there's
not a lot of power on paper but if that
torque number I said that you really
want to care about having that much
torque on demand really low in the power
band means that you don't really have to
rely on that 7-speed transmission to do
a lot of shifting when you want to roll
on the power you actually do have paddle
shifters if you should decide that you
want to do some shifting of yourself for
some supported driving but if you
actually just fire off a quick downshift
after a couple of seconds of not
shifting it will revert back to its
automatic mode and shift for you again
generally speaking I've been very happy
with the comfort and quietness of this
vehicle and the efficiency that I get
without having to sacrifice having power
on tap
I needed diesel is the way to go for
this kind of vehicle all right now the
2014 each 50 BlueTEC is gonna start at
51,000 for $400 and it's pretty well
equipped at that price you're getting a
lot of car for the money and you're also
getting that forty-five miles per gallon
on the highway which is so awesome now
ours has a lot of safety tech what you
want and a lot of convenience tech that
you want we've also got a lot of app
tech what you don't want skip that and
you can go all in Phoenix Dowell for
sixty six thousand twenty-five dollars
again still a pretty good deal and
you're getting a lot of car and a lot of
efficiency for the price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
