fifty dollar cooking system that's kind
of like having a Top Chef peeking over
your shoulder it's made up of an
induction cooktop a pan and an axe all
of which are connected using bluetooth
here's how it works you select a recipe
in the heston cute app and that path
will walk you step-by-step through
everything you need to do whether it's
chopping shallots or smashing garlic the
app also tells the burner what
temperature is required for each step of
your recipe at the same time the pan is
talking to the burner and letting it
know what its surface temperature is and
if it's getting let's say too hot the
burner will automatically lower its
temperature or vice versa
the education component of the Heston Q
is on point videos are included with
each step of a recipe so you can see
exactly what you're supposed to be doing
and the recipes themselves which include
a lot of proteins and sauces are really
delicious and there are plenty of dishes
from which to choose whether it's sauces
or salmon or even pancakes you don't
need the apps recipes to cook you can
control the cooktop manually or set your
own temperature but the Heston hue is
not as impressive without its app or
creative recipes and like I've seen with
other cooking systems there's no easy
way to adapt recipes you're stuck with
the ingredients in steps
the Heston cube gives you fortunately
the recipes are tried were very good but
it would be nice to build my own recipes
or replace ingredients while still
receiving some guidance from the
the Hessen cute gives us a peek at the
promise of smart cooking but even though
the Bluetooth connectivity and automatic
temperature control is impressive six
hundred and fifty dollars is asking a
lot for one pan and one burner this
product will find its home surely on the
quartz countertops of folks who want to
cook fancy but don't know how</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
