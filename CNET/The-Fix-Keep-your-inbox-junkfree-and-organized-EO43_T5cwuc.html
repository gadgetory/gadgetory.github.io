newsletters and shopping sites you
probably have dozens of emails coming in
daily once and if we're all here are a
few tips to help you organize your inbox
and keep it clean first unsubscribe from
any unnecessary marketing emails my
favorite way to do this is to head to
your inbox and search for unsubscribe
then open up one of those marketing
emails or newsletters scroll all the way
to the bottom where it's probably hidden
hit unsubscribe and then it'll take you
to the website to complete the process
as an alternative you can use a service
like unrolled dot mean it's designed to
automatically gather all of the
newsletters and emails you're signed up
for and help you unsubscribe from them
in one fell swoop so it does all the
heavy lifting for you so we'll have to
unroll dot me login with your email
select the mailers you don't want to
receive anymore and you're free from any
future junk
once you're clear of all the junk the
next step is to organize your inbox one
of the best ways to do this is by using
filters with them you can make any
emails from a specific sender
automatically labeled sent to a folder
archived or even forwarded to another
account I'm using Gmail but this feature
is available for most email services to
get started I'm going to make all the
emails from my friends sent to a friend
label so I'll select a few emails then
I'll go up to the more tab and select
filter messages like this then in this
screen I click create filter with this
search and here I decide what I want to
do in this case I want to apply a label
so I'll check that box hit new label
call it friends create and now anytime I
get emails from those people they'll
automatically be labeled as friends
another way I keep my inbox really clean
is by using shortcuts
it helps me sort through new emails
really quickly and helps me reach inbox
zero at the end of each day which means
my inbox is empty here are some of my
favorites you can use J&amp;amp;K to scroll
through your emails if you want to
select an email click X then from there
you can hit e to archive the email l to
apply a label or hit pound it to delete
it so those are just a few tips to help
you keep your inbox really clean and
organized and so that you can focus on
the emails that are really most
important if you have any questions or
tips of your own hit me up on Twitter
