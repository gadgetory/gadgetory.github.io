we get romantic with Google I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your scene at update
if your smart phone is stolen that's a
big bummer but if there was a way to
self-destruct your phone so the thief
couldn't use it then there would be less
incentive to steal phones right well
that's the idea behind a new smartphone
Killswitch bill that US senators are
proposing some of the government want to
require smartphones to have software
with a kill switch that would render a
phone as useless as a brick if it was
stolen now nearly one in three thefts in
the u.s. involves a stolen cell phone
and in big cities like New York the
rates are much higher so stopping this
sounds like a great idea right well the
wireless industry lobbying group and
wireless carriers are fighting against
the bill saying that a kill switch is a
bad idea that could be abused by a
hacker who might hijack and wipe all of
our phones for ransom and they have a
point but then again the wireless
industry would make less money if there
were less thefts and maybe we wouldn't
care to buy insurance hmm expect this
battle to heat up in the near future
because California is also trying to
push a state law requiring kill switches
and with the arrival of Valentine's Day
comes a bunch of new ways to use tech to
be lovey-dovey and Google's social
network Google+ just added a feature
that will add animated hearts to any
photo of kissing or hugging upload the
photo from your desktop and Google will
add the hearts automatically it even
works with bear hugs the app love
matically launched to help spread the
love on instagram by automatically
liking all of your friends photos for
you but soon after launching Instagram
broke our hearts and block the app so
we're now still burdened with having to
scroll and tap to like everything
manually and if you want to get in the
mood the chromecast hdmi TV streaming
stick has a new feature a virtual
fireplace when streaming google play
music to the TV using the chromecast a
cozy crackling fireplace can display on
the television it's like you log 2 point
0 to turn it on go to the gear icon in
the upper right corner of
play music select labs and enable the
chromecast fireplace visualizer and
here's a high-tech pillow that just may
save your relationship if you're sharing
a bed with a snorer the one hundred and
fifty dollars snore activated nudging
pillow can detect sonic vibrations from
snoring and it'll inflate three inches
to encourage the snore to shift
positions that's your tech news update
