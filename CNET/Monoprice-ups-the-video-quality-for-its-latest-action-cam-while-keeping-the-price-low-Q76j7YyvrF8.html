for itself by selling high-quality
affordable electronics and accessories
and that includes action cams like this
the MHD too I'm Josh Goldman with cnet
and the MHD too is a basic mountable
camera that can capture video at up to
1080p at 30 frames per second by simply
sliding this big switch on top or you
can snap 5 megapixel stills with this
button here and it even vibrates a
little to let you know it's on and
recording the camera is waterproof down
to about 30 feet as long as you have the
cap on back firmly in place the cap
covers all of the ports the micro SD
card slot and a switch that lets you
drop down the resolution to record in
720p at 60 frames per second there are a
couple other shooting options but that
just about covers all the features in
the box you get a pole mount with a
quick-release clip for it and mana price
sells several other mounts to use with
it and it has a standard tripod mount
too again it's a pretty basic camera so
you won't find a screen or built-in
Wireless and there's also no loop record
option so it's not a great choice for a
dash cam and while video quality is good
considering its sub 100 dollar price any
sort of vibration gets you some pretty
jello II results and audio sounds
muffled you can read the full review on
cnet com but basically if simplicity in
a low price matter most to you this is a
good no frills waterproof point shoot
video camera I'm Josh Coleman and that's
a quick look at mono prices mhd to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
