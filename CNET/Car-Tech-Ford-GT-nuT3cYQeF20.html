by 4 GTS especially when the whole
family comes home for a little
homecoming over there there's a red
generation one over there's a white gen
to the relaunch car and behind me
there's number three this is the new new
Ford GT quite a looker get a look at it
from the back alone it's got drama to it
wider lower more menacing perhaps and
less of a retro throwback now let's talk
about some of the guts believe it or not
this is running an EcoBoost engine which
you normally think of as being sort of
on the economical side although it's
been a huge hit in trucks and this one's
been cranked up to put out 600
horsepower this isn't the EcoBoost you
find in a fiesta the suspension is also
racecar stuff we've got a fully active
suspension like you'll find in a McLaren
for example and it's pushrod based as
opposed to sitting on gravity driven
Springs now structurally this car is
aluminum subframes out front and rear
and in the middle is a carbon fiber tub
you're starting to see a recurring theme
here of literal racecar or current
supercar technology towards done a lot
of catching up here inside it's not
exactly Spartan the GT has going to have
the full sync 3.0 LCD deal inside and
you're gonna find this as a car it's got
a pretty good creature comforts as that
is now the price of admission to cars
that are gonna be costing this much we
don't know what that price is but it's
gonna be up there with this kind of
technology production and arrival in
2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
