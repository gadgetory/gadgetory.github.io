makes the one in Silicon Valley
different why do we need one here I
don't like to do things the same as
everyone else Comic Cons are all over in
different cities around around the
country and don't do the same thing so
we'll have the popular culture side of
comic-con but will mix in a lot of the
science and technology that's local here
in Silicon Valley last year we didn't
expect so much interest and we had so
many people attend that we had we had
lines and we had blockages and we ran
out of food and all this so now we've
got two more buildings we're going to
have a space village with NASA making a
lot of great presentations and they're
going to have have panels as well
talking about quantum physics and all
we're going to have virtual reality
oculus and sony are going to show off
their hardware for that and we're going
to have a science fair as part of this
in the park and we're just we're just
going to make it a very neat for the
people that are interested in in
technology science engineering
mathematics it's all going to be there
along with the comic-con stuff which is
very popular wow look at this I can buy
some artifacts I can buy some some some
stuff to take with me so the theme of
this year's Expo is the future of
humanity where we would be in 2075 so
where do you think we're actually going
to be at that time the future is going
to be filled with who knows what maybe
every cars electric maybe it is offline
like like the Jetsons we're probably
going to have a lot of virtual reality
and augmented reality that just keys us
into a lot of artifacts of the world and
makes us more powerful as people this is
just the nature this is how technology
always goes trying to make people into
the superheroes that are in the comics
you know I get asked this a lot do you
have a favorite superhero and I'm very
afraid to answer you know DC vs marvel
why would you pick a favorite when every
single one of those comets wow this is a
great episode what they did usually for
some good at the end and and and you
know so I'll go I'm just go back and say
maybe Superman you know early early you
know yeah there's not like you wouldn't
pick like invisibility over flying or
you don't have a preference when it
comes to back oh I know which super
power is the best Stanley said it on our
stage last year look if they should
shoot a bullet at you and mrs. because
of luck if you're playing blackjack be
good if you could see through the cards
but if you're lucky you don't even have
to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
