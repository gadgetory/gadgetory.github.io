time you have somewhere to go
Google Maps shows you all your options
for getting from point A to point B
without leaving the app this now
includes hailing an uber before you
begin make sure you're running the
latest version of Google Maps and that
you're logged in to your uber account on
your phone then open the app and type in
your destination and map out your route
as you would normally now take a look at
the options above scroll left until you
see the stick figure with the briefcase
hailing a car and click on it you'll
have the option of ordering it and where
oralift but for now uber is the only one
that lets you complete the transaction
without leaving the Maps app so we'll
stick to this the interface is not
exactly what you're used to seeing in
the uber app but you still have the same
basic options for comparing prices and
wait times for the different rides once
you've selected your ride hit request
and select your payment method it
defaults to the card on file for your
uber account but you can easily add a
different one or use Android pay if
you've already linked your Google
account to your uber account you should
see the tiny car icon making its way to
you as soon as you hit the Bukit button
no over app necessary once you're in the
car the actual ride is exactly the same
so how long have you been driving over
the only thing I wasn't able to do in
Google Maps was rate my driver at the
end of the ride to do this you'll have
to go into the uber app unless they roll
out another update they're also offering
a $50 credit for new users on the Google
Maps app for both iOS and Android but
that may not last too much longer
and for more Google Maps tips and tricks
