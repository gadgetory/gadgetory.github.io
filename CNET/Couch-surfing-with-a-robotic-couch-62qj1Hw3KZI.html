cold drink or beer is just far too
difficult than I have the solution for
you it's called a robo couch designed by
students from the University of New
South Wales in Australia let's go see if
this is the future of couch surfing it
might look like a regular couch but
there's 100 kilograms steel chassis
holds plenty of tech student engineer
will Andrews lifted the lid to show us
what's couched inside so underneath the
couch we have four independently driven
mekkin them wheels so each wheel has
these 45-degree rubber rollers on it and
by having four of these wheels
independently driven we can make the
couch move in any direction forwards
backwards left and right turn on the
spot or any combination of those inside
the armrest we have a raspberry pi
single board computer and a little
wireless router so then we can plug in a
game controller or a laptop and then
talk to the Raspberry Pi and the
raspberry pi will talk to the motor
controller and make the couch drive
where does a program coach fit in our
future so we're going to build on top of
its autonomous systems on top so we've
got the base platform done there and so
we can I use open source software from
things like Ross now we can add things
you can go and maybe you can text it
might pick you up in the future it will
know where it is and so hopefully that
will make it more useful and maybe some
of them might think it's cool and apply
it mostly may be here and one cool
things what's the coolest thing you've
done with this so far so we took up for
a road trip and we took it down to
McDonald's drive-thru so we've got a
couple of soft serves and a big mac
turns out you can't drive and hold a
soft serve but yeah it's been an
adventure while we're not going to see
this in our lounge rooms anytime soon
the team is thought about making a robot
fridge now that's really built for the
couch potato</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
