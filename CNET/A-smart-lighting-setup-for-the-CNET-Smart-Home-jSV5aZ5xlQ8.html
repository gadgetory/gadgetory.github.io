a Smart Hub now let there be lights
installing smart lights is a common
starting point for the connected home
and there are a lot of ways to do it you
can automate a lamp using an app enabled
smart plug or install hardwired smart
switches right into your walls or just
swap your light bulbs out for smart
bulbs with wireless radios built-in but
in a big house like this one with all
sorts of bulbs and switches and dimmers
already in place things can get
complicated fast if you want to come up
with a whole home smart lighting
solution and we do you're going to need
to have a plan and the best way to come
up with one is to figure out what you
want your smart lights to do here in the
scene that smart home we want smart
lights that can do a lot voice and
motion activated lighting changes
tie-ins with smart security you name it
for that we need a system that can do a
lot and that's why we're going with
Phillips you to start things off aside
from the color-changing novelty factor
Philip tu is a well developed lighting
platform that plays very well with the
third-party products and services we
want to test out including the smart
thing stuff that we've already got
installed here in the smart home at 60
bucks each the color changing hue bulbs
are expensive sure but with the hue
bridge we can also control cheaper bulbs
like these fifteen dollar Cree connected
LEDs will save some cash and use those
here in the family room but what about a
light like this living room chandelier
it's a hard wired fixture so we can't
use a smart plug and with multiple flame
shaped light bulbs we can't just screw
in a Cree or Philips bulb even for a
light like this we're going to have to
go straight to the switch our target is
right here this set of four switches in
a single plate one controls the
chandelier another controls a pair of
lights in the window number three is our
front porch light and the last switch
turns on a fixture in front yard it
would be great to automate all of those
and to do it we're going to replace each
switch with something smarter that's
smarter option the Wemo light switch
with Wi-Fi built right in it's a good
fit with the rest of our setup and our
automations will still work even when
the lights are switched off wiring for
switches in together at once is a lot
trickier than wiring just one but it's
doable and with some help from our lead
technical editor Steve Conaway we
managed to squeeze everything in and get
it up and running for info on how we did
it make sure to check out our full post
at CNET
our last lighting goal is to control
everything you
spoken commands it's a growing facet of
the smart home on which were
particularly bullish and there are a lot
of big names that can currently get the
job done including Siri and Cortana for
our purposes right now though we're
going to start with something else Alexa
turn on the kitchen lights okay that's
right we're going with the Amazon echo
smart speaker and with Alexa the cloud
connected artificial intelligence housed
inside that said we've got big plans for
voice control here in the scene that
smart home so don't be surprised if you
start bringing in other platforms to
test alongside Alexa check back for
updates along those lines in the coming
weeks we'll tell you all about it for
now thanks for watching we'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
