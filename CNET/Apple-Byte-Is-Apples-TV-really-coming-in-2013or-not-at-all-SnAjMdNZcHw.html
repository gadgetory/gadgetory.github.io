can't find it what ryan you really think
I look like Jim nope no Charlie no I
idiot I was just a mistake
what's happened in brian Tong here and
welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of apple
and with thanksgiving holiday happening
in the US I just wanted to tell you that
I'm thankful for all of you the Apple
biters that means so much all right
let's get to the show in if it happens
we've been telling you 2013 will be the
year for the Apple TV but when can we
expect it well my favorite analyst who
loves to make up things gene munster is
back at it now saying the apple TV is
coming out in november of 2013 this is
the same guy that was saying it would
come out in december two thousand twelve
for sure see i wish i could get paid to
make up they can use to now the Apple TV
will only be a unique offering if they
are able to lock down the content deals
for their goal of an a la carte TV
subscription service over the Internet
that's what Apple needs to do to have
their next big product now if it doesn't
happen you're just looking at an apple
design TV with a mediocre Siri feature
and the functionality of a current Apple
TV at Apple's pricing is that what you
guys really want what we know Apple is
talking with content and cable companies
but they want piles of money to make it
happen and it's not happening right now
so my best guess is that we'll see an
apple TV in 2013 if they can lock down
more than just a few but not all content
deals to make a compelling we know ABC
disney is obviously in but it really has
to be more than that and if you guys are
holding off right now i'm buying a TV
hoping for something from Apple don't
all right so you guys can't get an Apple
TV TV but if you really love your kids
or nieces or nephews I know some of you
do you might want to pay attention to
this Nielsen study where I OS devices
were four of the top five gadgets wanted
by kids 6 to 12 years old with the
full-size iPad ranked number one kids 13
and up picked the iPad as their top gift
followed by a computer and the tablet
other than an iPad was third now if they
surveyed what I want for
Christmas they would know it's a diff
and dot's frozen top maker you know you
want one now Black Friday is going to be
huge an apple will have their own deals
this year they teased them once again
this week but don't look for anything
major and discounts off apple products
somewhere around ten to fifteen percent
last year saw discounts from forty to
sixty dollars off iPads and discounts
around a hundred dollars off laptop so
look for more of the same also if you're
still wondering where are the new iMacs
multiple reports say there are no delays
and the 21.5 inch imacs are shipping the
Apple distribution hubs right now
they'll be available online and in apple
retail stores before november ends with
27 inch still on track for december and
hopefully it's not the end of december
it's expected the new iMacs will also be
in short supply initially and Tim Cook
warned analysts about it in Apple's last
earnings call now very early builds of
OS 10.9 have been detected on multiple
websites and according to 9to5 mac these
early builds currently integrate apple's
siri mountain lion currently supports
the dictation feature but nothing
resembling Siri they also say Apple maps
will be integrated into OS 10.9 and this
map kit framework would potentially
allow developers to embed map
functionality into their apps for the
Mac like they do in iOS apps and since
we're talking about maps on iOS we told
you about Nokia's new offering last week
for their free here maps it's available
now to download and you can check it out
but its current rating is that a lonely
two and a half stars and it requires you
to create an account to add favorite
destinations now Facebook is also slowly
rolling out their photo sync feature for
iOS users that Android users have
enjoyed it now allows you to upload
automatically all the pictures that
you've taken on your iPhone to a private
photo album on facebook with two gigs of
complementary storage and yes those
pictures are private by default it's not
officially available to everyone just
yet but keep your eyes open alright guys
