streamers got a 4k TV but you're
wondering what 4k box will be the best
don't worry
I asked scene that's a TV Authority
David Katz Meyer for his opinion so
let's get to it at number five the
chromecast ultra the chromecast Ultra is
a quick and dirty solution for 4k and
high dynamic range video streaming on
your TV
however the chromecast suffers the same
drawbacks as any other protests it's
virtually useless without a smartphone
also there's no remote control or
built-in apps in a chromecast ultra for
video streaming and number four the
Xiaomi me box for around the same price
as the chromecast ultra you can get this
box
it supports HDR and 4k as well plus you
get a box that's powered by Android TV
that means apps on the box then there's
a remote that lets you do voice searches
does that mean this box is amazing no
but it's better than that number five
guy and number three the Amazon fire TV
box
the current generation Amazon fire TV
box does support 4k however there is no
support for HDR so you might want to
wait for the next version of it that
being said the fire TV box is speedy and
has Alexa for searching and general
information if you live in Amazon's
universe it's a safe bet to get a fire
TV box eventually at number two is the
Nvidia shield the latest Nvidia shield
is really snappy and it supports both 4k
and HDR the shield also has official
access to Amazon video unlike the
chromecast ultra and the me box although
I've read you could siloed Amazon onto
the me box anyway the shield will also
gain Google assistant capabilities in
the near future the biggest downside of
the shield its large $200 price tag
before we get to number one here's an
aside if you've got a 4k TV you might
not even need a streaming box at all
check your TV to see if it has its own
apps additionally if you've got a game
console like the ps4 pro that can act as
your 4k streamer and the number one 4k
media streamer is the Roku premiere plus
this list could have included multiple
Roku devices but this world
is the one we want to spotlight it costs
about $100 with support for 4k and HDR
since the Roku it has access to tons of
apps one of the few downsides is the
premiere plus does not have the ability
to handle a voice search that feature is
on Roku's top-of-the-line model the
ultra big things to the big cats for his
help also congrats the big cats on his
new nickname because I've never called
him that before I'm I as actor I'll see
you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
