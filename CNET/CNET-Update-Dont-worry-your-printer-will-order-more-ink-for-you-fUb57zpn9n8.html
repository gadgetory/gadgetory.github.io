more ink I'm Jeff Bakalar filling in for
Bridget Carey who's on assignment this
is your cnet update the first devices
with Amazon's dash replenishment service
have arrived these are smart devices
like a printer or Purell dispenser that
can automatically order more ink or
Purell juice when they're close to
running out amazon plans to sell more
smart replenishment devices soon like a
Brita water filter that will order more
filters and a smart door lock that
orders more batteries now which product
do you wish had auto replenishment be
sure to sound off on twitter in the
comments let me know for me I love my hi
choose box to order me more hi choose
that would be great skype has rolled out
a real-time translation service that
works over it's super popular video chat
feature now skype calls involving
parties who speak different languages
can have a much easier time
communicating it's actually quite
brilliant I mean think of all the
applications talking to your Airbnb
hosts from a different country or an
international business meeting skype
says the service has seen a four hundred
percent increase in calls since the
service first launched verizon is
getting ready to test freebie it's
sponsored data program that lets
advertising companies pay for some of
your data bill there's obviously a catch
though that free data can be gated by an
ed or an app or something that sits
between you and the Internet don't worry
he gets slimy ur net neutrality
advocates say this model could allow for
large companies to overshadow smaller
rivals that can't afford to take part in
the program so I bet you thought that
slick password you created last year was
pretty tough to guess huh well turns out
last year was filled with some truly
idiotic passwords security company
splash data has released some foreheads
slapping statistics showcasing just how
much we did not learn year-over-year
just like 2015's lists the most commonly
used passwords are still 123456 and
literally the word password what is
wrong with you
people but wait it gets much worse
lingering at the bottom of the top 25
passwords lists are a bunch of star wars
references like the words star wars and
solo and princess there's no hope here
so just just do what I do think of two
words that have nothing to do with each
other like tuna fish and pinball combine
them and change a few letters to numbers
BAM tuna fish pinball you're done all
right that'll do it for your tech news
update today be sure to catch Bridget
back here tomorrow follow me on Twitter
from our Studios here in New York I'm
