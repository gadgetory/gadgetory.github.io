everything but let's just flip the
camera this way and you can see all red
how is this possible it's the memo me
memory mirror and I'm here with the CEO
Salvador belkovsky checking it out this
technology is amazing can you really
tell us what you guys are all doing here
just one of the great things that you
can find here at CES so what we're doing
this is the first digital mirror
platform so it's allow customers to see
how they look 360 and check out how they
will look with different colors patterns
and we take it further mm-hmm-hmm so can
you kind of show us the tool and how
this memory mirror really interacts with
me and can't explain for people at home
yes so basically what you can do is you
can actually record yourself in
different colors and then you can
compare the colors and patterns or if
you try on some things on you and you
want to try other outfits you can then
do it in the memory mirror will remember
you and you will be able to see all the
outfits that you try on physically or
virtually and compare them and then
decide what you want to buy so and the
biggest thing that you have now is that
you can see yourself are your back side
Luke without people to your head out is
the booty look that is probably the most
number one important question that you
deal with right ladies are more
politically correct at the back side at
the back side we can show you how you
look side by side so if you now try on
the the red I can compare it let's say
with the great gray so now you can see
how you look from with different colors
without actually going to the fitting
room so basically we will roll out some
pilots with some brands and you will
hear about it in the next month's some
brands they always keep us wondering you
know what's coming XO thanks so much
Salvador we appreciate it this is really
cool stuff again like the future here at
CES this is stuff we will actually see
in stores and we talked to do it in the
store
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
