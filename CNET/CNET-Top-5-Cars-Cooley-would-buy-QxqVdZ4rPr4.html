about a hundred that we shoot here it's
seen that almost that many of the
world's big auto shows but if you think
I look at everyone and want it you're
very wrong
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five well
really the only five cars that I shot in
2011 that I ever looked into buying for
myself number five the Ford Transit
Connect yeah I see you there looking at
me like I have two heads but I love the
idea of a stand up height van that isn't
some huge ponderous pain-in-the-ass to
drive and keep fueled it's based on the
Ford Focus
so things begin economical and stay that
way it has basically no tech which is
fine by me in something like this I've
got a smart phone a window mount and an
aux cable we're good
let's go haul some stuff number four was
another Ford the Mustang GT I would have
ranked it higher if it was the model
with the v6 which I think is the sweet
spot of the Mustang line since that's a
powertrain you can actually drive it
7/10 in the real world unlike this
affordable v8 monster which has a superb
new 5 liter engine one of the best
interiors in the US car business great
lines I think and Ford Sync though the
interface on that needs a refresh number
3 the Kia Optima this is actually my
go-to car right now all this year really
when anyone asks me what car they should
buy it has handsome lines courtesy of ex
outtie designer Peter Schreyer an
interior no car in this price class has
a right to offer plentiful and usable
center stack technology and real
responsive drivability which is often
overlooked in favor of performance stuff
like horsepower and zero-to-sixty stuff
that you don't really care about number
two the Fiat 500c now I'm a Fiat
partisan from way back as you may know
but that notwithstanding I love how the
Fiat leads that brands return to the US
with stylish looks a great modern
version of the old retro ragtop
quit tech and fun if underpowered
drivability and all that under 20 grand
for a convertible step up to the more
powerful a Barth version will be testing
soon and this cars story comes full
circle before I get you to the number
one car that I thought about for me this
year here are the three cars that I
recall hating without having to even
look back at my notes the MINI
Countryman it costs too much the shtick
is tired and the one they sent us died
and had to be hauled away the smart
fortwo I had such high hopes for this
little piece of crap but Mercedes is
going to relaunch it in 2012 and I think
it has about one more chance to come up
a winner and the Volkswagen Eos first
car we ever rebadged enough said okay
the number one car I configured and
penciled out for myself in a long lovely
what-if was the 911 Carrera GTS believe
me I'm as allergic to the whole 911
cliche as I bet you are
and they even sent us a yellow one gasps
but on the road the GTS reminds you why
this car is a classic it's maybe the
only car this year maybe in the history
of CNET Car Tech that I can say feels
like an extension of the driver and keep
a straight face it's light it's
responsive it's built like an ingot of
steel but it's got serious power right
now power but it's totally livable day
to day lots of tech yes but they still
trail BMW and Audi in that respect but
that isn't the point no car I drove all
of 2011 succeeded so well at delivering
what it's set out to do okay you can
find all my car videos including those
of cars you love and I don't at CNET
tv.com just pull down car tech under the
tech shows tab and find more top 5s like
this at top-five cnet.com i'm brian
coulis thanks for watching
