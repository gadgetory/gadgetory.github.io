of Amazon's Alexa kind of laughing by
itself randomly randomly what was that
about a and B what does this kind of
teach us about the entire digital voice
assistant and the technology and where
we're headed with that yeah so so just
to catch people up on this Alexa was
just starting to like cackle for no
reason or people thought for no reason
Amazon came out afterwards and said if
you say Alexa laughs that was it and it
was in rare circumstances where it
thought it heard you say Alexa laughs
even though maybe you didn't it would
just start laughing getting like a full
spa like unprompted we're just
unprompted say Alexa laughs so Amazon
changed that we're now you have to say
Alexa can you laugh and then she'll say
oh yeah I'll laugh here's my laugh
whatever isn't that they're gonna make
it like preface the left with actual
English because by itself I mean yeah we
laugh at it was kind of creepy and kind
of funny by itself it was sort of like
oh my god something's laughing this is
right but it's it's so the engineers
we're probably looking at this and the
writers you know Amazon has like
thousands of people working on Alexa
they were thinking how do we humanize
Alexa more thoroughly well what do
people do all the time that's actually
like fun and interesting and quirky well
people laugh will be more interesting
than trying to get Alexa to cry which by
the way I should try to do I don't I've
never asked a like for me it's pretty
strange as it is bizarre but I obviously
blew up in their face they were like
trying to do this humanizing thing with
Alexa and this is this is the kernel
here is that this really conveys how
complicated it is to try to get a
machine to like interact with humans and
to create human conversation and that's
like people tend to forget that Alexa is
really only about like three years old
yeah and we have a ways to go for these
machines to actually fully realize and
fully understand what it's like to
communicate with people so you know the
story that happened last week it was a
one-off it's it's funny got hurt it's
funny no I got heard it's funny it's
creepy but I think it speaks to a much
bigger degree of like what
is going on with the nation see a voice
recognition and where it's sort of
headed I think people look at voice
recognition and they think it's the
future and then like we have this
amazing technology from the future but
in reality we're sort of just in the
nation see of this yeah absolutely I
mean the thing that's fascinating to me
about writing about this stuff is just
thinking about this conversation regular
conversation when you have with your mom
where you're not even paying attention
the level of complexity in the nuances
of the conversation the dialect that you
use the words you use the total the tone
all that stuff is so difficult to
actually train a machine on they're just
two people regularly talking it's way
more complicated than you could ever
actually realize and you know cramming
that into code and shoving it into a
machine it could take years and years
for it to actually work and that's why
it's this great you know scientific
effort that a lot of these major
companies are trying to do right now
right go go a little more into that
because right now Alexa and Google home
and all these assistants they can really
only detect voice like actual voice
matching they don't understand any sort
of sarcasm or obviously or any sort of
tone or the pitch in which you're
talking I mean maybe surface level sort
of stuff but what does that mean for the
challenges ahead and what are they
trying to do ultimately because right
now it's sort of like okay I could buy
more diapers using my voice but where
are we really headed with the sort of
stuff I haven't seen a lot of this out
of Amazon or Google but for some of
these small is some smaller companies
they really are trying to add emotional
recognition and emotional understanding
into voice assistance because like when
you say something whether you say like
shut up or I can't deal with this or
that's really funny
your tone has so much to do with that
and for a machine to like fully
understand you fully has to understand
your tone again it's like to layer that
on top of everything else it's gonna
take a long time yeah we got a way to go
yeah
all right cool man
we're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
