checkup open up and say uh I'm Bridget
Carey and this is you're seeing that
update when's the last time you went
through your privacy settings on
Facebook I mean really look through your
settings to see everything your friends
can see and what apps have access to
your profile you may be sharing more
than you realize
Facebook has a bad reputation for it's
confusing settings so it's trying to win
back your trust
by giving you a privacy checkup within
the next few weeks everyone's gonna see
this little blue dinosaur pop up on
their screen to make sure that you are
okay with what information you're
sharing publicly it's also redesigning a
dashboard for apps it's going to show a
clear list of all the apps that are
connected to your Facebook account that
way you can manage their permissions and
for anyone who is brand new to Facebook
the default status update will be set to
be shared with just friends instead of
the public which was the old default if
Facebook is more transparent it could
help the network avoid future headaches
from lawsuits and government regulators
Facebook has been taken to court
multiple times over how it discloses
personal information but don't forget
Facebook makes money from advertisers
based on your activity and what you
share it wants to regain your trust so
you feel better about sharing more Apple
is dealing with its own type of data
sharing headache it has to do with
iMessage which is basically text
messages sent between Apple devices it's
this seamless feature it's part of the
main text message application on the
iPhone and some people are saying that
they're not getting their text messages
if they switch from an iPhone to an
Android phone when they keep their same
phone number now for some reason Apple
servers still think the phone number
belongs to an iPhone so the text gets
stuck in some iMessage filter limbo
never making it to the person's new
Android phone now Apple was hit with a
lawsuit last week over its negligence to
address this issue but Apple could be
closer to fixing it the company said in
a statement to recode that it fixed a
bug with its servers and that
another fix is going to come out in a
future software update meanwhile over at
Apple's mortal enemy Samsung the company
is changing its music services Samsung's
retiring the music hub streaming service
which is less than three years old it
was kind of like Spotify except people
actually use Spotify Samsung is telling
music hub users to download and save all
their songs and use up any credits
before it closes on July 1st
Samsung rather have folks use the new
streaming service with the weird name
you know it's called milk music that's
