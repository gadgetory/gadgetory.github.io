fun business okay let's do it
we got another edition of wait for it
Joe
today Joey tell us what you have
well I'm just I'm just trying to lift
this up into my lap while they look at
the demo this is from the darts factory
this is the goose to dart board I mean
to me the goose Square dartboard it is a
digital dartboard with LED lights it has
multiple gameplay modes where you can
actually play locally with multiple
players you know typical cricket or a
count up but a nice feature with this is
you can also play someone else somewhere
else in a game of darts so Brian
actually came up with an excellent idea
say hey we should get one of you here in
New York we already have one in New York
but get one in San Francisco and maybe
you know a little Joe versus Tong action
this don't actually have they're not
just sharp no so they're not yet there
yeah yeah so they're not sharp darts
they're they're plastic tip darts and I
would recommend buying an extra pack
because we had some pretty aggressive
dart players in the office estimate
everything breaks but the tips obviously
didn't screw and they screw out they're
weighted if you want to hold it um it
comes with this face plate but they're
five different face plates it's magnetic
so you can magnetically comes off there
is a blue purple pink and I think maybe
your red in the Indian well the cut the
plate the face plate it's actually nice
this way the face plates can be
purchased for like 25 bucks this
particular model dartboard I saw an
Amazon for 245 what's special about this
is for all you iPhone or Android or iOS
users it works at both KitKat and up the
app is that there's a sidekick app that
actually keeps the score um so it works
with KitKat and uh Bluetooth 4.0 and iOS
7 and up and it either works on four
double A batteries but I think what
really what really impressed
of course it's an imported dart board
from the dartboard factory is in the box
that came with it they give you not only
a measuring tape where you can measure
to hang it they give you a sticker pad
where you can stand back and with the
plug they give you a plug for America
you know and pretty much all around the
world and you can run it via the outlet
or or from the batteries if you just
want to leave it plugged in all the time
you know if the batteries take it off
the wall another thing is the
instruction chart which is really cool
that comes with it has markings so you
can measure up and you can literally and
it comes with the screws to hang it so
you put the screws in here and you just
rip it off the wall and put it so you
measure where you put the paper you put
the screws through the paper I'm sorry
I'm showing you guys what's up Jim
you measure where you put it and then
you can just rip the paper off the wall
and just hang the dartboard right there
and you're you're good to go in terms of
the app and the dartboard I can flick it
on I just turned it on you can also
control the LED lights when you turn it
on and then you can use sorry this is
CNET's ipad not mine so before everybody
goes crazy in a chat like this is the
app and the app makes sound effects with
the dart sitting as well right it's
loading so it's loading and you know you
got your guest name you decide and I
think I created CNET they put CA with
hearty music in there yeah the idea here
is that two people have the dart boards
you can play at the same time so yeah so
if you have one at home and I have one
at home
we could play each other or we could
play locally so you just go to settings
and you go like to option dartboard
connect the dart board it'll connect to
the dart board yeah see connected and
you can go back and you go new game
cricket you get to choice a game you can
pick like cricket next then it creates a
game I want to add a player very simple
somebody has an account I could put
their account in there or I could just
go guest and I can add another one guest
and then I can start game
and it connects to the dartboard or
create the game then here it highlights
the person's turn and you can bring up
the menu here it's the person skip or
the roster dart you can go back next to
the next person options and it keeps
everybody score here and what you need
to hit also what the dartboard does is
honor if you can see it in the studio
likes but it lights up where you need to
hit you see it if I twist it it lights
up where you need to shoot I think so
you know you're aiming for so it's it's
it's really cool it's really cool arms
the guys have fun with it yes a we broke
it out for third Thursday yeah Mr McBee
in our chat has written do you get dart
DLC I don't know if there'll be a dart
DLC but um it's it's it's it's a really
cool product how much is that this
particular one is I saw like it for 2:45
on Amazon
there's the Sigma which is the step
below this it doesn't it doesn't come
with the overlays it's just a completely
circular dartboard yeah it doesn't have
all the LEDs you know it's it's like the
LX it's lacking extras this is this is
the creme de la creme but it's a really
nice weren't you just but weren't you
just showing me like pieces of wire for
music for like $200 different though but
is it really your headphones or just you
how many people can you play darts with
I mean money on what they want to spend
yeah it depends on how much you value
having a scoreboard on your tablet
essentially right if you can't which I'm
terrible bass I mean I could use
something like that yeah I just don't
know if I value it at 250 personally it
does look pretty cool enough it is cool
and I mean hey if you can make a cheaper
one go get it go get your Kickstarter
going no but I personally think it's
cool I haven't personally seen many
other than this so I couldn't tell you
if it's too high or not yeah but I mean
it's it's cheaper than a lot of things
you find it is the new Playstations $400
you know you got your own you got Game
Boy you know the 3ds is like 179
the I mean when you talk about
electronics you're always hitting around
the 200 although that seems to be the
sweet spot maybe for businesses mr.
McBee then wrote back after a reset talk
to his question that have you owned a
pub that this would be his go-to no
doubt well I wanna another nice thing is
that if you know like let's say like you
know I'm a family man you know I'm not
saying you can't take someone's eye out
but at least a plastic dart you're not
piercing the skin that's true yeah you
can actually you can actually play with
the young ones and not worry about
anything really dangerous happening
other than but let everybody play with
like glasses and everybody's like you
know they're impervious um so how did
you dart game game it's better when I
drink more or maybe I think it's been I
think I think it is better at pool and
darts I think seem to be a little better
for me when I drink but I have to be
right at that
that magic spot like not not like going
up the hill but not somebody's grade
yeah well this is I'll tend to focus
better yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
