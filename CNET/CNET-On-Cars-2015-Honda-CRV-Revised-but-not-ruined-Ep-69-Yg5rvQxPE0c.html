just change forget your flying car your
invisible car is coming first and the
top five car makers in the world it's
time to check the temp PC cars
differently under the hood but also
check the tech and are known for telling
it like it is ugly is included at no
extra cost the good the bad the bottom
line this is CNN on cars
welcome to CNET on cars the show all
about high tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis
well the honda crv is just about the
most humble car we've ever featured at
the top of our show but it deserves this
slot as it celebrates 20 years it is
currently the best-selling compact
crossover in the US market and that is
saying something
for 15 they gave the vehicle a pretty
good refresh a little different look
outside whole lot of new tech under the
sheet metal let's drive a 2015 tour it
with all-wheel drive and in root beer
brown and check the tech
now as you can see to be sure they
didn't do major surgery on this latest
CRV but enough to make its potable take
a look at the front face it no longer
has these kind of fussy 3 chrome bars of
the outgoing model now it looks more
like a Civic and it's a little more
aggressive or sporty looking out back
they got rid of this kind of goofy smile
like feature line straightened it out in
general the car looks a little more
macho a little more present now inside
the CRV one of the first things you'll
notice is a new set of head units that
are the big 7-inch touchscreen type this
is the high-end one in this vehicle I've
ever been a big fan of Honda navigation
as you know it's a clunky interface it's
kind of poorly rendered since Honda
locks out lots of inputs while the car
is moving and has no control a knob or
hand riding pad you better love their
voice rec I often don't go to nearest
Chinese restaurant basically they can't
put any bins in this car that hold razor
blades cyanide or a gun but you use one
or all three after you try to figure out
what mode you can be in to issue what
voice command gap luckily you've now got
a new option at least on your iOS device
for 60 bucks you can download and
install this Honda link navigation app
which is cloud-connected
you can enter addresses via voice here
in one phrase it's fundamentally better
than this you've also got a new AHA app
in here that runs from the phone shows
up on the dash as does the nav now to
get what's on the phone on the dash you
need to get a $100 cable kit that they
sell which is a combination of USB and
HDMI from your iOS device no Android yet
to get that on the screen that is a
horsey expensive mess but here's what
they call their amid their multi
information display this button on the
wheel takes you through a few helper
screens it allows you to split things up
put entertainment away up there while
you focus on nav down here is a common
scenario when it comes to your media
sources you've got the usuals plus nice
touches include Pandora integrated here
HD radio you now have two
USB ports here in the console and the
onion for drive controls in this vehicle
are going to be a one choice only CVT
gearbox if you've got a sport mode here
as a gear position not as an overall
powertrain modifier there's no sport
button for example beyond that all of
this is nestled in one of the
nicer-looking cabins in its class this
is a mature quality feel for not much
money and if you thought Mazda's
SKYACTIV was a stupid name for an engine
try earth dreams what does that mean
well it means different things in
different Honda engines in this one it
means they've introduced direct
injection and reduced the friction of
the internal moving parts the results
are good 185 horsepower same as last
year but it comes at a lower rpm and 181
pound-feet of torque that's 11% better
than last year while the mpg went up for
city and up three Highway that means 26
City 33 highway through this all-wheel
drive powertrain with now a CVT
continuously variable transmission
that's also new in this year's CRV now a
CRV is not a high performance vehicle
power though is adequate I don't have
any problem with it and clearly that
additional torque and lower rpm ceiling
for max horsepower are helping and an
awful lot of a kind of a crappy engine
note coming through the engine bay even
though they supposedly put a lot more
sound insulation in they could add some
more to of all of that rather grating
into the sound coming in is a rather
grating ride quality and it's been
improved they tell me from the last
generation but it could use some more
it's a nervous ride that can be
fatiguing you feel every crack in the
pavement unless the pavements really
nice this transmission the CVT I give a
lot of these knocks this is a real nice
one I didn't even know was a CVT when I
first drove the car I always drive these
cars knowing nothing about them to try
and feel them without preconception I
thought this had a standard automatic
which is high praise for the CVT
no paddles or any other nonsense as I
showed you earlier it's a
straightforward drivetrain there's also
no settings for the all-wheel drive it's
just there and it's working now all new
on the CRV this time around our driver
assist technologies like lane keep
warning and active lane keep assist you
hit a button right here on the right
side of the wheel and this guy is gonna
steer itself within the lane lines and
it's actually really aggressive in fact
it's kind of earring to be driving the
car and feel how how hard it's pushing
the wheel when it wants to keep you in
the middle of the lane the various
adaptive Drive technologies take over in
a patchwork of speeds Lane cape tech
works from 45 to 90 miles an hour
forward collision braking up to about 62
miles an hour and adaptive cruise only
above 22 miles an hour so it can't
handle a really congested freeway mess
still this is a lot of pseudo self
driving tech for an inexpensive little
compact crossover and one of the most
useful driver assist technologies is
this one I hit the right signal and
there's a camera over there on the right
hand mirror that gives me this excellent
view on the dash to see if I'm about to
cut off someone like a cyclist over
there or whatever is on my right side
that's one of the best visual
technologies in a car today I don't know
why no one else does it unless these
guys have it tied up with a back our CRV
is a touring model so it's got just
about all the bells and whistles
included base that's about thirty to
five if you want all wheel drive it's
1250 more there are a couple of
dealer-installed options you might want
remote start and some rear sonar to
augment your rear camera all in we're
looking at about thirty four seven is
about as hard as you can push one of
these overall as you can see honda has
not changed the mission or the role of
the CRV they just made it nicer all
around under the hood you're getting
better power and more mpg inside the
cabin a better attempt at cabin tech
though it's still a work in progress and
the adaptive driver assist technical if
you like the CRV before there's more to
like about it now it's basically
grown-up market a bit
find the full review on the CRV the new
15 at cars cnn.com well a Ledge tether
is either something you know all about
or have never used depending on whether
you're a parent or not they're those
hooks that live in the backseat of your
car for lashing down child seats it
turns out a lot of them don't do their
job very well
the first review of them by the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
is out we're gonna explain why so many
fall down on the job for the smarter
driver you see that on car insurance
latch lower anchors and tethers for
children the special child seat
connectors you're supposed to use to
secure your kids car seat not the seat
belt they've been required on new cars
in the US since September 2002 but of
102 cars just reviewed by the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety three were
found to have good latch tethers the
rest not so much
parents shouldn't have to struggle to
install a child restraint latch is meant
to simplify the process but it doesn't
always succeed it's not that poor rated
latch tethers aren't safe and solid it's
that they aren't easy to use and in the
practical world that's tantamount to a
lack of safety too often they're hard to
connect right parents get it wrong the
feds say three out of four times so the
IIHS set these five simple criteria for
a latch to be considered good lower
anchors not buried more than three
quarters of an inch down in the seat at
least a 54 degree angle of approach as
you're trying to connect to the lower
anchor less than 40 pounds of force
required to attach a connector upper
anchors must be on the rear shelf or no
more than 15 percent of the way down the
seat back on an SUV or a truck for
example and no other connectors should
be near the latch tether that could be
confused for some vehicles make it a
challenge to find the tether anchor in
this Toyota Sienna which gets a poor
rating this is the tether anchor it
would be easy to get confused by other
hardware the three tested vehicles that
nailed all five were the BMW 5-series
the Mercedes GL SUV and Volkswagens
Passat but that doesn't mean you can
shop with confidence by brand other
tested Mercedes only scored acceptable
all other tested BMWs marginal and VW's
Jetta poor
it pays to double check that you know
how to fasten the latch tethers in your
car even if they're not very good and if
you have kids and are shopping for a new
car make sure you know which ones make
using this technology less of a pain in
the latch welcome back to see net on
cars coming to you from our home at the
Marine Clubhouse of the Mount Tam Motor
Club just north of the Golden Gate
Bridge well most of us some time ago
gave up on the idea of the flying car
but amazing us in its place is the
coming invisible car this is not
entirely science fiction at least parts
of your car may be see-through some time
soon makes for a fascinating car Tech
101 Mercedes got some buzz a few years
ago with a car wrapped in LEDs on one
side and cameras on the other passing
through a live image that created this
illusion of invisibility but that was
just a promotional stunt check out
Nissan's rearview mirror that uses a
back facing camera to feed an image that
is free of rear seats body pillars or
the heads of backseat passengers why is
it every car doing this already
Jaguars looking forward in its current
work to develop interior pillars that
are upholstered in flexible display
material and that fed by exterior
cameras no more losing pedestrians in
those ever thickening pillars these days
the cameras are the easy part and
judging by what LG has been showing
lately the screens may be as well
Jaguars sibling Land Rovers developing a
full-width HUD that could fill the lower
part of the windshield with an image
from chin mounted cameras seemingly
rendering the engine bay empty and
see-through beyond off-road precision
imagine the reduction in things run over
in garages Samsung isn't in the truck
business yet but they think their
displays should be on the backs of them
connected to cameras on the front that
give the car behind a view through the
giant thing making that judgment to pass
or not more based on knowledge and less
on prayer and Minnie and Qualcomm are
working on augmented reality glasses
that would do more than that usual
display of information in your field of
vision turn to look over your shoulder
to park and suddenly your eyes are on
extension cords having to look like a
housefly is perhaps a small price to pay
to avoid curbing your nice alloys in a
moment better headlights on your older
car and top five car makers when CNET on
cars returns
you
it's been a while since the last honda
civic type-r bowed out from 1997 to 2010
it was the poster child of low caste
high tech naturally aspirated foolery
now though in 2015 it's back this time
it got turbo it's a Honda Civic it's a
shopping car but it goes too quickly buy

welcome back to see net on cars i'm
brian coulis it's that part of the show
we take one of your emails and this time
it comes in from jamie m he's got a
headlight question he says thank you
very much for covering the topic of
halogen HID and LED bulbs in the past i
was wondering if you knew of any
resources or techniques to improve the
lighting on cars that are too old or
just don't have the option for HID or
LED lamps well interesting question
jamie with about four or five answers to
it let me start with this idea of HIV
because everyone's talking about that
these days those are those bright white
almost blue white headlights you see on
most modern cars if your car doesn't
have them you can possibly get an
adapter kit like this that will let you
install those bulbs now you have to have
a car that has removable bulb modules
and once you do that this graphs on new
bulbs that are HID and these little
ballasts you see in here that are going
to step up your car's twelve volts to
thousands of volts that are required to
get that bulb fired and that's why it's
so bright I've never seen a brand name
of one of these I'm not even sure how to
pronounce that but there's a ton of them
out there on Amazon and different
shopping sites they're not terribly
expensive but shopper beware in terms of
LED headlights those are really the
latest and as far as I know that's a
factory installed technology right now
there might be an add-on kit out there
but I'm not sure how it's got to
actually match the mold and shape of the
headlight module that's why it tends to
come from the factory now the exception
to all this is if you just want LED
bulbs as opposed to a true LED headlamp
assembly
you can get old-school LED headlights
now for vintage cars or LED bulbs that
pop into the lamp of a more modern car
replacing either a halogen or HID you've
got in there now but remember this gives
you LED bulbs not a complete headlamp
designed to take advantage of LED now
much simpler than going to hid and the
results will be a little less is to just
make sure you've got a good halogen
sealed beam if your car is of that age
and you didn't say how old your car was
Sylvania and the other guys make these
kind of retrofit headlights that are
sealed mean you can't take the bulb out
but they do have a halogen bulb inside
instead of one of the more yellowy
incandescent from back in the day you
just pop these in put the plug on that's
it this is like a 5-minute upgrade now
if your car is new enough to have
replaceable bulbs instead of a sealed
beam like that make sure you've got some
good quality bulbs and these are also a
quick retrofit it's the same process
that's changing a burned bulb you just
put in one that's got a little brighter
whiter light and you can look this up on
the application chart of any of the
companies that make these like Phillips
in this case and several others down at
the auto parts store by the way upgrade
these in pairs so you don't have
different kinds of light coming off each
side of your car now if you've got a
vintage car I mean like 70s or earlier
and you want to upgrade the lights
consider putting in European headlights
I'm not sure these are strictly legal
even today in the US but I've got them
in a few of my cars and they're not a
lot of complaints
here's one from CBA for example one of
the legendary French headlight
manufacturers the Europeans back man
always had better headlights because
they had a different cutoff pattern and
they just threw more light these modules
can drop into a standard 5 or 7 inch
round headlight port that you have on
your car now but it's not a sealed beam
you pop in a nice light bulb here in the
back kind of like modern headlights
which tend to give off better light
combined with this better cut off and
beam pattern and you're gonna get a lot
more satisfying flow on the road
most importantly for any older car I
would suggest that you make sure the
headlights are running through a relay
to the battery let me show you on this
old Alfa now on almost all older cars
here's what they do that isn't really
cool power comes from the battery works
its way over here to the fuse box
then from the headlamp fuse goes over to
the headlight switch that switch then
sends it on back up here to the
headlights that's a lot of run of wire
which tends to be not the heaviest wire
so it gets overheated by having a lot of
current running through it it's just
asking for trouble
what you do when you relay your
headlights is run the power from the
battery directly to the headlight in the
shortest possible run using a relay a
relay is just an electrically controlled
switch it does what your headlight
switch does but does it electrically so
your headlight switch now all it's doing
is turning the relay on and off that
requires very little current just a tiny
little amount while the hard work is all
done locally up here and you're not
sending all this headlight current all
over the car to get there the key
benefits here are brighter lights more
consistent headlights that are less
likely to be interrupted by things like
tapping on your brakes it's also less
likely to have overheating fraying old
wire that can cause failure or a fire it
takes a few hours to do if you know a
little bit about automotive wiring if
not an independent shop can knock it out
for probably a couple hundred bucks
we've had requests from several of you
to cover cars that aren't sold in the US
market namely French and Chinese brand
cars and we're working on that but in
the meantime as we're crunching some of
the numbers around that plan we notice
that there's a good top five to be told
top five world automakers not automate
automate
number five the hyundai-kia group eight
billion cars sold up seven percent
year-on-year
now Hyundai Kia has been a huge growth
story for several years taking its solid
place as a member of the big five their
portfolio of car brands as perhaps the
simplest on today's list basically
Hyundai and Kia but they are part of
perhaps the most diversified family
conglomerate in our list that includes
steel shipping machine tools finance
aerospace and their original industry
construction number for Renault Nissan
eight and a half million of two and a
half percent these two formed a tight
partnership back in 1999 under it our
Nissan Renault Infiniti Dacia Lada an
important stake in Auto Vaz in Russia
and a partnership with Daimler that will
soon produce the first Mercedes pickup
truck no not coming to the u.s. here
Mercedes is seen strictly as a luxury
brand never as a taxi or a truck now we
enter the tight race between the global
big three number three General Motors
nine point nine million up two percent
GM was number one for over 75 years but
it's the only car maker now to have slid
a spot on this list from number two in
2013 to its current number three now not
because its sales dropped but because
number two grew even faster GM is huge
beyond its American brands in Chevy and
Cadillac for example they've got Holden
in Australia Opel and Vauxhall in Europe
ten different car making operations in
China which is also where Buick does
most of its sales number two the
Volkswagen Group 10.14 million up four
percent last year and crossing the 10
million line for the first time in
company history they've been talking
about soon being the world's biggest
automaker
now if the VW Group succeeds it would do
so with the wildest portfolio in the
entire big five be WOD
Porsche Bentley Lamborghini se OTT Skoda
Scania trucks Ducati bikes a big slice
of suzuki and two joint ventures in
China its ownership is also rather
interesting largely split between
Porsche and the government of Lower
Saxony
before I get to number one where are all
these cars made according to numbers
from the International Organization of
motor vehicle manufacturers China makes
the biggest slice of the world's 85
million cars followed by the US Japan
Germany and South Korea oh by the way
take out commercial vehicles and the
u.s. drops from number two to number
four the biggest car maker in the world
is Toyota ten point two three million up
two and a half percent tight race at the
top as you can see but Toyota has nudged
out VW so far for number one using its
namesake brand along with Lexus Scion he
no trucks Rams V's in China majority
control of Daihatsu that got a stake in
Fuji Heavy Industries that Subaru as
well as a piece of his Susan the
interesting story to watch at the top of
2016 is will Toyota drop to number two
and BW go to the top spot for the first
time so far mid here
Volkswagens ahead by 82,000 cars
