out on the PlayStation Store and Tay and
I have been playing a lot of it lately
and it's brought back some memories of
Dark Souls 3 which is still pretty fresh
in our minds what did you think of it I
thought Neal was a lot of fun it's very
dark souls ii in a way because of you
know the stamina and and just how brutal
it is in terms of you know making
mistakes and trying to learn what your
opponents are doing but at the same time
it was blending other fun things like
Onimusha where you had very weapon based
skills that you know if you had an ex
that could play differently than if you
had a katana and those things are
interesting to me I mean yes there are
multiple weapons of Dark Souls but in
neo you actually level up your weapons
skills yeah I liked how you could unlock
new skills like one with the axe in
particular if you hold down triangle
you'd like basically do like a sort of
Legend of Zelda spin move with it but
then you also did point out the stamina
which is huge in this game it stamina is
definitely something you need to keep an
eye on in this yeah so stamina in this
game is somewhat similar to Dark Souls
where you know your actions take up some
of your stamina running etc fix up your
stamina but the big difference here and
the most punishing thing about it is if
you do run out of stamina your guy just
keels over and he sits there and pants
and goes oh god I'm so tired I gotta
gotta take a break in that moment if
you're stuck there and out of stamina
you are so open to attacks and these
attacks in this game hurts so bad I've
been multiple times I've been to shotted
maybe three shot it and a lot of the
times is because you're out of stamina
you're stuck there I don't know if this
is the thing that they're gonna keep in
the game because it is an alpha I hope
that maybe they get rid of the keel over
thing cuz I think it's a little bit too
much and it sucks sitting there and
standing there and just being like I
can't do anything this stamina was
definitely brutal and there were plenty
of times where I'd be fighting off
enemies and if you ran of stamina and
you're still there's still two left
you're as good as dead yeah I will
mention though that at least with the
like lower stance attack which is
another thing they have in the game
there's multiple stances there's like a
high stance of a mid stance and a low
stance that each attack differently but
with a low stance I was able to kind of
attack a couple times and then I was
able to do that the Dodge or the dash
back and it would kind of highlight in
white and then I would
stamina back so I couldn't do that with
the the medium stance or the high stance
but it seemed like a good way to kind of
you know get your stamina back from what
I found the high students kinda like the
heavier one mm-hmm and one cool thing
that I found out is that when an enemy
falls on the ground I'd switch to my
high stance and then I just like crush
him from above like with an axe or
whatever whatever was that I was using
what did you think of the world how is
that as compared to Dark Souls again I'm
into it it's interesting because you
have not only just human enemies that
you're finding against but there's also
like zombified like a demon type enemies
too so there's kind of a little bit of
both you know kind of dark souls is to
you can have the humanoid and monsters
but yeah I totally like the environment
and the setting I like this oriental
style that they have going on it's
different from the Dark Souls that we
are used to and you know the the layout
of the land there's shortcuts I don't
know if you've gone around and found
those but there's like one of them yeah
yeah like you're kicking that ladders
you're like oh this gets me to you know
the the little shrine that you pray at
which is essentially like a bonfire so
this brings us sort of to the biggest
question I think a lot of people have
would you say it's more hardcore than
dark souls and keep in mind that it is
still an alpha so a lot of these things
that we might be judging or complaining
about could very much change i think
that at least from my first playthrough
it felt harder fen dark souls only
because it was more unforgiving in the
sense that one the stamina if you ran
out you would keel over and that would
pretty much be insta-kill if the guys
were next to you unless they happen to
run a stamina and two because as I
mentioned earlier the damage output of
the AI versus like how much life you
have is pretty insane like just dying
from two hits barely happens in Dark
Souls outside of if you're fighting
something pretty strong right like boss
exactly but some of these just normal
guys with a katana well maybe not the
normal guys with the katana but like
those guys might be three hits but still
three hits right like in Dark Souls you
could probably take three hits and still
kind of live and then kind of fend off
whoever he was and try to get to a
bonfire I don't know what do you think
do you think it's harder than dark souls
I I think I had a bit more trouble with
it than you did and yeah I think it's
definitely harder than dark souls but I
pretty much echo the things that you
were saying like I think it's more so of
the mechanics rather than like sort of
the enemy's you're fighting you know
like how dark souls a lot of the
challenge comes from the bosses you're
fighting
the moves characters do and this is just
kind of feels like you know you take
three hits and you die one thing I did
notice though is that I didn't feel as
accomplished when I get through in areas
i did with dark souls I don't think the
difficulty curve is where it should be
you know like I'd have lots of trouble
on something and then I've died and then
i do it again and I die and I'd do it
again and I die and then I'd finally get
through it and I'd feel good but it
wasn't like I didn't get that same
rewarding feeling that I do in Dark
Souls which is why I'm kind of hesitant
to play the full game when it comes out
but yeah it is an alpha so it will most
likely change yeah I mean I definitely
agree with you I did beat the the demo
and I still never really got that
resounding joy of like oh yeah I just
beat that boss that was whoopin me like
even though that boss kicked my butt I
didn't feel like that I didn't have my
stand-up moment where I just in Dark
Souls I'd get up and kind of fist pump I
didn't have that that might be a problem
but yeah we'll see thanks Jake yeah
thank you neyo right now is in alpha you
can download the demo on PSN and stay
tuned gamespot for more on neo and dark
souls
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
