taking a first look at the two new Pico
pix projectors from Phillips these of
course as you can see are designed to be
portable projectors they're small
compact really light but unassuming they
can project a screen up to 120 inches
packed inside is an LED light engine
that can project up to 100 lumens when
it's connected to a power source and up
to 60 when it's not it's got a 2 hour
battery life so long enough for watching
a movie but you'll probably want to
carry around your AC adapter with you if
it's something that you know you're
going to turn to often there are a few
ways to get videos onto this device the
higher end model the PPX 3 6 1 0 is
actually Wi-Fi compatible so you can
connect other devices to it and transfer
videos that way but both of these
projectors have mini HDMI USB and an SD
card slot as other options for getting
videos on here the resolution leaves a
little bit to be desired it is 480p so
that's standard definition however if
you're watching a smaller sized screen
say 60 inches the video does look pretty
good there's also a 1 watt speaker not
so hot but you can connect your own
speaker if you want to through an input
in the back the Pico pix 3610 model does
have a few advantages over the 34:10 for
starters it runs a full version of
Android and it's got a trackpad so you
can actually Mouse around using the
trackpad right up here another big
difference is that there is an Android
and iOS app that you can use as a remote
control to control this projector
however both of these guys do come with
a remote control the 3610 pico pix
should come out in February 2014 at 549
while the 34:10 is expected to come out
during the summer
for four hundred and forty nine dollars
