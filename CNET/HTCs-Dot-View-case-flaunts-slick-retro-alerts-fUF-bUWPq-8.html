it
and we're taking a first look at the HTC
dot view case so I bet a lot of you
heard about the HTC One m8 HTC's latest
flagship phone but I bet you don't know
that HTC also makes a special case for
the device now this goes way beyond your
typical flip case so all you have to do
is just tap the case and it will wake up
and display pertinent information so you
can see the time the weather temperature
you can also see you know if you have a
call that comes in you can see that
someone's calling you you can swipe
upwards or down to either dismiss the
call or answer it
you also see icons for voicemail and you
will also see calendar reminders which
is pretty cool too so essentially how
the dot view case works is it talks to
the phone which then displays block
letters and characters on the screen and
you see that lit up through the
perforations on the front of the case so
there's not really any major hardcore
electronics going on in the case itself
but you do get this really cool dot
matrix effect on the outside it's very
slick looking it essentially has this
front flip cover with perforated holes
and it has a backing which is made out
of harder plastic that you slip the HTC
One m8 inside of and it provides more
protection but also has the curved
backing that matches the curved aluminum
back of the HTC One m8 so if you're
looking to scoop up the HTC dot view
case for yourself it costs $49.99 and is
available in a myriad of fancy colors
and cues I'm Brian Bennett for CNET and
you've just taken a first look at the
HTC dot view case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
