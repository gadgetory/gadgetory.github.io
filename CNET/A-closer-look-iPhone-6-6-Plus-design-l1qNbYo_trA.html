Scott Stein and this is how the new
iPhone 6 and 6 plus are shaped unlike
the iPhone 5s or even the iPhone 5 that
industrial squared off look is gone now
these phones feel a lot thinner and
they're also rounded you've got metal on
the back gone is the glass completely
and the front the glass is actually
curved the screens not curved but on the
sides it actually curves around the
edges so it has a very round smooth feel
comfortable and the glass almost feels
like the screen is floating off at a
tiny bit now the home button is still
where it is before but where's that
sleep/wake button it's not on the top
anymore it's actually moved off over
here now Android owners may have phones
that work like that
just remember that if you want to turn
this on you're gonna press it like that
not up here and the headphone jack moved
to the bottom a while ago so that's
totally clean you still the same color
variations for these you've got space
grey silver and gold and that really
means a black or white front and on the
back different shades of metal and you
can see that the design of the shades of
metal is closer than before and feels
maybe a little more like an iPad or a
MacBook both new iPhones push the
thinness first and so they might even
feel wider and longer than other phones
that's because they have a wafer type of
approach now the six plus it really
shows up and the six you realize that
when you're holding it it feels great in
the pocket but you may have to get used
to it a bit in your hands
that's the iPhone 6 and 6-plus design in
a nutshell I'm Scott Stein at CNET for
the first look at both phones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
