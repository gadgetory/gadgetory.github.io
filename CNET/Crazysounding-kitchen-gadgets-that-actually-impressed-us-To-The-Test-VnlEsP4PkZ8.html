out there yeah and you're not always

the test we have the rapid ramen cooker
whoo yeah so if you want to make cooking
ramen easy because it was so difficult
before to do it anyway yes then you're
going to want to get this guy okay so
you add your noodles your seasoning
packet and then just like normal
except that you don't have to wait for a
pot of water to boil so this is like if
you don't if you only have a microwave
and that's it yeah and now we microwave
it excellent piping hot mmm you do the
honors okay good thing it's not boiling

good and you don't even have to wash
extra dishes I mean it's microwaving
Bowl thing oh yeah noodle broth in my
office you are it's perfectly all done
there
yeah al dente it's good so Sharon if
you're anything like me and you love
grilled cheese sandwiches but you don't
have enough time yeah there's this thing
called toaster bags okay okay and the
idea is that you can make grilled cheese
sandwiches from your toaster you don't
have to like ham fry anything you don't
have to like fire up the stove what's to
like genius she feels reusable it's not
like parchment paper yeah you could
actually Muse it like 50 times I think
Wow

toasted okay now it's done so we're
gonna take it on the toaster Curt hot

goodness these things should come with
your toaster yeah thank you okay
you do the honors fine interface oh it's
crispy look sounds crispy no worm mmm oh
so good
real cheese in a bag literally grilled
cheese in a bag so Sharon you know one
of the worst things to drink is a cold
beverage that's turned lukewarm it's
gross yeah so we have Cooper cooler Oh
which is supposed to immediately make
your lukewarm drink cold like instantly
okay all you do is add two cups of ice
and two cups of water and this is really
convenient when you want to get a warm
drink cold really fast so we're gonna
put this in and then we're gonna just
select the beverage the can and then
start
and it's like going through a little
carwash it's spinning it's like a
waterfall
yeah oh it's done okay okay yeah it's
cold to the touch but you know that
doesn't mean any it's freezing yeah
it hasn't been like pre refrigerated or
anything it's not spilling everywhere
good it did exploding face always a plus
always a plus
okay a little bit for me a little bit
for you all right no chance here it's
thoroughly chilled yeah it's really cold</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
