cnet.com and welcome to road warrior
where we take a look at the hottest
gadgets for life on the go coming up 1
XM tuner to rule them all a headset for
your jawbone and the hot new blackberry
8800 we'll start with the garmin
streetpilot see 580 it's a gps device
you can have a conversation with yet
text-to-speech functionality so it'll
actually speak street names to you turn
right onto visa Darrow street you also
get multimedia capabilities only plays
mp3's though so that's a bit limited the
sea 580 also has integrated bluetooth so
you can connect your bluetooth enabled
phone and make hands-free calls with the
device Bonnie also found that the points
of interest were outdated but the device
gave accurate directions to the outdated
points of interest I guess next up John
Falcone has the XM mini tuner one
satellite radio tuner for all your
devices pretty cool showed up John this
is backwards compatible with anything
that's XM ready and in order to do that
you need the XM mini tuner home doc kit
which we have here just pop the mini
tuner in there plug this into your XM
ready receiver and you're good to go you
still need the 13 dollar a month
subscription but you only need one
instead of one for every device next up
the a lift jawbone bluetooth headset
don't laugh there's a good reason for
the word jawbone and the idea behind the
voice sensor nub is that you can rest it
against side of your cheek and actually
senses the vibration of your jaw hence
the name jawbone because actually senses
the vibration of your jaw and that way
you can sort of amplify your voice to
the listener it also has something
called voice shield enhancement that
blocks out loud background noise like
traffic and stuff finally Bonnie cha has
this much-hyped blackberry 8800 how does
it compare to older models got the 8700
see here so you can kind of compare a
little bit taller by definitely thinner
and just sexier all around I am still
getting used to the trackball I feel
like it's a little loose and just a
navigations a little harder I
kind of miss the jog dial that was found
on the older of blackberries once again
manufacturer buries the SD card
back here behind the battery why do they
do that that's it for this edition of
road warrior I'm Tom Merritt check back
next time for more gadgets that keep you
armed and dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
