2015 thanks for tuning into the show
real quick before we get going we were
recording here with peter ha and justin
you and the computer crashed but don't
worry because we have a backup situation
that I only hit record about 20 seconds
into it so you're just going to miss the
first 20 seconds of the show not a big
deal is just the intro and then we just
sort of pivoted into this quick
discussion about that HBO Scientology
documentary but it's us finishing that
conversation at the top of this show
enjoy have a great weekend see you soon
you
documented he was on the New York Times
number one list for months right I think
years you yeah at that book Dianetics
did absurdly well my gosh well anyway
people don't deny that history even as
followers recognized that he used to be
a celebrated author right but then how
can they not attach that to this
creation story that he also made up are
they just in assuming like well those
are two separate things so he used to be
an off sure but he's also a theologian
as well like how can you I'm not put
those together I'm totally with you it's
a very strange set of circumstances
there's a lot of people out there a lot
of theologists who say look
Scientology's and and even Mormonism
they're relatively you know nascent
religions yeah yeah you know when you
look the grand scheme of things oh yeah
it sort of just all plays out in similar
fashion where it's like kind of like a
guy or a bunch of guys write a story and
seems so easy it does seem easy start a
religious one do you think we could do
it what we've been all good right uh hi
you mmm that seems like something I'd
prime is Eastern High you back are you
back yeah you are you guys hi a
practicing how you back in I am ok
today's our High Holidays I subscribe to
the three pillars of Chinese Korean
Judaism well today is pastor what are
you we can't buckle you baka you almost
flows better it's it's a baka hi Jessica
chant oh we're just being silly Fidelia
yeah it's pretty wacky um so i wanna i
want to turn the tables towards you mr.
haha the hell's going on what are you up
to every time used to come here okay
welcome back you know you have a very
sort of a specific pessimistic attitude
towards the world of tech and whatnot oh
yeah last time you had a joke I think
that goes without saying last time you
had a job in the business you were I
remember what was do you remember where
you were doing last time you were here
no I don't know okay so what the hell
are you doing now like what what the
hell is your job because I didn't let
you tell me when how specific do i need
to get here I want to know who you work
for and what it is you do nice right
well I don't know
i'm no law that's almost like a
kindergarten cop who's your daddy let's
do it stupid love that movie yeah for
sure it's not a I'm not an editorial
anymore so you've crossed into the dark
side well it depends on what the dark
side is to you so amongst people who
write in in the tech world the dark side
is like leaving editorial and somehow
selling out to the man today well you're
making money now nice which is which is
low comment which is the economically
intelligent thing to do probably uh so
long story short on the creative
director at a rather large ad agency
what the ok pretend for a second yeah I
don't know what a creative director does
ok I don't know what a creative director
does what what is it you do what does
that mean be at all specific with like a
certain project you've worked on that's
already out in the open maybe it depends
so you guys pay attention to like car
stuff yeah i mean i bought a car last
year so there was a time where i was
paying attention she fed have you had a
busy week with the car show me no not
necessarily ok so go on what were you
getting to which part do you want me to
explain you at a creative director does
or something of the way can you tell
it's the company that your client I
don't think the company I need to look
at it down ok but I'm but you're talking
about the client but it's a car
manufacturer correct ok it's a Japanese
car manufacturer okay uh so what did you
do with that project as a creative
director at some point I had some
interactions with deadmau5 oh the guy
with the man with the big ball on it
yeah yeah yeah you mean deadmau5
deadmau5 yeah no it is not cuz that's
that's crazy to me I did not crazy to me
that that's still okay that he does that
yeah why add silly um so what is it like
what you do with dead and that my house
would you do with that guy just like
Photoshop some stuff and he thought it
was really cool on Twitter it sounds
like Kia now because Kia like lines up
it like okie is Korean yeah that's a
conflict why is that it now
ya got the good one yeah um so what did
you do explain it you talked to deadmau5
and he's like i'm gonna wear this mask
alright so i said little while ago
deadmau5 he had a Ferrari that he had
wrapped and like an en cat not a
Japanese company correct hit a Ferrari
he renamed it the / re and you changed
all the badges in the car okay so he
debadged his Ferrari and made it correct
than he rebadged it with something
called / re he basically used the same
like font that Ferrari has and they got
really pissed off about that why he
could do whatever he wants he was caught
out I I think the issue is that he was
trying to sell it and they were like you
can't sell this as is because it's just
like a infringing on their copyright
different badging was very similar the
font was the same right but what but I
still don't think Ferrari has a case its
not aesthetically appealing to me that's
a silly lame yeah but yeah but here's a
guy who so there was that whole thing
they made him basically like strip it
back to normal Wow and one we
photoshopped a competitor to the Ferrari
wait a minute is on a whole nan cat sort
of theme I'm very confused so who was
the client you can see why cage say I
don't know I don't know did you sign
something that said your hands probably
so so this wasn't like an ad campaign
this was a very private matter no this
is just like when it was like and okay
is this thing uh-oh since the clients
Nissan so they hired you to take care of
the deadmau5 situation how was that I
didn't I came up with the whole
execution it was like all right Ferraris
asked deadmau5 to basically strip his
car hmm even though it's his car and he
bought it you had nothing to do with
that no not at all so why were you
talking it was just an opportunity like
well we have a really fat that's
right says we have a really fast what
are the rules about this show every now
and then the f can go but you could say
like the S word if you want i don't i am
as you don't care because now we do what
we want all right nice this even gonna
go on the air no this is for me the unit
is poor before my commute yes
I just perfect for I want to hear what
we talk to you good times this morning
yeah perfect all right yes there's a
long story short nissan has a sports car
called the GTR it's it's for all intents
unfamiliar is it's a supercar but it's a
nice car like a fraction of the price of
a Ferrari or whatever so I was like cool
this is sort of an opportunity where we
can wrap this GTR and the same thing and
be like a dead mouse we heard what for I
did ok now I understand her so nice oh
yeah you were you were making you were
accelerating elevating Nissan's brand
associating it with deadmau5 and he was
into it when yeah yeah I'm on I only
want to Vegas we got him a car to drive
around for the weekend yeah so did you
hang out with him I did so he we're only
where's where's the thing when he's
djing he's like yeah doing the buttons
that thing has air conditioning built
into it by the way yeah it's really
Sixers great something about it ok no
I'm not a fan of his music or anything
but well it does he make music or is he
just play records nice return Ashes
amaria yeah you say you know what I want
to know huh peter is uh you know in the
editorial world gonna have the
separation of church and state but
during the marketing team and the
editorial team mm-hmm actually when I
first started working here I was told
not to talk to people i was also are a
good time ago and i was a long time ago
yeah but I thought that was kind of
weird and since then I kind of just like
don't really talk them because there's
this they're just rule but yeah what's
it like sort of crossing over onto the
other side the sorting is editorial the
work is the same it's honestly the same
thing this is like what what would we
have to content or at least what i would
have to contend with back in the day and
you guys maybe to a certain extent
extent pages uniques right yeah yeah i
don't think i think here there happens
to be a pretty good separation when it
comes i think the the editors who are in
charge of the team the the editors in
chief perhaps and the executive editors
are more connected to that when it comes
down to like the pure review i think
that the integrity is still there which
is unprecedent story for cnet because we
do product reviews and
yeah the what said you work for the past
two stories and product stuff right and
that's solely based on like ad revenue
which I mean everyone is but their
models have always been like you gotta
get X amount of uniques a month or else
you're gonna we're gonna fire you Wow
okay so that's not that's not them yes
work environment no but that's well
maybe I should have come worked at Cena
at some point yeah we did have we did
have job openings but you decided to
become big old creative director I mean
it seems pretty fun that you could take
on these bigger projects and kind of see
them through yeah I mean it's a lot of
fun I'm not gonna lie about them the day
I still have to like what do people look
at when they're trying to figure out
whether or not I'm successful at what I
do he's like how many followers did you
get right because it likes to Gia how
many reshares all that stuff so it's no
different for sure yeah that's the one
thing I'm i struggle with Alan on a
daily basis is like the relevance and
usefulness of social media I still I
still kind of don't I still think in my
mind the jury is is kind of out on the
usefulness of it I'm not saying it's
useless because it's clear they're not
but perhaps it's weighted too heavily
let me ask you this you're about to have
a child boy or girl it's a boy boy you
guys picked out NEMA we have two to four
names ok that's it I'm not gonna I'm
real this is the one aren't this I can't
figure out what to call this thing hmm I
don't know that we yeah when it comes
out you kind of just like look at
Gulliver ever get this and then oh it's
Sebastian hey walk ewok chewy I don't
know qe would be sure she'll be back a
lot walking down mr. yeah there you go
comes to agree to let me ask you this do
you have or has your wife set up social
media accounts for your unborn child oh
um so it's a good question i guess if
you haven't picked up name out you can't
joke I've this is gonna sound crazy baby
back baby back our I've registered a
gmail for him for like our top contender
okay and a Twitter just to see if the
name was really able just to squat it
yeah
not to be like I poop today like tell
right in his voice but I so do squat now
I'm not going to yeah i squatted them I
do appreciate because I mean we all have
friends with babies now but I appreciate
having a separate Instagram account kind
of similar to people that do that for
their dogs or something I do that for my
dog yeah i mean that's fine i like that
because when you see that name you
expect to see a photo what do you what
I'm saying no what do you mean I'm doing
that I like people that create a
separate and Instagram accounts episode
of a media account for you know the
kidder sure sure so the reason why I ask
you is do you think that some of these
platforms are going to be relevant in
like five years ago child's great
question not even longer than that cuz I
don't think your kid's gonna have like a
phone when he's five no of course not um
yeah it's a great question just say like
10 years do you think Instagram so look
at me around twitter i don't i don't
know i don't know i mean that's the
thing no one's thought about that it's
no I've definitely thought about it
you're kidding but like when you when
you asked that question yeah when you
have the answer yes or no it's still
going to be around then what like oh
it's not gonna be alright will be
something else there'll be something
else right i I think there's still a lot
of consolidation that has to be done out
there with all these these services it's
Thursday I just started reading the
circle what's that by David Eggers Oh
Aziz I like it a staggering um what a
heartbreak worst a freaking work of
staggering yeah i read that haven't read
that it's a bad book yeah have you read
it I've ready no this is called the
circle new beau the circle I think it
came out last year at some point
everyone was talking about then I just
didn't read until now but it's basically
the story about this girl who starts at
this tech company right yeah which is
basically I think it at one point they
were talking about how it had basically
bought out like Google and Microsoft and
all these other like big tech companies
so it became the one it became the only
one physically and it's just interesting
because it's like the the story of the
founder is he got sick and tired of
having to create or remember passwords
and profiles for all these different
things so he created was like one
universal like key
yes I'm sure yeah I mean but then it
gets crazy apparently down the road oh
it has to if it's not asking a crazy I
look I'm with you I truly think like
we're gonna get to the point where
corporations become more efficient and
productive than governments which their
dr i mean like who would you trust more
with with your taxes google or the eye
or the IRS like I would know i would
probably trust google to run it I would
I really yeah you don't think so I don't
know the census for sure the census goes
without saying you talking about like
data like the true currency of our world
is data right scary thought you know
like you got to think about like that I
an end uh yesterday last week we talked
about it I truly think like robotics are
a big part of our future and a huge
impact on our economy and when labor
force I watched the new robocop last
week now not where I was going but yeah
I don't think like I don't think like
we're headed for like a world of
chappies but maybe we're headed for like
a world of like meter maids in a robot's
I'm already starting to see that clock
in i robot yeah if I kind of don't ever
want to mention that awful thing watch
those videos those video clips put out
by Boston Dynamics sure every go on so
just put out one that's like light years
ahead of the last one only like a month
ago yeah they'll have a dog that's had
barely walking yeah got and it's a car
the last one is gave published it showed
a guide like physically kicking oh yeah
as it was trying to run up a hill yeah
and a guy like kicked down stairs and it
resisted against him with enough force
to continue pushing it terrified the the
one that's going to freak you out is
when they get one that can like do
parkour we're like we're like traverses
complicated obstacles like it just
climbs up like an aggro crag and just
like what stars yeah yeah an
interstellar for sure way more
articulated yeah I'm telling you man
like that so so you know you talk about
that but I talked about this with our
good friend Jill Schlesinger last week I
truly believe maybe I don't know I saw
this video that was really compelling
and convincing and I think it was also a
little too dystopian but this guy was
making the case that like forty five
percent of the labor force is about to
get wiped out in the next 30 years
because we're
bots are going to take over janitors and
driving and all these like jobs and when
you screw up the economy like that and
then the workforce and unemployment buzz
man rumbas license upcoming thanks
Connor that's a start I'm Jay that's
kind of the start it is but attorney
we're already there like it have we have
self-driving cars they work perfectly I
don't know about perfectly it can't
drive in you city I don't know they
can't drive in Manhattan all right but a
two way too many variables yeah I don't
know that you see that that one google
video where they had the the 30 mile an
hour car doing an urban environment you
telling is different it's different so
you so you you shake your head okay and
use your like nah that's but you realize
oh it's going good oh no it's gonna
happen like there's none of them or
statement they're working now is false
no no it's not know is that you just
haven't done enough weight it was just
invented wise you were saying that yeah
dude I'm telling you there were getting
out of your mom we're getting there all
right you can say sir uh I mean that's
what ever wants to do you know it's
gonna who's gonna win that fight is it
gonna be like a Google driving car and
over driving car you're gonna drop a pin
it's not disappoint Rick and mr. mr.
robots gonna come I just feel like you
know I only just try to burr for the
first time really no not recently a year
what do you believe more than yea though
I don't use it very much i mean i biked
around i moved to Brooklyn that's true
no right yeah but um you know I don't
I'd used it for the first time maybe
like a year ago I was really impressed
by the service the guy walked out of the
car when I came and he came and picked
me up open the door for me and gave me a
bottle of water okay and my neighbors
probably thought I was a celebrity which
was awesome and then fast forward a year
later you know this was maybe a couple
weeks ago I took the other uber and the
service was completely different uber
because you want that premium service
yeah but now it's exactly the same as a
taxi cab just slightly easier to hail
you are exactly correct the honeymoon is
over oh yeah ate too many drivers and
they just don't care they don't care and
I guess like you can't complain about
this but you cannot get a ride during a
peak time and pay the regular price I
mean and I get it that's just applying
them in that
sort of thing button I don't give a
anymore yeah like I I'm sorry if it's
1230 at night on a Thursday and I can't
get out of regular priced uber in the
city yeah that's ridiculous yeah fix
that I know that just means higher more
drivers but fix that out even then it's
just it feels like and I wonder if when
you suck when you drive when you get
your first uber ride you know I almost I
will I feel like they know they know and
the driver knows and the driver is then
instructed yeah do it because you don't
have a rating at that right when you
give you the open door service well your
first ride really I guarantee you that's
a thing they recommends you me on your
best behavior is like a look first time
aburre first time it has to be I thought
it changes over do that what time I've
been doing is like a week that's like
hey whoever hasn't used do bird try it
and tell us what happened and Addison oh
that's a great idea I know they do that
if you like otherwise I don't know well
you got to do the standard one yeah
definitely Oh regular yeah not great
longer cuz X will do it for you because
you're paying a little more so they'll
come out no but X is a cheaper X's viaje
to try it regular that's what I'm
thinking do an uberx you know I'm
telling you especially if you're in a
town where you just gotta burr yeah
telling you there's got a good job but
they low hanging so you gotta tested
here though right yeah totally i can ask
me I I would almost guarantee the
problem is I don't know anyone who
hasn't tried it yet right you know um
yeah so yeah that's that's that's that's
where r at man that's what's getting
crazy okay there's a few things I had
that I don't want to talk about first
thing I want to get your guys opinion
about the The Trevor nila thing Trevor
Noah is taking over for John Stewart
this year and for whatever reason you
know the the vetting began right after
and this poor dude like gets you know
his life turned upside down and I don't
know where this started but a few tweets
from a few years ago yeah came under
scrutiny
from a comedian and he's a comedian yeah
he's a comedian and you know there was a
somewhat of a backlash from this with
you know Natan one popular comedian who
hasn't said something controversial dish
is gonna be silenced racist it's just
gonna be sore whatever it is do it yeah
yeah it's just gonna be silenced my
question is why didn't NBC vet that I'm
sorry uh why didn't wet who was on my
central yeah why didn't they vet that
Paul this is not a vet about how would
you hell they knew that they could
easily pour back through this guy's
Twitter course and what do you have
questionable stuff that it probably came
across it but is it really that
questionable though I mean it's not fat
chicks which is like you know making fun
of fat chicks is a very old joke in like
a comedians handbook by true I mean I'm
so that's not an especially offensive
one I don't think personally no but
still I mean just from covering your
bases like before you hire someone
that's gonna be that high profile make
sure that he hasn't said anything bad
and is so here's my thing they
definitely did vet him they definitely
saw that stuff and they probably thought
nothing of it because it's not a big
deal naini cool now people actually
might know who he is rights right I just
think it's amazing that it's just like
man if there's one thing that twitter
has done it has just made everybody so
much more offended and it's just as
platform for annoying for just
complaining yeah and it kind of drives
me crazy and I'm not endorsing racist
comedy and I'm not forcing and I'm not
saying people should just you know have
those kinds of liberties with comedy or
with anything because you know what even
if he's not a comedian it's okay for
people who aren't comedians to make
jokes yeah you got like I feel like
that's like anything that's just gone
completely the other way yesterday the
weather here was so nice I just wanted
to say something on Twitter something
about the weather and like being able to
wear like I love wearing my leather
jacket when ya is appropriate sure that
I was like what is alright it's ok what
if someone like comes after me they're
like PETA all this and leather and like
wow you know that I was like okay I'm
not gonna do this right that's that was
my concern was like why can't I say
something about the weather mm-hmm and
then I just
you're that out you're just not allowed
yeah you're not allowed one's gonna get
offended even the weather is a favorite
little come here and that's the problem
I have I look I just saw those people
that are offended won't be satisfied
until Trevor Noah has to put just
kidding after every single tweet that he
write but he's a joke well you saw the
Patton Oswalt response right and look at
what he say he sent out like a 53 part
yeah tweet all right that was clearly
addressing the Trevor Noah situation but
it's also a larger story about comedians
having to apologize right exactly and I
you know I don't know I just I don't
want to be up you know sort of the
police state totally I don't want to be
thrown into this group of people who you
know are associated with like saying bad
things they're being proud of it or or
somehow being proud of being a racist of
course that's not we're trying to say or
do here I am NOT concerned with Trevor
Noah saying these things on Twitter from
horse ago I am more concerned with him
actually being able to do the show apps
which is a way more like rational
thought what he said in the past who
cares ya know it's it's insane it just
brings me like really it just brings me
this really upsetting sort of like
feeling about the state of the internet
and maybe more so American culture yeah
because I'm just not sure a fallout like
this would be a thing yeah elsewhere
maybe it would maybe the UK going on
with that top gear guy I don't you know
I don't know well yeah yeah I mean I
wasn't story and that's a different
story and that was like a salt right so
what do you have like over a sandwich
that was prepared in Corrado I don't
know he wanted to stake what's the week
what we wanted he went like a hot he
wanted a steak yeah but the writ was
like there's no steak available yeah the
cook had gone oh yeah something like and
so they brought him like a sandwich
story some cold cuts yeah just
sometimes you want to stay yeah let's
take it good defense steak is let's
dinner on time all right I'm glad to see
we're all on the same page with that and
I would like to think that the vast
majority of Americans are on that same
page who live in a rational sort of
conscious state of mind no I don't know
but don't you but like I said don't you
think the vocal minority people who love
to be offended are the ones who live by
these double standards all the time
they've yeah the double standards it's
okay to make fun of everything else
except for the thing that I'm exactly
exactly like shut the question is is
there anything that's not okay to joke
about I don't know I learned real quick
on the Justin Bieber roast that
apparently if you it's okay joke about
anything those nine eleven years I
repeat that good i need to watch this
you should watch a Pete Davidson you
know Pete Davidson yeah
nineteen-year-old a 20 year old comic
he's on SNL so dad died no no he's a
firefight terrible terrible dudes like
cracking jokes about his dead and then
Jeff Ross like made a joke about is that
I don't know if that was public
knowledge beforehand no need this one
like Jeff Ross just made that joke up as
Pete Davidson was doing no I'm sure he
vetted it with him before look I'm gonna
is this cool i'm sure whatever it is the
best is that forgot he got okay the joke
was that don't repeat the joke okay the
funny part about that job is that he got
snoop and uh shack and Pete Davidson and
apparently is dead all in the same joke
right that was very master it's yeah
okay the roast is goodish water but it's
some beer yeah yeah you'll hate a modern
I like him he's not a very likable dude
if you were 33 year old male yes I'm
sure but uh but yeah like there you had
it you're like okay well I guess that's
not off limits either yeah not that then
it's not that I mean I always I was you
know sort of paraphrase this thing Mel
Brooks used to say where it's like you
if comedy is either everything or
nothing is essentially to take away from
the standards day and I can't say that
up to I still agree with that you got to
tell the line if you you know over the
line yeah it's just that that's how we
have to live and you know it's here's
it is it's okay to be offended but it's
not okay to make it this situation where
you you you are chopping down on people
being able to express themselves I get
it there's racist people that's not cool
well you you know and that's not a lot
of different part of this there are real
issues I mean I hate to I don't I don't
like when people bring this up but I
will I think that there's so many other
issues in this world to worry about it
then they're taking issue with this one
thing like there are really racist
people there are people that really are
waitest you know totally and focus on
those people where the problem is
obviously media yeah yeah it's it's
immediate reaction that ignites the day
out everything is like a tabloid yeah oh
my god everything everyone is like a
tablet for sure so unfortunately yeah
that's what it is it's like oh man we
gotta get some page views or its pages
what can we say who said what yeah I
mean and what can we dig out well the
problem is that like you know it's like
the chicken or the egg right like is it
the cultural desire to read the the
bottom feeding sort of junk or is it
because it's the overload that the media
sort of like a sort of populates that
drives that I mean here's the divide
between like what you would consider
quote-unquote air quotes old media
versus new meteor me new media will
never get the access that old media has
traditionally hasher so what is new
media have to do they kind of they gotta
go digging for stories sure that might
not necessarily matter things right and
present them in such a scandalous
sensational I yeah my favorite new trend
in articles are the ones that are listed
of screenshots from Twitter you know
it's like easiest job for an editor I
wish I had that job i could just be like
what these people said about x and then
all you do is just copy embed code from
twitter right it's just a list of tweets
yeah searching for tweets and they like
which ones are the worst possible yeah
put into the oh and it's like one that
has a do to guys like 11 followers and
none out
because because that's the problem
you're giving that no-name junkie a
voice okay it's clearly a junkie this
yeah you're just and that's the problem
with their internet all the internet did
was give a very you know successful
voice yeah to these lunatics yeah where
before they would just like live in the
basement and not bother anybody yeah
like a checkout clerk of the grocery
store was the only one that heard these
Rams sure and not to say that all check
out people are lunatics but you you get
our point right it's like these people
would just live their lives having these
awful opinions and awful views on life
and they would just fizzle out no one
would care any less but now that we've
given all of these a nuclear megaphone I
care oh yeah and now that's where we're
at okay deep that was deep let's let's
rise out of that muck a little bit well
I also don't want me the last thing i
wanna say about yours i don't want to
put myself above know the people that
consume this type of news because i read
a lot of that kind of stuff like I spent
an hour on like mediatakeout last night
what's on ya I don't even know that is
it's kind of like WorldStarHipHop oh
it's for like yeah it's like uh oh it's
just like industry news like
entertainment industry news it's a lot
of like look what uh Wiz Khalifa tweeted
today or like Amber Rose wants to get
back with so-and-so like what we
calendar and Duke sort of yes it's just
like Gawker or or worldstar but
specifically for like entertainment and
the hip-hop world gotcha yeah a lot of
like trying it remembers DMC style cool
yeah the best buy that's in next to
adidas and Soho Soho she should I
remembered last night that i had seen
Kanye West and amber rose in that best
buy a few years ago what it was the most
random thing like why are you why is
Kanye West in a Best Buy I don't know
with Amber Rose what section was he in
there's like the first floor so like
where the cameras were so weird it's
gonna be not so weird I don't know yeah
I don't know anyways sorry lets it go
Dora
exciting speaking of Kanye I know he was
part of jay-z's little thing that
happened earlier this week don't want
you to talk about title so there's a lot
of controversy over Trevor Noah and now
there's a lot of controversy over title
this is what happens when people with a
lot of money don't know anything about a
particular subject ya think they're
gonna just disrupt your whole universe
so title is a is a high-end high
fidelity streaming audio platform so
think of Spotify comics no never had
this idea I'm explaining this or this
time my bad it's okay so tied is
basically Spotify but with better sound
quality on steroids and an inferior
arguably inferior user experience right
to pay models you can heed to pay twenty
dollars a month for the hi-res tracks or
ten dollars a month for Spotify high
quality right right but the whole idea
is that the buy-in for the company it's
a it's a almost like a call it a co-op
but you can basically by equity in the
company right now so you can yeah so
jay-z is inviting other pop stars which
is why it's sort of all these again so
it's sort of like a Reb sharing thing in
that regard right but the guys that did
the presentation who's in it it was like
jay-z Kanye Rihanna's Madonna there my
daughter's there deadmau5 was there uh
there the core but you can buy in if you
have enough know what's the dudes Daft
Punk was there oh yeah right in the mask
dude yeah well they don't appear to
outside of the mask right there just Tim
white french dudes right yeah so why
what are your thoughts on title what
should they be doing that they're not
doing I don't know what they should be
doing they should probably just shut
down do it you have a problem with it
right yeah jority of people are using
really crappy crappy earbuds the vast
majority cranked all the way up right so
why don't you try getting a better set
of headphones okay so your for the
consumer that's right and supervision
advice right so for title I don't even
know what I have no advice other than
like yours this is the stupidest thing
ever okay so no but why why do why do
you feel the way you do because I don't
want a high-fidelity sort of experience
on the move okay some people do yeah I
maybe feel like my thing personally
don't so when I I hooked up with them in
January and they gave me a code for free
year and i've been using it almost as
much as i've been using spotify i like
Spotify because I use it I'll ok but
what are you using to listen to it I
have these headphones who's a really
good altima tears here cones they're
grits I'm in the minority people who use
great headphones are you using it Justin
no not using them but i can tell that i
can tell the difference in quality
totally I would pull it out I other I
thought the man complained about titles
at the catalog is nowhere near as big as
that is totally true for anything yeah I
mean Jimmy Iovine himself tried to take
over Spotify I was unable to do it why
does jay z and this is my main issue
with the whole title thing too is that
they're still going to have to license
the music from the record labels which
is the problem with the industry in the
first place right it's not that jay-z
and all these guys I don't know are
annoyed about not making enough money
they're mad because their record deal
sucks thank you do yeah and they can't
get out of it begin even the service
isn't going to make them exempt from it
because they're still going to have to
pay to license it from the companies and
those companies are not going to join
title when Apple is definitely going to
come out with our own streaming service
either this year or next so do you think
and shut everyone else down so you think
spot you think Apple could take Spotify
down absolutely i think if anyone can do
it Apple will no one else has a chance
what will Apple do Google sighs I mean
they have the money google has a strong
you know but people i'm using google
music no one uses it yeah um the what
were you gonna say the other thing is
all right you get higher fidelity audio
streams it that's not going to do to
your data yeah it's going to be in his
way more dude you probably use like five
times did ya know I'm with you man has
unlimited data anymore no one but i but
i have unlimited data in my house where
I use title the most like when i hook up
my computer to my receiver if i'm
choosing between spotify and title i'm
here on title because titles does sound
better right see that's it though I mean
i wouldn't pay 20 bucks a month for it
though i'm using it because they gave it
to me to test and i have it when the
years up i'm not going to right now or
not no I can respond no one's gonna pay
twenty dollars a month for streaming
that's so much money and we will you say
eight what is it nine ten bucks yeah
that's fine modify even though it is a
way inferior bitrate it does sound good
what is the highest i finally I don't
know what it is honey that's a great
question but I'm not sure I want to say
it's 192 that was that it yeah i know
but i don't what is title supposedly
then it's apparently it's like streaming
flak is well that's what that was the
pitch i heard I mean ideally that would
be great if you can get mobile and high
quality tracks but idea i don't think
that tile is going so spotify does have
320 k back yeah and 160 is the free and
no 96 is the free mobile i'm going to
look up title bitrate right here titles
bitrate I cannot go ahead like 192 oh
they they it is flac it's 11 14 11
lossless flac I'm with you though Peter
I don't think that unless you have the
gear it's very niche yeah and those
people that are niche are going to be
signing up for this alone they're buying
Dax their phones right they're gonna be
buying better headphones or just using
to music at home not to drink we're
gonna have what is that crazy hard drive
is it olive or something or other no you
know I'm time okay a digital music
player yeah I haven't heard well there's
a dance called there's like the poem any
even that a horrible reviews the what
there's the pono player oh no which is
that Helios thing yeah but I mean that's
pretty silly yeah I mean there's there's
no is there an ant built into that there
is yeah okay let's also a lot of CD
ripping yeah for sure and and and you
buy records you buy a record for
thirty-five dollars wait what yeah you
can buy you can also store through it
and you yeah it's it's a weird time my
whole thing and yes I'm with you and
you're like upset with jay-z right
you're upset with him I think it's just
audiences yes right you know they give
us a national audience for it so so
here's what upsets me about it it seemed
as if jay-z did this where he bought all
this equity right he has he owns a big
chunk of title now if not the whole
thing he bought the company last year
right so he owns it outright yes that
the whatever it is and then he like gets
on Twitter and for two days hashtag
Twitter title for all is trending and to
me it's just like that's that's me
thinking he thinks that he just can do
what he wants and people just gonna
follow him and but how is that different
than tech I'm just saying oh yeah it's
the same thing I'm just saying like
there is something inherently slimy
about that move I just wish that he had
been like we're gonna take a look the
entire model of streaming music not just
create another clone I mean it's
literally clone have you seen this yeah
that's exactly the same look Spotify I
want someone to you know I wish there
was innovation I wish they were just
like hey we're not going to release
music on a label anymore we're gonna be
distributed ourselves we're making our
own record label where do I sign our own
artists and come up with our own 5050
like what if he said here's what I'll
titles gonna detach yeah from record
companies right and when I master and
now everyone's going to own their own
stuff independently recorded and then we
will let them we will be the record
company and dreaming is the source of
revenue and nothing else right at least
I know I summarized something that's
sort of science fiction but at least in
that capacity you are then bypassing the
evil sort of shadowy corporation yeah
that exists above everything yeah so
just always a little skeptical about a
bunch of rich people saying that we're
gonna create a new solution that's going
to work for everybody total all right
yeah all right let's get to a little bit
of entertainment stuff um man Oakland
timings perfect Justin because I'm sure
you read yesterday about fuller house
what's that you don't know what that is
I mean I know it full houses I don't
want full our house so variety yesterday
reported that Netflix is seeking to
reboot whoa and that looks going on
they're seeking to reboot the full house
show calling it fuller house same
casters it like yes we be looting we
needs world type thing same cast what
same cast Netflix is currently calling
it a rumor but not elaborating on it
right and Warner Brothers which produce
the original sitcom is not commenting as
well but it would you know variety great
source in the entertainment what is it
Dave Coulier even do it now just about
to ask for steve now that i look at that
feel I can't believe Steve even made it
into this photo um but man was Becky hot
um but yeah I don't know I don't oh yeah
she was such a babe do you my one of my
best friends he grew up in LA and went
to school with what's-her-face Jodi oh
she was shooting epiny yeah it out with
her and how that's cool that's the least
of her problems right detection issues
yeah I don't want to do you see on that
what's that dance daily pants-off
dance-off show that weird i was on like
fusion a long time ago I don't know that
is yeah so apparently this is this is a
real thing it would be a full cast
reunion and they're looking to produce a
the Olsen twins are going to be on there
I mean they don't need the money that's
for sure but um but yeah maybe as like a
token of goodwill they would do it to
like help out there cast members I mean
who's making money these days Bob Saget
Bob Saget seems are you doing okay John
Stamos you doing okay nobody else no I'm
not sure about anyone else obviously the
Olsen twins is most successful I roll
them but it's crazy so so I brought this
up because i want to know it seems like
anything from our childhood specifically
because that generation is now making
the most money like what else do you
think we could get netflix to do like
what else do you think netflix would
reboot now know what you say said The
Cosby Show so we're not touching that
I'm not touching that sorry already did
yeah like so if you if you could have
something rebooted and i guess i guess
i'll kind of be a little serious about
it because I have a show that I used to
love on FX called terriers do you
remember that show with Donal Logue
amazing show boobs a Sean Ryan show and
it got canned after one season on FX
brilliant show love Donald lows really
good actor and I was just like I will do
anything for the show to come back yeah
I want netflix to pick it up I mean look
at super troopers to is going to be a
movie oh yeah that's pretty fantastic
which by the way oh man that's not why I
came on this show what point that finger
at me this isn't this isn't like a
finger point of accusation okay okay
when they were on our show yeah when
eyes on the show so we had two of the
guys from super college at the berlin
zur twitter yeah yeah we did an
interview and i'm not saying i gave the
idea but I literally said to them you
should kick start at super troopers to
like four years okay I don't think there
were a lot of people yeah I'm sure
they're like hey that Jeff guy had a
good idea and then four years later you
see on IndieGoGo you don't know that he
didn't I have some not gonna take credit
for it but it is kind of should cool I
mean you have record of it we do have
radio relevant it's online check it out
you go check it out you donate uh no I
did donate no because I knew he was
gonna find me was gonna be funded I
don't want things that are definitive
definitively gonna get funded what show
would you oh so Terriers without you
doubt I don't over the name of it but it
was a show that JJ Abrams was behind and
it was about time stopping at random
parts during the day do you know what
I'm talking about oh and it was like it
was like a stadium involves on ABC right
yeah I think I know your time out
remember the name though it was so good
I mean it was JJ Abrams I feel like JJ
Abrams had something to do with it and
there was a blackout for like five
minutes basically the story was that you
know life exists as we know it but all
of a sudden there's a blackout for five
minutes and nobody knows what happens
during those five minutes but they have
security cam footage of some people that
aren't frozen and so the show is them
trying to figure out what a what caused
the blackout what's going Inge was it
was gone
like who were these random people that
were moving while everyone else was
that's pretty cool i'm sure i'm looking
up there was he don't know if that's the
show I did under covers um how long ago
maybe it wasn't JJ years ago I know the
show that you're talking about i think
yeah whoa whoa whoa portal half-light
yeah i'm looking at two credit
Cloverfield that have been announced
what he he's getting crazy he's
producing he's working to have flavored
old movie and a half life movie Wow all
right but hold on are those actually
this could just be anyone you can't put
it in the game that's what I mean no
like this little movie half-life is very
specific portal could be let's be honest
it could be anything look if you go to
IMDb in your search portal and your
search are flagging at all you're doing
which could be a movie called yeah
that's what I'm saying you know this is
that this but description is the video
ok I don't I don't know so wait what
phone is that this is an iphone 5 me
yeah yeah just my iphone 5 oh you ok
yeah no I'm good all right can I just I
have two shows that i would love to get
to see you sure who did sure one more
than the other flash-forward sard in a
row row during this blackout everybody
sees a vision of the future yeah that's
kind of it was cancelled after like a
season for some would you watch you
finish it up yet and it just really good
seems very like time quake like kurt
vonnegut Ordo but yeah lingual easy yeah
ok either dinosaurs that's a pretty
reboot occurs at the end they die no
that do yet so at the end of that show
they they say oh man like what's that
big flag yeah i heard like the weather
report shows a trooper clouds in the sky
and then all of a sudden you see a flash
in the background and that's it it could
be a continuation maybe not a reboot
yeah why your sequel i guess i'm ok if
you just say hey all this happened
before doesn't matter i'm worried about
the rook annuity of know the canon of
dinosaurs the other thing that's a
brilliant suggestion i love that show
so much that would happen in a heartbeat
yeah you kidding me Oh God kidding me
the second somebody said it would happen
you know who did the voice of that baby
then not the mama who kevin clash who's
that Elmo Oh same dude that was just one
of his first I mean it sounds just like
him when you think they're all right the
other one yeah it's based on that fan
now wasn't fit Power Rangers the
original know like the reboot fan thing
that kid van der beek yeah okay so you
want a dark one yes you want like that
as a maybe yeah no but they could even
retroactively e oh maybe no no no going
forward not a reboot sure sure yeah
that's cool I'm into that i think i
would i would love for Batman the
Animated Series to come back dude no way
you can't perfect that it was just you
like you'll never get that 90's
happiness to it was so damn good that
show like I made sure I got home oh sure
like you ever see the someone recut uh
the dark knight it was the last one Dark
Knight Rises yeah they recut that
trailer using scenes from the animated
series that that's it so good because in
the animated series there was the
football team and that whole stadium
seen happened in the show in hawaii show
I don't remember that what were they
like implodes yeah I don't remember that
interesting look it up yeah I gotta look
we're done we'll watch it it sounds
awesome easier that's pretty cool man
yeah I could go for some batman begins
to I'm not gonna lie we were all little
old metal show came out um no Batman I'm
sorry what was the one that came out
after beyond beyond I'll I feature one
right yeah I was quitting it I want to
wear like Bruce Wayne was kind of old
and had a dog and trains his protege

other like live action dramas stuff like

Pamela Anderson starring as a where
she's oh good yeah she was basically a
like a private investigator / bodyguard

asian guy that did martial arts and
there was like Nikki who did explosive
no I don't want his hamill Anderson just

have like a blue wire characters you
want the old very much I want them to
reboot the original Baywatch you just
why not hassle g1 david has off back no
for a brand new cast maybe mr. building
yeah I don't know if I can get on board
with that but I do want to hear what
people have to say i read this morning
that they're doing a live action movie
of winnie the pooh oh yes that's a joke
wyd live action one that she like a cg @
u cg why because Paddington killed it
that's why that's why you do that do
well yeah really that's stupid um I
didn't watch it but it killed it Ike I'm
pretty surprised by that I would love a
new perfect strangers
lulu and be real dude good show oh no
what if those guys on even know what
their names one of them broke bronson
pinchot was the valve cousin Balki Balki
about Larry Coulson Mary yeah cool air
he was like a big Broadway guy that did
ya huh yeah all right let us know what
you want to bring back because
apparently netflix is like to be bought
open every sale you know they they just
wanna they just they'll do it seems like
they'll do anything yeah see I feel like
Netflix and I was listening to a podcast
where they're talking about Amazon's
process for like green lighting shows
yeah amazon will always make the pilot
available to people and then they decide
so it sounds like bass yeah it sounds
like they kind of test the waters we're
like a TV network could never do that
because it's like it's TV and you can't
just can't just do it but am is I'm
going to say hey here it is online go
check it out yeah I know interesting all
right speaking of movies real quick two
more movie stories Deadpool just
announced that it was going to be an
r-rated fan so there's there's something
cool about that didn't love the
announcement but whatever what do you
mean why didn't you like the
announcement you thought that was cool
Oh with Mario Lopez yeah it's like
that's like I thought it was kind of
funny for me it's like so they did
something so brilliant with Deadpool
yeah they put the Deadpool character on
Twitter right no they did they did okay
and he's like on Twitter and he follows
one person on Twitter God guess who did
it and it's hello kitty of course
because I really is aliens right that is
the perfect news what he would do that
is exactly what Deadpool would do and
then the same marketing teams like hurry
let's announce are rated on Mario
Lopez's show I mean was good at link
from the beginning that I dwell on they
stroll shiny know if I used it they that
I feel like that's an align with with
what they're trying to do with that
either way I'm excited Deadpool's not
going to be watered down that Ryan
Reynolds voice yeah it is it sounds
really great at our yeah augment how
much how much do you think they're going
to spend on this movie I hope cuz
they're gonna need to spend a lot
because it can't although maybe could be
cheap I don't know that I'm very on the
fence with this one that pulls obviously
a very beloved character by everyone
yeah hey how they gonna pull this off
how are they gonna pull this off this is
too it's almost too hard to do which I
don't think it's too hard to do no no
it's can't be harder than making a
Superman movie these days pretty hard
these days are you convinced by anything
you've seen in the last 20 years that a
Superman movie will ever be good again
I'm pretty excited about Jesse Eisenberg
as Lex Luthor are they're just gonna be
like Oh Lex Luthor shrunk and he's just
like but he got super smart it's just
like we could fit him in this little box
now like how's that gonna play out if
this maybe suck somebody no why would
you think anything else the track record
because I was not believe I want to
believe that this is going to be a good
movie Batman vs Superman the only way
it's good is because Batman's in it and
Batman is like box office guild but it's
Ben Affleck it's all right love that I'm
beyond that little diamond and I'm
beyond that a guy like that man I was
upset by jam I wasn't happy that I
didn't care when he was announced I just
was like why not give it to someone else
like he's mr. Hollywood he has
everything why does it get to you a pic
I haven't thought about it but it's nice
it to me it's just not fair because if
he gets to do everything yeah it's jon
hamm should have been Superman oh that's
out of it that's bringing Superman a
little like retro Batman robach matter
Batman Superman 00 t Superman for sure
he's got that like a little block coming
he does have I thought we were talking
about who should be Batman over been
enough like oh jon Hamm's John ham could
be broody could have also been uh
Captain America I don't give a crap
about cap all right no crops about caps
I'll only watch a Superman movie if it's
based on the death of superman comic the
only good superman movie is a dead I
really oh it wouldn't do that will this
remember reading that grown up I was
like every every month freaking doomsday
like that two page spread where he kills
them should I have that whole run yeah
all the sancha l'addition bag and
laughter what are all those different
Superman's that could be a great movie
that's why I'm holding out a little bit
of hope for this Batman for super moon
because it isn't some of based on Dark
Knight Returns right yeah so that was a
fantastic book yeah and hopefully we'll
get some love out of there before we
head to the reddit section of the show
uh ready we didn't talk about this last
week because the outside it was news and
we forgot it but ready player one
apparently will be directed by Steven
Spielberg ah so you have been watching I
haven't read this book but sushi ever do
not live what a shame shame it's ready
it's basically Willy Wonka meets the
matrix uh 30 years from now yeah that's
that's like the best quick one-line
description I can I can't even wrap my
head around with that so it's it's a
it's an easter egg hunt in a virtual
world is what the books and it plays all
80s nostalgia and that's and it's just
like a wild goose chase through this
virtual world where these people virtual
avatars are looking for this one easter
egg in the virtual world interesting
okay and it's all it's like everything
from war games together making another
Tron that's that's great i'm excited
about that yeah i really like the first
tron while i was in that movie you would
you were which one I was in that movie
The Faerie boo you boot yeah wait a
minute of her head hi Daddy be no I'm
not what I don't have a crime movie all
right i don't know if i was actually in
it by huh so that's definitely new york
comic con a few years ago before the
movie came out I during Disney's panel
the director I forget his name he was
like all right everyone here scream as
loud as you can because we're going to
use this audio track for the stadium
scene in the movie oh yeah that's pretty
cool I mean you're mixed down I'm sure
enough you listen real real close you
can here we go this is gonna oh man okay
good well I'm glad that worked out for
you because when you said you were in
the movie that wasn't I thought it was
gonna be like oh if you look closely at
this scene right yes computer ha like
changing a tire changing it what do they
had one of those light cycles I'd say
yeah let's don't have tires so my own
thing with this is I have a feeling
Spielberg's gonna wind up not directing
it oh yeah
because that's how this goes sometimes
like directors get attached to films and
then something changes and and that's
that but anyway we have the book you'll
read it in our in a week it's a real
real easy read okay okay to the reddit
section of our show head over to

Justin so much how's life how's your
girlfriend are you two getting serious
it was really on the computer did you
see us or is your question no no do my
gosh it's all cut they want to know read
it dude yeah they want to know what have
I been doing well I told you last time I
was here that I moved to Brooklyn I've
been playing video games lately yes i
have i told you about this yet off the
show no yeah yes I have so the short of
it is that my friend who obviously on
GPS for now is moving out of his
apartment and so he was cleaning house
and needed somebody to take his old ps3
so I'm a little behind in the game time
but right inherited a ps3 what I'm GTA
IV I've been playing bet that I've been
playing how far along are you I mean
it's slow because the learning curve is
really bendy yeah bendy yeah Barbie's uh
he had super feet yeah and right in but
it's fun it's really fun i also bought
batman arkham city oh nice islands and
it gradually yeah the city i mean asam's
great but a city is is was the big
blowout one I should have taken a screw
or I should have had peony take a
picture of me looking at your review of
arkham city in a good way now in the
game stop that's trying to figure out
which one was better Arkham City or icon
that's funny yeah and I guess I chose
the right one yeah he's right he's it's
great i shoulda brought this up when we
talk about Batman earlier how great that
fighting right the friday mechanic with
like yeah it's really red I mean I'm
it's taking a long time because I'm not
used to having to control the angle of
my view the camera
yeah when did that become a thing
there's a whole new dimension that can t
0 game since the last time i put in
mario 64 how are you supposed to move
like it's hilarious i wish you were
there yeah watching me and peony play
video games when it's just the two of us
like I'm always just like man I wish
Jeff was here so you're into it so
you're into yeah but in serious line
sounds like good I mean she's a huge
gamer she played Final Fantasy a lot
when she was growing up so she bought
seven sons and has been hogging what did
she play now what else um she got into
wall Final Fantasy the only thing she's
playing right now but afterward maybe
Bioshock okay yeah so you're dodging the
the real question here uh so the game
how I meet are you two getting serious
is what hand solenoid is every question
that you've thrown at him he has he's a
splitter it's a slippery little
design / whole time in here well it's
cool because now my videos you can't see
me blushing right but yeah meet me and
peony been together for three and a half
years now it's going well that's cool
you guys have been together almost as
long as I've been married I think the
last time I talked rocks especially you
process that for sure okay and it's
different schedules everyone every
course everyone's on their own path yeah
and there's not even a finish line
sometimes no sometimes you just
sometimes there's infinity bridge yeah
exactly all right I don't know what's
gonna happen no but and I'm sure there's
no pressure yeah she's an incredible
girl yeah maybe we should talk about the
Senate separate episode I have a lot of
questions wait we're going to talk about
dating at one point oh right so they're
all that well so pegue right so that was
kind of the thing because I wanted a
like parlay to you for a sec oh no what
have I done good transition to because
you brought up something that I I know
of that's happened twice with friends of
mine okay when they've met their
significant other yeah how odd line in a
basically through tinder tinder yeah so
so what what happened what how's it
going you know how tender work i do have
seen it likewise okay we do you know
this is the portion of the show where
Jeff lives by care through this single
friends
you swipe yeah no I'm looking I've seen
it but like so you see but I haven't
heard too many success stories I mean
and I would count as it is relative I've
heard a lot it's a lot of just normally
like it's basically do you want to bang
this person or no is basically what
essentially addicts poor what it is dude
it's hot or not I've got its hot of the
very morning so i'm assuming hot and I'm
seeing now that's it that's uh yeah but
no so it's working out is close you guys
are made you call yourselves
boyfriend-girlfriend no I wouldn't say
that okay but we've been dating for
probably been dating two months or so
that's I feel like that's you going on
your first date we were going to go to
this place called atta boy for some
drinks it was busy then we went to
another place called the lead belly so
how does it work the first time you meet
up how'd you get to the point where you
were like you want me to tell you how
this went down what I want to know what
your first impression of was when you
met up with her yeah and also if we can
get into the weeds just look here a
little more I want to know like where
how far along from swiping you get to
the point where like you both agree to
meet in public uh so my tactic at least
on online dating has traditionally been
instead of just like being pen pals and
texts are sending messages for days and
weeks and lends I'm like within the
first few minutes of going back and
forth with someone or maybe the first
couple times a genin at least I
generally get a sense of like is this
person like does she sound cool like
bright would we get along and you can
and you can sniff that out from a few
texts yeah I mean I poke around enough
to be like all right this girl seems
pretty legit we have some stuff in
common did you messaged her first yeah I
did and and then to answer I'll get to
that but then to answer your original
question yeah I like poke some holes see
what's going on and then I'm like
alright cool let's get a drink mmm I
like that and see a lot of people make
the mistake of conversing too much I
think a lot of people that start with
internet dating will do that let they'll
make dinner dates and stuff right and
you'll know immediately
meetup that you should see that's what I
understand see people they mix up the
analog and digital dating work they'll
like they'll they'll they'll see someone
that they want to pursue and then they
like put off the because that's what I'm
hearing is it's shortcutting not sure
cutting you know it is i'm gonna make
sure naked treat it like a Shrike
exactly a little mounted so from the
time that you both were matched up from
swiping you met in how short of a time
in public it took us probably two or
three weeks actually it wasn't let's see
over the course of us messaging for that
long she like lost her phone and then
she didn't that raised a red flag I
would have been like oh this chicks
losing her phone what's the deal no she
totally a really funny story about it
but okay I'd be like what am I guess
that's cool to miss this chance so we
met like on tinder whatever message and
then made plans the following week to
get a drink mmm she lost her phone she's
like I she's just very discombobulated
by it so she's like let's meet up like
the following week or mmm like alright
cool so I hadn't heard from her and her
her she claims that I somehow unmatched
her on tinder so that she couldn't see
our messaging to message me oh wow
that's you guys hadn't exchanged phone
numbers well we all had we had and then
she lost her phone and all this sort of
stuff and then I just text her I was
like hey what's going on like that's
weird you know you can unmatch yeah
that's interesting because you know the
tactic on tinder is you just swipe right
on every there are scripts you can
download that just automatically you it
well that makes sense because you're
essentially just casting your line until
yeah seein if you get a bite you're like
policy I'll throw this fish back I don't
see a lot of women doing that though
that's not definitely Samuel godly dude
thing it sounds like I yeah but her
nickname for me is residual tender
traffic guy that's a long which is
really funny it is funny and actually
works an SEO that yeah she's yeah uh
actually no yes basically yeah I'm she
was just like yeah I after right after
she met me she basically deleted tinder
she was already on her way out mm-hmm
and apparently like her like pretty
silent for a while and I just
matched it's not in there I got lucky
egg walk in there congrats I hope it
works out what did she do I don't know
what she does oh so you guys are close
she said she works in branding okay ah
you still in that weren't I got a
sighting like I would like what's your
favorite color give the siblings like
type of dating situation we've gotten
past how many dates I don't lost count
really Colorado it's good in the month
oh dude that's a mate its major he dug
that's major well good for you i hope it
works out what's her name do you care if
you can Jackie Jackie what's going on
Colorado what's easy cuz they're her
friends nice hang out for a long weekend
buy some legal weed maybe closer they're
up perhaps please do that well think
about that jolly ranchers um so it
sounds like you guys are both in very
nice relationships that's fantastic
moving along whoa wait a minute what you
know exactly my deal everyone who
listens to my show my deal there's not
one stone unturned way to talk to you
about a very small development your life
I mean she's due a week the 15th she's
new um she's gonna be late statistically
firstborns relate which hospital you I
don't know what makes you believe that
you envision that is the due dates
always it's all it's not bull it's
actually very accurate no it's not I
mean on a long enough timeline it is on
average you mean on average on average
mode is the on average most people give
birth within 10 days that they're doing
it within within 10 days front or back
yeah okay idea yeah that true it's just
that's what my doctor see you sometimes
a lot of folks will miss their due date
by at least seven to ten days right so
that's anyway but on your firstborn if
you look at the numbers and you've got
the firstborn for a woman statistically
is late okay no take that for what it's
worth I should our water could put a
broken a minute yeah I don't know mom I
just had my brother just had their first
kid Sorokin grant that's why I said
Uncle Pete Yeah Yeah right congrats I
got kids some swaggy close nice you got
to get my kid some alright then
like a dummy MX whatever now are you
right um so congrats to everyone and
yeah what do you have any other yeah let
me ask you this yeah um so my buddy ryan
he had a kid a couple years ago and he
told me that in the months leading up to
her giving birth he kind of had like a
bucket list of stuff that he wanted to
accomplish before bringing a kid into
this world you know part of that list
was you know getting more tattoos you
know going on vacation more like what
was on your bucket list did you have
like a list of things that you want to
accomplish before because I mean you're
basically gonna be in an 18 year no I
don't want it I mean you know I don't
know I have a lot of friends with kids
and the majority of them are the same
people yeah but I mean to say people but
you know in terms of your time I don't
do things I really don't think and I
don't want to say like you're you know I
don't know again I'm not a dad yet like
but everyone I talked to in this day and
age is able to make it all work and
continue to do what they want to do yes
can you just say hey we're going to
Vegas tonight no you can unless you find
someone to take care of the kid so yeah
I get it you know for me it was like I
looked at my life before we got pregnant
before Marty my dog and and like life is
just a bunch of like compromises and
sacrifices and the majority of it is
still doing what you really want to do
like when you when you break it all down
so I'm gonna ask you this question again
you can I mean look I know the next year
of my life is going to be chaos ya next
year year because that's the book like
the kid you know I can't just like go in
another room for a second or whatever
yeah I get a constant yeah you know the
first three months all your job is to
just keep it alive how big is the child
now seven and a half pounds wow dude so
what I learned was my sister-in-law is
telling me this the the heavier the baby
is when they're born the quicker they
are to sleep through the night beautiful
because i think it's like once they get
to 15 pounds or something or whatever it
is that's when they begin to start
sleeping more I haven't heard that but
if
true awesome because this kid is big
already he needs to be bigger he might
be he might be eight and a half pounds
you need to carbo-load that kid so he
sleeps through the night he might he
might be a and a half pounds by the time
he's born he might be nine pounds God if
she's if she's a weekly he could be nine
pounds you better I'll be born with the
itis well yeah we gonna sleep she's
gonna be born on Mars awesome wiping his
neck but no like yeah a bucket list
that's silly no because you can't have
an added you a mile and you can spend on
yourself is gonna be all cool no that's
not yes that's true isn't I mean I don't
it's not recently but everybody that has
a kid basically said like it's true for
the first six months I bet I feel like
you're gonna be going to bed at eight
o'clock every day I don't see why I
would just do that though my case goes
to bed at six o'clock at night yeah
that's crazy five months old oh the baby
yeah my niece yeah i'm sorry mr. I
misheard you oh I'm talking about you
like you're gonna be losing a lot of
course I'm gonna be losing sleep at all
I'm not gonna see for the first six
months but yeah I mean you know people
wouldn't have kids if it completely
destroyed their lives right and if it
was impossible to do there'd be a lot
less people you know plus we don't like
it you just return it stop you know you
fill out for Beckett you fill out a form
tomorrow suggested a little while now
yeah my parents would love another kid
what am I think we are the day what kind
of dog is my he's a shih tzu terrier um
okay I have a couple friends who had a
French Bulldog had yeah and the
operative words they got ready to get
rid of it because it bit another kid
yeah so the deal with Marty Marty's been
exposed to a lot of babies and a lot of
very tiny humans writing and touching
him and pulling like go like Martin like
if you're on the counter Marty you're an
adult and you like go up to him while
he's on the couch he'll be like hey back
up you know they say I'm relaxing okay
chill out all right we my niece it went
up to Marty snack Marty literally in the
face and marty was just like stood there
like she taking it really
ki that's good it's very good so here
right now our impression is that he'll
be cool he'll tolerate that they'll
tolerate it uh-huh once he he marty is
very loving like when he like the three
of us together me chasing him like we
are a nice little pack okay so I think
he always just wants to be involved and
stuff he wants to heal he's very
inquisitive he's like what's going on
over here yeah someone pick me up I
can't see that kind of thing mmm that's
the way we think he's going to be about
that uh he knows she's pregnant yeah he
can hear the heartbeat I'm sure holy
does it is eNOS center yeah yeah it
means his head on her belly four hours a
day oh yes sir he's cool alright so
hopefully it works out look I'm not
going to be stupid and say yeah it's
going to work out because there is a
possibility it won't yeah but if it
doesn't work at what we're gonna train
them because we've been able to turn 11
so old is he he's gonna be six in july
six years yeah I they talk about no I've
only had them for three okay but yeah
alright yeah we got him as a rescue went
over three what's going to happen to
this show while you're on maternity
leave so I don't want to make it sound
like i'm racing to come back to work but
i only do get the two weeks through CBS
uh-huh so i'll probably only miss two
shows huh that's easy and how long does
stacey going to be she's at she'll be
home for three months okay yeah and then
we're gonna we're gonna do daycare okay
so yeah I mean she's already like
planning a vacation in October or just
me and her so I mean ice it's cool like
what we're gonna figure it out what was
it every time I think about like your
situation right now I always think about
if you even Martin oh and uh yeah like
what's that movie parenthood pet yeah
yeah and him just having that go bag by
the door does have its own or yeah have
you guys had any false alarms or
anything like that yet where you're like
oh no it's just some like bad chicken
iater yeah we had a false alarm last
month was it like in the middle of the
night nope nope nope uh something
happened which I will not get into
detail but something happened where we
thought maybe it might be coming or time
and I was on my way into the city Oh to
do CVS and she called me she's like oh
you know I called the doctor and they
said come in and I was like so I
was like look I'm like in the lincoln
tunnel right now let me i'll call you
when i get to the thing cuz your
hospitals in jersey yeah so she so she's
on her way she's driving she gets there
and she's in the chic over-sized oh yeah
I mean don't forget this like I was like
over a month ago okay like you're she's
only been like incapacitated for like
the last four weeks this is over a month
ago son alright and yeah well you know
she wasn't nervous I wasn't really
nervous I was just like all right let's
see what this is and it took a couple
hours at the doctor but they're like
this is normal you're fine go home oh ok
some wasn't burial who oh yeah i mean
like I've look I've made my peace with
this with you know like you know I a
switch flipped I mean this point it's
completely out of your hands there's
nothing you can do that of course your
cêpan that now until he's born is out
of my hands after that into my are you
circumcised uh that's a good question I
don't know what do you I I guess we can
I can answer this yeah I'm gonna sort
out yeah I don't know yeah I don't know
what are gonna do with it curious uh
yeah you know I don't know my brother
had in a girl so I don't think he didn't
show his eyes boy yet no um yeah you
know we we thought about a long hard
hours nice man you know personal
decision I guess I'm proud of you not
just cuz you're circumcising your book
because you're having a kid ya know you
are in charge of another life now you
realize that I split that responsibility
god help us all okay no I think I think
I'm I'm be a good dad right why wouldn't
I be yeah you have a kind of stuff to
teach us kid yeah yeah are you a good
teacher by the time of kids for is gonna
be like what are we doing I mean it's
going on here what you have me by all
but everything I've learned from you
would say that you wouldn't have me is
that about
your parents calling you every day uh
multiple times a day yeah this is my mom
mom you know she's very hands-on I bet
your parents are so psyched their pump
man those you're excited it doesn't feel
real yet like I'm i guess a part of me
is like still a little bit it's gonna
get real soon oh I know and come on yeah
what have you done to the hell you know
yeah I'll actually you know how to do
anything to the house besides by a like
a crib basically dude it's all done this
kid can happen tonight you don't think I
already have do you have that thing that
the mobile it's like a mobile thing but
you put them in there and they're sort
of upright and then it rotates like this
its wings around I don't you don't I'm
yeah I think I know we got something
like that like a little chair to chill
out in yeah he's fine three-minute Abby
he's gonna be fine yeah Oh dessert do
that movie that is a good idea Burt
Reynolds Burt Reynolds was me in that
Governor Tom Selleck huh you good Bert
it's not the same guy just different
words it's due date for the driver on
this kid that's okay oh yeah I've seen
one of them yeah we got it's just like a
little like a little rockabye a little
play yeah we have a similar thing yeah
something like that we got something
like that so I don't know what they call
that well that's a boy or girl cute
that's when she was very cute like a
week out Wow yeah it's gonna be wacky
I'm just you know for me I'm gonna get
emotional obviously when I see the thing
and just be like Jesus if it looks like
me or whatever just not just being like
you know the DNA just this amazing oh
you know Jeff you hold that thought made
fun of a lot of ugly babies yeah a lot
of okay it's very possible i believe and
yeah and I'm ugly karma is real as we
all accept look I'll be the first to
admit if I have another baby see this
will truly answer the question do
parents of ugly babies are they blind oh
yeah yeah prob they're blind dear baby's
gonna be ugly for
please no no longer than that well
thanks should we make a pact right now
is the truth about the attractiveness
about what's a great feature oh no
that's fine back up recording no we're
okay yeah that's what redundancy is all
about yeah um yeah so that could be a
very real possibility are you ready for
that because I think most babies
actually look ugly until I don't know
maybe like a month or two you know they
look very uncomfortable in the beginning
here's the thing think about being
pushed out of something what is your fav
yeah I get it he got super losing messed
up from that and then also what I
learned was even in the wild all of the
babies look like the father initially so
the father doesn't eat it what eat what
eat the baby down easy that's why even
in humans the baby always an initially
looks like the dad that seems weird
right hello that seems crazy the things
that you learn when dash sister-in-law
is pregnant and your brother is a crazy
person yeah research is everything haha
that is just crazy yeah Wow so don't eat
your baby so please don't eat whatever
you do all right I just I guess I won't
eat the baby I'm good okay Clara on the
same page of that um all right we it's
it we went a while you're right compute
and reading show we have more questions
let's get through me Kenneth o people
asking what are you not on Twitter
anymore I am on Twitter you can visit it
right now people say uh Undead yeah I
said um what's justins deal on Twitter
his feeds been dead since last year
they're tweeting four months three
months yeah you know why cuz who cares
that's why I mean it's an extension of
this social media thing that we've been
talking about lately I just wanted to
pull back for a while and take my a I
hear you I mean I'd stop posting on
Instagram all the time ago barely use
facebook anymore just want to experience
real life and video games yeah what
experience a real life with you again
separately all right don't worry more
eventually I mean it's just a matter of
seeing stuff that I think is worth
tweeting sure check back I'll be there
your and your
as you all as you ever have been no
that's bad l you don't like Twitter you
just don't have any I don't know you
know I really have that much to say yeah
that's in the same way yeah okay also I
don't want to give out free ideas
anymore yeah that's another thing too I
also feel like there's a guy for that
like whatever funny comment you think
you have it's already a guy yeah that
absolutely a dozen people that I said it
that's a funny way to think about it um
someone's asking if we have you guys
seen that movie Garden State horse in a
long time so park system says Jeff do
you hate the movie card and say it as
much as I do uh what are your favorite
movies based in New Jersey yeah I
despise garden state now because it
paints new jerz know it paints new
jersey new and a perfectly fine light
it's just a very bad movie and it's
boring and I hate zack fair enough uh
was it one of the best New Jersey movie
did he go to Kickstarter to do a garden
state too I believe so I do so yeah good
state to it was for some movie yeah
anyway I think it was some sort of
spiritual successor so yeah and then
finally because the computer crashed uh
what we do have a back up here somebody
apparently he says this is yeah I
already read it this is from driller he
says Peter your Pepsi tattoo was the
inspiration for my own and he has which
we can't see in something he has a the
Korean flag over attitude a nice big big
one okay what do you want what's your
favorite tattoo so far it's what he's
asking of your own of your own computer
hasn't beer as a bunch and then either
way late and they're all in very good
shape yeah you get them touched up ever
now no they all see where a lot of sun
block I was gonna say some block because
you are you i know you spend time in the
Sun I see photos of you in the Sun is
that an accurate statement oh no I mean
I ok like where where are you baby out
right now maybe I just maybe I just
think like everyone's in the Sun more
than I am so by default perhaps Joe
Smith spending a lot of time on that
beach section at photo um yeah it's
pretty hot so what's your favorite you
knew I probably no one yeah have a big
old Korean tiger yeah it's pretty funny
like having a lot of tattoos cuz the the
more tattoos you get you don't realize
how much more lotion you have to slather
oh yeah absolutely you must go through a
lot of lotion now especially during the
healing process for that thing true are
you taking care of yours yours look good
yeah yeah I take care boy get a pretty
dark dark you went away yeah i went to
the Cayman Islands and still haven't
recovered from that tan yet I've gotten
a few new tattoos to you guys can't see
him but um I guess that's kind of partly
what I've been doing as well just
getting tattooed just sitting in the
chair all of us Oh doing nice what's the
endgame for you I've done after this one
that's what everyone says but oh yeah
because I don't want to get my legs
tattooed I don't want to get him I have
a chest piece I mean you got a nice robe
was is the one that I want to get on my
chest unfortunately the design is not
like my my sleeves kind of come over
into my chest so the chest piece that I
wouldn't want to get a it's not gonna
look good because of this stuff and then
also part of it would have to come up
onto my neck on to my throat and I don't
want to do that you don't want to do
want to touch the Necker you're gonna
touch the neck yeah I don't think I want
it I don't want anything anywhere that I
can't cover up yeah which i think is the
good rule to stop that and I don't want
to get my back done only get my stomach
I think expensive hobby is he not oh
yeah but I can imagine how gratifying
that feeling would be once you know
you're done yes I'm just a courtly
yourself I did want to get the back of
my hand tattooed at one point fells like
I can't cover that up and I'm not
