reasonable price you get amazing
features like the like the silverware
basket but it's also got an express
cycle that clocks in at an hour and a
half so there's that but hey at least
the tines do this Wow how about that
here's the thing this dishwasher isn't
bad at cleaning honestly especially for
the price that's better than some models
that cost a couple hundred dollars more
it's just not as good as similarly
priced models from Kenmore and
Frigidaire that we recently reviewed so
you'll need to rinse your dishes before
you put them in this LG it doesn't miss
many spots but it doesn't handle bulk
well that's not as damning as it sounds
it just doesn't do well enough to score
any points as far as performance is
concerned and no it doesn't make up any
points on features either it has an okay
mix of cycles but all of them are really
slow and everything else about it is
pretty run-of-the-mill
it's pretty quiet it's easy enough to
use and it looks fine nothing about this
LG dishwasher is offensive or bad but
we've recently reviewed a number of
really good options at this same $700
price and this LG dishwasher doesn't
have anything that would help me
recommend it over those it's fine but
you can do better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
