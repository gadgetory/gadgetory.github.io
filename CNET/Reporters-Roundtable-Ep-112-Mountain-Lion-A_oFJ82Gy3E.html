roundtable I am Rafe Needleman and San
Francisco's our weekly show where we
talk about a single tech topic each time
and today we are talking about the Mac
operating system OS 10 or oh 6 as
everybody calls it is that right
everybody calls it x yeah it's not no
it's OS 10 and the next one's going to
be called mountain lion it's time for
our yearly look at the Macintosh desktop
laptop operating system a evolution now
the operating system battle is evolving
in really interesting way so I thought
it'd be time for us to get back in and
look at this smartphone operating system
design is really influencing the desktop
laptop operating system the cloud is
becoming an integral part of a localized
operating system strategy and to talk
about that I can think of no two better
people on the guests I have today first
of all our own intrepid apple reporter
josh lowensohn who is joining us here
Josh thanks coming in yeah good and uh
Brian Chen from the New York Times
formerly of wired and author of always
on how the iphone unlocked the anything
anytime anywhere future and locked us in
hey thanks for having me here thanks for
joining us Brian it's good to see you
again Brian was on the show back in 2010
we were talking about the app store when
that was a newer thing and he's got some
great stories on the times of course you
guys should all check out uh now before
I get started on the show Oh mountain
lion was announced just a week in a day
ago officially and people knew it was
coming but we just had the shareholders
meeting and I don't want to get too much
into that but because we have a whole
newsroom out there and Brian I think you
are aware of what was going on there
Josh you were actually there anything
important come out of the Apple
shareholders meeting I mean the most
interesting part of those meetings
obviously is the Q&amp;amp;A session and that's
when shareholders just basically get to
get up and ask tim cook and whoever else
is there any sort of questions they want
and so this year you know some of the
big questions or are you doing a TV
which of course they didn't talk about
you know when's when's the next device
coming out can't talk about that but
they did say some interest
stuff about Facebook you know there have
been questions lately about why Twitter
over something like Facebook which is
you know monumentally larger and used by
more people and and Tim Cook's answer
that was you know what we like Facebook
and we do kind of plan on doing more
things with them hmm so it's kind of
cryptic interesting brian anything you
take away from it the shareholders
meetings are usually just the
shareholders saying oh you guys have so
much money what are you gonna do all
this money an apple says well we can't
tell you what we're gonna do with the
money but it's gonna blow your mind this
year that's what they said blow your
mind and so that that's pretty much how
I would summarize how shareholders
meeting GG are for Apple at least for
the past few years does apples pay
dividends no they don't and that was one
of the big things that people were
wondering about because now they have
you know a hundred billion dollars in
cash right well it's not I mean they
have a big chunk of cash it in terms of
like long term securities that makes up
you know kind of a big chunk of that but
yeah it's a lot of money it's enough
money the point where you can buy you
know a lot of big companies and make a
lot of acquisitions and in fact after
the shareholder shareholders meeting
last night there was news that broke out
that they had actually acquired chomp
which is like a App Store search tool
for Android and iOS yeah oh that's right
that chomp I covered them a really
really interesting app recommendation
engine a while ago called crosswalk yeah
I have to call them and one they must be
like dang shouldn't yeah all right let's
get into the operating system news which
we're here to talk about today it's
called mountain lion it's like a lioness
it's like leopard and snow leopard was
leopard s I mean that's a good way to
think about it's basically just kind of
a few you know new things tapped on to
something that you already kind of know
it's not the major ground making changes
now first of all when is mountain lion
going to arrive for real people not to
be in summer they haven't said how much
it cost yet but it's gonna be coming out
in summer which is just one year after
lion came out now line was a pretty
major upgrade and that was how much was
that for end-users 39 bucks just thirty
dollars and that was like when they
started distributing it through the app
store instead of a set of disks and it
sold really well I mean thirty dollars
is
is a pretty remarkable price for an
operating system motive imagine they're
going to continue selling it for that
price if they continue using the app
store to distribute it I want to talk
about the economics of this briefly
thirty dollars for a major operating
system if you're at all used to the
Microsoft way of doing business where
Microsoft makes all its money from
software thirty dollars is nothing
compared to go ahead Brian hey I think
this goes along with apples business
model right so they use software so that
they can sell hardware for the most part
they don't even need to make a lot of
money on the software so long as you're
buying a whole bunch of iphones or macs
and so on it benefits them to keep the
price of the software low because they
want to sell whole bunch of hardware now
lion the current operating system the
current version of OS 10 is quite good
why does Apple need to do I mean they've
accelerated the pace of their updates it
used to be I think a leopard and snow
leopard or on two year cycle on two year
cycle then you got lion and now Mountain
language on a one year cycle Josh why
have they accelerated the pace of the
major operating system updates I think
it's it needs to keep pace with iOS and
devices like the iPhone the iPad people
are kind of really accustomed to it
yearly annual update that makes major
changes in the case of iOS 5 which they
released in october they kind of a lot
of these things that were a part of that
the main kind of apps and features those
who come over to Mac os10 now with
mountain lion and it's kind of it's an
understanding that people do things
people expect to be able to use some of
the same things they have on their phone
on their Mac because they're corollaries
they're such as reminders and notes
those are some of the big features that
have come over you know one would think
that you know it's difficult enough to
make a major update to an operating
system no matter the platform whether
it's a smartphone tablet or a real
computer one would think that trying to
get these two operating systems in sync
in some kind of feature or operational
sink if not code sync would actually
slow things down because they're
separate projects how is Apple able to
start accelerating the pace of updates
when actually it seems like the work
they're doing is getting much more
complex
I think yeah go forward bring it they
have so much money and they can just
keep investing in the engineers to do
this stuff they don't need to pull back
any punches anymore and you can see with
the yearly annual release of mountain
lion or I mean OS 10 upgrades they're
going to keep going forward with that
mm-hmm you also have a big difference
from companies like Microsoft or they're
just a ton of divisions kind of working
on these things and then try and pull
little bits from each division try and
work together it takes longer to do that
whereas with Apple you have kind of a
core team of people who are working in
this and then there also I mean in the
case of iOS they actually pulled some
people over Mac so those two teams are
kind of very closely related when it
comes to the engineering backgrounds and
and the overall goal of going in one
direction yeah one of the things we
learned from the Steve Jobs book was
that you know the that Steve Jobs was a
fairly despotic ruler of Apple and he
hated the idea of divisions which is a
corporate concept of you gotta kind of
part of the company suing this part of
companies doing that were there were no
divisions he hated the words like it's
the device of us that's exactly the
wrong idea is Apple still as unified
under new leadership as it was under
jobs i mean the products we're seeing
now are still still have you know jobs
on them right it can't go on the way it
was then i mean it's hard to tell since
they're so secretive but considering
that mountain lion is it's getting more
and more like iOS i would say that yes I
mean it seems like they're getting
pretty unified mountain lions getting a
lot of the features that we already saw
on the iPad in the iphone mm-hmm I think
at least you know if you've if you read
a animal in skis book inside apple
recently I mean I think he makes the
case that that they just kind of they
march in a unifying order from the top
and a lot of that direction comes from
just a very core group and then kind of
trickles down but the people actually
working in the products don't have as
much of an idea of what's happening so
it's a foxconn and it's lightly but I
mean you kind of get this this overall
sense that they all work in these big
projects but you know the strategy
behind them is is very kind of connected
together it's less like
you know this company is working on zune
this one's working on windows right how
can we get those two to work it's like
these two are being developed at the
same time so speaking of working
together and speaking of the unification
of all these products and we started
talking I think two years ago about we
have this crazy idea a lot of people did
at the same time OS 10 and iOS will
merge and eventually and iOS will win
that was the idea because it's such a
successful operating system and the user
interface was so nice and so
revolutionary that eventually our
macbooks and our imax will start to look
like giant ipads are they going to merge
what do we predict about the the link
between OS 10 and iOS Brian well you
know I was thinking about this i thought
you know would it be kind of cool if i
could take my ipad i could dock it to a
keyboard and it turned into OS 10 i can
start using a mouse and just use it like
a regular pc but then i thought about it
more and i thought that why would they
need to make max anymore and still max i
think it's beneficial for them to keep
the two products separate and tweak the
operating system based on like the
context of what you do with the device
like with with OS 10 you still have a
mouse pointer you still have a keyboard
and with iOS you just have this big
screen of different apps that you watch
so i think it's hard to tell of course
what they're going to be doing in five
to ten years I mean they very well might
unify the products at some point but it
would seem from a business standpoint it
would be better if they kept them
separate I also think there's something
really interested me said it to add to
the points about the input if you've
ever used a simulator with Xcode which
is Apple's kind of developer tool and
they have simulators for iphone and ipad
we can test out your apps if you've ever
actually used a touch application with
one of these simulators where you get to
use your mouse and keyboard it just
feels weird and there's there's this
huge divide of actually if you were to
bring some of those apps that you used
to on your iPhone or your iPad over your
computer what that would actually feel
like in a lot of cases I don't think it
would work out it's interesting because
I think Microsoft is fighting that exact
battle right now with windows 8 and
windows phone whatever it is that
they're they're really beginning to
bring the experiences together
people are already complaining about
Windows 8 saying it's great with touch
but it just kind of feels weird with the
mouse and keyboard and I find it curious
unlike you guys comments on this that
Apple the great company of unification
of a single vision actually has two
operating systems and it seems to be
maintaining two completely separate code
bases and user interaction models even
though there are some things that make
them look and feel related but they're
clearly siblings not clones while
Microsoft seems to be moving in the
opposite direction of bringing
everything together I mean it seems like
a kind of evolutionary paradox that
we're witnessing right yeah and what do
you think about that do you think that's
going to be a good idea because I think
we already saw some products where they
tried to put two into one we've seen
convertible tablets where you rotate the
screen and then you can you can touch it
and then you rotate it back and it's
it's a keyboard again but the operating
system for a convertible tablet is still
a desktop operating system that you
traditionally want to control the
keyboard and mouse so when you try those
things they'll they always feel kind of
funky John and I forgot who said it but
there was this great kind of comment
about when you're using Windows 8 and
you're in the Metro interface which is
their kind of big touch thing with icons
and tiles and its really lively you know
based off the phones and then suddenly
you get popped up to the Windows desktop
and it's like you're you're drunk grant
drunk uncle come lick stumbles in the
room why is this here I still think
there's like a huge shift there and the
problem for developers in that case is
they really have to kind of design apps
for these two kind of different
interfaces mmm with the same binary is I
mean it's crazy its ambitious but it's
crazy I don't know so we'll do you think
Josh we're going to see these OSS emerge
I mean at some level the at the core on
the app and the Apple side there there
is some code similarity between iOS and
OS 10 but I mean one app won't run on
both platforms so they diverge pretty
quickly off the floor of the code right
yeah I mean I think it still all comes
down to input they if it ever were to
kind of have this this life where you
could have an iOS app on your computer
yeah you really need to get past the
interface hurdle first and right now the
trackpad is great but it's not it's
still missing that touching
penis it's interesting that you're right
i mean you just said something i think
that's really key it all comes down to
input it doesn't come down to processing
power which i think is very interesting
i mean the mobile devices are becoming a
powerful enough to run real OS is the
problem is the input and especially and
this is what i want to get into next
with the cloud processing power is
becoming less and less of an issue for
OS design because so much of the key
stuff like siri for example is being
done at in cupertino or at apple server
somewhere else and brian how important
is the cloud to mountain line into the
apple desktop OS it seems like it's
becoming increasingly important for
Apple to focus on the cloud and you can
see that there they just said that they
were planning to open a new data center
was it in Kansas I forgot anyway organ
Oregon right and the thing that the
cloud does for Apple is it allows Apple
to tie all the products together but
you're sharing the data between all
these connected screens these connected
devices and it makes more sense for you
as a customer to keep buying apple
products because the cloud ties
everything so seamlessly together like
you know i can i can edit a document on
my mac and that same edit shows up on
the iphone version of the document
editor it makes a lot more sense to buy
a mac if you have an iphone vs say a
windows computer Josh no I think the
clouds a huge part the the one thing
that doesn't kind of trickle down to
those devices there was talk a while ago
of Apple possibly doing a storage free
iPhone where everything's based off of
iCloud this is before anyone knew what I
cloud even was another way but the whole
idea was that everything would be stored
in the cloud into a degree they've
already kind of done parts of that for
instance if you have iTunes Match you
don't really need to keep any music on
your phone anymore you just kind of
download what you need when you need it
that's kind of cool and they've kind of
taken that same stance of documents it's
actually I google has actually done that
successfully with Android I mean when
you pull up an android phone you plug it
into your Google account and everything
if you're if you live in the Google
ecosystem everything you've done is
there the set is is really miniscule
which which is another approach by the
way to the whole operating system battle
which is I mean if Microsoft was in a
Cell in operating syst
windows 8 upgrade is going to be a
hundred thirty-nine bucks or 59 bucks or
it's going to be a lot it's going to be
a pain because when you upgrade your
operating system every four years yeah
that's a big upgrade yeah I OS 10 is now
moving to yearly it appears google is
just kind of updated all the time as
free that's a different model entirely
how does that work and can that becoming
an important operating system I'm not
talking about smartphones now I'm
talking about desktops in Chromebook and
and that operating system concept you
see a lot of Chromebooks around now
ideally I'd are we going with that yeah
yeah I see when I fly virgin that's
right when they hand them out all right
moving on what's missing from I don't
want to ask that question yeah I'm sorry
there's one other important topic with
OS 10 that I think is real interesting
and we began to see this a version or
two ago the the app store with apple
making their desktop operating system
work the same way or at least optionally
work the same way as iOS did where you
have an app store and you can now get
your apps directly from within the
interface and not have to leave it and
not have to deal with installers and the
apps go with you no matter which
installation of the product you're of
your desktop or laptop that you're on
how important is the App Store to OS 10
to mountain loin and are we going to see
an app store only version of OS 10 I
think on the surface the App Store is
pretty important for OS 10 in terms of
security there's that option so you can
switch it so you can only download apps
for the App Store versus like the
internet and or through a web browser I
mean and it sounds kind of draconian but
you can always turn that option off and
the whole option is there just for
people who are a little bit less
sophisticated with computers so they
don't need to worry about viruses hey
every time I see Apple do something
where there's an option to turn off some
brand new feature i know that it's only
a version or two away from taking that
option away from us seriously do you
think it's going to happen um I think
they've already gone too far with
keeping the Mac a relatively open system
in terms of being able to to download
applications from different avenues I
don't think they could just
do a complete 180 I think that would be
pretty unattractive for a lot of
customers what do you think yeah i'm
wondering i think from a legal level I'd
I think they have to well I'm not sure
cuz on mobile they've offered it like
that but that's because they're been all
these deals with carriers where it's
been at a security issue with this it's
there's this basic paradigm of computers
where you want to install what you want
to install and you need to install what
you want to install but they proven with
devices like the iPad the iphone people
are kind of okay with convenience
they'll pay for that right the problem
is when you get apps it can't conform to
the App Store rules and therefore they
can't be on the App Store what happens
in that future you don't have apps like
you know VLC before it got pulled which
is this hugely useful mac app and that
wasn't on there because that licensing
issues that's what I'm getting at is is
I I mean I think people like the app
store when I look at a new app that I'm
thinking about buying and it's not in
the app store it's like oh god I got to
deal with the installer and if it's a
paid app I've gotta pay through some
other way the App Store is super
convenient and super great because your
apps are archived for you no matter
where you what machine you're on you
want to move to I'm wondering how far
Apple can go there and also how this
whole concept of the of the the App
Store and the frequent updates works in
one of the major buyers of technology
which is the corporation is OS 10 is
mountain-lion more or less corporate
friendly than previous versions have
been and how important is that well I
think with gatekeeper it is corporate
friendly especially if you have
companies that are kind of putting out
versions of apps or deploying them
through the app store through things
like codes and through imaging I think
the issue more so is actually lagging
companies that will wait for certain
time periods to upgrade OS is suddenly
if it's a one year cycle and you
actually have some critical kind of apps
that need that and you want to use that
for your business that kind of runs into
a problem I don't think that's going to
happen with mountain lion do you think
that corporate corporations will upgrade
line to mountain lion or will we have a
legion of corporate Mac users running a
version or so behind because their IT
department are like we just upgraded
yeah
I think that's a problem but at the same
time you also like we were talking about
earlier it's all about selling Hardware
and for a lot of these these folks who
just bought it it's I don't think thirty
dollars if that's what it's gonna be is
a huge deal Brian yeah as for a lot I
mean if even if you just look at lion
right now I mean I've talked to a bunch
of IT people who just don't want to
support lion because they're it's still
really buggy I think there are problems
with the mail app breaks for instance
and I would hope that Apple fixes these
problems before they switched to
mountain lion or I mean before mountain
lion comes out so I'm a little bit
pessimistic about the corporate support
for mountain lion miss my gut says that
I don't know I I think you're probably
right I also imagine a bunch of IT guys
and I could be wrong on this who are
looking at all these updates and saying
job security for us a lot of stuff we
have to deal with because you know that
individuals are going to be bringing
their mountain lion equipped max into
the office and using them there no
matter what their supplied with so I
don't know anyway uh we talked about
this briefly at the top of the show
about Apple's integration of other
services now there are existing
Macintosh apps I think GarageBand the
movie app what i called imovie and
iphoto that are integrated to an extent
with facebook and one of the things that
they were showing with mountain lion was
deep integration in parts of it with
Twitter so which is it going to be and
can it be both well I think if you look
at where Facebook is on OS 10 right now
it's it's basically everywhere you want
to be most people are going to do almost
everything the browser so it's not I
don't see that as being like a huge big
pole the two areas where it really is
that it needs to be is with media and so
if you just cut a video in iMovie or a
quicktime player you can send it to
facebook if you just took a bunch of
photos and edited them and you want to
put them up on facebook there's
integration there the bigger thing now
is Twitter with mountain lion because
then you can just take any pager on any
sort of photos on your desktop whatever
it is and share it hmm so imagine sorry
go ahead no please I would imagine that
Apple's just cozying up with Twitter
because it
had tried to form a relationship with
Facebook in the past like with iTunes
ping and Facebook had wanted some pretty
onerous terms or so to speak that's what
they told kara swisher at some point or
that's what Steve Jobs told Kara Swisher
and I I would imagine that they might be
more willing to work with Facebook if
they kind of loosen those terms I'm we
don't know what those terms are but I'm
sure they wanted a lot of customer
information I can just see Zuckerberg
and jobs or Zuckerberg and cook getting
into it's like but these two juggernauts
of Technology arguing terms that would
just that would be epic an apple is the
most secret corporation on the planet so
I think it's it's hard for them to
understand what social networking
companies need in terms of customer
information interesting so what's
missing from mountain lion as far as we
know that we sirree there's no sirree
not really not that that should be may
be too surprising because they gotta
sell some phones and right now that's
the big feature well come on people can
we walk around with their computers
using them as phones I mean it wouldn't
a theory wouldn't I'm serious all
cloud-based so it's not like the
technology won't work them on that oh
esta I mean part of that is hey it fits
and it doesn't there's these new apps it
came from iOS 5 and you can use Siri
with them and in on your phone and it's
great like reminders and notes all that
stuff is that's a great use for voice
technology and I think the actual core
need for series that sometimes just a
pain in the butt to get around your
phone like you want unlock it you don't
wanna find the app you don't enter the
data it can do that for you on the Mac
or if you have a bunch of apps running
you just kind of you go an exposé pick
the app you want and do your thing with
a keyboard mouse it doesn't take very
long um that said there would be some
cool applications for Syria on your
computer and you know people can dream
of those all day but maybe Apple is who
knows right um I can't really think of
too much that that's really missing but
you Siri Siri is one feature i mean the
mac operating system i think they can
just keep rolling out incremental
additions because we already do so much
on our desktops in a browser and just
the App Store is you know the avenue for
you to get additional applications to
enhance
is what you do on a computer but yeah I
think we can expect to see some pretty
incremental updates for the Mac
operating system the next few years well
watch the next one not Siamese when then
when do we expect if you think we're on
a yearly cycle now and and are we going
to be eventually just paying Apple 30
bucks a year just saying update me
whenever you think that's coming I think
her to be buy a new computer every two
years I'm not worrying about it and then
paying them thirty dollars in between
yes yeah Brian what do you think are we
have another one coming a year after
mountain lion I think they have
explicitly said that they were on an
annual cycle I always said that's what
they told John Gruber I think during
that briefing yeah so assuming they keep
on making boatloads of money which I'm
sure they will over the next few years
they probably will keep on continuing
that cycle and asking for thirty dollars
a year sure not that much to pay
actually and I think another big part of
that is it you do need something to make
the mac more exciting because it's still
a computer and they were selling a lot
more of them than they used to but it's
nothing close to what they're selling an
iOS and a big part of that is that you
get these new features every year mm-hm
and if they can somehow add that on top
of things like more RAM and faster
processing speeds I mean that's that's
cool too that's a good business model
it's worked really well for them on the
portable side what can they do next I
mean the air and OS 10 you know a couple
of additional features the mountain lion
I mean how do you make a that's a I
don't want to sound like a fanboy so
forgive me but this is a pretty damn
sexy product where do you go from here
flexible displays that's a good one okay
keep going just roll up the screen and
put it in your your jeans and take your
computer with you everywhere you go I
think that'd be kind of cool like going
beyond the tablet I've always thought of
