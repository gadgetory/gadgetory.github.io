different design look coming to the US
and judging by this guy I'd say they're
not lying they call this the ambassador
for their new style this is the cross
coupe GTE it's a crossover vehicle as
you can see but that's a different look
for Volkswagen it's a hybrid with hybrid
power at the front wheels an electric
motor handling the rear wheels to give
you this hybridized all-wheel drive you
can get 355 horsepower combined out of
the powertrain but also 70 mpg/eso
trying to pull it both ways and there's
a GTE mode that puts all the motors
together full tilt at once for super
performance and you'll do that for about
20 miles before you've depleted battery
and go back into a lesser mode by the
way the only is this vehicle a hybrid
it's a plug-in hybrid as you can see but
it's a plug-in in a different sense you
can also plug in appliances like your
shaver that's a European outlet but you
can also imagine an American three-prong
in their VW says that's what it's for
now inside we're seeing clearly a
concept car cabin but notice some of the
cues that Volkswagens moving toward
generally an all LCD instrument panel a
very large main LCD touch panel here
they usually haven't done these will but
they're trying to make catch up quickly
and then down here an LCD touch panel we
saw a similar arrangement on the Golf R
touch at CES just a few days ago
they're also envisioning this gesture
control system where your hand will
approach the system put you into gesture
mode and you can do some simple flicks
and wipes and presses simple stuff not
getting into detailed gestures
