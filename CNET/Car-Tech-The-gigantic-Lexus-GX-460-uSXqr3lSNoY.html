this other big boxy spindle grilled SUV
it looks a lot like the LX that's
because it slots right beneath it
offering both just a little bit less
off-road capability but still really
good levels of luxury and it still
strikes an imposing figure in a parking
lot
let's hop behind the wheel of this 2014
model and check the tech now here in the
engine room you're going to find a 4.6
liter v8 engine that's worthy GX 460
gets its name from four 64.6 you're
looking at about 301 horsepower 329
pound-feet of torque we're looking at
about 15 miles per gallon city 20 miles
per gallon highway and 17 combined now
this engine strongest suit is that it is
kind of dead simple and dead reliable
which is kind of what you want from a
big SUV and it's going to be paired with
a 6-speed automatic transmission that's
going to have a sport mode that you're
probably never going to use in this
vehicle and it also has a manual shift
mode that could come in handy for
passing every now and then now what we
have here is the Lexus gx460 luxury it
is the step-up trim level from the base
so we've got a couple of nice amenities
like nicer leather seats that have
heated and cooled surfaces right here in
the center of the dashboard we have
Lexus IS 8-inch informed system at this
luxury trim level we get navigation
built in the navigation is pretty
rudimentary you get 3d sort of like
bird's-eye view maps but the graphics
aren't the smoothest that we've seen in
Toyota or even a Lexus vehicle but it
will get you from point A to point B and
it does have voice control which is
pretty good we've also got the inform
app system built into this and what that
will allow you to do is pair your phone
via bluetooth and run an app on your
phone that's going to give the Lexus a
connection to the internet and access to
a handful of apps for example you'll be
able to stream music from I Heart Radio
or Pandora you'll be able to access the
Facebook Places on your Facebook account
so if
you've RSVP to a party the address will
show up right here in the Facebook app
other apps that you have access to are
things like movie tickets calm or open
table so you can make reservations and
actually find something to do tonight
before you hit the road now if we look a
little bit lower down on the center
console here this vehicle is equipped
with a full-time four-wheel drive system
and you've got the controls here you'll
be able to switch between your four
wheel drive high in four-wheel drive low
mode that's going to be able to drop you
down to a sort of low speed high torque
setting for when you need to tow
something or kind of climb a really
steep hill and when it comes time to go
back down that hill you've got the DAC
mode right here that's downhill assist
control flipping this on is going to
activate a sort of brake based cruise
control for downhill it's going to help
you control your speed so that you can
focus on steering the vehicle while you
go down a really steep decline up above
that we've got the controls for the
adaptive suspension in this case you
have the option to switch between a
sport mode a comfort mode when you want
the ride to feel a little bit more
supple and then a normal mode and right
next to it we have the ride height
controls and what that'll allow you to
do is flip this switch and either lower
the vehicle a few centimetres or raise
the vehicle for those situations where
you want to go off-road and need a
little bit more ground clearance beneath
the vehicle now that we've got that bit
sorted let's take this thing off road
and see what it can really do now I'm
just kidding nobody actually off roads
in a 50 to $70,000 Lexus let's hit the
road and check the pack
powered ESCO adequate but the v8 engines
delivery is both a bit remote it seems
like there's lag between what's
happening was my foot on the pedal and
the actual power delivery that I get
about to see to my pants that end
Lexus's engineer seem to have gone out
of their way kind of isolate the driver
away from what's happening with a
fingertip feel in the steering wheel and
what's happening through the suspensions
now this is a big seven passenger luxury
SUV what we just tested the Lexus LX
which is another big 7 passenger luxury
SUV so you've got to kind of wonder if
flex is maybe putting these vehicles in
direct competition with one another on
paper it would seem that way but in
person the GX actually prints a lot
smaller now the LX is based on the Land
Cruiser the GX is based on the toyota
4runner that means has a base that gives
it some pretty good off-road bones but
what we have in front of us isn't a
whole lot of off-road controls we don't
have a lot of the different settings for
dirt and for rock crawling because
that's not what the point of this
vehicle is okay let's price this big box
of luxury on wheels
the GX 460 is going to start about
49,000 85 dollars for the base model but
this luxury model that's going to come
pretty well equipped with a lot of the
optional features as standard it's going
to be about 60 now we've also got an
optional mark levinson surround sound
system and a destination charge it's
going to bring us to our s tested price
of about sixty four thousand four
hundred sixty one bucks that's a pretty
good sweet spot for this vehicle but
there are a couple more options you can
add we've also got the optional driver
aid package and a rear seat
entertainment so it's really easy to
push the price of the thing up to about
seventy one thousand dollars find the
sweet spot somewhere in the middle and
you have a nice luxury cruiser
