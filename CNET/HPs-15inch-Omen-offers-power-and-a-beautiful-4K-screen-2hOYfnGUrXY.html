between worlds it's not as felt as a
razor blade nor is it as powerful as a
heftier rog or MSI laptop instead it
walks a line between those two options
the laptop can be configured to pack an
nvidia geforce 1060 GPU which gives it
enough graphical grunt to play almost
anything you throw at it
including VR games and while it's not
what I'd call ultra portable it's also
far from being a behemoth the 15-inch
German comes in many configurations
starting for around a thousand bucks the
model we reviewed will set you back
$1,700 and runs on an intel cabling i7
processor 16 gigabytes of ram and the
aforementioned 1060 graphics card with 6
gigabytes of video read the 1060 that HP
uses is one of the more efficient masks
you variations from Nvidia which are
designed to fit into smaller machines
the first such laptop with the max Q
branding was the rog Zephyrus but that's
a different beast to the omen the
Zephyrus is thinner and has the
considerably more powerful 1080 GPU it's
also about $1,000 more expensive so
don't dwell too much on that max q
branding HP last year issued the gaudy
look that characterizes most gaming
laptops instead opting for a more subtle
design for the omen range this year
that's all changed it's got a to turn
shell that's liven dark with carbon
fiber and the blood-red omen logo there
are also a lot of annuals going on but
that's not just for sure the frame
slopes inward under the ports so when
you grip the laptop it doesn't feel too
thick The Omen 15 does a lot of the
boring stuff right - its keyboard is
comfortable it's got decent speakers and
this trackpad is weighted actually
expected to be the one thing it doesn't
do well is survived without a power cord
thanks in large part to the 4k screen
which is gorgeous the battery gets eaten
up real quick in practical terms I
watched an hour of Netflix at full
brightness and sound and the battery
went from 100 to 30% there are more
powerful laptops out there some of which
are slimmer than the omen 15 but they're
all at least a couple hundred dollars
more expensive the omen strikes a good
balance is powerful and stylish but not
so powerful and stylish that has to cost
a fortune
