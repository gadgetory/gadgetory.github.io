importantly though for consumer expect
exceedingly high throughput than you see
today so throughput measured in tens of
gigabits per second very low latency
single-digit latency which means the
response time from your request to the
action you get from the network will be
much shorter than it is today and expect
the network that can handle the ability
to to accommodate multiple millions and
possibly billions of machinae Machine
connections so if you think you want to
take a practical example let's think
about the Game of Thrones catalog
so there's five seasons of Game of
Thrones roughly 10 10 episodes per
season probably around 500 megabits
megabytes of storage per show today
download that entire catalog probably
take well over an hour that's at roughly
50 megabits per second on LTE which you
see today quite a bit with 5g when you
start to measure tens of gigabits
throughput in that scenario you're
downloading that entire catalog in under
a minute when you look at the range of
opportunities that are created by
throughput measured in gigabits in a
wireless environment the opportunities
are almost limitless so we expect a lot
of innovation to occur once that network
foundation is set that will open up new
use cases and new customer scenarios
that we can't really even envision today
at some point in time absolutely you'll
need a 5g phone and that's part of the
evolution of wireless technology overall
as networks are built technologies
developed then the ecosystem as a whole
flourishes and you get 5g phones you get
5g devices you get 5g routers you'll see
Internet of Things connected devices
that rely on 5g as well what we're doing
at Verizon here is pushing that envelope
very very hard and we want to advance
that ecosystem rapidly we're doing field
technical trials right now locations all
around the country and we want to see
that brought to market over the next
couple years indoor coverage is a
function of solid design and 5g being no
different really any other technology is
when you want to cover an area you have
to have good silent engineering
principles to get RF to that location so
when you think of indoor coverage with
5g as the operators deploy 5g technology
at Verizon we deploy coverage for inside
buildings from the inside of the
building 5g will use some of those very
same principles and it also allow
coverage from outside to inside you know
can you develop broadband service at a
cost point that's incredibly efficient
both for the operator and the customer
and that's what we're trying to figure
out right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
