our guys are running around like crazy
backstage as you might imagine we
figured out why my demo crashed because
there are 570 Wi-Fi base stations
operating in this room okay we can't
deal with that so the choice is either
I've got more details that are really
great that I'd like to show so we either
turn off all the stuff and see the demos
or we give up and I don't show you the
devil's would you want you see these if
those are on let's turn on what you're

things to my leg

the floor and all you look around I'd
like you to police each other if you
want to see the demos shut all the
laptops turn off all these Wi-Fi base
stations and put them on the floor

and and with the Star Trek and
communicators and just dreaming about
