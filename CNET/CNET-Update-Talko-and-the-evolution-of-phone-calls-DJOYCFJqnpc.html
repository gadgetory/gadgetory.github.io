phone calls I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update you may not realize
it yet but the phone call is evolving
the way we make a call hasn't changed
that much over the years even with
smartphones you do it rings and then
there's the delicate dance of pick up
ignore and leave a message at the beep
but several text messaging apps that are
growing in popularity including the new
I message in Apple's iOS 8 let you
attach audio clips for short voice memos
so you can still have a conversation but
it doesn't need to be live there's a new
app that takes this concept to the next
level it's called taco it blurs the
lines between texting and a live
real-time phone call because you just
jump in and out of live calls while
sending clips and it's not just voice
you can text and send photos in the
middle of a call you can tag a call as
important or put in hashtags so you can
quickly look up a conversation later you
can also forward voice recordings to
other people which means you may want to
be careful about what you say the app is
free now but there will be a
subscription version I should warn you
to test it out with a close friend at
first because there are times you won't
realize that you're in a phone call and
the other person is just listening to
you breathe it's kind of confusing but
if you're up for the challenge you can
find out apple's app store now and it'll
come to Android and the web in a few
months as I just mentioned voice clips
can be sent in I message with iOS 8
about half of Apple's mobile devices now
have upgraded to that new operating
system Apple estimates about forty six
percent of iphone ipad and ipod touch
owners have iOS 8 with forty-nine
percent still on iOS 7 if you didn't
update yet you may want to hold off into
another update comes out with bug fixes
every time Apple jumps to a new
operating system there are performance
complaints and this time is no different
some users report poor battery life
buggy Wi-Fi connections and strange
crashes and freezes with the keyboard
notifications and the Safari web browser
last year Apple pushed out several bug
fix updates days after the new operating
system went live
and in the world of gadgets there's a
new action camera from Polaroid that's
trying to jump in on the trend of
recording life from different
perspectives the polaroid cube is one
hundred dollars and it captures 1080p HD
video the only mount is a built-in
magnet and there's no memory card for
storage video is split into five minute
clips and the battery lasts for about 90
minutes it's not good for capturing
extreme action like a GoPro but this is
more for casual use just like how
Polaroid cameras spit out simple instant
photos the cube chops up bits of video
in a similar informal approach that's
