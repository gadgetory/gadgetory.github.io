highlights from the 2011 Frankfurt Auto
Show how to make your own iPad stylus
Dyson's new gadget is full of hot air
and step away from this blu-ray player
it's all coming up right now
hi everyone i'm brian tong and welcome
to the CNET tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer our own unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start off with the good moly
maybe on vacation right now but Brian
Cooley has been hard at work sending
back reports from the Frankfurt Auto
Show here's a look at some of the
highlights including a new concept from
Land Rover and a Mercedes that works
with your iPad what's ironic that Land
Rovers defender isn't sold in the US
these days because it doesn't need us
crash standards kind of strange for a
vehicle that's always been so tough and
rugged it's like a little vault on
wheels they're ready to bring it back
this is one of the DC 100 concepts the
idea here is to bring this forward in
two different ways one's kind of sporty
Cabriolet like the other one more
traditional defender like this among the
high-tech features I'm looking at one
right here supposedly self-cleaning
paint I want to see that work after you
go through a big old muddy gully full of
rocks right now technologies in the
front of the car that look forward are
interesting they have two things once
called terrain I get it terrain it's a
scanning technology that builds a 3d
virtual map of what the terrain is in
front of you and the car can say you
know what you're coming up on a lump or
a gully that I can't deal with why don't
you go this way or that way and there's
one called Wade a to technology that
will figure out how deep the water is
you think you're about to forward
without clunking the car and tell you if
you can actually do that they say the
car can get through 750 millimetres of
depth that's what that's about
six and a half long cigarettes whatever
that comes out to what is that about a
yard here's one right out of
double-oh-seven there's apparently a
button inside the car they envisioned as
extending the spikes on the tires I mean
they're not spikes to kill people but
just to get some grip inside all kinds
of interesting technology check out this
pop-up display we've seen this in cars
even in production right now but if this
goes into production this would actually
snap
about it's like a tablet you carry with
you to do navigation on foot to continue
your journey after you run to something
you can't drive over anymore 8-speed
automatic transmission right here part
of an efficiency message I don't want to
put any big old horse ev8 3m v6 in these
cars anymore they're talking about
2-liter hybrid motors or even plug-in
hybrids and the drive line on this
vehicle would physically disconnect when
you're not using all-wheel drive to
further cut losses no place to put a key
on this car that I see and even went to
production there wouldn't be because
they envisioned an RFID adventure key
which would obviously be a lot better to
have in your pocket when you're out in
the mud and the wet then one of those
actual physical electronic keys now this
is a vision for maybe 2015 it's not
going to be in your Land Rover showroom
anytime soon but it does bring back the
defender brand which they love to have
on the showroom floor in the US as well
as around the world
well if your Volkswagen you don't just
lay there like a dumbass and let Fiat
get all the headlines with the 500 you
answer it with this the Volkswagen up
now this is a car it's in roughly the
same class size wise it's below a golf
by a significant margin in terms of
overall footprint as well as in price
we'll get to that in a minute
now right now it's only slotted for
European introduction but you can just
about bank on it come into the US sooner
than later now under the hood here
you've got a pretty scrawny three
cylinder one liter engine not sure that
would come to the US one and if this car
ever does they might up rate that for
the American market get it close to 100
horsepower right now it's a sixty or a
seventy five horsepower mill give or
take
with really good efficiency really clean
low emissions this car will come stock
with a city collision technology one
that will look forward with ultrasonic
or radar whatever they use to keep the
car from rear-ending someone at low
speeds that's usually the kind of
technology that was only reserved for
much more expensive cars wherever they
came from but now we're seeing a lot of
the small cars offer that as a
differentiator okay so here I am six two
plus in this little guy and as is always
the paradox with little cars there's
some of the roomiest inside because they
have very thin door panels not a lot of
filigree and built up consoles that make
a car seem tight this car is entirely
spacious for everyday driving it's not
something going to take on a 3,000 mile
trip and lay back in very simple
instrument panel you've got what do we
got here a little tiny tack on the left
that's interesting fuel gauge on the
right big speedometer finally that makes
some sense too many cars are giving too
much real estate to tachometers I love
gauges as much as anybody but you know
what the tach it's time for it to go it
doesn't make a lot of sense anymore
often you'll find color-keyed dash
panels here that go with the car body
that's very Fiat 500 not saying they
copied them but that's kind of the style
right now here's the most interesting
thing Navigon makes a snap off portable
infotainment unit I'm pretty sure it
won't snap off here oh look at well what
trusting people our Volkswagen friends
are and here are your choices
information about the car again because
it's connected to the cars data bus when
you dock it you can't do that with a
standalone pnd here's your media player
pictures CD player control because this
again connects to your optical disk and
car radio control against something your
stand alone won't do your Bluetooth
phone controls and Technology are in
here and of course your navigation and
map all that in a nice slim unit that is
actually a portable electronic sort of a
bidding you get when you buy this car
we're starting to see a lot of carmakers
go this way now the pre-orders begin
shortly in Europe for this car in
Germany in particular and by top of 2012
these are going to be out but again in
the European market where they're
pricing it at below 10000 euros I've
been in this business too long to say oh
just convert that to dollars it never
works that way currency conversion aside
but it's a cheap little car it's
bringing up the bottom of the VW line
and it's going to answer one big
question why don't they bring the Polo
to the US which slots down below the
golf they're going to do this one
instead that's a big old going door
isn't it this is one of the bells of the
ball here at Frankfurt 2011 the mirsini
is f1 25 concept by the way the end of
the name has an exclamation mark on it
and for pretty good reason there's an
awful lot of tech going on here first of
all the powertrain is an electric motor
out at each wheel one on each corner
that's not too exotic totals of 313
horsepower but the torque of course
would be right now but it's a hydrogen
fuel cell car so you can go a thousand
kilometers what's at 600 and something
miles on a belly of hydrogen except it
wouldn't be a belly of hydrogen it would
be a body of hydrogen you see they're
going to store the hydrogen compressed
in cavities around the body and I think
I've heard of that before in any of the
various hydrogen concepts that are out
there now let's talk about some of the
technology that's more consumer
electronics you see these doors as they
go up and down those are gesture control
so you walk up to the door and just go
huh
the door goes up and then the door goes
down you've also got gesture control on
that nice big display for the passenger
if they want to go to the next track on
a DVD or a CD they just do this kind of
thing menu all this sort of thing is
very much like Kinect for
example the display to the right of the
driver in the central tunnel it's a
curved display totally unfocused done by
some interesting new rear projection
with a sort of an arc algorithm to make
sure that all stays in focus from one
projector beam that's amazing and then
look at that display in front of the
driver that's actually 3d you can't see
that in our 2d stream of course now
what's behind all those systems one of
the most interesting things to me is a
hundred percent Internet streamed
infotainment so anything from the media
to the weather to the news all these
sources coming in they're thinking 100%
streaming at this point let me show you
interesting way to configure it so what
Mercedes says is as cars get so complex
and so rich with their infotainment and
settings and configurability you need a
way to do all that when you're not just
sitting in the car that's one place but
other times you've got more time to sit
down and think how do I want to set my
car up not sitting here in the driveway
like some dork so they give you this
very rich app that they've envisioned
for the f1 25 let's just go to one part
of this the entertainment block here I
have a whole variety of sources
information and entertainment news
weather music the music for example I
can take and drag down to this timeline
which roughly maps to my route in
navigation so these things are going to
happen in order of the trip what's in
the music this is all Napster powered
right now they could have any number of
partners though and this is again part
of that all streaming entertainment
system here are playlists I've over here
here are Napster channels and again you
can imagine anybody being in here this
could be also Pandora it could be
Spotify anyone is software is software
this stuff gets really interesting as
you start to go to that level I can
bring a weather report down here
whatever I want along my route or
directly access it in here and of course
there are many other settings and
configurability options in here to set
up a car that now has arguably maybe a
thousand different configurations no two
cars will be the same it's as they say
it's like a smart phone you can sit in
and no two smart phones are the same so
you start to see how we connect the dots
here and need a different interface oh
one more thing I want to show you if
it's a smart phone you can sit in I do
sit in it check out the rear seat lounge
that's like a corner group I'm gonna see
anything that cool since like a 68
Eldorado I'm in hopefully that iPad
control will trickle down into some more
accessible Mercedes models it looks like
the perfect way to design a road trip
playlist or maybe the folks of Mercedes
will expand their technology to other
tablet models if so they couldn't go
wrong with either the Galaxy Tab 10.1 or
Sony's tablet s but if you're trying to
pick which one to go with yourself
hopefully this week's prize fight will
help you decide what's up prize fight
fans i'm brian tong and we're bringing
you a nasty bloodbath between two duels
for tops and tinny tablets it's a prize
v punch-out with Samsung's Galaxy Tab
10.1 Wi-Fi versus Sony's tablet s now
our judges for this fight are senior at
McDonald tablet tinkerbell senior editor
Erik take it to the bank Franklin and
myself Brian Tom now we'll take all
three judges blind scores and adds them
outs in the nearest tenth each round the
final prize five score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system it's six rounds to the
finish round one is designed Samsung
brings the cookie-cutter tablet design
we're used to seeing it has an amazing
screen that pops and if you want one of
the thinnest tablets on the market
you'll be a happy camper here now Sony's
tablet s is a bold design that strays
from convention with its rolled back
magazine design and it works although we
wish it was thinner it's light easy to
hold and stands out from the crowd
Sony's tablet s takes round one with the
four and the galaxy 10.1 gets a 3.3 next
round as controls and user interface
Samsung brings the TouchWiz interface
here and it adds some cool new features
like a screen capture button directly
accessible on-screen a redesigned for
Android services and quick access to a
few utility apps but it's bright and
bubbly feel takes away from the elegance
and TouchWiz feels a little cartoonish
at times now Sony brings a few
customizations of their own on Android
with a favorites drop-down to quickly
access content you can customize moving
apps to the top for quick access creates
more space
and it brings a more sleep grown-up
design to Honeycomb Sony takes round two
with the four and Samsung gets a 3.3 so
after two rounds Sony leads by seven
tenths of a point round three is
features both tablets have front facing
and rear cameras but the Galaxy Tab is
so thin that there's not much room for
anything else there's additional
adapters for HDMI out and media cards
but it's screen is arguably its best
hardware feature the Sony Tablet S has a
thicker design and you'll get a full
size SD card slot and a USB port but its
killer feature is its built-in universal
remote functionality and it's DLNA
compatibility for media streaming Sony
takes another round with 3.7 and the tab
gets a 2.7 next round is web browsing
and multimedia Samsung's larger 10.1
inch screen really enhances the overall
web and multimedia experience and you'll
also have access to their media hubs for
music movies and TV shows plus its rear
camera is 8 megapixels and it takes
excellent quality images now Sony's 9.4
screen is still great it has a 5
megapixel rear camera and it brings
innovation to the web browser with its
quick new option for faster page
rendering it has a clever keyboard of
its own plus Sony's suite of media apps
for TV shows movies and music and gaming
with their PlayStation brand brings
content that will support the platform
so guess who takes around four yup it's
Sony again with the four and Samsung
gets a three point seven so for
averaging four rounds Sony still has a
solid lead next round is performance bow
tablets are snapping performers running
one gigahertz dual-core
ARM Cortex a9 processors and you won't
feel a speed advantage between one or
the other the Galaxy Tab brings its
vibrant screen and a battery life around
nine hours compared to Sony's solid
screen with about an eight hour battery
life the differences aren't huge here
but Samsung finally takes this round
with the four and Sony gets a 3.7 now we
have one round left and the final round
that decides it all is value
these two tablets start with 16 gig
models at $4.99 and we all think these
are sold devices but that price tag just
doesn't make sense in the current market
if they want to gain any traction
Samsung has proven their commitment to
the Android platform so you'll get
support from them Sony's the underdog
but their killer remote control feature
and PlayStation Sport shows they're more
serious to use their content muscle if
they want to keep this platform alive
$4.99 is still a hard pill to swallow
but Sony just gets the edge in value
with the 3.7 and Samsung gets at 3.3 so
let's average out all six rounds and
this was a battle where Sony just kept
getting the edge over Samsung in five of
the six rounds taking this prize fight
three point nine two three point four
and is your prize fight winner your
little surprise so are we but Sony's
innovations showed in its design
interface and unique features that is
bringing to the tablet war i'm brian tom
thanks for watching catch you guys next
time on another prize fight
like I said I was a little surprised to
see the tablet as take the wind but with
so many Android tablets out there Sony
clearly found some ways to distinguish
theirs from the rest of the pack next up
it's arts and crafts time here at the
tech review Donal Bell has a handy DIY
project for all you who would prefer a
way to control your iPad that's a little
more precise than just using this
touchscreens offer an awesome and simple
way to navigate and interact their
tablet or smartphone except when they
don't
when it comes to detailed control
something like drawing or writing it can
be really useful to have a pen but not
just any pen will work since it's not a
matter of pressure but an issue of
electric conduction you can buy a
compatible stylus for as little as $5
but what if you need something right now
well in this scene at how-to I'm going
to show you how to make a touchscreen
pen
that's essentially free assuming that
your boss will look the other way if you
raid the supply closet so here's what
you'll need you'll need a pen a paper
clip and a sponge now make sure that the
pen is one of those that you can pull
apart you also need three tools pliers
scissors and a drill first step pull the
pen apart and remove the ink cartridge
keep it around though you'll need it
later next slice a little rectangular
wedge off of the sponge you're going to
be squeezing a chunk of this through the
barrel of the pen so make sure it's
small enough to get in but thick enough
to stay put any sponge should do as long
as it has a little moisture in it and
you can always test it out by using it
directly on your screen next step drill
a hole into the pen barrel the hole
needs to be big enough for the paper
clip to get through now shove the sponge
through the barrel so that pokes out of
the tip then put the pen back together
and finally flatten out that paper clip
and poke one end of it into the hole
that you made just so that is jabbing
the sponge and then wrap the rest around
the barrel so long as your hand is in
contact with the metal it'll carry an
electric charge through the sponge and
to the screen now won't work of the
sponges completely dried out though but
a few drops of water should get you back
in business so there you go
Oh a DIY capacitive stylus you can use
with any tablet or smartphone it's not
pretty but the price is right it's easy
to customize and you can make one in
just a few minutes for cnet.com time too
although don't worry about a little bit
of moisture on your iPad screen just
don't soak your stylus
too much I know sounds weird alright
let's just go ahead and take a quick
break but stick around there's a lot
more tech review coming up right after
this
welcome back to the sina tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at Sina TV now
continuing on in the good if you find
that you're working with multiple
computers at any given time and it found
that using multiple keyboards and mice
is a big hassle today is your lucky day
here's rich brown to tell you why hi I'm
rich brown senior editor for CNET today
we're going to take a look at a new app
from Microsoft called Mouse Without
Borders so the idea behind mass Without
Borders is that it lets you use one
mouse and keyboard to control multiple
Windows PCs so we've downloaded the
software in the system over here and
it's really easy to set up we'll install
the app and it gets you this let's get
started screen it asks first if you've
installed Mouse without borders on other
systems so we're going to say no here
and that generates a security code and
the name of this computer which we then
plug in to another PC where we've also
installed the same program so we've
already installed Mouse without borders
on this other PC over here and you can
see the same startup screen but this
time we're going to say yes and it
brings us to a screen where we can enter
in the security code and the system name
from the other computer so we'll just
punch that in and then you can see the
systems are connected so we'll set up
both computers so you can see the
program that your control up to four
systems on the same network we're only
going to use two here for the sake of
simplicity but that said earlier we were
able to connect to Windows 7 pcs and a
Windows XP machine on the same network
and things worked flawlessly we had no
problems so take a look over here you
can see this option screen gives you a
few more settings to play around with
now with the default setting we can
simply drag the mouse cursor over to the
other display here you can see there's a
setting that lets you use a key tab of a
switch between systems the software also
lets you drag and drop screens here to
kind of help you make sense of the order
in which you're going to move the mouse
between systems so with the wireless
mouse you can see has no problem
tracking the cursor between the PCs so
the mouse works seamlessly pretty much
there's no noticeable input lag you can
right-click you can move windows around
you can launch applications it works
exactly as you would expect a mouse that
was connected to the system
now despite its name you can also use it
to type on the other PC now on top of
letting you control multiple pcs you can
also use mouse
Without Borders to drag-and-drop files
between computers see we've picked one
up we brought it to the other system so
as you can see the software is really
easy to use and works pretty much as you
expect
we also found it did some things we
didn't expect for example it recognizes
hardware volume keys on the keyboard to
control volume on the other PC now it
has some limitations brightness keys on
the keyboard won't change that display
over there for example we also had
problems with games the mouse sensitive
is just way too high and we couldn't
adjust it even using the in-game menu
overall though we can see plays
scenarios where mouse without borders
would be amazingly useful from education
scenarios in a dorm in a support
environment at home pretty much anywhere
you have multiple windows pcs that want
to talk to each other and one of the
other great parts about the software is
that it's freely available for download
from Microsoft so much Brown this has
been a quick demo of Microsoft's maps
without borders as cool as it is the
mouse without borders utility only works
with Windows so if you want to control
pcs running Windows and Mac's across
your network check out a program called
synergy a lot of our producers and
editors work with a Mac and a Windows PC
sitting side by side and it works great
and no synergy did not pay me to say
that all right now let's see what we can
find out in the bad do not buy this
blu-ray player was the headline but
Mathieu Muscovy I posted his review for
the Philips BDP 5506 now here's your
chance to find out why this player can't
stand up to the competition
hey I'm Matthew moscovia Katzie Netcom
and we're going to take a look at the
Philips BDP 5506 blu-ray player which is
currently selling for about a hundred
and sixty-five dollars a Philips usually
has some pretty unique designs on its
products but this is a generic looking
blu-ray player the front panel buttons
are all touch sensitive there's a glossy
black finish and the USB port on the
front we like the main user interface
which is simple and straightforward but
once you access the streaming media
features it gets more cluttered the
icons are relatively small and there are
plenty of filler services that just kind
of get in the way you'll also notice
that while there are some important
services that we care about like Netflix
Vudu and Pandora
loop's doesn't have many of the premium
content sources that competitors do like
Hulu Plus Amazon Instant and MLB TV on
the plus side the BDP 5506 does have
built-in Wi-Fi so you don't need a thern
ette in your living room to use the
streaming services the standout feature
of this player is supposed to be Philips
Media Connect which allows you to stream
whatever is displayed on your laptop
directly to the blu-ray player it's an
interesting idea but we found it
difficult to set up and overall it
wasn't that useful especially when
competing blu-ray players have so many
streaming media services built right
into the player we also put the player
through our image quality test and we
were surprised to find that the Philips
failed quite a few of our basic tests we
saw artifacts and jaggies on standard
film based movies like Mission
Impossible and sunshine and it's the
first player we've tested this year to
fail these tests the same kind of issues
showed up on DVD playback so if you care
about image quality at all we'd go with
a different player overall with all of
its competitors offering better image
quality and more streaming media
services there's just not a good reason
to pick the BD p55 over better
alternatives I'm Matthew moscovia and
this is the Philips BDP 5506 I guess it
doesn't get much clearer than that so
let's just move right along to this
week's bottom line we're all familiar
with the commercials for Dyson vacuums
with that weird guy who's obsessed with
suction then the company turned its
attention from sucking to blowing with
their introduction of their hand dryers
and swiveling fans now the heat is on as
David Carr Noyes shows us in this first
look at the dyson hot
I'm David Cardo a executive editor for
cnn.com and a lot of times in the tech
world we like to describe products as
hot and new but this is the first time
that the word hot has actually been
incorporated into the product name this
is the dyson hot fan heater it is really
a heater it looks like a space heater
but it's actually more of a space-age
heater it works with Dyson's bladeless
fan technology before the company had
something called the Dyson Air
Multiplier fan that fan comes in
multiple models now we have the Dyson
hot which basically pushes hot air
through that bladeless fan there's a
thermostat that goes from 32 degrees all
the way up to 99 degrees that's a little
bit deceptive because this isn't an air
conditioner actually what you do is you
set the thermostat to say if the room
was around 40 degrees and you want it to
be 50 degrees you set it at 50 degrees
and every time the thermostat would drop
below 50 degrees the heater would kick
in a couple of cool features like the
air multiplier models this one has a
tilt mechanism in it this one also comes
with a remote control it's actually
magnetic and you can stick it to the top
of the fan that remote control allows
you to set the thermostat also the power
of the fan and you can set it to
oscillate like Dyson Air Multiplier
models this is a fairly quiet fan it
does kick up the sound when you do put
it on the higher power levels it's also
designed not to get too hot there's no
exposed heating elements and Dyson's
making a big deal about how it's a safer
fan if you tip it over it turns off
automatically and there's nothing to in
theory start a fire in case you're
wondering this can also be used as a
standard fan it is a little bit
confusing at first but you have to set
the thermostat all the way down to 32
degrees and then the power button on the
front goes from red to blue and you are
in standard fan mode the fan comes in
two colors this is the iron and blue
color and there's also a white and
silver model we like this color a little
bit better it does look a little bit
more futuristic with the blue on the
inside for the one downside here is that
like
most Dyson products this is a fairly
pricey heater at $399 a lot of people
are going to balk at that price but by
the same token it is a really a
showpiece product and Dyson has managed
to sell a lot of those air multiplier
fans so we also expect the company to
sell a lot of these heaters I'm David
Connelly and that's the Dyson hot fan
heater the bottom line this week this is
why i'm hot this is why i'm hot you know
at 399 it may seem expensive because it
is but i can really use one of those on
