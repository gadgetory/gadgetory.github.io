notebooks in fact the original series 7
pretty much made me lose my mind with
its beauty and inside this box is the
new series 9 now it's technically
classified as an ultrabook although it's
basically a MacBook Air competitor let's
check it out there's quite a lot of tape
ins I'm finally okay I'm okay
a lot of pocketing going on here they
got some bubble okay
I can do that right okay
these notebooks have really become known
for their high style they are a little
bit expensive but if you really are
looking for that Mac competitor you want
it to look good you're probably already
willing to pay more box oh it's kind of
a bluish look to it ah yes okay
inside the box in addition to all the
regular charging cables you actually
have an Ethernet dongle that's right
even though this laptop doesn't have
Ethernet built in the dongle is right
there in the box take that Apple now
let's have a look at this guy look how
thin I mean for a 13-inch notebook this
is extremely thin and light before I
start actually physically drooling on it
let's go through the specs it has a
third generation Intel Core i5 processor
running at 1.7 gigahertz there's four
gigs of onboard memory the display is
thirteen point three inches and the
resolution is 1600 by 900 it runs
Windows seven the weight is 2.6 pounds
it has two USB ports one on each side
it's also equipped with micro HDMI and
an SD card slot the base model has a 128
gigabyte solid state drive now at $12.99
this series nine is $100 more than the
MacBook Air although it's really only
$70 more if you include the dongle other
than that it's practically a one-to-one
comparison it's a really pretty ultra
book that runs Windows head on over to
cnet.com to read our editor Scott
Stein's review and find out what he
thinks for my part I just think
it's so pretty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
