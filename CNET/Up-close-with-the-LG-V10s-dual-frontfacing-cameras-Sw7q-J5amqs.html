v10 that I have here both with the two
five megapixel front-facing lenses and
also with the 13 megapixel camera on the
back you can access all of these tools
on the side so that means you can get to
manual controls that will give you more
granularity over ISO and white balance
it'll also manual focus and you can
swipe to move around between the
front-facing camera and the rear camera
there's also a manual mode for video and
one of the things that I think is really
neat here so you can see voice levels
turns out this 24p movie mode here was a
special request of Joseph gordon-levitt
there's also some neat stuff that you
can do around audio including directing
where the sound comes from and turning
on a wind noise filter so as you can see
LG has done a lot of work in the camera
department both with the front facing
camera rear camera and the video another
feature I really like is that anytime
you take a photo you're prompted to
share through one of your social
networks for all the rest of the
information on the high end specs with
the LG v10 has make sure you check them
out and see navcom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
