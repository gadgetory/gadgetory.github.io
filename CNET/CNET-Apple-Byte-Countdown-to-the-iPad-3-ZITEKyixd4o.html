inside the world of Apple and nothing

according to all things D and the loop
blog Apple will introduce the ipad 3 or
ipad HD in the first week of March
there's no official street date for the
iPad release yet but the announcement
will be held at one of apple's trademark
events in San Francisco presumably at
the yerba buena center for the arts and
if you want a peek at it and these new
pictures from Apple da you might be
looking at the exterior of the iPad
threes booty now the main thing here to
notice is the cameras placement that's
closer to the edge and it's no longer a
circle-shaped lens which will mean all
new cases and accessories thanks Apple
we love spending more money now the site
also claims that pictures of the Smart
Cover magnets and suggests the next gen
ipad will share the same smart covers as
the ipad 2 now this comes after repair
lab showed off their own pictures of
what's purportedly the inside of the
rear plate of the iPad trace with minor
design changes that suggest space for a
larger battery and a redesigned logic
board and who would have known ipad 3
shells available now at several of your
local black markets and in case you
didn't know the New York Times is also
saying the new iPad will have a truly
amazing screen before the product is
launched great review guys now in Apple
TV news Canadian newspaper The Globe and
Mail reports that apple is seeking out
active partnerships for their upcoming
Apple TV with companies like Rogers
Communications and BCE Inc who have
wireless and broadband capabilities now
the paper also claims the company's
already have the apple TV prototype in
their labs Syria's integrated into the
TV set like many expect but hand
gestures can also be used for
interacting with an on-screen keyboard
surfing the web or conducting video
chats and more all without any physical
interface so we'll see if that's really
true or not all right let's take a quick
break and showcase a nap worth tapping
