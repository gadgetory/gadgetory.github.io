gaming console sony has already sold
more than a million PlayStation fours
now the Microsoft Xbox one has hit
stores and so begins the fight for your
holiday dollars the five-hundred-dollar
Xbox is one hundred dollars more than
the ps4 included in each Xbox one is an
updated connect Microsoft's motion and
voice sensing device it can track more
people in the room it can kind of
recognize you by just your face and sigh
you into your account it does motion
tracking so if your fault you're walking
around the room having a skype call with
someone you just walking around your
room it will follow you it actually
tracks your heartbeat you know if you
have an exercise game sony has an
optional camera you can add four sixty
dollars Microsoft is hoping the xbox one
will also appeal to a more mainstream
audience not just gamers I think
Microsoft wants to be your kind of go to
box for your living room microsoft is
offering the fantasy football
integration they're offering cable TV
integration where you plug your cable
box into the xbox one each system will
have exclusive game titles to show off
stunning graphics and more powerful
machines a lot of big franchises are
going to be an Xbox one halo is going to
be an Xbox one there's a new franchise
from the makers from original makers of
the modern warfare franchise called
titanfall I think they're both going to
have really powerful really appealing
exclusive games at the e3 gaming
conference Sony CEO Jack Tretton told
CNET the improved technology would
heighten the emotion of the games I
think as the technology grows the
ability to make the experience more and
more immersive to really evoke emotion
to make people scared when they're
playing it excited mad and to really get
in a relationship with the characters
just like they would with a movie or a
TV show but if you're looking to upgrade
your current system you won't be able to
play your old games on the new consoles
for now if you have an old system you're
probably going to want to keep that
around for now even if you buy a new
system but instead of focusing on which
console to buy it might be
more prudent to think about when to buy
so if you wait you're going to get more
games better games you won't have to
deal with the technical launch
difficulties you might even see a price
drop in a future that's what happened
with Nintendo's Wii U which launched
last year but failed to gain traction at
the time it's a year later so high
quality games are starting to come out
right now and the price is lower it's a
lot lower than the PlayStation 4 or Xbox
one so i think the the wii u actually
makes for pretty compelling by this
year's where last year really didn't
giving credence to that old adage timing
is everything in San Francisco I'm Sumi
