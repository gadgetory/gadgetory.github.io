came along and looked like Apple was
going to enjoy the same blowout in
tablets that it did with mp3 players but
a 7-inch tablet for under 200 bucks from
a company you trust that got your
attention but that doesn't mean you
don't have issues with it
I'm Brian Cooley with the top 5 gripes
you've got about the Amazon Kindle Fire
tablet this according to a survey of
2600 Kindle users by change wave
research number Five's the one you
notice right out of the box the screen
size 7 inch it's a lot less than 10 inch
10 percent of owners noticed that once
they get it in their hands and I bet
most of them when they're watching or
sharing a movie or a video that whole
immersive thing doesn't really happen
with a 7-inch device unless you want to
hold it like 10 inches from your face
and then you look like you're way too
much into tablets don't do that number 4
is that ty 12 percent of you pointed out
these two things the lack of 3G or 4G
cellular connection and the limited or
curated selection of apps you see the
fire is Android base but that doesn't
mean you have access to the whole world
of Android apps just the one Amazon lets
you get and the lack of 3G or 4G means
you'll be working a cold sweat whenever
you're away from a Wi-Fi hotspot combine
that with the small 8 gigabytes of
internal storage and that's a lot of
time spent sweaty number 3 15 percent of
you said the battery life's too short we
found that our lab tests you will be
lucky to get the promised 8 hours where
we readily got 12 or more on the iPad
again smaller device smaller price
smaller battery on the fire but this and
the Wi-Fi only thing kind of conspire to
keep you looking out of the corner of
your eye all the time for a place that
has Wi-Fi and a plug and that takes some
of the mobile out of mobile number two
21% of you said this no camera I don't
get this one who carries a fire and not
a smartphone that is an imminently
easier to use less dorky camera before I
get you know the number one Kindle Fire
gripe what's the top thing Kindle Fire
owners love yeah you know it's the price
$1.99 59 percent of you were gaga for
that and a distant number two was the
color screen loved by 31% who clearly
came to their fire from either a
grayscale Kindle reader or the 19th
century the number one thing that irks
you fire folks is get this no volume
buttons seriously 27% of you hate having
to go to the screen to control the
volume gets old real fast even button
hating Apple gives you actual volume
rockers on the iPad when you head into a
more button free design than Apple it's
time to get a second opinion
