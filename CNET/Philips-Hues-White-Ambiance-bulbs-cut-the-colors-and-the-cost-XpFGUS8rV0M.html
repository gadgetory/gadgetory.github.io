colors but they do change color
temperatures offering a variety of white
light tones ranging from warm candle
light glows at one end of the spectrum
and cool bluish white daylight tones on
the other now along with two of those
bulbs and this handy physical dimming
switch the $130 starter kit comes with
the second gen Philips hue bridge that
bridge lets you sync the bulbs up with
apple homekit which means you can
control them using Siri voice commands
like this hey Siri turn off the test
bulb okay good test off is off my main
problem with these lights is that they
aren't as bright as you might want
Philips labels them at 800 lumens which
is about what you'd get from an ordinary
60 watt bulb but if you check the specs
online you'll see that you only get that
level of brightness at the 4000 K color
temperature setting and that is not the
bulbs default setting when you turn it
on it's about 2700 K and at that 2700 K
setting you only get about 450 lumens a
40 watt bulbs worth on top of that when
I tried to find that 4000 K 800 lumen
setting in the ocean of pixels that the
app gives you the best I could get was
about 600 lumens that's less brightness
than you'll get with color tunable
competitors like the lifx white 800 the
C by GE sleep LED and the stack LED
downlights one other quirk that bugs me
Siri doesn't have a vocabulary for that
white light spectrum so if you ask her
set them to soft white or 2700 K she'll
just look at you funny she has no idea
what that means
you have to instead set up a scene in
the hue app that includes color
temperature changes and then run that
scene all that said the white ambience
LEDs work as well as other philips hue
bulbs which is to say that they're
reliable and fairly easy to use and at
thirty dollars per bulb they're also
twice as affordable as use full color
LEDs and they enjoy the same wide range
of third-party compatibility I just wish
that on top of all of that you got a
little more brightness for your buck
