today we're going to take a look at the
Cambridge Audio minx err 200 this is a
large wireless speaker that supports
both bluetooth and airplay and is
currently selling for $600 the mix err
200 is one of the nicest looking
speakers to enter the scene at offices a
lot of these speakers go for a real eye
catching design but the mix has an
understated look with the white plastic
cabinet and a gray speaker grille that
looks good pretty much everywhere I
placed it it is surprisingly big though
especially wide so you're gonna need a
lot of shelf space to accommodate it the
top has two sets of mushy rubber buttons
and the number of buttons on the left
offer the neat ability to stream
internet radio directly to the Minx
without needing to deal with a
smartphone or a tablet there's also a
remote included but it's one of those
remotes with cheap bubbly buttons that
are kind of common on speakers like this
luckily you're mostly controlling things
from your mobile device so you won't
need to use the included remote that
much the mix offers both bluetooth and
airplay which gives you some nice
flexibility to wirelessly stream audio
from a wide range of devices airplay
does theoretically offer better sound
quality with Apple devices but it also
requires a Wi-Fi network so luckily you
can always fall back to bluetooth if
you're outside of your home network on
the back there are a few ports including
Ethernet a mini jack input and an analog
input there's also a convenient handle
but that doesn't mean the Minx is
portable there's no built-in battery so
it always needs to be plugged in for
listening tests I had the mix 200 set up
directly next to the clips KMC 3 in the
Peachtree audio deep blue and it
couldn't quite rock out with the other
speakers it sounded a lot better than
the smaller mix 100 but for harder rock
tunes it wasn't able to deliver a
powerful sound especially on the low-end
jazz and pop sounded better on the mix
err 100 but when I switched between the
speakers I still found the other system
sounded a little richer so overall the
mink ser 200 is a decent sounding
speaker with a great design and a solid
feature set but that's not quite enough
to justify the 600
dollar price tag if you're okay with a
more mellow sounding speaker it may be
worth considering but otherwise you'll
get a better value from other wireless
speakers I'm Matthew Muscovy ak and this
is the Cambridge Audio mink air 200</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
