phones for 2015 this is the samsung
galaxy s6 and we've got the curved
samsung galaxy s6 edge I'm Jessica doll
for Percy net and I'm going to take you
on a little tour of these brand new
devices the galaxy s6 and s6 edge
represent a completely different design
for samsung the plastic is long gone and
we've got glass on the back and a metal
frame around the edges that is Gorilla
Glass 4 by the way the phones are really
slim light very sleek that's because
they have an embedded design that means
you won't be able to pull your battery
out there's also no microSD card but
there are three levels of storage to
satisfy your needs their 32 gigabyte 64
gigabytes and 128 gigabytes it has the
same size screen as last year a 5.1 inch
AMOLED display but this time the
resolution gets bumped way up to 2560 x
1440 p for those of you who count as a
pixel density of 577 ppi that means are
going to get ultra chris videos and
images when you're playing games
watching a movie or looking at pictures
Samsung is going with its own 64-bit
octa-core processor of its Exynos line
both models of the phone have a 16
megapixel camera on the back and a 5
megapixel camera on the front there's
auto HDR improved low-light and optical
image stabilization there's also a
really great feature to pull up the
camera from any screen neuron really
quickly you just double-click that home
key to launch a camera in under a second
Samsung has done a lot of work regarding
charging of the battery for both of
these phones there's wireless charging
for both standards that's built into the
back of the phone now the s6 and s6 edge
come in four different colors each you
can get either phone in sapphire black
white pearl and platinum gold the s6
also comes in topaz blue and the edge
comes in emerald green carriers will
announce their own prices and we don't
have a launch date but we do know that
both phones will be available in q2 I'm
