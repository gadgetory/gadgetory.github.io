of the sony bdp s 5100 with blu-ray
players now so cheap and so versatile
that they make a great alternative to a
streaming player the sony bdp s 5100 is
a decent model that accepts most digital
formats and has an attractive menu
system as well bill wise it's just okay
as well as compact in size the door on
our unit wasn't attached very well the
player looks attractive though with a
jewel-like finish likewise the remote is
easy to use attractive and you won't go
accidentally hitting Netflix button like
on some others be aware that if you're
buying this player for someone else that
it only has digital outputs so you won't
be able to use it with a CRT the player
comes with what the company calls super
Wi-Fi but based on my testing it's
certainly not faster than a speeding
bullet though it may still wear its
underpants on the outside the player
offers 3d playback in addition to DLNA
streaming but there are no fancy screen
mirroring features plus the web browser
is pretty bad with no flash support
streaming video is pretty good though
most of these players connections aren't
currently fast enough for true HD
quality from netflix blu-ray and DVD
quality is very good with a crisp clear
picture and while it did fail one
synthetic test it's something I didn't
see on real world applications at a
street price of ninety dollars the Sony
offers good value for money and pretty
much all of the apps you'll need this
