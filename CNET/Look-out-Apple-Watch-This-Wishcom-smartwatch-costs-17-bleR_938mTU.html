with C net and I'm here with an exciting
product you may have heard of the Apple
watch
you may even thought you know what I'd
like to get one so we found a great
alternative it's this what's interesting
is I don't know who makes this honestly
I have no idea on the box it says
verified by wish but a more curious
label is on this other side here caution
do not charge over two hours if the
battery is overcharging please open the
back of the watch and take it out let
the battery discharge it will work
normally so right off the bat before
even open the box there's a big warning
about the battery let me get our
official opening tool here there we go
and you guys can see on the inside if we
got the watch we have the smallest
little micro USB to USB cable here and
instruction manual definitely in Chinese
and one in English here there we go so
okay there's like a kind of like little
sleeve I took off from afar maybe even
slightly closed up it looks like an
Apple watch guessing this might be where
SIM card goes that's right this thing
have a SIM card looks like there's a
speaker grille here and I'm guessing
this little pinhole is probably a
microphone on the other side it looks
like we have a dial oh it does it pushes
in and it spins so and on the back it's
just plastic looks like there's a camera
and if you guys can see that and there's
probably the fattest bezel I've ever
seen on a watch in my life but that's
okay because we paid 17 bucks for this
thing
sounds kind of like that level by
Radiohead music you might get it
Starbuck here we have our main screen on
the top right it says company mode not
sure exactly what that means heard in
the menu maybe there we go
we have something very Apple like
interface with the SmartWatch apps here
all being circles
I got settings I have calendar looks
like here I have all my Fitness stuff on
the top there have a someone running and
my last screen I have whatsapp and
Twitter so a lot of apps already
installed a lot of things I would
probably actually use I'm going to tap
on the calendar all right man that is
small I do not know how you I mean yeah
that is tiny I don't even know how you
maybe does the crown finally where nope
so it does show a calendar it does not
look like any events maybe there's
different looks to it no that's just
yeah don't use the calendar this thing
sucks just tap on that two hours so I've
call history and call settings again the
crown does not work on this at all very
very horrible missed calls because we
really haven't made a call from this if
you remember up there we go we got John
so it's showing up that I called you and
try this again options call
I'm thinking this is a Bluetooth failure
that's what I think I think I don't know
what I think it's clearly not working I
think that the app on the bottom here it
looks kinda like a camera icon
so tap this and look at that I got a
camera see if I can take a picture oh my
god actually works I have to hold it
very far away as well you see how far I
am to get myself in the frame ah well
problem too if I tap the button please
insert a memory card the question I
really have there's a couple things here
I don't know which are on the screen so
let's tap them so first is this purple
thing what all right I see you maybe
have to do it this way hey John are you
seeing me on the screen there that's
pretty cool get Bryant on this is what
Brian wants right he wants the Dick
Tracy watch we found it we have found
the watch so in the day I don't know 17
bucks he really go wrong this is our
Smart Watch aka the Apple watch knock
off from wish calm our first unboxing
and about 17 hours of me setting it up
and it still doesn't all work but it
looks pretty cool
