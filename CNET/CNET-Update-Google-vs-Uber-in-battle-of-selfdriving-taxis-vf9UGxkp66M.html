begun I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
CNET update Google could be taking on
uber with its own car hailing service
that's according to a report from
Bloomberg which has a source saying that
some folks on Google's campus are
testing out a car sharing app it's
likely part of Google's self-driving car
project Google executives have said they
envision self-driving cars to be able to
pick you up on request but this could be
a shock to BER because google has been
one of overs biggest investors and
Google has linked over into its Maps
but Google itself didn't comment on the
report instead it just sent out a
cryptic tweet saying we think you'll
find oberon lifts work quite well we use
them all the time mm-hmm well shortly
after that report came out uber releases
some news of its own
uber is making its own self-driving cars
with the help from researchers at
Carnegie Mellon University it's no
secret that uber wanted to go in this
direction the head of the company said
that one day self-driving cars could
replace ubers human drivers and uber has
the cash to do it
uber is the highest-valued venture back
company in the world valued at more than
41 billion dollars but until we get into
that world it seems over and Google may
coexist as frenemies as for a new tech
that you don't have to wait five years
for a new samsung galaxy flagship phone
will be unveiled on March 1st samsung
sent out teaser invites to its next
event at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona Spain it shows a slim curving
silver line against a black background
with the phrase what's next it could be
the galaxy s6 or as some people
speculate on Twitter it could be a fork
and while a galaxy fork does sound quite
intriguing there's another bit of
gadgetry trying to solve a more basic
problem Wi-Fi you may think your home
Wi-Fi works dandy but a startup called
Eero believes we're all in for trouble
as we have more devices in the home
communicating with one router so instead
of having a single router from a company
like net gear Linksys
or d-link the ero gives you a pack of
three routers so you can distribute the
signal throughout the home there are
other perks too like you can give access
to a guest in your home without having
to give them the whole password login
but the starting price is steep at three
hundred dollars the company is taking
orders now and it's shipping in the
summer
that's your tech news update and you can
stay updated at cnet.com and follow me
on twitter and snapchat yep I'm doing
that snapping thing now from our studios
in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
