Hawaii and then comic-con whoo that was
really a hard vacation
welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
we're still in a holding pattern for the
next big product drops mmm iPhone but
there's always something happening like
when people are bored they decide to
make nice-looking renders of what they
hope the next iPhone 8 stop bar will
look like instead of the black knots
that jets out around the cameras and
sensors that we've seen before now this
is what I want it would look so much
slicker and yeah you know Galaxy s8 ish
but so what we'll wait and see now the
iPhone 8's OLED display will be
manufactured and supplied exclusively by
Samsung reports say Apple has signed a
deal for a supply of up to 160 million
curved OLED panels over the next two
years but according to et news Apple is
developing its own OLED tech setting up
a research and development line in
Taiwan just for OLED screens with the
goal of moving away from Samsung as its
sole supplier now the report says Apple
has purchased chemical vapor deposition
machines which are used to make OLED
panels but look like they could make you
a nice brew as well but they won't now
Apple could license the machines to
manufacturing partners like Foxconn or
Pegatron to open up the OLED supply
chain building more screens for devices
like the iPhone Apple watch or the
second gen home pod with the screen see
I just completely made up that home pod
part to see if you are still paying
attention that's not happening or is it
now if you're still trying to narrow
down when we'll see the next Apple watch
three quanta is one of its manufacturers
and the revenue projections would line
up with the new Apple watch coming in
the third quarter of this year around
September rumors have pointed everything
from better battery life to a cellular
connection and improved health biometric
sensors with the same form factor for
the next Apple watch but come on come on
gimme that Dick Tracy style FaceTime on
that bad boy that's what I want I'll
write the third public betas for iOS 11
watch OS TV OS and yes buckles
they're out now with a few minor tweaks
and improvements based on the fourth
developers release I'm okay to throw it
on my iPad but I'm not an eager beaver
like some of you who just want to put on
everything it's still a beta with bugs
and it's not worth it to drop it on my
primary phone ok Adobe is finally
killing flash no not that one this one
yeah that doesn't look nearly as cool
but for reals this time after they
announced that they will end-of-life the
plug-in by the end of 2020 and guess
what
some of you already just wrote in the
comments flash has already been dead in
all-caps with an exclamation mark or
three now Adobe says it's working with
companies to prepare for the upcoming
death of flash you know the one Steve
Jobs famously wrote about in an open
letter back in April of 2010 because of
its poor reliability and security modern
options like open source html5 CSS and
JavaScript poor battery life and its
lack of support for touch C Jobs was
right on the money about flash just
seven plus years ago I'll write a new
report from Reuters says hi robot the
creators of the Roomba vacuum is looking
to expand in the smart home world and
will start collecting mapping from
people's homes
now iRobot CEO then wants to sell it to
companies like Apple to improve their
smart home information that's not creepy
at all the hope is that the data would
help accessory makers have a better idea
about how homes are laid out customers
would have to give their permission to
use the data but Apple Amazon and
alphabet you know formerly Google are
all fans of the technology and if you
missed it Apple and the rock Dwayne
Johnson released a four-minute movie
featuring a day in the life with the
rock and Siri where he's challenged to
do pretty much everything hey Siri read
me my last email at 9:30 a.m.
sent you an email about mr. Nakamura can
discuss your fashion line
everything in life is made up of four
elements wind fire waters rocks
hey Siri how many ounces in a centimeter
one centiliter is 0.34 fluid ounces the
rusticles of yuneisia messy so what do
you guys all think of that it doesn't
matter what you think all right that's
gonna do it for this week's show you can
email us at the Apple by to see Netcom
or tweet me at Brian Tong thank so much
for watching we'll catch y'all next time
for the bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
