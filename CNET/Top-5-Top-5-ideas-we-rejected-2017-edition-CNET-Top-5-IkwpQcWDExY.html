fives of 2017 you know they say in
brainstorming there are no bad ideas and
that might be true but when you
eventually try to sit down to make top
five scripts out of a brainstorming
session you realize there are some bad
ideas after all
here are five ideas that are sitting on
the bench for now how are they right
they are ranked from least likely to
most likely to have been made in episode
of top five coming in at number five the
top five smartwatches I think I wrote
this idea early in 2017 and was hoping
maybe just maybe smartwatches would get
good my exact note when I revisited this
idea said who would care at number four
top five seen at top five hosts this was
an idea for April Fool's Day episode
there been a handful of hosts for the
show but it didn't want to come off
unintentionally mean-spirited if I
ranked them even Phil was a joke that's
right if something is mean-spirited on
this show it's usually on purpose I also
thought about listing myself in a 5-way
time instead we went in a different
direction you did text that episode
right there's a place Sega's newest home
console is all that and a bag of chips
it's got a built-in modem so you can
play with other people over the Internet
just make sure no one picks up the phone
when you're gaming though then there's
the controller with a mini video game
console right inside it can't fail
number three top five tips for pixel two
XL owners honestly within a week of the
pixel 2 XL release the number one sip
might have been to avoid the pixel 2 XL
entirely however if you stuck by your
pixel remember to turn on gestures and
settings so you can pull down the
notification tray by swiping on the
fingerprint sensor in the original pixel
it was under the moves option also make
sure you're shooting video in 4k since
you're getting unlimited backup for your
stuff at full quality with Google photos
might as well take advantage of that
deal huh at number 2 were the top five
tips for Robo vac owners this one was
weird because that thought was useful
but essentially I would be reading your
robo VAX manual to you say hello to my
dog tour it she is extremely allergic to
dust mites and guess what dust mites can
live in the hair that she sheds that's
why I have a Robo vac that cleans the
apartment daily if you were wondering
about those tips themselves clean
Kahless because robo backs sometimes
have no mercy another was to put away
shoes I've come home to find my Nieto
bought back dragging a slipper with it
as it attempted to clean the place and
the number one rejected top 5 for 2017
was top 5 ways to get smarter this would
have focused on online learning sites
like Coursera EDX iTunes U etc the
problem was in the ranking there's no
way I could take every course I actually
did take 3 different nutrition courses
using Coursera EDX and iTunes personally
I like the Coursera course from Stanford
the best the video quality was excellent
and the notes were good introduction to
the topic this was essentially an
unmanageable top 5 but there's a chance
I might try to do this again in the
future
and there you have it that's the last
top 5 of 2017 I want to thank Bryan Van
Gelder he's shot and edited most of the
top fives you've seen this year also I
want to thank all of you for watching
Amaya's actor and I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
