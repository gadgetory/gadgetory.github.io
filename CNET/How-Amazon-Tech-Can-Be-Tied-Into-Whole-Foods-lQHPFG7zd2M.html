Foods Market organic grocery store chain
for 13.7 billion dollars well now we
know how Amazon plans to expand its
reach into the grocery business because
with this merger Amazon will control
more than four hundred and sixty
supermarkets across the u.s. Canada and
the UK those all can now become
distribution centers for the Amazon
fresh grocery delivery service why
invest in stocking warehouses with
groceries when you could just use
grocery stores now if you're not
familiar with it Amazon fresh is a $15 a
month service for Prime members you
order fresh produce and other groceries
online get it delivered to your door at
a time you choose Amazon is also
starting to test a drive up service
where you can order on your phone and 15
minutes later drive up to the Amazon
fresh center and someone puts the
groceries in your trunk that could be
implemented in any Whole Foods parking
lot Amazon even has a gadget just for
ordering groceries on Amazon fresh the
dash wants scans barcodes and adds those
items to your shopping cart or you could
just speak into the microphone to tell
it what you want and that's not all
Whole Foods could also be a testing
ground for Amazon's more ambitious
retail technology the no lines no
checkout just walk out concept known as
Amazon go it's only being tested now in
Seattle but here's the gist when
entering the Amazon go store you open
the Amazon Go app take the products you
want and sensors keep track of what was
taken off the shelf it knows what you
walked out with and charges your account
accordingly but the Whole Foods merger
is then a done deal just yet it still
needs to be approved by shareholders and
meet regulatory approvals which likely
won't happen until later this year the
plans are to keep the Whole Foods Market
named with CEO John Mackey stayin at the
helm of the chain and Amazon would also
keep the Whole Foods headquarters in
Austin Texas I'm Bridget Carey you can
