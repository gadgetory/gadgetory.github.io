you're looking at the Visio m3d five
five zero Kady
this is a 55 inch LED TV this review
will also apply to the 47 inch size this
is one of our favorite LED TVs so far
this year first off it's pretty darn
inexpensive press time this 55 inch is
about 1,200 bucks for example which is
pretty darn good for a full-featured LED
TV we also really like the picture
quality we'll get to that in a little
bit but let's first take a look at the
design on this set it's actually our
least favorite part I do like the fact
that the bezel around the edge of the
screen is pretty thin so it's a lot of
picture for the size of the cabinet but
all told it's a pretty mediocre styling
I really don't like this flash of silver
here along the bottom where the stand is
and I really wish the entire thing was
completely black as opposed to this
little lighter spot right below the
screen I'm also not a huge fan of the
design of the remote control it is very
functional though you do get a full
QWERTY keyboard and it's bluetooth so
you don't have to aim it at the screen
but it's really chunky and the keys
aren't all that responsive so again I
feel like most people are gonna be
replacing it with a universal model this
set has plenty of features including a
local dimming on the LED backlight as
well as a four pairs of included 3d
glasses which is of course a lot more
than any active tv includes this set
also has passive 3ds there's also a
smart TV function on this set includes
built-in Wi-Fi and it's also one of the
few TVs to include all of the big four
content providers for video that
includes Netflix Amazon Instant Video
and Hulu Plus so all told plenty of
content on this set it's available via
this Yahoo would just like interface the
scroll along the bottom is a little bit
awkward and you can't really see all
that many apps at once but at least
there's plenty of selection 150 total
apps included on this set around back
the connectivity example with four HDMI
there's also provisions for component
and composite video a PC input and a
pair of USB ports while the vizio will
handle photo video and music files via
USB you can't stream them by a DLNA over
your home network picture controlled on
this set are ample but not extensive you
get a two point grayscale as well as
Google's of different picture settings
but it is missing a color management
system gamma control and 10-point system
as I mentioned at the top this TV does
have very good picture quality that
starts with its deep black levels the
local dimming allows the set to get nice
and deep especially indoor
scenes it is pretty variable however so
in lighter scenes those black levels do
come up a little bit so it's not quite
as good as some of the other sets we've
seen it being consistent but again I
really do prefer that actual overall
black level and I'll take some of the
trade-offs which include a little bit of
blooming and that variable backlight on
the downside the off angle viewing is
not great on this set but it does have
pretty good screen uniformity and it
does have a relatively reflective screen
but not quite as bad as some of the
really glossy screens we've seen out
there it's been a bit of a semi matte
finish anyway that's a quick look at
videos and the 3d 5 v 0 KD I'm David
