going for it in theory it has 1080p
high-definition live-streaming
integration with other smart home
devices through the third-party service
if local and optional cloud storage a
three hundred and forty degree panning
angle and an 80 degree tilting angle the
kicker is that it costs just 80 bucks
$80 for a pan tilt HD home security
camera here's what it did really well I
was able to have mostly intelligible
conversations through the mini 360
plusses two-way audio intercom feature
yeah I also received prompt motion
alerts although some included phantom
alerts
video playback of nothing but shadows
shifting around in the light the mini
360 plus also has a feature that lets
you opt in to auto motion tracking for
instance if the motion sensor detects
activity the camera is supposed to pan
to follow it this worked to some extent
but not as well as I would like if a
person walks by at a normal speed the
camera will follow it initially but
randomly gives up partway through when I
walked more slowly it did a better job
of tracking my activity but I doubt a
burglar would oblige with the same slow
pace the good news again is that this
thing doesn't cost too much but I'd
strongly consider the Z modo pivot over
easy visits many 360 plus if you want a
camera that tracks motion with greater
ease</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
