best battery life one of the more
positive trends in modern smartphones
has to be bigger batteries yes we've had
thinner phones and lighter phones and
less bezel everywhere but a phone that
lasts all day now that's exciting let's
get to it
number five is the LGV 30 with 17 hours
and 30 minutes of battery life LG makes
some great phones but it seems like it's
archrival gets all the headlines of
course I'm talking about palm now
Samsung anyway the V 30 has some clean
styling big OLED screen wireless
charging is water-resistant and even has
a headphone jack madness coming at
number 4 is the BlackBerry key - it ran
for 18 hours that's excellent keys on a
key to physical keyboard are 20% taller
than the keys on the BlackBerry key one
keys the physical keys can also act as
shortcuts to apps or tasks using long or
short presses you can have 52 different
shortcuts if you're thinking wait
blackberry is alive blackberry phones
are made by TCL the original blackberry
company formerly known as Research In
Motion handles the software still
BlackBerry devices now run Android we
are at number three and three times
three is nine the Samsung Galaxy Note 9
ran for 19 hours and 20 minutes during
our tests the note 8 pulled in around 17
hours so battery life should not be the
defining characteristic if you're
looking to upgrade from a note 8 to a 9
otherwise the note 9 is a very powerful
device and is also handy for those of us
who like to jot things down instead of
typing the note 9 also added some neat
tricks to its s-pen it can now act as a
remote control as well as a stylus the
massive battery in the note 9 charges
the s-pen number two is the vivo NEX
clocking in at 21 hours and 50 minutes
thanks to its 4,000 milliamp hour
battery you guys know the next right
it's got that pop-up selfie camera no
not here the NEX
also includes a fingerprint sensor in
the screen the
downside of the necks vivo skin on
Android is kind of clunky let's get back
to that selfie camera and answer the
question on everyone's mind how tough is
that camera it's actually pretty sturdy
and it's far from flimsy and the phone
with the best battery life is the
Samsung S eight active at 24 hours yeah
you heard me right a whole friggin day
the s8 active maybe ancient news because
it came out way back in the olden days
of 2017 but let's talk a little bit
about good old grandpa s8 active it's
really tough you don't need a case for
this thing you can throw the s8 active
against a wall and the wall will likely
be more damaged than the phone the s8
active has a flat screen no infinity
edge here it also has the Snapdragon 835
processor which is still plenty fast as
it's been around the block for a bit you
can find the s8 active at around $400
online thanks to the one and only Lin
law for helping me out with this top 5
and for testing loads and loads of
phones to this list finally convince you
to buy a blackberry key to really let me
know I'm is a colonel see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
