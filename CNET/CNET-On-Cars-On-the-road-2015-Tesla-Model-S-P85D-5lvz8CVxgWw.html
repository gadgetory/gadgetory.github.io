S was missing some pretty basic things
all wheel drive and any kind of driver
assist they just got caught up let's
drive 2015 Tesla p85d check the tip
rather quickly
now on the outside as you can see these
nudie model Tesla Model S's are very
familiar it's what's happening
underneath in two broad areas first of
all the details you've got dual motors
which also rolls in all-wheel drive
secondly a whole new wave of autonomy
driver assist to the degree of self
driving even is coming in phases let's
start with the drivetrain though now a
Model S traditionally had a single motor
at the rear driving those wheels these
new D cars add a second motor at the
front to drive those wheels to the tune
of 188 horsepower at each end if you get
a P or performance model like we have
the rear motor gets bumped way up to 470
horsepower and the front a bit higher to
221 for a massive 691 total that gets
this nearly five thousand pound car to
60 in just 3.2 seconds range is down but
only slightly from a standard rear wheel
drive model S overall charge time
doesn't change much in the new car with
a single charger that comes built in
about eight and a half hours option the
dual charger you get that down to about
four Tesla supercharger gets you 170
miles of range in 30 minutes and if
their battery swap stations come to
fruition you'll swap the whole pack in
just three minutes
now all-wheel drive comes in many
flavors of course there's that which is
aimed very much at dealing with tough
conditions and that which is aimed at
performance this one is clearly looking
more like a performance setup though
it's certainly going to help you when
you've got lesser traction then there's
the new autopilot which is what Tesla
calls their driver assists that means
adaptive cruise that maintains speed and
distance to other cars along with the
ability to come all the way to a full
stop and resume to be honest nothing
other cars didn't have a couple years
ago did oh this cars new ability to read
speed limit science and alert you to the
correct speed now highway lane changing
is interesting you can do it by just
signaling our car currently just does
the acceleration part for you but
automatic lane change steering is coming
as well self parking in a Tesla means
the car not only parks in a spot that
you pull alongside of but eventually
will bring itself out of that spot and
to you
at least on private property now inside
the Model S nothing has changed on the
p85d just to give you a quick refresher
these cars are laid out differently than
yours
here is the giant Center LCD that can be
used in one or two modes you see Google
Maps is one you'll commonly have up
here's one that may be an eye-opener a
live web browser that even works while
you drive over there in front of the
drivers and all LCD instrument panel
with your main sort of speed and range
gauge in front of you on the left you'll
get navigation when you're under
navigation and then on the right you've
got about a handful of very quick
shortcut menus that largely replace
things that are buttons on other cars
and the media choices on these cars are
similarly monitoring of am/fm HD radio
of course then standard they include
streaming radio like slacker and tune in
through a built-in 3G radio
interestingly optional is satellite
radio only with a pricey audio upgrade
and of course you've also got bluetooth
streaming and a couple of USB ports for
mobile devices now screens that show the
new features of this car are under the
controls menu first of all if you go to
driving here's one that's very telling
acceleration can be sport or insane that
takes full advantage of both motors at
full tilt and under settings you've got
what Tesla calls their autopilot
technology and then adaptive cruise
control by the way should be able to
take us all the way down to zero and
then back up to full freeway speed as
traffic conditions warrant ok I'll be
honest with you if I'd done a top five
improvements I wanted in the existing
Model S greater performance would have
been number six just listen on my list
these are all good performing cars
however this is now one that has notable
performance as you saw in the zero to
sixty numbers these PID fives by the way
if they're P models they also have an
improved sport suspension that is also
highly variable in height so combine all
of that with the fact that you've got
that big old belly full of battery
keeping this thing planted and low
centered and it's just an amazingly
Rippey stuck to the earth performance
sedan it always takes me a little time
to get used to the fact that I have
basic needs no drive controls in this
car you just have the pedal on the right
and that's it no sport mode no Sport
Plus no need me need to get this in that
dialed in you just step on it harder
it's amazingly elegant but we're so used
to having gadgetry between us and that
it's a little jarring when you drop this
thing into insane mode like I showed you
it's insane how can a car that weighs
nearly five thousand pounds do what that
thing just did however it's also a bit
of a head-fake I would trade all of that
insane mode nonsense and all of the
seconds they've shaved on it serviced 60
time for a vastly shorter battery charge
let's not lose the real fact on electric
cars these p85d which are top of the
stack performance dual motor models are
coming in at around a hundred and six
thousand base and then we would add
about another $8,000 in options but due
to the almost $10,000 in tax credits
available at least here in California we
end up actually below the MSRP but still
not a cheap car this technology will
also be very interesting as we see the
all-wheel drive get much more accessible
in the coming Model X more cars driven
