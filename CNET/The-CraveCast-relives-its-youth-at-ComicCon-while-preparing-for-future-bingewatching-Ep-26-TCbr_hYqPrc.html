eric mack live from Cena's high desert
Bureau the annual geekfest that was
comicon 2016 it's now over but we're
still digesting all the news and
everything that we learned whether it's
the improbable revival of the
nickelodeon classic double dare all
things Star Trek beyond or the latest
pokemon developments there is so much to
rehash from the annual meeting of the
united nations of nerds a little later
on in the show we'll also get an update
from the major political conventions
going on in the US this month which
strangely have some crossover with
comic-con but first let's check in on
our panel and introduce them including
those that made the pilgrimage to
comic-con this year live in the cnet
studio there we have Kelsey Adams
Christine Caine Jeff Sparkman and behind
the controls as always Steven Beecham
howdy also still in the promised land of
San Diego via Skype is mike sorrentino
from see how you guys doing yay all
right thanks thanks everyone for joining
us today and of course we're live on
livestream and on YouTube and on cnet
and if you want to join the comments
conversation you can jump in the chat
rooms there or tweet at us at krave so
to get started Mike you're still there
in the promised land um and you got to
get going first why don't you won't you
tell us your comic-con highlights to
start things off well this was the first
time I've worked at a comic con I've
come the last few years I've never had a
pass before I'd always go outside
outside of the comic con area it
basically becomes a free disney world
this year alone there was a Gravitron
you could jump on laser tag at Petco
Park I believe in Adult Swim's theme
green area I didn't personally make it
over that last one but in terms of
inside the convention hall there was so
much going on in terms of movies
survival's i spent a particularly large
amount of time covering some of the
Nickelodeon 90s nostalgia activities
which included a the legends of hidden
temple being revived
as a television movie and to promote it
they had a virtual reality experience
where you put on a samsung gear vr and
kirk fog who is the host of that game
show is now the guide to the temple when
you go in the temple and you meet all
mac and all mac is kind of scarier he's
a little i guess a little more friendly
on the game game show this time he's
like you must complete a puzzle or
you'll be trapped here forever and
beyond that there was also nickelodeon
did a 30th anniversary of their double
dare game show which was amazing they
brought back mark summers and had
members of the all that cast compete
against each other in double dare
activities and it felt just like the
game show which apparently ended in 1993
why didn't realize that far back that
family double dare had ended i guess
because of the reruns i totally want to
play this all the sounds were all the
same they apparently did a couple press
only games before to warm up for the
facebook live and they did a full of a
leap about a twenty eight minute or so
broadcast and all of it which is on
point all the lights sounds it was crazy
how it was it was just so weird it was
like the opening was original everything
that i would you see when i was nine but
now I was in a night it was being held
in a nightclub and everyone was drinking
and you had all these kid games being
played by people now in their 20s 30s a
bean maybe in 40s it was fantastic am I
crazy to recall recently I think this
was a Kickstarter or something that
there is like a documentary being made
about Marc summers life did what did
that come up at all I didn't come up i'm
not familiar with that honestly but i
would really like to see it because he
has such a cool career i was sitting
next to a friend of his it he's a
magician now maybe he's been mentioned
the whole time i didn't know that till
till then between that and his history
on unwrapped there is a video
documentary i learned about over the
weekend about the making of double dare
I think it's at probably sat on VHS I
believe from like 1991 from a long time
ago but it went over how they filmed
like the pilot of it way back when but
there was a lot of 90s coming back Power
Rangers there reboot movie comes out
next year and the cast of that we're
making appearances all over comic-con I
attended a panel that was held at petco
park where the director dean is relied
announced that they'll reimagine alpha 5
in some way was the robot buddy that the
Rangers had and it definitely some
things a theme where they want to appeal
to people who were kids in the 90s but
are now growing up ideally with jobs and
with money to then stand on toys and
games that you said above their parents
for it's not really like the perfect
storm of 90s nostalgia lately with all
of this stuff and in Pokemon it says
it's almost it's almost too much to take
in fact it was too much to take when I
Scott when I saw Scott Baio speaker the
Republican National Convention what he
had to say was too much to take but you
also caught up with all the Star Trek
news while you were there right oh yeah
Star Trek had a pretty big blow out
there leave was the 50th anniversary
panel I've someone correct me if I had
the the number wrong thanks the they
announced that that CBS series that
comes out in 2017 will be Star Trek
discovery they showed off the ship which
I've been noticing commenters wondering
if it's now going to be a prequel based
on the design of the ship I don't have
enough familiarity honestly with the
history of Star Trek and what the ship
designations are I just saw Star Trek
beyond last night um yeah the dishes in
the main universe not to be universe oh
yeah yeah the prime universe which I had
learned from my colleague rich or Carly
Grich who was reporting that was the
universe that was the TV show before the
movies broke out yonder always thought I
was right we're a whole lot of movies
before the reboot movies but they carry
on
yea though the movies again I'm not as
familiar I'll be honest um I'm a nerd
now I appreciate it thank you the UH ya
knows that I was a cool panel too I'd
watch that panel remotely and then our
colleague went to which was at a hotel
panel with interviewing with the people
themselves about it very curious to see
how it comes out since it's going to be
releasing digitally on CBS first then on
that the all access platform the US and
Netflix everywhere else so what did
everyone else think about all the Star
Trek news and and you know any other
double dare fans anyone else have any
reactions to the stuff that might
covered oh yeah I want to go on that
double dare ya obstacle course for sure
that needs to happen let's look super
fun I hope its annual I mean I know it
was the 30th anniversary but they got to
do that again it was too too good I
think the guy look like everyone there
was just super excited so hopefully they
will bring it back so Christine was I
like for you I mean you're kind of a
different generation well I'll be quite
honest I think I actually missed that
but entirely so I didn't people seemed
really really excited about double dare
and I'm like what is that and i know i'm
just laying out my ignorance here for
everyone to see you but um what about
power rangers before after i think i was
a little bit mmm too young for it i mean
i remember watching some episodes but i
don't really remember anything cuz i was
like six yeah yeah something surreal
yeah i'm like discovering our Rangers
now because my kids are foreign to and
they just want power rangers and they
have i bought them like the big you know
the big character that puts all the
dinosaurs together with the power the
Dino Chargers and everything's though
I'm going about it all 20 years of it on
netflix and just have them watch it yeah
whole thing that'll keep them quiet for
like two days I mean do we think we're
reaching peak 90s right now it feels it
feels just like an over
filming amount I mean what what is going
on that this is happening right now I
think he's like Ariz I think those kids
are now adults yeah exactly and we have
expendable income we want to spend our
money on something and we and a lot of
us have kids too so we want to share
those memories that we have our kids so
it makes sense that's all coming around
right now yeah totally well what what
for you personally mike is the moment
from this year that that you know that
you tell friends first when when you
only talk about the trip is the double
dare what do you think it's gonna be
double dare because of the even just
getting in was a triumph because it was
strictly invite only when we first asked
they politely weren't sure but then the
day before they let us in and then they
gave us really great seats right in the
ring or everything was happening to be
able to watch Lori Beth Denberg and Josh
server it was that Danny temporarily and
Kel Mitchell as well running around
together competing and physical
challenges that's definitely for me the
biggest highlight but beyond that it was
cool to just see so many people
cosplayers and really diehard fans run
around there were people waiting I think
three hours to x star wars figures I
wasn't around by the hazard with a few
times to see if I could even get in line
and they're like nope linesville so like
that and I also don't think any point
anyway we really had a three-hour luxury
to go shopping because it was just a
busy busy week ok so I gotta know about
the Star Trek beer did you get a chance
to taste that yeah it was great it was a
this golden ale made by schmaltz Brewing
Company and this is their second beer
they've made the first one was a Vulcan
themed beer and they had it on display
that's ahead on draft at comic-con it
had a US i said this right excuse me it
was a golden ale with a sort of a light
spice to it and it was called the
trouble with tribbles based off of okay
just ever episode involved the triples
in start Star Trek trouble with that one
yeah and now as a
definitely a really refreshing and it
came with a commemorative glass which I
have nowhere near me right now
unfortunately and it was a nice sort of
thing I was talking with the owner the
company about how they got the rights
they have them for like a three year
deal i believe so they'll have a new
beer come january around that time
around the time as a new TV show so it's
definitely more Star Trek theme drinks
to come and hopefully maybe more
franchises could have like drinks to
come on actually there are already
plenty of um you can get Game of Thrones
beer lord the rings beer just Klingon
blood wine apparently I'm why wow I
actually have a whole bunch of links if
you interested I've been trying gets me
to do around it for a while ya know this
is a thing you can get totally drunk on
whatever universe you choose it's a
beautiful thing the craft brewing
revolution but don't mix them the
hangover is terrible yeah yeah that's
right oh it's a beer beer before liquor
never sicker liquor after beer have no
fear right that's that's the thing it's
at a certain age neither one works but
well hey Mike I know you gotta go I
think you're technically on vacation
there in San Diego but thanks for
calling in and filling us in on
everything comic-con this year of course
thanks for having me guys and I look I
had such a great time working with
everybody over there and up speed there
in a few days actually awesome safe
travels thanks bye everyone yeah all
right uh Mike Sorrentino ladies and
gentlemen so so Christine you were also
on location in San Diego this these past
few days right yeah that's correct and
it was my first comic con ever actually
like i haven't been to san diego
comic-con or wondercon before so i had
only read about it to sort of hone my
expectations and that's it go ahead and
what I was just to say you you used you
put together some really awesome cosplay
galleries what were what were some of
your favorite sites from San Diego well
I have to say that the the pokemon go
obviously has been
like extremely prominent just everywhere
and so you kind of expected a lot of
like last minute cause plays of Pokemon
like at the con and even just after the
con ended like each day and going in
attendees leaving and going into
downtown there were people like chanting
their names or just like freaking out
like oh my god there's you know like
whichever Pokemon here or whatever and
Jeff was there with me oh yeah yeah and
not it yeah like because downtown San
Diego is clustered with various pokay
stops and gyms so you can sort of
physically see the battles going on like
people were congregating in groups and
like physically just like trying to
claim gyms and grab Pokemon and things
like that it was very an team rivalries
were very apparent to like people were
wearing t-shirts and you know jokingly
throwing crap at like other people on
the posing teams yeah um so it's kind of
crazy but expected yeah not too many
people walking into each other walking
into walls uh I think that was walking
into Jeff I think that was the case uh
anyway just well yeah is there so many
people there you can't not walk into
people yeah it's sort of something you
have to in order to survive comic-con
you have to embrace really that you're
just going to be constantly running into
people anyway whether you like it or not
but no other than people just clustering
around bars and things like during epic
on itself people tended to be more
concerned about making their way to
panels that they really wanted to see
cuz lines are notoriously long for some
of them or just sitting down at some
random spot and just charging their
phones probably because their phones
were dying from playing pokemon go so
yeah away or may not have died because
of that yeah I brought two portable
chargers in it
pation for all of the Pokemon that I
would catch and the pokemon in San Diego
are very different yeah then the pokemon
in San Francisco like there are a lot
more fire types because Southern
California is always on fire yeah that's
the weird yeah it's really weird but
kind of nice though hoping that they get
trading up soon for the game because you
know otherwise you'd have to like travel
a lot of all over the world to get all
of the Pokemon so yeah you know I would
think between like Pokemon just like
taking photos of other cosplayers taking
selfies periscoping doing Facebook live
I would assume that like people are
running through their batteries like
crazy everyone always has a phone up is
that pretty accurate well you're either
posing you're taking a picture yeah it's
very true like sort of everyone you see
on the floor is kind of glued to their
device and whenever they see a cosplayer
that's really good you start to see a
group kind of forming a semi-circle
around them waiting yes or them forming
are really in a really informal line to
take pictures with them or take pictures
of them and for me like because I had to
photograph quite a few of them I had to
wait in many of those lines in order to
get photos for our cosplay galleries but
there's a fun experience I mean the
people who make their costumes tends to
be really passionate and usually really
really nice too like I kind of was
worried about like the infamous like
cattiness or a stubbornness or just like
being jerks in general about you know
like whenever you go to comic-con but I
didn't notice that to really be the case
except for maybe saturday when it was
the most crowded craziest busiest day
and it results in people turning a
little bit barbaric but I think that's
true for everyone even I was even the
ones not dressed up like yeah
dressed up yeah yeah i saw a panel on on
cosplay it Silicon Valley comic-con
where they were saying that cosplay
costumes that are meant to imitate movie
costumes and TV costumes are often
actually better made than the original
props because they're not meant for just
brief filming they have to be worn all
day long and comic con which is
extremely hot yeah and you know they're
on their feet all day and people are up
close to them and you know poking at
them so they actually have to be tough
for better looking better ventilated
everything than actual movie props yeah
the the stakes are quite high you can't
bring something flimsy to comic-con and
expect to leave comic-con with that yeah
including your ego yes there's always
going to be someone who complains about
like oh you're like this detail isn't
right or like you know this character's
hair is always tied in a ponytail or
something like that so I have on the
internet literally seen a guy
complaining that a woman was too short
to to be a Norse God it like a Norn
giant okay you know not many of us are
literally not possible yeah so there's
nine million Harley Quinn's right there
are so many Harley's yeah and I think
it's because of the Suicide Squad I was
wondering also done is it possible that
this is one aspect of this costume is
you can get really reckon up no thought
for God's sake man 10 yeah you can you
could wear very little clothing and it
will instantly recognizable but at the
same time I think you could go for like
flat shoes and you would still look like
a good Harley which they should be a
tactical yeah it's it was in terms of
comic-con it was a very good forgiving
choice because it was hot as balls and
yeah and you know it's just like a
breathable shirt like henley shirt and
then booty shorts and fishnets like it's
very good for warm weather um and i saw
very a ton of Suicide Squad Harley's but
very very few like other variations well
just like exactly like the original
batman the animated series like there's
I think there's like one true rendition
of that in the gallery I did but um and
I talked to the cosplayer and she said
like oh I'm doing everything indoors
it's too hot
go outside yeah you know that I was
dying and I'm you know just wearing a
t-shirt you know yeah I mean you know in
pants so they're very irritable yeah we
really they said I had to I'd svcc they
had a bunch of deadpool's which you know
is even worse than oh yes Oh herrlich
mean I saw a good couple of deadpool's
there yeah i mean not and that
incredible i saw yeah there's no the
incredibles family yeah i'm like wow
that's some dedication deep timing to
plan yeah yeah that's exactly what I
said um but yeah it was great I mean it
made me wish I had dressed up because I
I do some casual costumes myself I
wouldn't say I'm a cosplayer but I it
made me wish I like you know had you
know my full batgirl costume or my
assassins creed costume or something
like that so I could show off a bit of
my fandom too but wait I got I got your
Batman cops oh no yeah it's not that
good let's now proceed to different go
miss Dean's pretense that she's not an
amazing costume oh yeah if you scroll
down there's like well why wait why am I
telling you yes wars go through my
twitter real quick oh here you go yeah
oh yeah woman that's wonder woman and i
said i have a hover hand problem like i
do the thing that nerds do when they're
super nervous around beautiful woman
they like don't touch them they kind of
just like put their hands sort of around
them I mean that's one of the things it
was very easy oh yeah yeah it was um and
my version is Cassandra Cain who is like
I don't I know she's not that popular
but she's like a I mean that's that's
cool street cred at Comic ok very
obscure yeah one thing I love about the
way he did costumes is you you always
put your posture into it like you really
like in that you're really creating the
character at the way you're standing
it's not just about like I'm waiting at
you yeah that's actually something I
know and I I appreciate that but I'm
it's something i'm still very much
learning to do from my friends who are
more hardcore cosplayers but i noticed
at comic-con when i asked for a photo
they'd usually say sure and then like
immediately
like get into some sort of like really
really good practiced pose for their
costumes like I I mean because they
expect to be photographed so they they
want to make sure that they look good
and that comes down to even things like
making sure they get the just the right
pose down and it was really amazing to
see them in action so cool yeah Jeff did
anyone recognize spark man where your
fans there well no I said I was you know
I was keeping it on the down-low so also
i didn't i didn't actually go like
walking around the floor very much
because um i have like issues with large
groups of people so naturally I would go
to comic-con cuz I'm smart uh no
actually I spent most of my time like in
ballroom 20 checking out the panels
ballroom 20 thankfully is very nice
air-conditioned I appreciated that and
you sent us a lot of articles you
reported on a lot I don't yeah yeah I
actually did like actual work things
while I was there it wasn't all just for
fun tell us about it uh so I saw some
panels and now so like what I guess
wednesday i went to some of the the
pilot previews they i watched riverdale
the Archie show and powerless which is
the first dc-based comedy and those one
might say playing against type yeah yeah
um it's um it was just I i I've it's
like all the days are kind of blending
together at this point um not you do
either those get your stamp of approval
oh yeah yeah those are you know I was
actually surprised cuz um I with
Riverdale especially I was a little
skeptical because you know I grew up
reading Archie comics and you know I
have certain expectations of them and
when I first read the description how
it's gonna be like this dark you know
kind of like twin peaks he kind of thing
and I was like well you know because
they have like the the afterlife with
Archie titles and they've had lark in
the 60s they did like Archie's the
Archie kids as like actual superheroes
and stuff like that I so it's not
like you know unheard of for them to do
like this huge like genre shift but he
said Archie vs predator already oh no no
and and they met they met the Punisher
um they even teamed up with the I think
there was a sharknado crossover recently
which I have not checked out yet but I
mean how could I not like that you know
but um that the thing that threw me off
the most initially before I watched it
was that when they mentioned that that
like Archie was involved with miss
Grundy and like it makes sense in the
context of the show because miss Grundy
is young and very attractive but i'm
thinking of like the comic miss grande
using like white hair she's sometimes
they drew with like having one giant
tooth in the front um so that wasn't you
know there's a little bit of a change to
get used to but um I I kind of dug it I
mean it's it seems like it could go like
horrifically off the rails but like in
the awesomest way um so I mean either
way I'm kind of down to watch it and
then powerless I really liked um because
I'm a fan of workplace comedies I've as
a lot and I said in what i wrote as long
as it's not a lot of like you know oh I
understood that reference kind of stuff
like where you know they throw out the
the comic references and stuff you know
as long as the it's a comedy first and
it just happens to take place in the DC
Universe I think it should do fine I did
get to see it twice uh and you know
people were laughing at all that I mean
I still chuckled and I had just seen it
like a day or two prior so um those were
cool and then I saw the trailer the
teaser trailer for the Luke Cage show
yeah I want to know holy crap that looks
awesome um you know the thing that I
noticed the most about the end if you
watch the trailer you see this the way
that he just beats the crap out of
everybody it is just like like
nonchalant ass-kicking you know it's
it's like very fluid and graceful and I
just it looks really neat yeah they're
trying to convey his invulnerability
yeah he doesn't really have to stress
out about people shooting at him because
he knows nothing is going to happen like
the wu-tang music oh yeah
just beating everyone to death with a
car door
so cool stays up in a bender
yeah I wonder if he goes thrift shopping
cuz his clothes often have to get
replaced actually this is addressed in
the original I'm just getting started
that like cool first of all I'd like to
apologize for going actually in the
comics without sorry about that but I
also wanted to express a little
dubiousness here um I mean I liked him
and Jessica Jones but the character he's
playing definitely seems very like sweet
and innocent like the only part writing
flick he was doing a good job when he
was supposed to only be angry and
threatening mm-hmm and it seems like his
individual show here is trying to be
more like angry and threatening so I'm
just wondering he can pull it off what
do you think Jeff I think so okay you
actually saw them right oh yeah yeah
yeah I mean it's there wasn't like one
specific thing that just like sold it to
him it was just kind of like the overall
like how everything meshes together um
they showed a couple of scenes there and
there was like some really great framing
of the shot and usually I'm like I don't
notice things like that but it was it's
just just look cool you know like ihop
that hallway fight in daredevil yeah
yeah that was awesome um one take two
yeah that's crazy yeah so that and
that's a netflix joint though yeah Luke
Cage one huh yeah that should be cool
I'm I'm intrigued actually I didn't
stick with jessica jones but i'm
intrigued they also showed a little
teeny teaser for iron fist and what
sorry I that big fluffy beard what who
would ever says you that with iron fist
what's going on there sorry yeah you
know maybe he'll shave it I don't know
weird there I mean there wasn't like a
whole lot in the clip so I mean
it could have been like before whatever
and then an even briefer defenders
trailer I'm psyched for it though I like
the logo and I like the music that they
used in it and do you have that one
student no I don't that's want to do
yeah they may not have released that one
later there was so much on the stuff
that came out so much stuff that was
released I mean we can't get to it all
by any other favorites that uh know we
haven't talked about yet I really like
the flash panel cuz it's like you know
one of my favorite shows right now and
um all the DC show panels actually it
just I I was really struck by how well
the cast seems to get along like you
know not like the we're here to promote
our show let's look like we like each
other kind of way but it like like
genuine camaraderie when I watched that
fully panel yeah the flash cast just
seems so like they're having so much fun
oh yeah yeah I mean like in the flash
panel of jesse l martin and grant gustin
were like tap dancing a little brief
competition there and we're all waiting
for that all musical episode oh yeah and
then in the arrow panel um even though I
have not watched arrow very much um I
was you know I was still interested
because of the enthusiasm they had about
they also ended the the arrow panel by
singing a song from Hamilton wait and
then they really yeah you'll be back
which I'm not going to sing speaking of
dancing superheroes one of my favorite
parts of comic-con was actually the
cosplay masquerade because yeah what's
up okay so so it was basically a fashion
show / talent show with 35 contestants
showing off their various cause plays
and the intermission actually was when
my favorite parts because it involves a
dance crew called core i believe and it
was just it just showcased they were all
dressed as x-men and dancing
yeah it was so perfect yeah oh man like
just seeing if every yes I'm gonna love
it I'm just gonna watch it again cuz
it's so mesmerizing I'm just gonna say
that that right there was the most fun
Cyclops has ever had I'm tired I same
goes for Wolverine I think every needs
to grow beard oh yeah I don't know it's
more aerodynamic without the beard um
but yeah it was so fun and the one other
thing that happens that I didn't really
expect was a marriage proposal happened
on stage well one of the contestants or
rather two of them were you know in the
middle of a kylo Ren and Ray battle skit
and and you know as ray like not siloed
down with the force like he got down on
one knee and maybe I'm just bitter but I
was like uh I know what this guy's and
sure enough he pulled out a ring and
knocked at least annealing kneeling
leads to proposes yeah yeah and I just
joked with Tanya who was my colleague
who was there with me at the time that
this is actually very much following the
the the star wars tradition of being
incestuous assuming that you know ray
actually is related is related yeah if
they're if they really are cousins you
know um a lot of people come in and done
on that tweet and someone also included
the video but I guess we already looked
at the picture yeah it's fine I mean
that it's pretty much what you think you
are you'd expect yeah but yeah it was
very eventful and it was crazy to see
like the fun skits that people came up
with and stuff it was really good I
actually have a question for you guys so
I've read the were followed the live
blog for Marvel's big presentation in
Hall H and with a couple exceptions like
they had a big skit for guardians of the
galaxy apparently we're Ravagers burst
in and oh damn saying a lot of jokes and
there was a kind of mockumentary of
Thor's private life in between movies
where he was doing all these mundane
things which they don't appear to have
really
we work and expected him to do that yeah
and Marvel hasn't really released I
guess it's a DVD extra um but for
everything else it just seemed to go by
so fast I mean yes okay here's this star
here's the star here's this star we're
very happy about this movie Next and it
was it really like that we knew there
it's hard to see how it could be worth
flying all those famous people out well
I didn't I want I didn't have like three
days to wait in line so I didn't
actually attend any of the hull age
stuff but in and all the stuff in like
ballroom 20 and the other room that
looks like an eye chart for the name I
can't remember which one was um 27 b c d
anyway um some small room no it was a
small I thought it was small based on
the name but no that was the one where I
was like out in the heat waiting in line
and I was going to complain about being
hot but then I'm like well okay there's
Jon Snow in armor there I can't really
complain oh yeah there was a jon snow
cause player who really looked like Kit
Harington I wish I got a photo but he
was going the other way but I was like
as he but you know when looks like from
the back yeah well like I saw him and he
was crossing and I tried to give his
attention but there were so many people
and someone yelled the king of the north
and looks confused for a second and said
I know nothing and it was that that was
that um but my only um celebrity
experience at comic-con was actually a
gout de toute coming TV Wonder Woman
75th anniversary panel and she actually
spent like pretty much all the panel's
there she came a little bit late because
it was supposed to be like the surprise
reveal um but yeah she she was really
she seemed really nice and she gave her
insights on filming the new Wonder Woman
movie and just like I mean little things
like oh we had to like film you know six
days a week for six months in like
freezing cold conditions and I wasn't
wearing very much and it was kind of
uncomfortable but we did it anyway and
yeah it it made me kind of excited for
Wonder Woman I mean I wasn't I really
did not like man of steel so I avoided
you know Batman V Superman but I'm like
cautiously excited for Wonder Woman I
think it could be good the trailer can't
look to me like something I would watch
on Netflix which is a big step up from
vs Superman yeah and I might actually go
to justice league in the theaters I
couldn't like that trailer yeah I dug I
dug that uh the Wonder Woman lot one
look really neat yeah like I'm like well
cuz you guys know what I thought of
Batman vs Superman it is slightly less
than excited about well I think what we
all thought well simple like it and you
know that's cool I just was one of the
ones who did hear it's very popular in
the Aflac household yeah um I don't know
I am reserving my judgment i will give
Wonder Woman the chance but I'm not as
hiked about it as people at the pan will
seem to be so i think i have finally
come to accept the fact that they're not
doing the original Wonder Woman this is
the modern character it's completely
different she's a fighter it's more Xena
hmm it's just gonna be different i
snooped it looks like Xena yeah I think
that's one of the reasons why I might be
okay with watching the movie because I'm
very much into Greek mythology and you
know like her mother for instance like
Queen Hippolyta and you know general and
Anne Tiffani I think that's how you
pronounce it like they're actually based
off of like Greek mythological figures
and that might be one reason why I'm
okay we're kind of giving you a chance I
mean I'll have to change some things
because your old enemy was Ares war now
she's a warrior so she works for him
yeah how does that work but ya know it's
I mean this is what they've been doing
the Wonder Woman for some time now Jeff
keeps explaining that to me and I
finally accepted that we've moved on and
things are different so plus I'll a
crisp I yeah i'll give it a chance fair
enough well i'm gonna force a connection
a really rough connection to what i was
doing last week which actually Stephen
if you look at the very bottom of the
google doc I just put in two weeks 12 a
video went to an Instagram post we can
throw up the video i was in cleveland
while everyone was getting ready to go
to comic-con for the republican national
convention here in the US i went to
cover how social media was going to
cover the convention but interestingly
while i was there
I found that there was an odd like comic
connection to what was going on at the
RNC in Cleveland and I know if you've
got the the video there Stephen but we
came across these two guys who were in
town from New York a pair of brothers
and this guy was walking around with a
huge like ipad pro size tablet and just
sketching on the tablet caricatures of
people he ran into in Cleveland like in
comic book style he's a comic comic
artist and while he was doing that his
brother was filming him and they they
called the whole thing blogging do you
have that video Stephen yeah I'm trying
to load it right now let's say you're
going out for dinner plate a commercial
find the best way to get there it's
gonna take a minute it's playing a
30-second commercial yeah okay so yeah
these two brothers they have the digital
caricatures going on and then the other
brother is a video artist and so he is
he's videotaping the entire encounter
you know of these people being
caricatured and kind of getting a little
bit more of a flavor of who they are
then the entire thing you know the
videos and the caricature is in the
graphics and everything almond up on
their blog and so that's what we were
talking about on streets of Cleveland
Public on right here snap chatters and
vloggers to bloggers and vloggers yes
bloggers that's actually not a word I
made up but these guys have made up
their own style of Gauguin we're doing
basically is um if blogging is
traditional media digital media and say
for instance vlogging is when you're
incorporating video in digital media
blogging it's when you're incorporating
graphics in digital media quaggan oh my
gosh yes block we're glad loggers and
we're glugging we run a Glock know what
you're thinking and yes they're twins
twin bloggers basically
yeah Tim fielder has been walking around
Cleveland and Tim draw portraits of
people in town for the RNC right there
on his big tablet and while he's doing
that his brother Jim is filming Tim
drawing the people and then all that the
drawings maybe some video and some text
all end up on the brothers glog which is
at diesel funcom and 23 vlogging nice
that's awesome that's super cool I'm
sorry I just didn't they were there with
comics cast sent you some some comments
to the RNC and so I also ran into one of
the guys that the caricature there the
guy fish who had the the sick turban on
actually ran into him how long I'm
Slater and that's the the Instagram
photo do you have that there we did a
periscope live with him actually from
fourth Street in Cleveland but my
photographers with got that really cool
instagram photo of him so it was
interesting there was this kind of
bizarre comic book connection what comic
con was going on there was a little
flavor of it even in Cleveland at the
RSC that's awesome I remember reading
about a guy who did this last year too
is it known if it's the same guy first
name starts fish yeah I would be I would
be surprised these are these are like
all new york comic comic book artists
who were making the pilgrimage a
supercool guys was already has much
cosplay there oh i bet then as I mean
cuz i know there's the one guy there who
looks kind of like an oompa loompa but i
don't know if he's actually cosplaying
but i was just kind of curious what
about pokemon it's a lot of Uncle Sam
cosplaying there what there were there
were a few Uncle Sam's running around
and there were yeah a lot of the Act a
lot of the activists and protesters had
some some interesting costumes people in
in the convention the delegates even had
an interesting costumes not on the scale
of comic-con and not anything I can
really comment on more than anything
there were just 5,000 police there were
all totally cool they had a ton of
I cops there um which I think was a much
more a lot much less intimidating
presence hey it was interesting everyone
got along great I had kind of gone
assuming that there might be some
violence or protests breaking out but
honestly by the end of the by the end of
thursday i witnessed a guy there from
the group truckers for Trump playing
ping pong against a guy from the black
lives matter movement so it was pretty
it was pretty kumbaya nice so um I think
that's about all the time we have any
final thoughts on on Comic Con 2016 I
want to sleep now yes see which is what
tania's damn yeah I slept until 2pm p.m.
yesterday uh which is very unlike me it
was just a lot of early night or early
mornings and really late nights of just
constant working yeah because the team
we had was rather small it's such a big
event so it's we you know it was
impossible to cover everything but um we
really tried and that definitely cut
into our sleep by a lot sounds like CES
without the endless tables of iphone
cases yeah yeah here instead of that I
think it was like tons of like artists
selling their work which was a nice
place to get gifts oh yeah yeah and I
think that's much more exciting than
endless booths of iphone cases I'll take
that any day oh yeah especially cuz i
own an android all right well on that
note I think that does it for the crave
cast for for this month thanks everybody
for making the pilgrimage down to San
Diego and then back to to tell us about
it and will be definitely looking
forward to some of these things hitting
Netflix hitting movie theaters hitting
the airwaves and the cable waves if
there are such a thing and we'll
definitely be talking about them on a
future episode of the creative cast so

Kelsey Adams Stephen Beecham and Jeff
