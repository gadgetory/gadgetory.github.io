balloons last words to his dad watch me
pop oh my god that's horrible hey what's
going on it's time for another episode
of quick question this week we're
talking all about Amazon Alexa right
here joining me is the Amazon a word
expert Ben Fox Ruben what's up in hello
how are you good
Fox where's that come from I made it up
you made up Fox
so what big deal all right I'm not gonna
fight him about it let's get into the
questions first one from Thomas I
purchased one of these for my father for
Christmas I set up his account and log
in so is it ethical for me to look up
his questions and laugh at them he is
noted for asking ridiculous questions
hmm the operative word is ethical no
it's not that's a clearly on a it's not
ethical but it's not illegal and it's
your dad there you go it's your dad
I'm not I'm not saying you should go and
do this but I'm also saying it would
probably be hilarious Tim Mooney asks
now that real doll is in the collector's
edition biz which they are they they're
coming out with like a special kind of
toy for a video game it's a long story
is there any chance of a special edition
real doll at little X Alexa what is real
doll real doll they make like life-sized
dolls that you can be intimate with sex
dolls yeah bankable dolls Oh God
listening to this whole thing she said
sorry and I agree with her this is a
hard no I'm sorry Tim it's not gonna
happen
you have your answer Tim I can tell you
what they think is the definition of
Chula would you get intimate in a room
you knew how to LexA in it or would you
make sure to unplug it first man that's
a good question cuz I'm sure that's been
a problem for some people what would you
do I don't see an issue with that I mean
it would that would really we're in the
moment yeah but my accident Alexa got
triggered during some heightened moment
of intimacy it would be strange if that
were to happen yes but it is also a
smart speaker so
you could be playing R&amp;amp;B you know Keith
Sweat or what have you in the room so
Alexa is a useful companion for that
Alexa you watch me I don't know that
okay maybe I mean like she's she's
claiming she doesn't know but she knows
Adam cook how does Alexa pronounce Super
Mario Brothers and for the record your
way is the right way Jeff thanks Adam
yes you're right totally good Jack yeah
all right we win okay let's ask her
Alexa Simon Says Super Mario oh cool it
doesn't matter it doesn't count it's
okay it's not human it's also she's from
Seattle people from Seattle talk weird
everybody knows weird super Mario's
favorite Mario games Mario Mario Eric
Harper says do you think there will be
future versions of Alexa that feature a
human or Android like face that is a
very good oh my god this is starting to
get annoying
that's a great question though because
this is like is that gonna help humanize
Alexa or is it just gonna be super weird
and creepy
yeah it's entirely possible that we move
in that direction and Alexa is more than
just like some thing in the ether that
you talk to but I I asked them that last
year and they said no we're not working
on it right now
yeah let maybe let's remove a face from
Amazon's digital assistant I don't
really want that andrew says if the
laughs can't be stopped
who's left would you prefer to spook you
in the night this is going back when he
when Amazon Alexa was laughing for no
reason so let's ask her what her laugh
is right now Alexa can you laugh sure I
can laugh okay literally anything but
that yeah I mean nobody laughs teehee I
do sometimes what I'm tickled you know
it's Maria it's a good TV sometimes
really you teehed a genuine teehee oft
he'd get out of here why do people call
Alexa and AI when it's more akin to a
voice recognition UI that's a good
question I guess we're you know we might
be splitting hairs there
it is a UI to a certain extent that's a
user interface but you could also sit
and claim that it's an artificial
intelligence the more you talk to it the
better it gets at voice recognition does
it learn it learns insofar as that there
are a bunch of software engineers that
like take the information to make Alexa
better so I don't think that it's
directly maybe Alexa isn't learning on
its own but it's you know through human
curation it's always getting alright so
I guess we could consider it AI to some
degree yeah how creeped out should I be
that Alexa is quote always listening it
seems just a bit too weird to put an
internet-connected microphone in my
kitchen and my just paranoid is the
benefit worth the risk is risk the right
word
I mean look yes you are paranoid but
that's okay
if you're a consumer that doesn't like
this thing then don't buy it nobody's
making you for other people they're like
perfectly fine with having it and Amazon
constantly talks about the fact that the
mic is always listening but it's always
listening specifically for Alexa not
anything else what wake where do you use
do you use computer no I use Alexa and
Alexa is a very you know regular part of
the house I have a five-year-old cheese
size Alexa all the time my 3 year old
says Alexa mm-hmm it's kind of weird
like that they're growing up in like a
house where there's a voices system
that's just now there all the time by
the water you know they play music cuz
you doesn't think there's like a person
in there no they do they do and they say
it's a person that's trapped there's a
little person person trapped inside and
we pay a subscription service to keep
them in there that's alright that's
gonna do it for another episode of quick
