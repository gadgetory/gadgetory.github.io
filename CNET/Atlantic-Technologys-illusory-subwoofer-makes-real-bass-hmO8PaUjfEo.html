and we're taking a look at the Atlantic
technology PB 235 power bar this is an
innovative sound bar that claims it can
deliver true deep bass without a
separate subwoofer and it's currently
selling for a little over seven hundred
dollars the first thing you'll notice is
that it is huge this is nothing like the
slim plasticky sound bars you'll see
lining the shells at Best Buy and that
size is more than just an aesthetic
problem as its 6.5 inch height will
likely obscure part of your screen if
you try and just place it in front of
your TV so you're either going to need a
riser to lift up your TV or you'll have
to wall mount either your TV or sound
bar now that's a bit more work than the
typical sound bar requires especially
because wall mounting is no easy task
with the bars 26 pound weight the design
is mostly symmetrical except for an
awkward bump in the middle on the front
that bowl tells us some of the front
panel controls and a display which is
nicely you can see how loud the system
is playing on the back are the inputs
and it's a generous selection including
two optical inputs one coaxial and an
analog input that's nice but you won't
need to take advantage of all those
ports on the back if you end up using
your TV as the switcher the included
remote is a bit of a disappointment for
a system this expensive it's just a
chintzy credit card style remote with
mushy buttons and it feels cheap at
least the buttons are laid out well but
you'll want to plan on replacing it with
a solid universal remote like a Logitech
Harmony the real draw of this system is
its sound quality specifically its
ability to make true deep bass without a
separate sub woofer I was pretty
skeptical of the marketing claims but we
had resident audiophile Steve Guttenberg
give it a listen and he was seriously
impressed with the amount and quality of
the basic produces even head-to-head
with our reference Harman Kardon SB 16
sound bar which has a huge wireless
subwoofer the PB 235 actually sounded
better with plenty of low-end for home
theater now it's still a sound bar so
it's not going to sound
better than a pair of tower speakers
with an AV receiver especially with
music but it does deliver best-in-class
sound quality for sound bar which is
incredible for a system without a
subwoofer the real question is whether
the PB 235 is worth its high price and
impractical design personally I don't
find a subwoofer to be that imposing on
a living room so the PB 235 seems like a
lot of work to avoid a problem that
might not bother you that much but if
you want the no subwoofer sound bar
experience the PB 235 is offering and
you're willing to pay for it it's an
outstanding performer with some truly
innovative speaker technology I'm
Matthew miskovic and this is the
Atlantic technology PB 235 sound bar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
