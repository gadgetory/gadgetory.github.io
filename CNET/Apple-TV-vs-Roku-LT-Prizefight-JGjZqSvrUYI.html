Tanya we have a battle for streaming
media Fox supremacy
it's a prize five punch-out between
Apple TV and the Roku LT now we'll take
each round score an average the mounts
in the nearest tenth of a point the
final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds in the same
decimal system let's get this party
started
round one is designed the Roku LT and
its new design takes cues from the Apple
TV it's smaller in size and adds
personality with purple but it's fabric
tag still belongs on jeans more than it
does on a set-top box
Apple stays true to tradition and can
even make a streaming box look good with
its sexy minimalism it's about 25%
larger than the Roku but you won't
really notice either of these next year
TV we're calling this round an even tie
at four points apiece next round is
interface and navigation the Roku LT has
a simple interface that's very
utilitarian with its single row
navigation it won't wow you visually but
it gets the job done and it's easy to
customize by adding channels for your
favorite content with a straightforward
remote now the Apple TV interface is a
clean and elegant experience that you
expect animations are smooth and its
interface really feels polished there's
no real customization here but it's
remote is easy to use as well the Apple
TV gets a perfect 5 and the Roku LT gets
a 4 chopped are averaging two rounds the
Vague a leads by half a point round
three is features with a media box you
want options and the Roku LT strips down
to the bare and I mean bare essentials
it connects to any TV with HDMI for up
to 720p output or there's a custom AV
port for composite video there's 802 11
and Wi-Fi and doesn't undone a power
cable now if you're looking for more
you'll find it in its bigger brother the
Roku 2 but not here the Apple TV also
brings HDMI with 720p support and 802 11
and Wi-Fi but you'll also have options
for optimal audio out and an Ethernet
port but then you jump into the software
where being part of the Apple ecosystem
has its advantages airplay support
allows you to play and display
content directly from your iOS devices
and even mirror your iPad to screen to
the Apple TV if you pay $24.99 a year
for the iTunes Match service you'll be
able to access your entire music
collection through the Apple TV and if
you use the iCloud you'll also be able
to view your photo stream plus Windows
machines and Mac's can share their music
collection through home sharing in
iTunes the Apple TV is feature-packed if
you live completely in the Apple
ecosystem but it still brings a punch
Apple takes this round with a perfect 5
and the Roku LT gets slugged with a 3
next round is content with media
streaming boxes content is king now you
have Netflix with both boxes but that's
not enough to satisfy our hunger the
Roku shines with over 100 channels of
content like Amazon video on-demand
Hulu Plus and HBO GO which cover your
movies and TV shows
then there's Pandora for music discovery
and social services like Facebook and
Flickr have apps there's on-demand
sports for the NHL and NBA and specific
content like our own CNET channel or
stuff for the kiddies with the Disney
Channel the Roku's media options are
endless
and customizable now beyond Netflix
Apple's box has access to content from
the iTunes store to purchase TV shows
and movies but that's about it they've
added support for on-demand sports
including Major League Baseball but when
you're talking Apple TV's additional
online services like YouTube and Vimeo I
can count them on my two feet the Roku
punch is back with a perfect 5 and the
Apple TV gets a 3 but after averaging 4
rounds Apple still holds it to lead by 3
tenths of a point the final round that
decides it all is value
the Roku LT makes a statement with the
lowest-priced streaming box on the
market that's all about value at $49.99
now that's a price that makes you go wow
now the Apple TV has remained at its $99
price point but are you really getting
50 bucks more worth of value if you're a
fruit lover it might make sense but it's
pretty limited if you're not in the
Apple ecosystem in the final round
Roku throws another bow with the perfect
five and Apple gets a three so let's
average out all five rounds and in a
battle where Apple was rolling the Roku
LT surged back in the end taking this
faceoff for point two to four and is
your prize fight winner if you want a
streaming box with the most content at
the best price then the Roku LT is
really the one for you
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching it
we'll catch you guys next time for
another prize fight
