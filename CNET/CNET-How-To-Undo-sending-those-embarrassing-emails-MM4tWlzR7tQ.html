really didn't want to get out now there
is an unsend option in gmail before it
used to be a labs only feature so it was
in beta but now it's available to
everyone and I'll show you how you can
activate it open up gmail on the web and
then click the settings cog scroll down
to the settings option and then make
sure you're in the general tab then all
you need to do is go down until you see
a feature called undo send you need to
click enable undo send then choose the
timeout period between when you click
send on the email and when the email is
actually sent now simply scroll to the
bottom of the page click Save Changes
and you're ready to go so now to test it
out i'm going to send an email
complaining about things to my best
friend but accidentally put my boss as a
recipient subject line you will never
believe what happened today and just for
good measure i'm going to include a
funny animated image and then click send
and then all of a sudden when i see send
i can suddenly hit undo at the top which
i'm going to definitely want to do
because otherwise it's going to my boss
once I've hit undo you'll then see the
email pop back up again and you can
either edit it or probably on the safe
side deleted that's a look at gmail undo
send feature if you want to find out the
