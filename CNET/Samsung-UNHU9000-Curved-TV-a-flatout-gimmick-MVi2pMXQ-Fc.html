and next to me is the world's first 4k
curved LED LCD TV this is Samsung's best
TV for 2014 it's the hu 9000 series I'm
having to be next to a 65 inch member
there's also a 55 and a 79 insurer in
the series this is a really really nice
looking television externally it's got
samsung's patented all picture look
around the edges really really thin
bezel nice silver finish and of course
is silver stand beneath it the stand is
curved to kind of accentuate that radius
it's pretty much identical to the radius
of the television Samsung tells the
ideal seating distance is pretty much
where you want to sit although you know
ideally you do want to be a little bit
closer to this curve to you to
experience what Samsung calls that
immersion in my experience that
immersion really isn't that immersive
there's really no major difference in
watching this TV versus watching a flat
TV so you do get a little bit of a
distortion when you watch this TV you
can see a little bit of a bowtie effect
slightly where the edges are a little
bit bigger than the middle there's some
other distortions if you move off angle
that are again relatively subtle the
curve is pretty cool looking in person
especially when you look at it from the
side you show somebody hey look at my
new cool curved TV but in practice in
terms of picture quality really doesn't
have that big of a benefit the one
exception is it does reduce reflections
some was if you have a really reflective
room with a lot of lights in the
background this TV will catch fewer of
them than a flat TV but aside from that
the curve really isn't that big of a
deal this TV has all the features you
could ask for it's got a built in camera
it's got samsung's patented smart TV
suite it's got this fancy remote control
that's got motion control on us a little
bit like a Nintendo Wii mode nice part
about that remote is you don't need to
aim it at the television you go around
back the inputs are special on this TV
as well there's none on the back of the
television in fact the inputs are all
removed to a separate box Samsung calls
one connect which is little silver box
here it's got four HDMI a smattering of
USB on it of course all those HDMI ports
can handle 4k video at 60 frames per
second if something new comes down the
road Samsung promises to have future one
connect boxes that'll handle those
different connectivity types and smart
TV Suites another extra on this TV is
this little 4k content pack so only a
few movies in here including the
counselor and GI Joe and World War Z
they're actually in 4k though so you can
demo by plugging this little box into
the one connects USBs port and get some
4k video right away on the flipside that
really isn't much other 4k content
available there is Netflix available on
4k you can stream house of cards season
two and Breaking Bad but aside from that
it's really not all that much 4k video
out there on the other hand the cyan TV
looks great with pretty much any
resolution source it has excellent black
levels thanks to the best local dimming
I've tested on any Samsung TV the set
also has very good color and video
processing so all told you're going to
get it a great picture out of this set
so even with the curve the HU 9000 is
definitely one of the best performing 4k
TVs I've tested this year not quite the
best but extremely good of course it'll
cost you a lot of money and once again
that curve isn't really going to affect
your image quality that much at all in
hero direction that's a quick look at
Samsung's hu 9000 high-end 4k curved
television for 2014 I'm David Katz I
