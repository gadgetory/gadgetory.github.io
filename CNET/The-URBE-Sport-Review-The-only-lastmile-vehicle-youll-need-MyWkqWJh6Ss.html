whole last mile solution thing all about
you might have heard about it and it's
really a class of electronic vehicles
that allows you to cover short distances
maybe finish something like your commute
or get you around town without the need
for a car now I've tried things like the
Eco rico's scooter or a boosted board
and I don't like the idea of standing up
plus they just aren't versatile enough
and I'm not willing to spend $1,000 for
that but now enter the Irby sport I
didn't use this for a quick ten minutes
just for a review I use the Irby sport
GT for over a week in my real life they
like to call it a foldable electric
vehicle I like to just call it badass
now the company launched with the Irby
classic in 2015 it started at $1500 it
was a little too rich for what I was
looking for until they introduced the
new Irby sport that's cheaper starting
at 899 and 20% lighter in weight at 30
pounds the sit down experience feels
natural from the start I don't want to
be standing all the time when I'm on the
go what makes this unique how about a
removable battery that not only powers
the Irby sport but can be used as a
portable power source with 4 USB 2.0
ports and a USB C let me repeat myself a
removable battery that can be used as a
portable power source yeah awesome at
full capacity it can charge an iPhone 40
x or a MacBook five times
you can even charge your phone while
you're riding and there's a phone mount
that's an extra attachment and there's
more like a cup mount or even a cargo
basket that can be used to grab some
groceries now the battery covers 16
miles of travel and the Irby sport hit
speeds of 14 to 18 miles per hour sure
it's not the fastest but honestly it's
fast enough I'm not here to knock the
boosted board but do you really want to
be riding 20 miles per hour standing up
I don't
one challenge 30 pounds isn't something
that everyone can carry around easily
for me it's not that bad because I can
curl 50s but there is some effort the
point of these last mile rides is really
to take them out only carry our wheel
them around for short distances maybe
even steps before you head out now let's
compare what's out there a boosted board
is the lightest electronic vehicle
weighing around 15 pounds it starts at
$12.99 with a twenty mile per hour top
speed and a seven mile range with a
standard battery but I'll never feel
safe on one the Eco reco s3 model starts
at 799 it's about twenty nine pounds
with the top speed of 20 miles per hour
as well and anywhere from a 10 to 20
mile range now another cool part of this
story Irby is made here in the good ole
USA not just assembled we're talking
about manufactured and assembled right
here in Pasadena like literally there's
a mall over here there's a BJ's a
Subway's right next door there's a dim
sum house on site and Irby comes off the
production line every 15 minutes they
even have a tumbler that removes burrs
or rough edges on parts why did I show
you this because it's cool
I live two point seven miles from work
by car that's about a ten minute drive
by Irby it's roughly eighteen minutes
now I do wish there was an option to get
the softer pneumatic tires that handle
bumps and divots a lot better but I get
it they want someone like me to make the
jump to the pro but let me be clear this
isn't for everyone it depends on where
you live the weather and what type of
things are around you but there's
actually a growing group of people that
could benefit from this like any of
these last mile rides prices range all
over the place when you're talking about
quality you're looking at something
around the $1,000 price range now the
urban sport is in that range and when
you really stack up its foldable design
it's removable battery and its ability
to hold cargo beyond just a backpack
come on this by far is the best last
mile ride oh yeah and one more thing and
that's a feature to Fanta there's a body
good
