a look at the toshiba portege are 835
now this is a laptop we have reviewed at
least a couple of times before this
slightly updated version is called a p88
edition and it takes a whole different
meaning on now that we're looking at it
after the first generation of ultrabook
laptops that's because we originally saw
the portege are a 35 it really became
one of our favorite laptops it was a
13-inch laptop kind of like the macbook
guy had a metal body it was relatively
lightweight really good battery life
decent performance and it was well under
a thousand dollars which made it a very
affordable alternative to those 13 inch
apple laptops now since then we've seen
all these really thin less than an inch
ultrabooks most of them are 13 inch
models toshiba even has one they're a
little bit less powerful they get rid of
things like the optical drive and a lot
of the ports and connections so when we
got a chance to take a look at our old
favorite the r8 35 again I really
thought we weren't going to like it as
much and it definitely does feel
different now it feels like a bigger
bulkier laptop compared to some of these
super thin ultrabook and ultrabooks
style ones that we've seen but you know
what at the end of the day I ended up
still liking the r8 35 a lot that's
because at about three and a half pounds
it's still very light and still
reasonably fit not a thin as an
ultrabook but you do get the full
voltage processor you get plenty of
porting connections and of course you
get that optical drive that's missing
from pretty much all the ultrabooks so
if you want something that's kind of in
that same vein but keeps all those
full-featured kind of things like the
optical drive and the full voltage
processor and really good battery life
then this is a fairly reasonable
compromise to make in order to get
something that's kind of in between
let's say a 13-inch MacBook Pro and a 13
inch ultrabook the best thing is these
guys use around eight nine hundred
dollars i found this particular version
2 p 88 on sale for 699 at a couple of
places if you can get it for that then
it's a real steal eight or nine hundred
then maybe you do want to look at one of
the Ultrabook options out there i'm dan
ackerman and that is the toshiba portege
are 835 dash
