headphones that attract a lot of
attention and like to listen to your
music super loud well these headphones
will definitely do the job it's just a
new 4c net and this is a first look at
the monster 24k over ear headphones so
these are actually DJ headphones but the
only thing that really sets them apart
are the ear cups that rotate backward to
let DJ's listen to their music while
queuing up the next song another thing I
like about them is the detachable cable
on the left ear cup that lets you
replace the wire if it shorts out or if
you need a longer one a coiled cable is
included in the box for DJs and there's
another one with the remote and
microphone built into the wire that lets
you control your smartphone these things
do look pretty bulky like a lot of
monster headphones but you'll probably
be really surprised at how light they
really are and they're pretty
comfortable to wear for a while too
thanks to the padding underneath the
headband and the cushy memory foam ear
cups in terms of performance these
things are great for anyone that listens
to their music loudly without Distortion
and you'll definitely get a lot of bass
out of them but not at the sacrifice to
any of the other frequencies and you'll
also get much better performance on
these compared to your stock earbuds you
can read more details about this
headphone on CNET but that's gonna do it
for this video I'm Justin you these are
the monster 24k DJ headphones thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
