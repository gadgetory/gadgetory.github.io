stage here at si si s 2012 we're on the
scene that stage this is gonna be a
reunion of sorts we had 50 here last
year he's coming back making some more
noise ladies and gentlemen put your
hands together make some noise 50 cent
in the house I think you guys have you a
little better than that come on 50 cent
in the house oh yeah we got a boost in
morale around here how you doing man I'm
good man I'm sorry Uniting it feels so
good yeah man this is the second year in
a row see yes you know I come out this
time is I actually have physical product
at retail yeah you no wonder you've kind
of been through the CES experience
because sometimes Proctor announced that
don't make it but right you're brick
you're bringing a product this year
right exactly that I was here and I had
a really nice picture last year and then
I went through the process manufacturing
process and rebuilding my actual company
I'd acquire Kona audio in order to
create SMS audio and launch this actual
project so let's talk about the
headphones for a moment right
this is SMS audio this is your company
right and can you kind of talk about
some of the technology because I love
the wireless aspect of what you have
yeah well the marquee product from SMS
Audio this year's the sync has said it's
a wireless headset a lot of the wireless
headsets that you see on the CES floor
or utilizing Bluetooth technology which
was originally created for
telecommunications so it does it
compress the statue allows so it doesn't
have the same sound quality the sync
headset uses a clear wireless 16-bit
technology that allows you to be 50 feet
away from your source of music and they
sync up to four headsets to one source
and because I wanted to make sure that
they had the highest quality sound for
all genres of music is set at the best
possible sound quality and then as like
a bass booster for someone who
would like to listen to it with
additional bass has a homeboy EQ that
allows you to volume up by them down
fast forward and to rewind tracks from
the actual headset so you pretty much
just did a product demo right here
really quick he's on it now 50 also with
SMS audio with the clear technology it
goes what 50 feet 50 yeah and uh full CD
audio quality right right alright that's
that's killer now another thing that
maybe a lot of people don't know about
what 50s been doing lately is your
Street King initiative and right that
ties into the headset yeah Street King
actually was traveling you know my music
has taken me places that I didn't even
imagine you know I've been all over the
world and when I was touring in Africa I
came across something that was a bit
more extreme than low income housing and
I actually come from and I wanted to do
something about it I know what it feels
like not to have money but not to have
anything to eat is a whole nother level
of not having and when I got back I
started working on an actual project so
I created an energy drink just called
Street King and with I partnered with
the United Nations World Food Programme
to provide a meal with every bottle of
the energy drink the soul I thought it
was important partner with the
organization as well established as the
United Nations to create confirmation to
the general public that it would
actually reach its charity you know and
because it's the organization it would
provide aid for Haiti during this
earthquake or Japan during the tsunami I
felt like it was sufficient and
following that what I got through social
networking my Twitter into Facebook all
these other things that I utilized was
50 we got we need we got people hungry
here you know and when you look into it
one in six Americans is actually we got
one six Americans with in hunger now
here in America so it is actually issue
is not a third-world issue it's a world
issue and what I did was I partnered
with feeding America which is the
largest
the leading domestic charitable
organization against hunger in America
and with the purchase of these headsets
to SMS audio.com
with each person from the US 200 mils is
provided for each actual headset to so
see that's incredible guys I mean you
got to give a round of applause this is
this is this is a shift right I mean
honestly last year you're here right no
pace in the headphones we're talking
about how much you won yeah you get any
winnings this year or how you doing
right now but this is you know this is a
shift that we've seen you being a lot
more involved in philanthropy I mean
right the maturation of 50 cent
absolutely I want to promote conscious
capitalism or Flinn tropical you know to
find finances that we seem to not be
able to find through our actual
governments I think the way I do it is
through business you know according to
World Bank numbers one percent of
business would alleviate all extreme
poverty so I feel like if I can actually
influence my peer and we can influence
other young entrepreneurs to create
create a new standard that will allow us
to to find to find that actual to
finances to make a change I think with
the major corporations that are out
there now that the major shareholders to
give up 1% of the actual shareholdings
wouldn't change 1% of their lifestyle
but they're just not conditioned to give
so you know you gotta start somewhere
there you go now you also talked about
your experiences you know with Twitter
and hearing from the people you know you
love Twitter you were there before
Twitter existed you're here no wit
Twitter there what are your thoughts on
it I'm excited to see these companies
grow like that's even a big example like
Google's only 10 years old and we know
what the value of that company is not if
it came in under this type of business
model would be really exciting so for
those people who don't aren't interested
in an energy drink or a headset you know
the business model itself is exciting
and I was inspired by the Tom shoe model
where if you buy one
a pair of his shoes he provides shoes
for someone in need I just feel like
people can't eat shoes no home does the
issue let's just do it a different way
you know I put the remix on it and let's
see how far we can actually take it now
also just reading about some of the
things that you put on Twitter recently
like you're already smiling right your
mind sets in a different place you know
I don't know if it was blown out of
proportion but you did mention how you
know life is short right you might you
might die soon and everyone's like what
is fitty like suicidal but no it was a
different message you know but you know
I got a certain amount of characters
what I was trying to say is you know you
don't know what do you want your legacy
to be I want to be more than a guy who
created a few cool songs or was able to
memorize the lines and have decent
performances and film projects I won't
be someone who impacts a lot of people's
lives in a positive way so I'm a little
more conscious with the things I'm doing
in business to try and get back and make
a difference this is this is a 50 that
I've never seen before guys seriously
like this is a great message that you're
giving out to the people
yeah I'm time I had to figure out a
whole new approach since you bought
Wayne Brady up here before I got can't
try to joke when the comedians is
different you're still jokester yeah you
know I try to enjoy myself you know I'm
saying but you know I do believe life is
short and because humans a habit-forming
and we look forward to the future we
don't want to think about it probably
all got bank accounts looking everybody
here you know I mean but tomorrow's not
promised you know so you gotta be
conscious so today like I actually
learned meditation from Deepak Chopra I
saw that video yeah he told me some
meditation and trying to teach me how to
you know live in the moment didn't he
also take a shot of your Street King
drink of that video too yeah that was
part of it right that was a part of the
marketing me I never did no commercial
now what are you expect me to do kind of
the rest of your time out here at CES I
mean I know you have a good time
I do yeah I enjoy myself every time I
walk around CES is like taking a look at
the future you know I look through some
of the TVs and
it showed me like 3-d and 4-d
televisions that you don't need glasses
for and I'm sitting there thinking like
what did you do tomorrow if we had to
wear glasses to get this effect and I
could see it with without the glasses
what did they what exactly is that I'm
looking at you know you see those bit
you saw the big video walls yeah those
are LEDs yeah like we use that on a tour
so you know I know that it don't try to
meet one I was asking if the man saw it
no no I know what that is
all right man well we just want to stay
say thank you know for coming out stage
coming and hanging out again busted me
out a little bit right man we have fun
every time yeah there you go all right
