stage here at sea CES 2012 who are on
the scene that stage this is going to be
a reunion of sorts we had 50 here last
year he's coming back making some more
noise ladies and gentlemen put your
hands together make some noise 50 cent
in the house I think you guys could do a
little better than that come on 50 said
in the house up here there we go yeah
boosting morale around here how you
doing today man I'm good man we cycle
reuniting it feels so good yeah man is
this the second year in a row CES you
know I'll come out this time is I
actually have physical product every
tale yeah you know one of you've kind of
been through the CES experience because
sometimes Proctor announced that don't
make it but right you're brick you're
bringing a product this year right
exactly that I was here and I had a
really nice picture last year and then I
went through the process manufacturing
process and rebuilding my actual company
I had a quiet corner audio in order to
create SMS audio and launched this
actual project so let's talk about the
headphones for a moment right this is
SMS audio this is your company right and
can you kind of talk about some of the
technology because i love the wireless
aspect of what you have yeah well the
marquee product from SMS audio this
year's the sink has said it's a wireless
headset a lot of the wireless headsets
that you see on the CES floor or
utilizing bluetooth technology which was
originally created for
telecommunications so it does it
compress the statue all files so it
doesn't have the same sound quality the
sink headset uses a clear wireless
16-bit technology that allows you to be
50 feet away from your source of music
and they sync up to four headsets to one
source and because I wanted to make sure
that they had the highest quality sound
for all genres and music is set at the
best possible sound quality and then as
like a bass booster for someone who
would like to listen to it with
additional base has a homeboy eq that
allows you to volume up volume down
fast-forwarding to rewind tracks from
the actual headset so you pretty much
just did a product demo right here
really quick he's on it now 50 also with
SMS audio with the clear technology it
goes what 50 feet 15 feet with no sauce
music yeah and uh full CD audio quality
right right alright that's that's killer
now another thing that may be a lot of
people don't know about what fifties
been doing lately is your street king
initiative and write that ties into the
headset yes street king i actually was
traveling you know my music has taken me
places that i didn't even imagine you
know I've been all over the world and
when I was touring in Africa I came
across something that was a bit more
extreme than low income housing and I
actually come from and I want to do
something about it I know what it feels
like not to have money but not to have
anything to eat is a whole nother level
of not having and when I got back I
started working on the actual project so
i created an energy drink this called
street king and with a partnered with
the united nations world food program to
provide a meal with every bottle of the
energy drink the soul I thought it was
important to partner with the
organization as well established as the
United Nations to create confirmation to
the general public that it would
actually reach its charity you know and
because it's the organization it would
provide aid for Haiti during this
earthquake or Japan during the tsunami I
felt like it was sufficient and
following that what I got through social
networking my Twitter and Facebook all
these other things that I utilized was
50 we got we need we got people hungry
here you know and when you look into it
one in six Americans is actually we got
16 Americans with in Hunger Now here in
America so it is actually issue is not a
third-world issue is a world issue and
what I did was I partner with feeding
America which is the largest
the leading domestic charitable
organization against hunger in America
and with the purchase of these headsets
to SMS audio com with each person from
the US 200 mils is provided for each
actual headset too so see that's
incredible guys haven't you got to give
a round of applause this is this is this
is a shift right i mean honestly last
year you're here right okay singh the
headphones were talking about how much
you won invade get any winnings this
year or how you doing right now oh
you're too good you know something down
forever but this is you know this is a
shift that we've seen you being a lot
more involved in philanthropy i mean
right the maturation of 50 cent
absolutely i want to promote conscious
capitalism or flynn tropical capitalism
there you go you know to find finances
that we seem to not be able to find
through our actual governments i think
it the way it do it is through business
you know according to World Bank numbers
one percent of business would alleviate
all extreme poverty so I feel like if I
can actually influence my peer and we
can influence other young entrepreneurs
to create create a new standard that
will allow us to to find to find that
actual to finances to make a change I
think with the major corporations that
out there now that the major
shareholders to give up one percent of
the actual shareholdings wouldn't change
one percent of their lifestyle but
they're just not conditioned to give so
you know you just got to start somewhere
there you go now I you also talked about
your experiences you know with Twitter
and hearing from the people you know you
love Twitter you were there before
Twitter existed you're here no wit
Twitter there what are your thoughts on
it I'm excited to see these companies
bro like that's even a big example like
Google's only 10 years old and we know
what the value of that company is not if
it came in under this type of business
model would be really exciting so for
those people who don't aren't interested
in an energy drink or a headset you know
the business model itself is exciting
and I was inspired by the time she'll
model where if you buy one
a pair of his shoes he provides shoes
for someone in need I just feel like
people can't eat shoes you know hunger
issues let's just do it a different way
you know I put the remix on it and let's
see how far we can actually take it now
also just reading about some of the
things that you put on Twitter recently
like you're already smiling right your
mind sets in a different place you know
I don't know if it was blown out of
proportion but you did mention how you
know life is short right you might you
might die soon and everyone's like what
is fiddy like suicidal but not only was
a different message known only got a
certain amount of characters what I was
trying to say is you know you don't know
what do you want your legacy to be I
want to be more than a guy who created a
few cool songs or was able to memorize
the lines and have decent performances
in film projects I won't be someone who
impacts a lot of people's lives in a
positive way so I'm a little more
conscious with the things I'm doing in
business to try and get back and make a
difference this is this is this is a 50
that I've never seen before guys
seriously like this is a great message
that you're giving out for people yeah
I'm talk I had to figure out a whole new
approach since you bought Wayne Brady up
here before I can try to joke when the
comedian's is therefore you're still
jokester yeah you know I try to enjoy
myself you know I'm saying but you know
i do believe life is short and because
humans a habit forming and we look
forward to the future we don't want to
think about it probably all got bank
accounts looking everybody here you know
I mean but tomorrow's not promised you
know so we gotta be conscious today like
I actually learn meditation from deepak
chopra I saw that video yeah he told me
some meditation and trying to teach me
how to you know live in the moment then
he also take a shot of your street king
drink of that video too yeah that was
part of it right that was a part of the
marketing me I got he never did no
commercial now what are you expecting to
do kind of the rest of your time out
here at CES I mean I know you have a
good time i do oh yeah i enjoy myself
every time I walk around CES is like
taking a look at the future you know I
look to some of the tvs and showed me
like 3d and 4d
televisions that you don't need glasses
for and I'm sitting thinking like what
did you do tomorrow if we had to wear
glasses to get this effect and naga see
it with without the glass what did they
what exactly is that I'm looking at you
know see those but you saw the big video
walls yeah those are ladies yeah like we
use that on a tour so you know they
don't try to play me but I wasn't I was
in I'm just asking if the man saw it no
no I know what that is all right man
