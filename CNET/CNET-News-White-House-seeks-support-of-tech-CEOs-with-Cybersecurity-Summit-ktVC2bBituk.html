personal security cyber threats posed an
enormous challenge for our country it's
one of the most serious economic and
national security challenges we face as
a nation recent attacks like the Sony
hack have spurred the White House to
action President Obama has set aside 14
billion dollars in the US budget to
boost cybersecurity and now he's seeking
support from the private sector as part
of that effort the president will attend
a summit on cybersecurity and consumer
protection at Stanford University
business government and academic experts
will attend among them Stanford
researcher herb Lynn the fact that it's
also focused on consumer protection is a
big deal too because it says that
ordinary citizens like you and me have a
personal stake in cyber security as well
the summit will cover a range of issues
from developing better password and
authentication techniques to encouraging
more secure payment methods the
president is going to be speaking with a
large number of CEOs of major American
corporations who I believe are going to
commit themselves to taking specific
concrete actions to improve the
cybersecurity postures of their
individual organizations let's say we
will do XY and z to improve
cybersecurity that we didn't before and
that we haven't done before and this
will have tangible effects on the
security that and the cyber security
that our customers enjoy Apple CEO Tim
Cook will be speaking at the summit
making it likely that the subject of
encryption surfaces cook previously said
that Apple's encryption techniques make
it impossible to intercept user data
even when faced with the subpoena we're
going to keep on at this as a government
but we're also going to be working with
the private sector to detect prevent
defend deter against attacks and to
recover quickly from any disruptions or
damage Lynn says that cyber threats will
always pose a problem they are facing an
uphill battle but there's room for
improvement fewer security breaches
would be a good start in Stanford
