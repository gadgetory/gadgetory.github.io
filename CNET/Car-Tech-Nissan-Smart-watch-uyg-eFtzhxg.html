car nissan has a way you can wear it on
your wrist here at the frankfurt auto
show they brought the nismo watch this
is a smart watch you put it on your
wrist and it tells you things like your
car's fuel economy your car's speed and
other sort of telemetric information but
it also gives you information about
yourself gives you your heart rate and
Nissan's working on things where it
might I don't give you your your brain
pulses or something like that the idea
is you wear this watch while you're
driving while you're driving on the
track in your nismo car because this
watch will only work with disans nismo
models that means the Juke Nismo the
370z Nismo and the gt-r Nismo so you're
driving on the track you can see your
vehicle speed and you can also see your
heart rate on the same display I don't
know if this thing actually tells time
but it tells all these other cool things
and apparently if you get like two hot
if you're getting that red mist while
you're racing around the track this
thing will give you a warning like maybe
you should slow down maybe you should
hit the pits for a little bit now at the
show here at the Frankfurt show they've
got Nissan's got this watch kind of
locked away in this plastic container
here it's a because it's a concept like
some of the concept cars we see here you
can't actually touch it you can't see it
in fact the display they all in here is
really just a piece of paper but they do
promise that it will have a full
SmartWatch capability it'll have a
Bluetooth link to the car for getting
all that information back and forth
it'll have a looking of my own battery
with about a week's battery lifetime so
here's the nissan nismo watch concept at
frankford ave</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
