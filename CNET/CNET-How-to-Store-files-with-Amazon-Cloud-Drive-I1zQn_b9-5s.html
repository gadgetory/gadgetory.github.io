show you how to upload files to the
cloud using Amazon's Cloud Drive desktop
app like Google Drive or Dropbox
Amazon's Cloud Drive allows you to store
files online rather than on your local
computer Cloud Drive isn't nearly as
feature-rich as some of those other
services at this time but if you want to
check it out for yourself here's how to
get started to get the app first head
over to download comm and search for
Amazon Cloud Drive you'll find versions
for both Mac and PC after installing it
you'll be prompted to log in with your
Amazon account email and password if you
don't have an account with Amazon you'll
be given the option to create one once
you're signed in you'll see a cloud icon
at the top of your screen click it and
you'll find an option that will take you
to the cloud drive site where you can
view the contents of your online Drive
by default you'll have folders for
documents music pictures and videos an
uploads folder will also be created
after you've made your first upload
using the app there are two ways to do
that you neither drag and drop a file or
collection of files right on to the icon
or you can right-click on any file and
select upload to Cloud Drive from the
menu it's worth noting that on a Mac the
right-click option only appeared after
restarting the computer to see your
uploaded files head back over to the
Cloud Drive site you'll see another
option here for uploading files on the
left along with your newly added uploads
folder click once on the folder to see
its contents to download any item back
down to your computer check on the box
next to the file name and hit the
download button up at the top you can
also move files between folders for
example if I want to move this word doc
from the uploads folder into the
Documents folder I'll check the box next
to the file name select move item from
the more actions drop-down menu and
select the destination folder from the
list so that's how to use Amazon's Cloud
Drive app for quickly backing up files
to the cloud it's a free and convenient
tool for Amazon customers and hopefully
a service will see integrated into more
Amazon products in the future if you
have any clever uses for Cloud Drive or
if you have any questions about other
topics be sure to let me know on Twitter
or on my Facebook page receive Netcom
