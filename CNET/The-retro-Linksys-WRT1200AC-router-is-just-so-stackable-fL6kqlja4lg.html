T 1200 AC router from Linksys now this
one here is very interesting actually
there are three things was talking about
number one is the desire here this is a
second from Linksys that feature this
retro design that dated back to the old
WR t theory that came out more than ten
years ago now the second thing is
aspects the router here is both very
powerful and also very modest now
problem because it features a dual-core
1.3 giggler processors 256 megabytes
rememory and 128 and megabyte of flash
memory that's one of the most sub table
I've ever seen modest because as a Wi-Fi
router it feature only the dual stream
are two by two Wi-Fi setup and that
means on the five gigahertz frequency
band it has a top speed of just 867
megabit per second on a 2.4 good/bad
just 400 megabit per second
now that is a lot lower than those awful
by the three stream or three by three
router of course there was the speed on
papers in will wall you will never get
close to that but the most streams you
have is true that the most speed you can
get and the third thing is this router
here is very expensive as hundred and
eighty dollars now it's not the most
expensive router or market but for a
dual stream ac-12 colorado it is that's
because you can find most of the AC
triad router for in less than hundred
dollars and even some three stream
router for chose hundred fifty dollars
or less so the question is is this
router here will one performance enough
to justify is out of this world price
the answer is not really
now don't get me wrong in my testing
this one here proved to be quite a great
router with fast Wi-Fi speed for its
specs also long Wi-Fi range again for
its specs but for the money you can get
other arrows with better range and
faster Wi-Fi speed
now this wrt here does have one thing
going for itself that is when hosting an
extra hard drive plug into is USB 3.0
port on the back it has very fast
networks or performance via a gigabit
network connection in fact the second
fastest in this feature just slightly
slower than is older brother the wrt in
1980 so if you want to have your own
network storage server without having to
buy an actual nath server this is a good
brother to have now form on this one you
check out my full review at cnet.com
basically is a great router and if you
get it for free be very excited not me
though because i also have the other
more expensive and also better wrt in
1980 which i brought here just to
demonstrate the stackable design here
you go
is sitting hopefully on top isn't it
just the way I like it and that's
because I'm down low and this has been
the first look at the wrt 1200 AC router
for Lynx's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
