you pour molten copper onto a McDonald's
Big Mac me neither but YouTube creator
Tito for a did and he executed the plan
on his YouTube channel for all to see
when he pours the molten copper on top
of the Big Mac the Big Mac seems to not
take any damage whatsoever in fact the
copper slides off like a freshly waxed
automobile viewers went nuts on line
asking questions and making comments
about what seemed to be an invincible
Big Mac well according to snopes.com
the answer lies in the Leidenfrost
effect which is a scientific phenomenon
where a liquid in near contact with a
mash significantly hotter than the
liquid boiling point produces an
insulating vapor layer according to
engineering website engineers edge so
mystery solved I know who I've got my
money on in the next MMA fight MMA
fighter Angela overkill he'll showed up
the weigh-in ceremony for the Invicta FC
all-pro women's tournament in las vegas
nevada dressed up as doll c from the
classic video game Street Fighter 2
she even took it up a notch by mimicking
doll scenes famous poses from the Street
Fighter game and the internet loved Hill
went on to beat her opponent by TKO in
the second round 10 pigeons from London
have been outfitted with tiny backpacks
designed by Paris based company plume
labs that can sense nitrogen dioxide and
ozone levels in the atmosphere and then
tweet to the Twitter account pigeon Air
Patrol alerting followers of pollution
levels in the atmosphere the idea comes
to us from a marketing company called
Digitas LBI
who won Twitter's powered by tweets
challenge last year the pigeons
backpacks do not tweet automatically
however users of the site simply tweet a
location within London to the pigeon air
Twitter account and receive an instant
reply notifying them of the air
pollution levels in that area according
to Michele stars crave article you can
find a live map of the pigeons flight
paths at the pigeon Air Patrol website
make sure you check out crave at crave
chena calm you can follow crave on
Twitter at crave and this week's crave
giveaway is a complete set of 86 google
android collector pins go to the blog
and enter to win this is scamp the
stanford climbing an aerial maneuvering
platform a robot capable of flying
perching climbing recovering from
failure and taking off
outdoors using only onboard sensing and
computation to purge scamp flies until
its tail contacts the wall it responds
by turning its rotors on at maximum the
tail acts as a pivot forcing the robot
into the correct orientation the rotors
then adhere the robot to the wall
aerodynamically until the vibrations
from impact are dissipated and its feet
have found a good grip the rotors can
then be turned off and scamp can start
to climb this mechanically assisted
approach to perching is effective in a
wide range of outdoor situations scamp
climbs by alternating loads between his
two feet the feet attached to bumps and
pits on the wall using tiny metal spikes
referred to as micro spines these
attached and pull down against a
foothold and release when tension is
removed if scamp misses a step and
starts to fall it detects the drop in
vertical acceleration and turned his
rotors on briefly this returns it to the
wall where it can re-engage with the
surface and resume climbing when scamp
is ready to take off it deploys a
take-off spine without this take off
spine scamp's rotors would keep the
robots stuck to the climbing surface
unable to rotate without reversing
thrust transferring load to this spine
applies a mechanical moment that rotates
camp away from the wall and allows it to
fly away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
