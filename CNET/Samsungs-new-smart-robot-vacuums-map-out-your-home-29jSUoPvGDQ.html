CES taking a look at the new robot
vacuums that the Korean conglomerate has
in store for 2016 there are a couple of
new additions to the power bot family
this year both of them smart models with
Wi-Fi built-in and an app you can use to
control them
the first is the power bot essential
plus that's gonna be an $800 model that
offers some basic functionality with its
smart app you can start and schedule it
from your phone but the real interesting
one is the $1200 power bot turbo that's
a lot to spend on a robot vacuum but the
cool feature it brings to the table is a
mapping feature it'll actually send its
mapping info of your home to the phone
so you'll be able to see the floor plan
that the robot vacuum has mapped out and
then point at a specific room and tell
the robot vacuum to clean that room if
you tap on three rooms it'll clean those
three rooms in that order it's a cool
way to sort of put you on the same page
as your robot vacuum so it knows exactly
what you want to clean the new smart
robot vacuums also have the nice remote
feature that lets you point at the floor
of the laser and send the robot vacuum
scurrying after it like a kind of
sluggish cat kind of a neat way to
pointed a messy spot on your carpet and
send the robot vacuum there for more on
