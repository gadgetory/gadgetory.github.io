and this is a matchup between 24 inch 4g
touch screen phones on t-mobile it's a
prize 5 foot out between t-mobile g2x
and HTC Sensation 4G our judges for this
fight our senior editor Bonnie boom
shakalaka cha senior editor Nicole it's
so coldly and myself ring a ling a ding
tone now we'll take all three judges
blind scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth each round the final prize
fights for be an average of all rounds
using the same decimal system it's five
rounds to the finish to let's get it on
round one is design t-mobile g2x has a
solid design with a matte finish on the
back it's camera lens puts a little bump
in its trunk but this is a classy phone
with a vibrant 4-inch 800 x 480
touchscreen display HTC Sensation 4G ups
the ante with a 4.3 inch qhd display
that's even crisper with a 960 x 540
resolution but not as bright now we all
liked it's contoured body but it's
sweeping three tone pattern on the back
reminds we have a girl skirt but it
doesn't hurt it here the sensation 4g
takes the first round with the 4.7 and
the g2x gets a solid for next round is
controls and user interface this round
isn't easy when the tmobile g2x brings a
pure stock Android experience there's no
bells and whistles and it makes for a
clean design you'll still get widget
customization and if you want more good
news it feels a tad bit snappier to use
now HTC Sensation 4G brings the next
generation of its user interface with an
even sexier design yep i just called an
OS sexy now there are seven home screens
and flash your animations across the
board the sense UI has always been a
favorite of ours and it just gets the
EDS with a perfect five and the g2x gets
a 4.7 so after averaging two rounds the
sensation 4g leaves by half a point with
plenty of fight left next round is
features
both of these phones are pretty evenly
matched with dual-core processors 8
megapixel cameras androids turn-by-turn
maps and voice of text and HSPA+
compatibility Wi-Fi and Bluetooth now
you'll find everybody's favorite swype
keyboard technology on the g2x it also
comes pre-loaded with eight gigs of
internal storage space and an additional
microSD card slot to add more storage
the main difference here is that it's
currently running only android 2.2 with
a gingerbread update coming soon now HTC
Sensation 4G is preloaded with
Gingerbread and you'll get some of the
cool benefits like a much better cut
copy and paste an application task
killer or launching apps directly from
the lock screen it comes with its own
flavor of swype called trace but it
tends to be a little less accurate at
times the sensation also gives you
access to only one gig of internal
storage space and the microSD card slot
is occupied with an eight gig card which
limits some of your flexibility out of
the box we're calling this round even at
four next up is web browsing and
multimedia web browsing is a push and a
pretty similar experience on both phones
the sensation was a tad faster at
pinching and zooming but in many cases
the g2x was a beat faster when loading
pages the g2x features an eight
megapixel camera with a single flash and
a micro-hdmi port for video out while
the sensation brings an 8 megapixel
camera with a dual LED flash both
cameras record and playback 1080p video
sources but we had mixed opinions with
the image quality of their pictures the
sensation 4g also brings the watch app
that allows users to rent or buy movies
directly from their phones but in the
end the sensation 4g gets a 4.7 and the
g2x gets a 4.3 so after averaging four
rounds HTC leads by just three-tenths of
a point the final round of the sides at
all is all
a performance t-mobile's g2x was
excellent with its clear and crisp sound
quality with little to no distortion or
static in the background it was also the
snappier performing foam between the two
with its dual core tegra two processors
and menus that jump instantly from one
to another now the sensation 4g sounded
excellent as well the speakerphone
wasn't as strong but regular voice calls
we're pretty clear Qualcomm's new dual
core processor kept things running
smoothly but maybe the sense you eyes
animations were a little too taxing but
this phone was still a tiny step behind
and you can feel it the g2x gets a
perfect five and HTC gets a four let's
average out all the scores and in a
prize fight where HTC Sensation 4G took
an early lead t-mobile g2x storm back
but it just wasn't enough and the
sensation takes this battle 4.5 to 4.4
and is your prize by it winter t-mobile
brings too heavy hitting contenders that
you can't go wrong with but the final
decision as usual is up to you i'm brian
song thanks for watching it will catch
you guys next time on another prize by
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
