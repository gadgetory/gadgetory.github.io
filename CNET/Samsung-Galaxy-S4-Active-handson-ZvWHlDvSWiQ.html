cnet.com and we are actually at an event
in New York checking out the new Samsung
Galaxy s4 active now what separates this
phone apart from its cousin which is the
galaxy s4 is that basically this spoon
is ruggedized in a way that it is splash
proof you can put it in water submerge
it up to 30 feet I believe and you can
also expose it to dust and other like
particles and dirt things like that so
it makes a very good product take to the
beach I don't worry about it being
underwater or getting stuffed up in that
way it also has a very cool feature
called the aqua mode which is a camera
setting which allows you to take photos
underwater basically what you do is you
set up aqua mode and you can press the
volume button or the camera button to
basically record a snapshot or a video
which is pretty cool and the reason they
do that is because the capacitive
buttons that you usually use to operate
the phone will not operate under water
due to the pressure and also the effect
that uses static electricity to begin
and register a command so so there you
have it we've got a look at the buttons
here on the bottom of the galaxy s4
active you can tell these are physical
peas not capacitive which is pretty cool
it's actually not too much thicker than
the actual galaxy s4
that isn't splash proof or waterproof so
you can see it's it's actually pretty
thin that's the same kind of
polycarbonate plastic back and the one
difference that you can tell here is
that this is a 8 megapixel camera as
opposed to the 13 megapixel camera which
is on the galaxy s4 right now this is a
global device but it actually will be
coming to AT&amp;amp;T at some point so we're
not sure exactly when or where the price
will be but hopefully will be soon and
hopefully we'll be in time for the
summer and that way you can tick to the
beach takes the pool or anything like
that there you have it folks this has
been a first look at the samsung galaxy
s4 active</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
