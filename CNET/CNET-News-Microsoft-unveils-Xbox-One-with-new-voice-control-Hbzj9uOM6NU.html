what if a single device could provide
all your entertainment and what if that
device could turn on your TV and talk to
all of the devices in your living room
and what if it was always ready and
connected well now it's all going to
begin with two simple words Xbox on and
it's that simple Xbox one instantly
recognized me and gets me to my own
personal home screen no more manual
login no more waiting on system or game
updates now the home screen as you can
see has a familiar interface but let me
point out for you a couple of unique
differences first of all it'll remember
what I was last doing so for example
here in the center of the screen you can
see I was playing one of my favorite
racing games this one here is just one
of the new amazing Xbox one exclusive
you're going to hear a lot more about
you can also see I was listening to some
music by deadmau5 and watching a movie
now like many of you I also discovered
new entertainment based on what my
friends like and for that we created a
new area called trendy here I get a
snapshot of what is popular in the
entertainment world both with my friends
and with the entire Xbox Live community
of course I can still browse a great
content I've come to love on Xbox such
as games TV and movies and music Xbox
watch TV
and with that simple command I'm
watching live TV now here in Seattle I'm
a Comcast subscribers so this is the
programming available in my area but
hold on let me show you how we're gonna
you take live TV and make it not only
integral to the Xbox but also incredibly
useful through a great new feature
called instant switching go to Internet
Explorer oh nice watch TV watch movie
switching between live TV and all my
games entertainment is now as fast as
switching channels on your TV remote now
you've already seen how simple it is to
use your hands to navigate through the
Xbox one but we're gonna create a new
set of Universal gestures to control
your entire TV experience gestures such
as grab and pan and swipe up let me show
you one of my favorites here's an
example of how I can get easily back to
my home screen from anywhere in the
system I simply spread my hands grab the
screen and I'm back home and if I want
to get back to my movie I grab and I'm
back to the movie now have you ever
wanted to do more than one thing at a
time when you're watching TV of course
you have on Xbox one the ability to do
multiple things at once on your TV is
now a reality introducing snap mode for
the Xbox Xbox snap Internet Explorer
with snap mode I can run multiple
programs alongside one another and
easily interact between them without
having to shut one down and start up
another Xbox favorites Star Trek ok so
right now watching Star Trek and I've
heard great things about the sequel star
trek into darkness so now I can use
Internet Explorer and my cell phone is a
remote control for example to watch a
trailer and I can even navigate to find
movie times and buy tickets and again at
any given time now if I want to go home
I just grab and I'm home
Skype on Xbox one connects you to family
and friends in ways you aren't gonna
find another TVs
not only will you get Skype experiences
in widescreen HD with the best
livingroom camera available but only on
Xbox will you be able to do group video
calls on your TV let's take a look at
Skype in snap mode Xbox answer call hey
DJ thank you for calling in to help me
show up Skype in snap mode looks like
you're working pretty hard out there and
yousuf thanks for having me I'm happy to
do it you know it looks like you're
doing okay yourself I'm looking forward
to showing off the great work we're
doing with our partners at ESPN well as
a matter of fact that's what's coming up
next so why don't you sit back and enjoy
it that's great just make sure when you
get to fantasy you show the real version
you know the one where I'm in first
place yeah yeah yeah Skype in call let
me go ahead and though and show you that
Xbox sports offering that DJ was talking
about Xbox watch ESPN all right let me
set up the scene here
imagine I'm at home watching an NBA game
during the regular season but if you're
like me I like to keep up with my
fantasy team now I can do those instead
of having to pull out necessarily a
separate device when my player scores
here like LeBron I automatically get an
alert that just pops up on the TV and I
can say xbox show fantasy and now I give
my fantasy players right alongside all
right finally let's tackle what I think
is the biggest challenge with watching
TV anybody for me it's finding what to
watch and keeping up with it introducing
the xbox one guide xbox show the guide
now you can find discover and watch TV
in three powerful new ways voice control
search and navigation favorites and
trending with the Xbox one guide I see
all my local TV listings right through
my xbox and I can use my voice to check
out what's on Xbox today's show
watch sci-fi channel watch MTV what's on
HBO
pretty cool huh let's see that again
Mary and Martha watch CBS show the guide
see how easy it is no more memorizing
channels are hunting for remote control
then this thing I want to show you is
how I stand on top of all of the series
that I love to follow xbox favorites the
favorites area is an easy way to keep up
with all the TV shows that I like to
watch all I have to do is pin the
content in one convenient place it's a
lot like having my own personal channel
and finally there's one of the areas I
like the most xbox trending trending
gives me a glance at what everyone in
the Xbox Live community is watching
I like how current it is it's
up-to-the-minute from here i can
instantly jump into the most popular
shows but training isn't just for live
TV there's also a section for video on
demand so I can see what people are
liking no matter what time zone it's in
Xbox go home so there you have it the
all-in-one system where it all comes
together games movies music web and now
Skype and live TV the one place where
you are now at the center of your
entertainment the one place where it's
simple and instant to connect with your
friends this is the beginning of a new
generation of games entertainment this
is the beginning of truly intelligent TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
