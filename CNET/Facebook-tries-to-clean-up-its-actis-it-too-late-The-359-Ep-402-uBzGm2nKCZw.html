bourbon I'm Alpha ring Facebook wants
you to know it's doing a lot to clean up
its massive social network the company
on Tuesday for the first time were
revealed hard figures for its
enforcement efforts saying it took down
837 million pieces of spam in just the
first quarter of 2018 and disabled five
hundred eighty three million fake
accounts most most of which were
disabled within minutes of registration
should we feel good about these numbers
those are those are big numbers I mean
it's it's you know important for
Facebook to reveal these basically
saying like look at how much that we get
rid of every day I mean it for a long
time I feel like most tech platforms
have been going by the creed of you know
if you're doing everything right like
people aren't really gonna notice an
issue but like people have started
noticing issues so they're saying okay
yeah you notice these issues that like
leak out but like look at all the other
stuff that we've gotten rid of these
millions of post and then like why are
you pointing out these like one post
that like that that is available which
which is still an issue it's not like
just because they delete all of these
that means that like things don't get
through so in that post in that report
that they put out today they said that
even though they've deleted five hundred
and eighty three million fake accounts
which is about a quarter of you know
Facebook's actual like users they said
that so the 2.2 billion users that they
have now about three to four percent of
that is still exists that our fake bot
account and you know three or four
percent doesn't sound like it's that
much but you know if you break it down
by numbers that's about like 66 like
million accounts and that's where a lot
of us coming from yeah so it's it's not
like it's not like they've gotten rid of
all of them and it's not like Facebook
of saying we're getting rid of all of
them but it is it even even at a low
percentage it is a pretty big number do
you think that coming out with these
numbers helps their reputation at all I
mean it helps them build a case at the
very least it's true I also wanted to
check with you about this what about
houses artificial intelligence playing a
part in this they mentioned that AI was
really used
and taking down a lot of graphic
violence yeah so as far as the account
goes that's how they're able to delete
it within like moments of registration
it's not like they check every single
account like the moment that they sign
up because that's about you know like
six accounts six million accounts a day
like there there wouldn't be enough time
to look through all that so a lot of
this is AI based and the 857 million
post that you mentioned it's like just
spam post that's also AI they said they
deleted those before they were even
reported so there's a lot of basically
like our algorithms that are searching
based on image or like things that don't
really fit in with like what a normal
account would look like or anything like
that yeah nice to see that they're
making Facebook less of a cesspool but
still got problems next congressional
Democrats last-ditch effort to save net
neutrality is coming Wednesday that's
tomorrow that's when a vote on a bill to
turn back the FCC's repeal on net
neutrality will take place the bill has
a chance to pass the Senate but is
unlikely to go further than that it also
needs the president's signature and
president Trump is unlikely to actually
go through with this because he's the
guy that that brought the FCC Chairman
and GPI that push back
net neutrality in the first place so I
don't really see this going anywhere
yeah it's unfortunate there's so much
skepticism with this but I mean I think
it's it's not really it's I think it's
more of a statement about how like our
politics really work yeah they'd like
views on net neutrality or anything like
that but yeah and it's a way for
Democrats to get attention to the issue
it's important to mention to the FCC has
scheduled the rules to officially come
off the books June 11th so if you
haven't seen any major changes related
to this that's why because it hasn't
actually taken place last target is
stepping up its work with next day
deliveries bringing its restock program
nationwide the company also cut delivery
fees to $3 from $5 making its new
service potentially stronger competitor
against Amazon Alfred do you think this
would get you to stop using Prime I
don't think it's gonna get me to stop
using anything if anything I would just
use both of them that's that's weird to
drop a service completely just because
there's another option available that's
true if you want to read more
about these toys check us out on CNET
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Afra dang thanks
for listening
and thanks everybody for joining us for
the recording of the audio podcast you
can subscribe to that later will tell
you all about it until then I'm gonna
jump into the chat pull out some
questions and comments anything you got
with today's topics for one I will go
ahead and jump back to your question to
Alpher it about Target I'm in the same
boat I think I'd be willing and welcome
to use both but it's not probably not
going to take me off what I'm already
subscribing to because this target is
not the target shipping is not going to
take away that prime also gets me video
it gets me music and a lot of other
perks it's a it's a really fuller
package covering the e-commerce speed to
me it's at least gratifying to see that
folks like Target and Walmart are trying
to step up their game a little bit more
and at least be a little bit more
competitive against Amazon and this is a
next day delivery service
Amazon's already been doing a lot of
same-day delivery into our delivery for
Prime members so I feel like the big box
guys the the traditional retailers still
have a long way to go to actually
directly compete against Amos I mean
they they might have an advantage though
based on where you live considering that
there's like a target you know there's
like a ton of targets around where I
live like where I went to college -
there was like several targets I imagine
they'd be able to get it to me like much
faster than Amazon would from like at
their warehouse or whatever like for
their mini yeah like they're using their
stores as many where yes basically which
is a way to kind of use that
infrastructure that they already built
out and and make it into a benefit
instead of something that's just a
legacy part of the business yeah hurting
them so it'll be interesting to see how
that happens and I think a lot of people
are waiting to see what else Amazon is
gonna do with wholefoods after they
purchased Whole Foods last year the
expectation is is that they would do
more like pickup out of their more
grocery delivery iguanas on the menu
yeah ever see if Jeff Bezos definitely I
wonder what iguana meat does taste like
and I hope it does show up I don't know
sometime soon and at Whole Foods didn't
you email I guess on I value about Whole
Foods and Amazon asking if I think they
were gonna say blah know on you
we definitely get them headlines I
really I really want to just start my
own beat where it's just asking stupid
questions to multibillion like companies
you did this once before it I did this
is the Super Bowl tab that was pretty
funny act it was like so it was around
when hq2 was being announced and they
picked 20 cities and Philadelphia and
Boston were both in the running and they
were also both playing the Super Bowl so
I mailed Amazon and I just asked them
hey does the winner of the Super Bowl
get get hq2 or like well that will that
be a factor
oh they actually said no they basically
said like look at our guidelines like
there's nothing I mentioned sports in
there that's too bad
well that was that was nice they were
good sports about it to actually respond
to you all right
question time from the chat Michael
Brown Facebook tries to clean up its act
as a tool a quick answer no have you
seen the number of global Facebook users
yeah we've touched on that one before
point though that's a good point I mean
it's it's important for us as reporters
to be you know hard on the company and
really point out the critical issues
right we've also said before Facebook's
not going anywhere and they do have an
opportunity to turn it around and we
still use it here I know yeah that's
that's a company yeah do you don't
personally I do Michael Brown goes on to
say what is the next big social media
it's still Facebook by way of Instagram
what are our feelings on that one um
we've always asked what's Natalie I
don't use it much I think that's a
popular I think that's a popular opinion
to say that Instagram is going to be
like you know where although all the
kids are flocking to and things like
that I mean some people even like to say
like snapchat for me I would make the
argument that like I don't think there
is going to be a next big social network
more so that I think that people are
just not really gonna be using social
networks that much anymore I kind of
think that there's something to be said
there that there's a kind of a sour
taste left in all of our mouths I know I
have just kind of dialed back that's
just me that's me but yeah I've kind of
just weaned myself off of it it's still
there when I need it when I need to
reach someone specifically but overall
I'm not with things much time there I'm
finding other things to waste yeah if
anything I feel like more people are
just gonna be moved
- like messaging apps which you know
Facebook has their asses covered there
with whatsapp and messenger yes I count
messenger as part of Facebook but sure
but yeah I mean I you can look at it
more so it's like taking a step back
where like the the social network you
know in the late nineties was like a
more what is it like MSN Messenger or
something like people people in
different areas use different stuff I
used a m-- right now there was also like
Friendster MySpace yeah no but like
those aren't messaging out oh that's
true yeah but yeah there's a really
great article in New York mag yesterday
where it's basically like I'm now bored
by the internet like we used to go
online all the time just to waste their
time you know go on forums talk to
people that they'll never see again or
anything like that and then and or like
play games and like look at stupid memes
messaging boards and things like that
and then I moved on to like oh everybody
has a real name now and then like here's
all my real photos and stuff like that
that was the new way to waste time but
like I don't know I'm not really I like
I I read that article and I just like
yeah I'm like severely bored by like
stuff on the internet it's like very
hard to waste time online now mmm
nothing is fun Danny Green points out
not a long time are not a long ago a lot
of people left Facebook for periscope I
how often do you hear people talking
about periscope right now
sorry periscope viewers we have a lot of
actually really great periscope users
hey you wait who left Facebook for
periscope I don't recall that myself
that's not even a correlation I don't I
don't see how that makes sense well
maybe for Twitter it was I think it's a
good one-two punch from Twitter to
aquire yes yeah to me I would like to
see Twitter be a stronger competitor I'd
like to see snapchat be a stronger
competitor just because I like to see a
healthy competition in the marketplace
and unfortunately right now it's like so
solidly Facebook all the time and that
puts the target on their back they have
a lot to answer to when something goes
wrong they get put in hot water a lot
but I think it's better that consumers
have more options and unfortunately
snapchat and Twitter are so much smaller
and they do have their user bases
they're also not going anywhere but it's
really like a winner-take-all or win or
take most kind of world these days they
always say that there's no big
competition for facebook but I think
there is the
I for one am a big fan of fakeblock
remember fakeblock you don't recall it
they'd all by George Michael sorry I'm
rewashing Arrested Development season
four as we speak
yeah there's new episodes on all right
remix episodes Oh what does that mean
that means that they edit it more in the
traditional style of the original show
with minute episodes instead of the
extended like anthology episodes I saw
yeah I saw I saw like when I was on
Netflix the other day I was like oh new
episodes of Arrested Danza and I was
like I'll watch that later but now that
you've told me that I have no plans to
watch all right fill us in on fakeblock
since I'm a dad and don't get anything
it's about security and privacy and you
got to get Stan Sitwell to invest wasn't
it just like a metronome thing
yeah and it's being a woodblock movie
Josh Boyd asks is vine too still
happening or will it be Glen I really
hope as I saw that the other day I said
mine is on the ice now I'm so sad that
like I really start over sets create
that Wall Street Journal or something it
was a it's yes the internet reported on
what was happening on the internet but
either way I really started to enjoy
vine and started watching those YouTube
compilations for like a half-hour or
something after vine it already I will I
will say this I am very glad that the
like vine dyeing caused the death of
like vine compilation' channels no it
didn't which I do there's strong vines
there's they just keep repurposing them
okay but my point was was that like I
hate it I I watched like some of those
because it was like I don't spend all my
time on vine but I hated that they made
money off of that because like ya guys
are doing leeches you guys are
bottom-feeders you don't like make your
own content you just take other people's
stuff and like oh that they didn't do it
we wouldn't be able to revisit them
that's not that's not true cuz tomorrow
is Wednesday my dude it just derailed
Alfred everybody put this down the
podcast is now complete today alright
let's switch gears right now I have
something new to feel bad about
just like oh I really appreciate those
compilations no they're bad and here's
why yeah let's switch gears before we
run out of time here and talk about net
neutrality which is of course on
everybody's not mind a fly cope says net
neutrality is gone but I haven't noticed
much has it gone in place yet or what we
kind of covered that earlier over that
June 11th is when it legit goes off the
books and there are already all sorts of
changes happening on the state level so
who's to say whether you're gonna notice
any sort of difference whatsoever if
anything is just gotten way more
complicated right so let's expand on
that fly cope wants to know what exactly
would happen with net neutrality the
government can't really do much it's not
in their hands per se it's them handing
over more control to the ISPs so what
are the things that we can expect to
possibly see without fear mongering too
much here we've talked back for me
personally enough but to me personally I
don't think much is gonna change it all
for consumers yeah you know especially
within the first year or two because I
don't I don't expect on June 12th all
the ISPs are all of a sudden gonna be
like ha ha joke's on you we're all of a
sudden gonna like jack up prices and you
know force you to pay for fast lanes
like I don't anticipate that happening
if we're supposed to believe what the
FCC's argument about this is though is
so apparently on June 12 there's gonna
be massive massive innovation from all
the telecom companies because they got
they got rid of net neutrality so now
they've also not gonna have advanced to
that the amazing future that this
regulation has been preventing for all
these years
yeah according to the FCC at least
that's that's really what the argument
is so either it will be a dystopian
future where everybody has to pay
millions of dollars to for slower
internet or tech innovation will take
off and will be will be in the in the
space age of the internet it's a good
point and ultimately I guess we're
probably gonna see some sort of middle
ground a lot if this has to do with
infrastructure and it's gonna take a
really long time for any of these
changes to happen if they do start
changing the ISPs do start changing
their pricing tiers people are probably
wig out and and that's why I don't
anticipate that happening that's my
personal opinion I don't anticipate that
happening and at least in the short term
in the next year or two and let's see if
it does it's actually coming pretty soon
down the line yeah I mean what they have
now is a user base far and wide
intermingling between the different ISPs
that have become comfortable with the
current approach and format and slow
changes will always come regardless of
net neutrality repeal or not it'd be
akin to everybody every cable provider
suddenly deciding we're gonna roll back
to 720 and nobody'd be happy about that
mmm-hmm it'd be a foolish move yeah you
actually covered a lot of ground there
because we had several people asking
about the timeline about some of these
rollouts and possible changes to throw
this out to the chat ooh I'd love to
hear from you guys I I mentioned my own
personal opinion about this but what do
you what do you folks think is actually
gonna happen on June 12th do you expect
to have significant changes happen are
you anticipating to have to pay more
money significantly more money as we
said you know things always change
prices do tend to go up but they were
going up regardless of this or not yeah
but like do people expect there to be
significant changes I'd love to hear
from you yeah yeah I like to say that I
have somewhat roll back my my rage on
this case I feel like I finally worn you
down I don't know about that I'm just
trying to keep a level head because
maybe if we hearken back a few episodes
ago there's maybe more than a few of me
so boxing and don't get me wrong I'm
still ticked off about this I still
think this is a bad move though mad
alright still mad but keep my mouth shut
for a second Mike Shaw for one was
actually saying the Lawson net
neutrality opens the door for more
innovation it will likely be a net win
mmm I love it yeah how do I try to go my
someone else's comment no no Mike Shaw
keep doing awesome puns yeah he says a
fly cope agrees saying competing is what
we need
fly cope says not much will happen Josh
Boyd says if t-mobile and Sprint gift 5g
will that put pressure on the cable
companies in regards to pry
there's a good point I think we've
talked about that a lot the potential of
5g adding more competition problem is is
that that's not coming in the next like
year or two yeah or three probably but
yeah we'll see when that happens on the
other end of the go ahead sorry I was
gonna say like I don't know that
argument kind of doesn't really gel with
me mostly because like yeah it's not
coming for a really long time it's like
asking if like do you think flying cars
are gonna get rid of the like
self-driving car industry like it's not
mm-hmm I don't know it's like probably
but like this is like a very long time
for me yeah I mean MTV's going on 40
years and video has yet to kill the
radio star just putting that one out
there mmm on the other end of the
spectrum Demonte says it was intended to
be up and free and it should stay that
way in regards to the internet being
available to the people governed by the
people run by the people that sounds way
more political than I intended but yeah
his encouragement is that the government
and the more importantly the providers
should not be the ones calling the shots
he wants people to run the internet then
I don't I think he wants it to be just
be more free and available I don't we
know we'll never live in a world where
the Internet is completely free I think
I think the challenge is is are we
really gonna see this really lousy
situation where you're gonna have to pay
for fast lanes or have to pay for like a
social media package or a news package
on the Internet
instead of just paying one flat fee to
access the Internet and you know time
will tell if that ends up happening it
seems that consumers have said very
loudly that they were super not
interested in that kind of thing so
having ISPs shove that down our throats
it's I would call that a really bad move
and people would find an alternative I
would imagine as quickly as they could
but I don't know we'll see a couple of
closing comments before we wrap up the
show s mcpeet er says I expect my
subscription prices to go up first how
much those increments will be will
remain to be seen I lost my place here
sorry everybody
go ahead I'm a little skeptical so my
price is for my internet people have
gone up consistently over the last like
four years
I feel like it would have gone up
regardless of net neutrality so I don't
know if it goes up again like later this
year if that will also be related to
like the net neutrality
yeah and how much are people gonna freak
out if that happens you feel like Oh
your ISP prices went up it's because if
not neutrality being rich a cause like
my friends have always gone up I don't
really I'm not saying that like net
neutrality is like good or bad you're in
this scenario but I'm just saying that
like I don't like I continuously paying
more for Internet mm-hmm which is also
odd and you will and luckily I cut the
cord so I don't have to deal with that
anymore and all my money is cause paying
for the internet fly coke goes on to say
what I've heard is that not safe for
work sites might be harder to access
which probably won't affect us that much
because we're not too dependent on it
but there is something to be said there
for the censorship and the ISPs power to
censor what they can deliver to you
there's another possibility that we
that's also part of the nightmare
scenario that's a good point to bring up
that just the ISPs blocking certain
sites and making the internet harder to
access in different areas so yeah that
would not be democratic or you know it
would really raise the question about
like free speech issues I would think
too so I don't know that they would
really want to get into that but who
knows here's a great question from
Hunter Monzon is there any chance in the
States for a new ISP to start up with
all the Giants already ruling the game I
said I look it bring out your economist
hat here Ben it's really expensive to do
this kind of thing yeah it's it's
possible we learned about stary a couple
years ago which is just piloting some
stuff in Boston and I think they're
moving very very slowly I don't even
know if they're still working frankly
but it's there's there's a reason why
the landscape looks the way it is it's
super expensive to do this type of work
I think if there's anybody in this world
who can make that happen and musk We
Trust yeah that'll be like the most
boring space that'll be the most boring
thing he ever did I mean like he's doing
like electric cars flamethrowers candy
factory and Aniyah cyborg dragon he's
we're dragon dragon energy all right oh
god I think he could pull it off
with the sheer amount of capital him and
besos obviously but he could wake a sexy
and interesting than sure why not come
on must keep the porn alive all right we
are out of time thanks everybody
