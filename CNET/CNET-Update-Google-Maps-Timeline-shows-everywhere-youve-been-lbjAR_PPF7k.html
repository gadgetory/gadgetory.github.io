of yourself I'm Bridget Carey this is
your CNET update Google may know every
place you've ever been and what you've
been doing at those places now if that
sounds shocking to you well then you
haven't been paying attention to how
Google collects your data for a long
time now Google has been able to keep
track of your location history if you
had the option turned on and if you do
have location tracking activated now
Google makes it easy for you to see your
travel history and a feature called
your timeline it shows the places you've
been and you can jump down to a specific
day and see your journey as well as what
photos you took on that day that is if
you use the Google Photos app you can
also rename some places as mom's house
or doctor's office all this information
is for your eyes only and you can turn
off location history or even delete
specific days or all of your history the
feature is rolling out now but you can
control your settings in Google Maps on
the desktop just go to maps.google.com /
location history and I should say
tracking some location has its perks if
you use Google now it can alert you when
traffic is congested on your typical
route home or it can show you search
results tailored to your location which
is helpful when searching for a place to
eat nearby in addition Google is making
a big change to the Google Plus network
the Google Plus photo backup service is
retiring on August 1st and it's being
replaced with a separate Google Photos
app that launched in May but here's
what's important to know if you uploaded
photos to Google Plus they are safe but
you'll need to do a few things to access
your photo backup you can download the
new Google Photos app and it'll all move
over to that new app or you can also
export your library using the Google
takeout service which lets you download
a copy of all your data saved on Google
and if you don't want to do that you can
still view your library on the web at
photos google.com and there's more
Google News this time involving email
Google says it's testing a way for Gmail
users to create their own custom Gmail
addresses so instead of saying at
gmail.com it's at your company com or at
your name com
it would cost you $2 a month for your
personal account and
nice users would be charged $5 a month
for extra storage and other tools $10 a
month gets you unlimited online storage
along with some other features but
google says is just a test for now it
may not be an official thing in the long
term
and speaking of email Microsoft just
launched a new email chat app on the
iPhone it's called sent and it's similar
to Facebook Messenger but only people
with Outlook in office 365 business and
school email accounts can sign up to
chat on it Microsoft said it will expand
availability in the coming months it's a
way for you to chat with all your
co-workers or your classmate email
contacts without having to know all of
their cell phone numbers microsoft says
it's coming soon to Windows Phone and
Android that's it for this tech news
update there's more at cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
