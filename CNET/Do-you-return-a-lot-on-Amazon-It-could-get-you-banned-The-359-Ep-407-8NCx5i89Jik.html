Alfred Aang Amazon has a very generous
return policy but even it has limits
according to a story from The Wall
Street Journal some folks have gotten
banned by Amazon for apparently
excessive returns Alfred do you find
this story concerning I mean I think
it's concerning that there's no like
straight-up number like if you return
like 20 percent of your orders or
something like that then we'll Daniel
will give you a warning or anything like
that because from the story it seems
like it's just like a straight-up like
look you've been returning too many
things we're gonna ban you so I mean I
get it I know that there's like cases of
abuse out there where people will order
things and then like just immediately
return it or something like that but you
know I think that people should know
like at least like how much they are
able to return because I think well I
totally disagree really you don't think
people should have an idea Amazon came
out with a very explicit return policy
people would know they could hit that
line like one returned prior to that or
whatever and then abuse it to the to
that level which is like obviously why
Amazon does not explicitly state a
return like appreciate a warning or
something like that though because it's
just like I I'm kind of worried about
how much I'm returning now I mean I
don't return that much but you know if I
get something I'm wary of oh wait like
what if this isn't like what if this is
gonna get me banned off Amazon because
there's a lot of implications of not
being able to use Amazon yeah
and the story mentioned something that I
thought really was kind of lousy some
guy had a Kindle and wasn't able to
download new e-books because he got
banned from Amazon the thing is is that
he did argue to get reinstated and did
manage to get reinstated it's also
important to recognize that there are
300 million customers on Amazon which
means that even a tiny tiny percentage
of that getting banned to me that seems
like well within the like likelihood
it's a giant global company somebody's
getting banned
yeah I don't buy that just because it's
so like when they have a massive amount
like even if it's a tiny percentage
that's still like millions of people
like malware that hit like Gmail last
year only affected point
1% of Gmail users but that was still
like a hundred million people yeah if
there are millions of people getting
banned off of Amazon I would love to
hear about that so if you've gotten been
from Amazon please email me or send me a
tweet I'd love to hear from you
Amazon is selling its facial recognition
software to law enforcement something
that's raised concerns with the ACLU
Alfred tell us a little bit more about
this so this is Amazon's a facial
recognition program that it calls
recognition with a k' it's very
inspiring what they've used it in
amusement parks to to help like you know
I lost children yeah right here it's
fine like they're lost kids or anything
like that but there's concerns about
this technology being used by police
departments mostly because you know they
obviously have way more resources than
your local Six Flags like Disney right
but and they're worried that it could
get abused yeah you know it would track
like protesters or suspicious activity
yeah that kind of thing but in general
facial recognition software something
that people should be worried about I
mean yeah facial recognition software
and police hat is something that you
know it has been available for a pretty
long time now but you know privacy
advocates and just people like concerned
with like technologies failures have
always raised issues with that one of
the bigger arguments is that facial
recognition is not a hundred percent
right all the time and if you're relying
on this to you know solve crimes it does
have a lot of dire consequences as if it
has even like a 1% error rate yeah
definitely a good point Mark Zuckerberg
said sorry mark zuckerberg said yet
another setting yet another hearing this
time with the EU all part of his
continued fallout with Cambridge
analytical scandal so was anything new
at that EU conference not by Mark
Zuckerberg answer's no so the way that
this conference worked this testimony
worked was that instead of him answering
the questions directly one after another
they all asked the questions at the same
time and then he tried to answer them
all within 25 minutes it's basically
trying to an answer an hour of questions
in 25 minutes which doesn't work because
he he tried to like bundle the answers a
lot of questions about Facebook being a
monopoly why Facebook shouldn't be
broken up by you guys you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
Sina
Ben Fox Ruben I'm Ashley shadow profile
profiting thanks for listening and
welcome back everybody thanks for
joining us it takes me a minute to do
these things I'm running a lot of
switches in here outfits cool anyways
thanks for joining a song yeah you're
gonna dance more if you yeah if you just
keep them on in the background sure
gonna entertain the folks who focus at
home for us no only the ones that work
okay if you're watching this while
you're in the office I wanted to mention
something too this is so The Wall Street
Journal has written more than one story
related to customer returns they also
had one last month about customer
returns for brick-and-mortar stores this
is there's this company out there called
retail equation that a lot of retailers
use and it basically tracks how many
returns you do at a store whether you
had a receipt or not and whether you
like show up at the very last minute
right before our stores about to close
they create this entire profile about
people and at some point you could get
denied to be able to do a return if also
you do excessive returns for those
stores so it's important to recognize
that this isn't just about Amazon there
are a lot of return policies out there
and I mean I've definitely returned
stuff on Amazon though like if they've
they've shipped me like the wrong thing
like a few times yeah I mean like
everybody's like probably return stuff I
think the idea is like if you don't know
the limit of it then like I'm kind of
like I feel like I am like extra careful
now about like what I'm ordering on
Amazon just to make sure it's like what
I wanted but even like I've ordered like
USBC cables where like they sent me
micro USBs hmm twice I told him you made
a mistake which is totally fair I mean
if they screwed up the order or it's
damaged or whatever you absolutely are
well within your right to return and I
think that like if you're a regular
customer you use Amazon regularly then
you are not at threat for getting banned
and even if you do get banned the story
mentions that you can get reinstated by
arguing your case there was one guy that
Jeff Bezos it's Jeff at amazon.com after
he did that he was able to get
reinstated so I to me it seems like this
is really focused on you know like the
really serious or excessive abusers
which with that many customers I feel
like you know like of course that
happens you have somebody's doing it
seemed like I mean from the Wall Street
Journal's story like from what I had
read it seemed like most of those folks
were not like trying to abuse it or
anything like that are like the
anecdotes that they had spoken sure to
so that's a thing like how like how does
Amazon like determine that you're
abusing it because from those cases that
were being made it seemed like they
didn't they weren't abusing it yeah and
a lot of it can be algorithmic which
means some people will get trapped that
weren't supposed to be and it's nice to
see that people can get reinstated if
you argue your case yeah so speaking of
algorithmic errors you know with that in
mind here's also this facial recognition
program that we have use it to try to
arrest people if you'd like I do want to
throw out Amazon's comments because they
gave us a comment specifically about the
returns they said there are rare
occasions where someone abuses our
service over an extended period of time
they went on to say that you know we we
do this specifically to make sure that
we can continue to have a generous
returns policy for everybody so that's
that's at least their point that I
wanted to throw out there anyway let's
get to questions yes let's take some
questions right out the gate from
Matthew dacher what does banning fully
entail will it also kill a person's
Prime membership drop their Alexa block
them from video or is this strictly
applied to the shipping aspect that's a
good point I'm pretty sure it gets you
thrown off of prime for sure as far as
Alexa the story doesn't mention whether
folks have an Alexa that like just just
give em everything you'd need an Amazon
account for yeah but you would need your
Amazon account for Alexa which would be
pretty miserable if you like operating
your entire smart home and then you get
I mean yeah I imagine because of the
example you gave the person with the
Kindle and like they couldn't get ebooks
anymore I imagine kind of be the same
scenario with like an echo and all these
like smart homes I guess in that
guard it's useful to consider that Apple
probably won't ban you because what
would they ban you from like you buy
their hardware and then you use it
iCloud I guess so they probably also
have like some sort of returns policy to
that people may or may not be abusing I
mean like you know you buy too many
iPhones and return them really quickly
you know like it's just it's it doesn't
surprise me that these companies aren't
just like waiting for you to like return
stuff constantly and we won't ask any
questions about it so I don't know
that's a good question about Alexa
though I'd love to look into that that
is a good question here's another good
one from Mike Shaw some people abuse
returns like buying a super awesome TV
just before the Superbowl returning
afterwards restocking fees try to deter
that but it turns out to be just like
renting for a weekend which makes me beg
the question why has an Amazon just
launched their own rent to center type
situation I feel like that might
actually be a beneficial industry for
them to get into it's a good question
I wonder if the shipping costs are just
too much like if you were gonna ship out
giant television and give an offer at a
two-day shipping and then have to take
the return on it you would have to
charge a lot of money for it to actually
work also are around a center is like
still a thing I always love they just
prayed on like people without money yes
and yes
so they they are still a thing and
Amazon such a big company that I also
like I wonder if they actually do have
that service somewhere and I just don't
know about it well yeah the
facial-recognition service had was
around for like more than a year and
then like most folks didn't know about
that mm-hmm
yeah another question from spring joy I
guess this might be related to the
policy that allowed customers to keep
the product and get a refund if the cost
is below ten dollars I don't recall that
I've never done myself yeah
that's happened to me more than once
like if I get like a children's book
that wasn't the right one or you know
like cables or something like that that
are really cheap it actually is more
cost-effective for them to just eat the
eat the cost and not have you return it
then actually like pay for you like to
ship it and to return it this happened
to me a handful of times I always wonder
if they're tracking how many times that
actually does occur and if at some point
they're just gonna be like we see what
you're doing and you know just give it
back to us because we don't want you
abusing this policy yeah I've always I
that's never been like an automatic
thing for me I've always had to like
take it up with the like the seller like
I have to send them a message saying
like you sent me this in black when I
wanted it and like red or something like
that and then they'll just say oh just
keep the black oh and we'll send you the
right one and said yeah for me I think
it's a policy specifically from buying
from Amazon because they also have the
marketplace where there are smaller
sellers that sell on it and they all
have different types of return policies
hmm sorry I was knee-deep in coffee
change gears over into Facebook syringe
oi asks did Zuckerberg mention anything
about GDP our I know Facebook is
following their own policy revisions
yeah so Zuckerberg mentioned that
they're working toward and they'll be
compliant towards it but he did not
mention which one of the members of
parliament did call him out on was the
fact that they moved many of their users
outside of their servers in like Europe
which like would mean that they're not
really like they're complying but
they're not really like complying I
guess is like the best way to say it
um but he did he did talk about how
Facebook is moving toward making sure
that they're gonna hit meet the
requirements by the deadline which is
this Friday can you give us like a quick
TLDR what's gdpr
yeah it's the global data privacy
regulation general Gen Y isn't it
general there was something like that
yeah but it's like right legislation
that was put forward by the European
Union so this isn't something from like
the US but the idea is that every tech
company now like has to basically change
their privacy standards and they have to
make it so like you're much more aware
of what data they're taking from you
like their privacy policy has to be a
lot clearer that's why like everybody
has been getting all these emails from
companies basically hey we've updated
our privacy policy the idea being that
you know
because like the EU such a big like part
of their user base that they're just
going to do it for everybody
instead of like when the users in Europe
or something like that mm-hmm
well let's switch back over to Amazon
real quick because I like this
conspiracy theory from Alex Mitchell
asking I wonder if employees send wrong
things out on purpose to hurt the
company since we have some pretty bad
stories coming from the front line in
Amazon that's an easy way to get fired I
mean like if that actually that is an
interesting conspiracy theory for sure I
don't know maybe a witch hunt
it's which I don't know no full-on
response to that when you're just gonna
let it hang uh I mean I don't really
think it that is happening but it's such
a big company and they have five hundred
thousand people so to assume that like
no employee has ever attempted to do
something like that I think would be
incorrect but that's really like such an
easy way to get fired is like you're
intentionally sending out the wrong
stuff also at the warehouses like so
much of the stuff is automated and
double-check that it would probably be
pretty hard to do something like that or
like it would be pretty easy to get
caught doing it so anyway that's that's
my fuller answer okay if you say so I
got a hot tip from my source at Amazon
Beth J's owes I don't know where he is I
don't know like what level how high up
he is or anything like that but Beth
jaysus is the primary he's never been
wrong to me so nice all right back into
Facebook also from Alex Mitchell I don't
understand Facebook being called a
monopoly I'm all against monopolies but
Facebook isn't a necessity and it's
completely free I guess making money on
ads does make a difference could you
maybe explain this a little more how
Facebook qualifies as monopoly well I
said it before it's not the only social
network yes
so the idea and they've brought this up
in US Congress to where it's the idea
that like Facebook really doesn't have
that much of a competitor I mean you can
point to Twitter but like you look at
2.2 billion people versus like 300
million yeah on Twitter and it's just
like that's not really competition
for them I mean like Mark Zuckerberg
didn't even list Twitter as a competitor
when they asked him to name like one
competitor that was out there like he
instead he named companies like Google
and Microsoft and Apple which are not
social networks but you know from from
his perspective so his defense has
always been and he mentioned this at
Parliament yesterday to like essentially
you know Facebook is not a monopoly
people on the average person uses 8
different apps to like communicate
online if you take a look at the App
Store the top 8 most popular apps three
to four of them like if you're depending
if you are on iOS or on Android are all
owned by Facebook so like let's look at
it so there's Facebook 300 three billion
people
whatsapp Instagram arguably the second
most popular social network which
Facebook owns Facebook Messenger so
that's already like four really popular
apps at Facebook owns and I think that's
the big argument that people make about
Facebook being a monopoly where yeah and
then now they're also trying to like
take out tinder with their new dating
service they tried to take out
Craigslist with their marketplace they
they own there and they have the user
base to do that I mean like look at what
happened with snapchat which could have
been one of their biggest competitors
and it was okay so just copy exactly
everything what they do and I'll snap
check still exists though yes one of the
arguments that Zuckerberg made which i
think is at least worth repeating is
that from a advertising and a digital
advertising perspective they're clearly
not a monopoly they obviously are a
duopoly with google in the united states
where they get a lot of digital
advertising revenue versus a bunch of
other publishers and a bunch of other
folks that add you know do ads online
but the like there was at least one EU
guy that was like look that's an
understandable argument except if you if
you have a monopoly on cars you can't
say that like oh well you could take a
bike or a train you know that still
means that you have monopoly on cars
which I thought was an interesting
argument yeah I mean I guess I guess the
argument like if we're going with the
car analogy here yes Facebook doesn't
have
in analogy I mean doesn't have like a
monopoly on all cars like they don't
have a monopoly on all advertising but
like imagine if like the most popular
car company in the world also had like
owned the most popular bike and train
company - mmhmm yeah one of the other
things that I thought was interesting
that was mentioned in the hearing wise
they like somebody posited this idea be
like would you think it was a good deal
he did not answer this question by the
way they were like you think it was a
good deal if we forced you to spin off
whatsapp like you no longer own or
control that company like he obviously
didn't even attempt to touch that one
but at the same time I you you saw all
like the congressional hearings I didn't
I was there was there like a big
difference between what the European
like what the tenor of that conversation
was because it looked like a lot of them
were talking about monopolies and
breaking up Facebook it was like it was
I wish they had the members of the
European Parliament asking those
questions with the US Congress format
because like in this one it was like a
lot of good questions but he doesn't
have the time to answer it whereas in
the US Congress like hearings it was a
lot of dumb questions and then he had to
answer every single one of them and it
was like okay well that was a massive
waste of time they were both like
massive wastes of time for different
reasons well that's good to hear
so like one was like dumb questions and
then the other one was dumb answers so
and before somebody in the comments
trolls with this show it was a massive
waste of time oh cool no no no just it
it's the rules of in before we've got to
learn the internet no no I haven't
figured that part out yet but okay thank
you we are winding down let's take one
more question and talk about recognition
honestly I thought that there was some
like new Russian initiative or something
when is yeah that's actually my wake
word so I'm gonna go off and do some spy
stuff now see oh wow okay don't kill me
first
freight car APEC says that most law
enforcement companies have their own
very advanced facial recognition
software so is this really concern and
how
this kind of superseded what they're
doing at the local level I think it's
it's a bigger concern because it's from
Amazon the idea that like this is a mega
like giant company that's helping
supplied at the same time that they're
also you know hey put this camera in
your home that like will tell you how
great your outfit is like they're not
using any of the echo data or anything
like that but I do think it strikes a
chord with a lot of people that already
have concerns about like the echo like
listening in their homes and things like
that well you said you got to talk to
Amazon though and they told you that the
information is siloed right they there's
not like one central database No yeah so
all the data that's in there like if I'm
you know the Orlando Police Department
I'm not gonna be able to match up photos
of like potential suspects that like say
police in Oregon has if you buy like if
you use recognition it matches only the
photos that you upload yourself that
being said though like an the ACLU has
made this argument to there's always
like a potential for breaches totally
especially with Amazon Web Services to
where like that has been a major source
of breaches from like companies over the
last like five years now and the idea is
every time that happens it's like it's
never Amazon's fault because it's not
like Amazon themselves got breaches the
person that set up this ad AWS like
cloud server they got breached
so that's like another like major
concern with this - mmm all right I
think that's gonna just about do us for
time today we have one more episode
coming up tomorrow you guys back for
this one or are we getting Joan on here
sometime soon well invite Joan Joan
we'll come back what you're getting sick
