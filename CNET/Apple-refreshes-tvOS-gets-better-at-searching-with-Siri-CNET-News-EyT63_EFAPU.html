way we interact with our television
because now we just tell it what we want
to watch and we're making it even better
because now you can search movies by
topics now my daughter is actually going
to high school this fall and I remember
back when I went to high school it's
been a while there's some great movies
that I'd love to watch with her and now
Siri makes this really easy because I
can just say find high school comedies
from the 80s and sorry we'll do that one
again find high school comedies from the
80s and there are some of my favorites I
actually have watched them all let's
take a look at Ferris Bueller's Day Off
and with just one tap we can start
watching a serially searches over
650,000 movies and TV shows now but what
about YouTube well that's easy too
because now you just ask Siri search
youtube for Steph Curry's three pointers
Siri lunches YouTube and shows you the
results but a big part of your TV
experience is live channels and we've
got some great channels on Apple TV like
ABC CBS FX and a lot more that give you
live channels but to start watching you
got to find the app you've got to launch
it and then you've got to find the
channel well we've got a great new
feature called live tune in and all you
have to do watch ESPN to take it
straight to the action go
and this is already working with a lot
of great channels and we're making live
tune in available on both your iPad and
Apple TV as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
