wireless technology was May of 2014 and
back then nobody expected it in the wild
until 2020
since then the goal line got moved up
quite a bit as Verizon recently
announced they will be doing field
trials in the US by fall of 2016 and
have some degree of market availability
in this country by 2017 that's even
ahead of Mobil ambitious South Korea in
2018 and Japan in 2020 let's look at the
reasons why we should once again take a
look at 5g including the fact that it's
coming a lot sooner than we thought
your first thought I'm sure is around
speed that 5g will be faster than 4G as
it was faster than 3G yes correct
and in fact verizon says it could be 30
to 50 times faster than your current 4G
LTE but take that with a grain of salt
because in the real world we know the
delivered speeds are different than the
possible speeds but speed to me is
actually the least interesting of 5 G's
promised benefits here are a few I think
are maybe a little more subtle but more
interesting
the first is low latency that means when
you create an input or request something
on your mobile over 5g it'll take very
little time before the other end
receives that request if you will now
this is measured in milliseconds so it
doesn't sound like a big gap but it's a
big part of why your phone can feel
sluggish a recent study by open signal
and fierce Wireless found that the
average latency on the big four carriers
in the US right now is between 75 and
100 milliseconds the folks over at the
5g development teams will tell you the
goal is to get latency on that network
at one millisecond that is dramatically
different aside from just being a faster
way to navigate the web which isn't
really the point it will allow us to
have applications like high performance
very responsive gaming over wireless
networks as well as professional
applications like remote telemedicine
and surgery without any goofs nothing
that keeps cutting a half a second after
the doctor stopped telling it to and
also robotic applications for industry
that require absolute precision and
again come down to low latency then
there's lower power consumption you
often think
a type of wireless is using less power
than others but in fact the wireless
radio inside your mobile device is one
of the biggest consumers of power this
is a big deal because it appears that
any major battery breakthrough isn't
going to arrive until flying cars so
let's make the most of what we have now
then there's traffic prioritization this
is being baked into 5g from the
beginning it's an idea that says look if
you've got a car going down the road
with a 5g connection it needs to know
that signals from other cars to avoid
collisions need to get through first and
that's signal streaming of video to your
kid in the backseat can wait a few
milliseconds and 5g is being built from
the ground up to have that kind of
smarts and finally there's cutting the
cord and I mean the entire cord right
now your home or business very likely
have Wireless inside them but what's
feeding that is a cable twisted pair
fiber or satellite connection getting to
the curb as we say but 5g wireless
promises to have so much bandwidth and
be so stable in delivering it that you
could actually use that to provision
Internet to a premise which we don't
really think of right now as a wireless
technology that means we have a much
greater flexibility of saying I need
internet here or here or here without
having to worry what kind of cable or
wire is available so a lot of questions
around 5g starting with a whole variety
of competing standards and development
players right now after that we hope to
get a 5g that is a thing versus a bunch
of things using the same name that's
what 4G is really like today there's
cost who knows how you price something
like this when it comes to market what
are the tiers
what are the gotchas and what about data
caps if you've got a pipeline this big
and fast you're gonna blow through a lot
more data than they provision for you
today even on a generous plan finally
you're gonna need a new device no device
on the market today can talk to a 5g
network what we're talking about a few
years down the road and you never have a
new device by then anyway so keep this
in the back of your mind that said 5g is
definitely shaping up sooner than we
thought
to be the biggest innovation in mobile
networks since mobile data know what's
