is it an upgrade worth getting now how
different is it and what does it feel
we've had the iPhone 10 for just a
handful of hours so far but these are my
first impressions out of the box with
what the 10 brings to the table the
iPhone 10 feels a lot like the iPhone 8
or 7 in the hand but a little denser and
thicker still it feels like the perfect
size says it still manages to cram
nearly a full edge to edge screen on the
front but yeah that notch there's a
cutout bit where Apple's advanced depth
sensing selfie camera lines most apps
don't use that area much but videos and
photos can be expanded to use that not
part of the screen it mostly means that
when apps and videos get cropped down to
avoid it the tens display sometimes
doesn't feel larger than the plus
screens at all and all new true depth
front cameras the tens biggest future
feature depth sensing infrared can scan
out a short distance which is used for a
few things right now most importantly
those cameras can now unlock your phone
and pay for things face ID replaces
touch ID the 3d face mapping is the only
way to unlock your phone and pay for
things besides using a normal passcode
it's pretty fast to set up and it worked
well on my face but you still need to
swipe up to unlock extra settings can
turn on or off the attention feature
which requires you to look at the phone
in order for it to work
face ID is supposed to work with your
face when you make casual changes like
getting a haircut
so what happens when face ID see some
changes in your face well I started with
my haircut next I'm gonna work on my
beard we're adding a beard again crazy
new glasses a hat a scarf a hat and
scarf what if I just changed everything
base ID has limits but mostly worked
provided I was looking directly at it
the face idea no touch ID also means no
more home button which means you need to
relearn how to use the phone
new gestures control things it's swipe
up to get to the home screen swipe down
from the corner for control center and
swipe up and hold for other apps or
swipe the bottom strip to swap apps a
side button control Siri and Apple pay
it's a lot to get used to right away and
some of the gestures aren't always one
hand friendly for quick on-the-go access
there are a few camera upgrades on the
iPhone 10 selfies can get portrait mode
which adds depth effect to headshots it
looks really good for the portrait
lighting beta so far which tries to add
studio style lighting looks like it
still needs work the true depth camera
can also be used for augmented reality
and other face mapping tricks there
aren't that many so far an emoji is
Apple's snapchat like face mapping trick
for iMessage which lets you face puppet
animated emoji as you speak the
10-second clips are cute but snapchats
also taking advantage of true depth with
improved face mapping filters to an
apples clips app uses it to green-screen
faces into animated effects maybe
there'll be more down the road but there
aren't many yet I am Scott Stein and
that's our very first look with our
first handful of hours with the iPhone
10 more to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
