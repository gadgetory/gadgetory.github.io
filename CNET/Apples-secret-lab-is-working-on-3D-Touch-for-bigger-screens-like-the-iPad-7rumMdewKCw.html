the apple pie for the good and bad
inside the world of Apple now did you
know Apple has a top secret lab well it
was a secret until now see a new report
from Bloomberg says Apple opened the
secret laboratory in northern Taiwan
earlier this year to develop new
technologies for thinner lighter and
brighter displays for Apple devices the
facility is located in a remote science
park with no external apple brandy and
the Bay gay has recruited people from
local display makers AU Optronics and
Qualcomm to help develop new LCD and
OLED technologies I'm also hoping apple
has this top secret battery lab
somewhere that we don't know about
otherwise we're still stuck with this
who is so ugly now echoing the Bloomberg
report digit times as Apple is also
developing flexible OLED display tech
for idevices at the newly discovered lab
now this secret lab sounds good but we
won't be reaping any of its benefits in
the near future that's after KGI
securities claims the next iPad air
three will be released in the first half
of 2016 but is unlikely to get a 3d
touch display because of production
issues in the supply chain Apple Insider
corroborate supports Apple is developing
a new pressure sensitive display that
can be scaled up to ipad screen sizes
but also confirms the tech won't be
ready for the release of the ipad air
three or even around the time of the
iphone 7 so it could be at least a year
out now Apple can't scale the current
iphone 6s is 3d touch to something like
a 9.7 inch display and that's why
they're working on a comparable tech for
larger screen sizes even for something
like the twelve point nine inch iPad pro
and you all know how I feel about that
Pro I'll write an apple music news a
media research report estimates that
Apple music will have around eight
million paying subscribers by the end of
this year and that number is expected to
more than double to nearly 20 million at
the end of 2016 it won't catch spotify
with currently over 20 million
subscribers and 75 million users but
that number would solidify Apple music
as the number two player in streaming
music Apple's music services also
finally getting support on sonos with a
public beta the sonos controller app was
updated with beta support for the
streaming service giving users access to
their music library and playlists for
streaming in multiple rooms and you know
what that's a good Apple and if you're
an apple retail employee the Cupertino
Fruit Company is gifting its staff a
free nine months subscription for Apple
music that's in addition to the pair of
your beats headphones they hooked up
staff with for the holidays now there
are no confirmed reports if you can get
hired for the holiday season get your
free stuff and then peace out kind of
like how I do samples at costco alright
exclusive content is a big deal with any
streaming service and this one is huge
for Apple music and fans of Taylor Swift
see on December twentieth a new
backstage concert film called the 1989
world tour live will be available
exclusively on Apple music you know if
you're someone who's into that kind of
thing I know there are a lot of Apple
biters who force their significant
others to watch us so trust me I've met
them so I felt like I should at least
give you a sneak peek of the trailer so
yeah there it is
I wonder what would happen if I invited
the most amazing artists in the world to
come out with me and perform on my stage
dammit okay cool oh man I wonder what it
would be remade you have to see this so
I lost in it every not arena oh my gosh
looks like it here Oh hit my head it
would be oh my god that whole tray over
Taylor I love you too quick we know okay
so yeah you know whatever to their own
all right that's gonna do for this
week's show but a quick shout out to my
Apple by Dirk I'll from Houston Texas
who found my Apple watch after it
slipped off my wrist in the airport in
Vancouver you tracked me down and gave
it back to me right here true story so
if you still want to be a part of the
show send your emails and you're
positive or brutal feedback to the apple
by to cnet com or tweet me a brian Tong
and you might find yourself here as we
wrap up 2015 thanks so much for watching
we'll catch y'all next time for the bite
of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
