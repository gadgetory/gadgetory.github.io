the way of the dodo there is still a
market for high-quality sound on laptops
and even some desktops the creative
soundblaster
x7 is a curious Beast it's a USB sound
card that also doubles as a stereo
amplifier plus enables you to record to
a PC as well oh and it has Bluetooth and
a smartphone app and $400 it certainly
packs in a lot of features but is this
something you might need build quality
is only barely acceptable sadly for a
while it looks pretty sitting on the
desktop it's too lightweight it moves
around on the desk when you plug things
in and the buttons scrape when you push
them while it has the outputs for
surround sound and it decodes Dolby
Digital it's really designed to be used
as a stereo device with a 100 watt
stereo amplifier built-in and 2
headphone outputs meanwhile hooking up
surround sound means you would have to
forego the amplifier altogether and in
this case you'd be better off just
paying for a cheaper card the amp
accepts the line-in as well as a digital
optical input and these can be used to
listen to consoles or even your TV as
well as record to the PC
unfortunately there's no remote and
there's also no input selection so
everything including the Bluetooth input
will play at once if you let it
however the smartphone app does offer
some control over sound settings and
volume being able to use the device to
play Bluetooth music while the PC is off
is also handy sound quality is fine as
other sound blaster cards which is to
say it's very good and the amp is even
good enough to drive speakers worth up
to 600 or $700 of course you'll find
that more modest speakers like for
example the $300 audio engine p4s will
make a better match you could also
consider the emu XM 7 speakers and I
would personally only use them with this
amp as it has a specific EQ setting to
tame their overly bright treble is this
sound cut better than a dedicated USB
and at the same price no but if you're
looking for a desktop and slash sound
card that will also record to a PC say
if you're a musician or a podcaster then
the x7 is pretty niche but also pretty
capable this is ty Pendlebury for
