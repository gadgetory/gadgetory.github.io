Apple well I've got a little update
right here for ya I'm Dan Ackman and
this is the Apple MacBook Pro with
Retina display the 15-inch version
mid-2014 now what Apple is done with the
retina MacBook Pro does the same thing
they did earlier in 2014 with the
MacBook Air and also with the iMac
desktops they kept the outside look
pretty much exactly the same but they've
updated some of the components inside
most notably the CPUs and in some cases
they've added some price cuts to them
those MacBook Airs went down by a
hundred bucks there's a new less
expensive 21.5 inch iMac and for the
retina MacBook Pro line the most
expensive 15-inch now cost a hundred
dollars less the other one cost the same
this is the entry-level model if you can
use the term entry-level to describe
something that costs $2,000 at $19.99
and once you get new industries version
versus last year's across the retina Pro
line is a slightly slightly slightly
faster CPU just a very modest spec bump
a bunch of them double the RAM from
either for cakes to eight gigs or in
this case to 16 gigs other than that
you've got the same pretty big SSDs a
256 gig SSD and this one a 512 and the
more expensive version that's $24.99 for
that more expensive version but if you
stick with this one you also lose out on
the discreet Nvidia graphics this guy
just uses intel's integrated iris pro
graphics of course you still get the
main highlight of that MacBook Pro line
which is that Retina display that super
high resolution display over the last
year or two and this is the third year
in a row that Apple is making these
retina systems we've seen more and more
I call them better than HD displays from
other PC makers Toshiba even has a 4k
display in a 15-inch laptop and of
course Lenovo and Toshiba and other guys
have you know better than HD displays
it's almost a common thing now in a
premium laptop and we talked about these
prices you definitely consider this a
premium laptop this model versus the one
from last year performance is a hair
better because of the faster CPU battery
life is about
the same still nine hours still very
good for a high-powered premium laptop
the main difference is you're getting
that slight CPU bump you got more RAM
but other than that if you have an older
15 inch retina MacBook Pro there's
really no need to update but if you've
been waiting
they've given just a tiny bit of a boost
even though this model didn't get that
small price cut that some of the other
ones did I'd love to see this for a
hundred or two hundred dollars less I'm
Dan Ackerman and that is the Apple
MacBook Pro 15 inch Retina display</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
