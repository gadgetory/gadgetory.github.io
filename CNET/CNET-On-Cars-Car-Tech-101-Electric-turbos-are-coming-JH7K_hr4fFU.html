check out our car Tech 101 on them back
from episode 2 and our turbos vs.
superchargers episode 15 segment but I
can save you some trouble we can do a
quick refresher on turbos right here
with this Ford EcoBoost four-cylinder
and this is the turbo apparatus this
part picks up the exhaust gas coming out
of the engine and it starts to spin a
shaft on the other end of that is a
compressor that takes air and rams more
of it into the cylinder then the
environment would do naturally and
that's how you get more power out of the
engine because more fuel more power but
there are three hang-ups to this kind of
design first of all since it's run by
exhaust which is a gas and a
compressible gas there's a whole lot of
lag when you step on the gas pedal
before you get the full effect of it
secondly you've got an issue of size and
placement I mean you've got one spool
here another spool here and a lot of
plumbing that means this thing's fairly
big because it lives and runs off the
exhaust it has to live at the exhaust
manifold more or less that takes away
some flexibility for engine designers
who would like to put it somewhere else
and thirdly since the turbo sits in the
middle of the exhaust stream it gets in
the way of scavenging exhaust gases and
that means the engine breathes less well
that's not good for power or efficiency
the electric turbo seeks to answer all
three of those limitations
major supplier Vallejo has an electric
turbo which they happen to call an
electric supercharger
it's powered by 48 volts DC four times
what your car has now this is a new
thing but we've covered it recently in
our episode 63 car tech 101 if you want
to brush up now once you have 48 volts
this turbo can be mounted almost
anywhere typically close to the intake
of the engine for the shortest run to
push the boosted air and of course not
sitting in the exhaust path or it can be
used to pre boost a traditional turbo so
it works better that's part of why
Vallejo claims this can increase mpg on
a car by at least 10% and maybe over 15
to conquer turbo lag their electric
booster always idles at around 10,000
rpm spooling up to a max of 70,000 to
deliver full boost and almost the moment
you demanded via the pedal outies been
testing it and Vallejo says that company
will put it into a production car in
2016 Honeywell and Continental are two
other big industry suppliers who plan to
have electric turbos on the market and
in production cars perhaps a year or two
after Vallejo taking a slightly
different tack is major turbo maker
BorgWarner with what they call an e
booster it's a small electric air pump
that additionally boosts what a
conventional turbo is shoving into the
engine either by being mounted before or
after the turbo itself the e booster is
always a helper not a primary turbo the
fuel economy and emissions targets that
are coming in the EU and US alone
cover enough new cars each year to
demand new ways of managing engine
efficiency opening the door for electric
turbos especially in smaller engines
that demands more nuanced flexible
boosting technologies more car tech
