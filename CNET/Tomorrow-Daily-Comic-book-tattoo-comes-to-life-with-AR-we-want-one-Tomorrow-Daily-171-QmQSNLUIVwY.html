that was so intense I don't need to
describe it no yeah World Trade Center
observatory has an amazing elevator
we're gonna tell you all about and a
comic book creator gets pretty much the
greatest tattoo of all time tomorrow
daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best speak
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva and join me as always kill
anonymous directing you to the exit in
the event of an emergency
it's Thursday you know how Thursdays
episodes go exit to exits in the back
two in the front and two on the wings
this is Thursday throw it no it is it is
like superhero weekend
it is superhero day was yesterday which
I don't observe stupid fake holidays so
that people can celebrate it on like
Facebook's and turns my into it on
Saturdays it's a real holiday though
yeah but no that's real like that's an
actor not like donut day donut like a
yeah not like popcorn danceable genghis
day but but this weekend not only the
thing that you're into but also it's
it's super heroin it's Avengers means
happen so we're getting into it alright
alright what's it the headlines
I have three tattoos
fun fact a lot of people don't know that
how many's on their Nightmare Before
Christmas - okay the third one is not
it's da della smart I think the one on
your leg dick takes up that much is this
is the cap sleeve the cap sleeve is I
like to consider it one piece I like
consider one piece um I have to tell you
about solar I gotta tell you about this
modern pole axis is a comic book that
this guy kick-started the creator's name
is Sioux - Sioux - hey Kickstarter this
comic book and it's served a mixed
digital media comic book it's pretty
cool so what you have is you have the
comic book and then you have this app
that is powered by boom core AR
technology and as you go through you can
actually like hover your camera over it
and then the panels come to life which
is pretty amazing and there's like
hidden messages and secret stuff that
you wouldn't see unless you were using
the actual app and everything so this
character right here that you're seeing
right now like that the his has this
plot like his hands clawed up and stuff
so that's what the Congress like oh my
god I want to read this right okay so me
too so this guy kick-started last year
but the point of this is is that the
creator got an idea that maybe the
images from the comic would also sort of
come to life on other surfaces namely
his own skin so he got an exact image
tattooed on his forearm and it comes to
life that's what we're seeing on the
screen right now he put that up on
Instagram it's a video oh my god that's
the coolest tattoo ever I am stealing
this idea somehow I saw this and I let
out a little scream cuz I was so excited
I wish my tattoos could come to life but
I was thinking about it
could you imagine with augmented reality
I'm sure there could be all kinds of
uses for this like you could have Disney
say oh we're gonna release this one
piece of art that you could unlock like
it would be living from this particular
movie or whatever like they could say oh
we're gonna release this cool Iron Man
tattoo and if you get it like or if you
have it then it's AR and people I'm sure
get tattoos of whatever any I think I
think we're already there if you think
about I don't know if you think about
any of those little things that like
Nintendo
what's out where you little character
and it's just like this weird IR code
and then you could just yeah that's
awesome Wow
pretty great I don't know what somebody
has to have thought about this but like
this guy it was from his art from his
comic book and it's and it's very
specifically designed for his comic book
to come to life so this is a this is a
very particular app and it's basically
the app is treating his arm as if it's a
panel in the comic book which is so
freakin cool and it just oh my god it's
amazing that makes me so happy and the
the story in the comic book is modern
plexuses the tale of a paranoid time
traveler so I thought that would be it's
kind of like very futuristic like it's
cool I like I just love all of it
everything about it I like can't wait I
can't wait is all the issues out or
what's the deal I'm not a hundred
percent sure I know that I want to know
too much this in particular was
kick-started a you know like a year ago
it was last year it was kick-started so
on so you'll have to check again
modern pole axis is the name of it mmm
and so that brings us to our hashtag of
the day which is of course TD tat what
tattoo would you get and how would
animate that's a that is I'm excited to
hear your answers for this okay I got
one
okay my hair looks real it looks real
Thursday it looks Thursday all right so
so filling in for mine alien what is it
that it I'm not saying I'd get an alien
know what I'd get is I would get do you
stay on this angle go I would get a
tattoo here and a tattoo here and they
would be the devil and an angel so they
would use IR you see like a devil and an
angel on my shoulder but they're like
versions of me like a dummy where Cronk
has different any time someone has to
make a decision between something good
and something bad and there's always
like a little person that's like yeah
Kail do it and then someone else going
no Cael to wait I mean that's what I'm
gay I think I think both of them sound
evil both of your self evil or like
they're both Devils all right what's
your I think I would get I like the idea
of getting a metroid ball like Samus
Aran in a ball and then will you put the
AR over it she pops up and she shoots
stuff that's also a me
you're really cool yeah like you get
this like really simple thing and people
have no idea what it is until you like
put a camera over it and all of a sudden
it's like Santa's jumps out of it kill
some space but that's that's also really
good Wow all right yeah good good
choices I thought I was a really nice
time TV tech hashtag with that to chat
all right you tack talking about
hololens okay so let's just launch let's
roll on the lower thirds and launch
right into the b-roll because we have
more visuals from hololens we of course
know that this is Microsoft's new AR
headset that I think earlier their
promises coming out this year we will
see about that but Microsoft build is
happening right now so Microsoft has
taken this opportunity to show off
basically in real life what they're a
are can do so they had someone on stage
using the AR headset the the the
hololens and then they had a camera that
was outfitted with the ability to see
what he was seeing so what did they show
off well they showed off everything that
they promised they would in the video
including you'll be able to watch a
screen yeah enlarge that screen and the
screen will follow you you'll be able to
have 3d renders of stuff move around in
active space interact it with it just by
putting your finger in in real space no
gloves or nothing that was proper
English but uh loves or nothing so
what's what's they announce a few more
things including a Windows holographic
program so devs are gonna be able to
make Windows 10 apps so this is all
gonna brought off Windows 10 that was a
big theme yeah
Windows 10 is gonna be like the ish can
we discuss this robot because I need one
yeah a medium so they they got a real
robe they got a real robot and to like
have a our abilities and they made it so
that the robot can sense the world
around him it's all futuristic stuff
like crazy future tech I've seen a lot
of people it works come out of this yeah
I've seen a lot of people come out of
this not with oh I think it would be
really cool if it did this but with
there are so many possibilities I can't
even pinpoint one and that's been the
general response yeah it's like there's
so many possibilities I my brain just
can't even work yeah um so yeah so
that's that's kind of like the big thing
that they showed off I
how it was basically because there are
no like microsoft says hololens works
without a computer a smartphone like you
don't have to plug it into anything it's
just its own independent piece of
technology that you can use so far which
I think it'll be very expensive if
that's the case but I liked how they are
basically allowing you to have your
entire desktop or your your computer
experience in your living room like the
he so he was walking around with the
video and stuff but he also had you know
like the little fish bowl with the
weather in it and then if you walked
over to his desk his calendar was the
screen was sitting on his desk look as
accountant we recommend you check out
the video we have a couple up on CNET
that are sparse like parse down versions
yeah that are like 2 or 3 minutes it's
super to go watch it there's two of them
one that shows off the robot with that
that one right there and then they have
another one that shows off how they use
it in the home space
I'd recommend watching a full-length
version so you can hear the annoying and
give you the whole demo but basically we
wanted to make sure that you knew at
least the very like the little bit of it
and you saw some of it there's no price
yet no release the date but you me but
give me now and if Microsoft if you
could just bundle hololens with that
robot that would be great really great
the next thing I'd love to hear from
them are the apps that they're already
working with so whether it be Netflix
which is what we saw and their initial
run or Amazon or any they showed off
Skype showed Skype they showed a video
player and they showed so dumb he's like
I don't call my friends enough so I'm
gonna put my picture of my friends on
the wall with my skype thing so remember
to call them all the time it was a
little silly but I get where they're
going with it yeah but it was it was
pretty neat oh yeah don't forget you can
have a dog you can have a dizzy dog that
just sent from the floor and no one else
can see you weirdo
you're weird are you creepy weirdo with
your imaginary a our holographic dog
yeah I saw a lot of people that were
like because every single thing they
showed off that you can expand it and
everyone was like everyone was like one
night when he turned he goes or this dog
and then everyone's like expand the dog
expand the dog
I love it anyway we're excited about
hololens and all the possibilities
obviously you can think of a lot of
dystopian reasons why this might play
right out of the better out of the gate
- thumbs up thumbs up shut up and take
my money that's right Logan was gonna
buy the the Apple watch you're gonna but
you get a hololens Logan alright let me
tell you about one World Trade Center
this is pretty amazing and I think all
major cities in the world should
incorporate this somehow into their
tourism experiences so One World Trade
Center has this amazing elevator or I
guess a series of elevators that I would
like to tip my hat to I just saw this
video maybe a couple days ago so here it
is and you can see it starts underground
and it comes up and what's happening is
this is the history of Manhattan Island
in five hundred and fifteen years in the
ride from the bottom to the top of the
one World Trade Center Observatory
you're gonna see the history of
Manhattan as its evolved over five
hundred and fifteen years that's
incredible isn't that so cool like I
love this so what they're doing is their
five special elevators that service the
observatory and it's a 47 second
panoramic time-lapse 500-year over 500
years of Manhattan history Manhattan
Island history there are 975 inch
monitors inside this elevator to make it
look like you're in a glass elevator as
you're like watching so it's a there's
the building being constructed as you're
getting up to the top floors and then
all of a sudden you get to the top for
102 doors open and boom there you are
right at the observatory you're like
right there so pretty awesome sort of
like it's it obviously like things like
this have been done like similar things
but not anything quite like this that
I've seen and I just think this is a a a
really nice tribute to the city of New
York which is a great place for it
obviously at One World Trade Center and
it starts in the year 1500 and then just
like takes you all the way takes all the
way from that is really incredible
I want every city to do this now like I
want like in London when you go to the I
if you have to like ride up or if you go
to the observatory or whatever you ride
all the way up and that's like you could
see it there too like I love this idea
no I want to
in every major city I would love this
you know the US bank building in
downtown LA you take the elevator
they're like that's what I want to see
the history of like all of Los Angeles
being built out I think that would be so
awesome be like several times where it's
just on fire right now just on fire
there you go damn fire pad is really a
really nice like it's really for New
York and what that whole building
represents yeah it's I mean it's just
really great and it opens almost a month
from today oh it's not even open the
29th of May this is gonna be like the
observatory will open so I think the
building is open as far as I'm aware but
I think the observatory like I'm not
100% sure you guys I haven't been to
that building and I haven't really kept
tabs but as far as I'm aware on this
article it looks like either these
elevators or the observatory itself will
open May 29th so there you go definitely
check that out if you ever go to New
York really great for tourism but those
are our headlines for today a lot of fun
stuff we will be right back with of
course into it because it's Thursday

auto on PC because of mods mods are like
the bread and butter of a lot of PC
games so of course GTA has the ability
to be anything and so you can be right
now they're they're very limited because
they haven't cracked the whole thing so
you can only be things that are already

there was a lot so let's get into that
immediately
so we saved TD bullets aunt Edie souped
for today because we did Konami two days
in a row so uh TV bullets about the
DARPA homing bullet it's able to kind of
like aim at a target find it change
trajectory meter so I saw after some
more digging I did see that it is fins
and like an engine that it responds to a
computer on the rifle okay so that's how
it changed an engine it's something like
that like fins and some sort of like a
you know some sort of microprocessor or
something like that that changes that
helps the fins change direction not a
cheat bullet yeah but still there's a
people some people are asking like
$10,000 a bull which is crazy some
people wanted some people have a lot of
money so I've got who knows anyway um
