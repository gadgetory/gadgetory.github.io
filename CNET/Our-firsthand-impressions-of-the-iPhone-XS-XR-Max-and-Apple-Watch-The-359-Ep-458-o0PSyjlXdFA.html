Chang I'm out
for dang and with us this special guest
chart tip Ken Apple's event was last
week but we're still talking about the
new iPhones and Apple watch Charlie you
were at the event so please give us some
of your impressions what did you think
when you actually got a chance to play
with these phones these devices yeah I
mean it's pretty interesting I think
what they really did was kind of give
more options in terms of you know we
have the bigger screen again
they finally redesigned they're cheaper
iPhone which is now yeah you know above
$700 the the XS sorry tennis itself is
we've been mixing it up all week after
will the tennis itself is you know if
you have the 10 it's gonna be basically
the same phone right for all intents and
purposes but it's kind of those other
two that are really interesting yeah
they can I mean the 10 are you wrote
about this ahead of time that it was
sort of the most intriguing yeah I have
a lineup what do you think of that phone
in particular when you held it did it
feel cheap it didn't feel cheap I mean
it definitely was colorful I don't know
if people remember the 5c so when that
one came out it was it felt cheap
because it was plastic so it I mean it
literally was cheap materials but it was
colorful this one didn't feel cheap in
your hand you know it's still premium
materials it's aluminum it's not
stainless steel so it's just not as
sleek as the other two right but it
still is you know a really good phone
for what it is
did you see like the difference between
you know the whole adversity like what I
noticed was the bezels so with with LCD
you can't curve it over the sides like
you can OLED oh you know so you know I'd
the iPhone it's just like you almost
don't even notice that there's any edges
around the display at all it's just kind
of like all screen I kind of I know that
was more noticeable I thought on the 10r
but you know just kind of the edges but
it didn't I didn't what I wasn't doing
like watching videos or anything like
side by side to be able to compare and I
think for most people you probably won't
notice
okay just you know in what you're doing
on a normal basis you're you know
looking at Instagram and you know
checking your Facebook and sending
emails and Google Maps and whatever it
is you're doing I don't think it's gonna
be yeah a huge huge difference right and
so you also wrote about how smartwatches
are finally finally where we wanted them
to be five years ago yeah and then so
that's perfect I would apple watch what
you think of the new series for yeah I
honestly want my watches to be smaller
instead of bigger which you know so that
was one thing because these are
definitely a little bit bigger but you
know it does look a little sleeker cuz
it's kind of it's a little bit yeah it's
I mean you know they're using kind of
some of the design techniques they were
using in the phone starting with the
iPhone 10 last year they've kind of
taken those a little bit to the watch
and then the health stuff is really
interesting you know not just for I feel
like a lot of us aren't gonna be using
like the EKG monitor we're not gonna be
necessarily like caring about fall
detection all the time right
but it's kind of nice just like knowing
that stuff is there if you need it and
for people who have disabilities the
elderly some of these other areas people
with epilepsy who do fall a lot like
these could really be very significant
devices for them okay and we wanted to
talk about the latest in road trip
series alfred you went to a well it's
supposedly an underground bunker
tell me about what that was like well
yeah so i went to a factory out in los
angeles
it's from the atlas survival shelters
they were like one of the top sellers of
nuclear bunkers in the world but they
also sell it for you know things like
wildfires or tornadoes and things like
that that's actually their bigger
concern right now because they're based
in california a lot of the shops are
selling are for wildfires and you know
that being said a lot of their customers
are also very rich like a lot of them
are going into like Napa Valley which is
near Silicon Valley with all these like
tech billionaires there one that I saw
was being built was supposed to double
as a wine cellar so in case of emergency
you know you can also get very wasted as
you what with his ending that's what I
would define it you know like people
have like some of this wine is worth a
lot yeah
it's true yeah so no room for the kids
just yeah so how much how much are some
of these shelters so they start at about
$18,000 for like the cheapest one which
was the one that I was in okay um and
then they can go up to 84 like Bay Area
yes eh sorry could you go up to like 8.3
million dollars and that's if you want
like some crazy thing with like there
were two that were built in Napa Valley
that had like horse stables and then
which I'm like why would you have your
horse underground with you doesn't make
any sense like the wildfires just think
of the smell though hey you gotta
protect the horse yeah all right so for
more on these stories in the road trips
area should curse on Cena and run a
channel malphur dang I'm shy recipient
actual something
yeah
yeah that one is insane I don't know if
specifically that one was but they have
models that are worth like so like third
they're only as always thanks for
joining us for the recording of the
audio podcast now it's time for me to
jump into the chat they got some
questions and comments and keep the
conversation going I know everybody
wants to talk about these phones Mike
Shaw asks only 64 gigabytes of storage
on high phones start at a thousand and
eleven hundred dollars
Apple has insulted all of us hot take
guys what do you think I thought that
was actually kind of surprising that
they still start with 64 I really kind
of thought that the minimum was gonna
get bumped up a little higher
yeah I have a 64 gig phone and I've
never run out of memory on it to be fair
I also don't
yeah that's insane I don't take that
many videos or terabyte an iCloud
storage every month oh god no no I mean
when you have kids you know I was like
thinking about getting a new phone this
morning and then I was looking I was
like do I really need like 128 gigs no
like I'm flying a 64 then I just didn't
get a new phone but would you pay a
thousand dollars for it
I want to pay a thousand dollars for any
phone so no there you go that's my hot
take just no let's take one from James
FIFA this is a recent question but I
think this will kind of set the stage
well for the rest of the conversation
what does a liquid retina mean I've
never heard that before
oh it's because it's a term they made up
yes so yeah that's why yeah this is a
bad thing then again be very super
retina doesn't mean anything either no
huh these are all just made-up terms it
was just nice little markings I thought
I was like a metal gear solid reference
I thought it was my disease like could
that liquid retina I feel like that
would be we just got like a band name if
the doctor came to you like sorry I mean
you know they just have these like
marketing terms so you don't feel like
you're kind of getting screwed when you
don't have the super retina you have
liquid right I'm your pain you're 750
like don't worry you've got a liquid I'd
love to be in the room where they come
up with that where they just have a
bunch of like quasi like sounding names
like mega ready
that's actually on your podcast now -
it's just liquid retina
ready for the next one yeah from the -
so I take the goal of getting a small
phone is dead is that correct Alfred I
think this one's for you
yeah I've pretty much given up on it I
like I said I was looking for a new
phone this morning and it was basically
just oh I'm definitely not getting a
like smaller cheaper phone now but
Linlin law has a column on small phones
I think there is ik a Sony device that's
out there that's like an Android device
that's small if you want to switch to
Android there are some small options but
you're right most I mean with Apple
killing the iPhone se I'm like pretty
much still using my 5s like now like I
like my phone screen crack this morning
and I was gonna look for a new phone and
then I decided you know I'm just gonna
get screen replace because I like this
phone size there are by the way there
are phone se is available I think yeah
it's still it sells out because it
carries probably have some inventory so
if you really want a small phone people
are still trying to sell them for like
$200 and it's just like are you kidding
me no that's way too much money for a
phone wait how much do they go for $200
yes they were trying to like this is
like like refurbished like it it oh oh
yeah no like I'm not buying that there's
something out hope though that they're
gonna come out with one like I think
that first se came out and like March or
something yeah it's kind of a weird time
I think the same time yeah yes I I don't
know they never tell this obviously
which is unfortunate it's hard it's
better long like hand-sized aside like
just like you know trying to like
stretch your hand so use like you know a
max or anything like that
kids yeah that and like pocket space is
really frustrating cuz like I have I
have a galaxy s7 that I use for work and
I hate putting that at my pocket because
it just like sticks out so you answer
like insanely yeah cuz I'm insanely sim
and slimming in shape so right thanks
for a compliment just by the way Linds
story she notes that she calls up the
sony xperia x z2 compact which i've
never heard
and you probably buy online unlocked but
if you really really want a small phone
apparently that's an option for you just
give me the phone that I can digest and
I sure yeah is that what they do in the
movie no but it's we were so close to
the future and then they just completely
went the opposite way that's why I'm so
excited about the Apple watch being able
to be like you can use it as a phone cuz
like yes finally like give me something
like that size i want that size of the
FAFSA phone yes just like a little yeah
but then it turns out that it's not that
great of a phone so thanks a lot
yeah last about an hour yeah imagine
getting spam calls on that alright let's
take one from our old friend Carlos I
have questions does the iPhone 10 are
performant perform fast also how bad are
the pixels can you see a lot of pixels
does it look the same as an iPhone 7 or
8 and what is your takeaway on the
general quality no sure are you you had
some time earlier to kind of broach on
that but now is the time we get to run
free with the with the topic so go for
it yeah so um it does not look like the
seven or the 8 because it looks more
like the iPhone 10 that was kind of the
whole point of this was that phone was
finally getting redesigned so there's no
home button if you like touch ID you're
gonna have to buy one of their older
phones that still have that it has the
same processor as the 10s and the tennis
Mac's so it's gonna be a fast phone I
mean like this is in if you just kind of
compare them it's basically the sum of
the materials are less premium and it
doesn't have the two camera lenses so if
you really like that 2x zoom that's just
really easy you know you hit the button
and it's you know clear great or kind of
the bokeh effect where you can take a
picture of your dog and like it's
blurred behind him that's not gonna work
on the ten are the ten are has they use
kind of software to be able to blur the
backgrounds if you're taking pictures of
people yeah but it doesn't work with
like animals and things oh really it's
just people it's just for people Oh
yeah they said that during the
presentation did that well maybe they
did I guess I was told that in like the
demo room oh so it's you know if you
yeah you want pictures of your pets
you're gonna have to get the other one
oh yeah I'm gonna drop an extra $300 for
better photos of my pets yes you will I
mean yeah but but otherwise it's it's
very similar I didn't see those two
screens right next to each other it if
you're I don't think the iPhone 7 looks
pixely I don't think the iPhone 8 looks
pixel II and those don't have the OLED
screen so you just kind of have to think
of it as like kind of a similar screen
to what was in those devices just you
know the home button is gone yeah it's
fast and snappy it's got it's everything
I've gotten Center class and I've got a
10 and I look at the screens often
actually and I don't I mean of course
you do of course I do I rush
Roger waiting so we're trying to eat a
lot of emails I will say like the color
the screen the OLED screen is a little
bit more vibrant but it's really not
that significant a difference yeah it's
not a deal-breaker like if I just had
LCD I wouldn't be disappointed yeah so I
mean yeah it seems like this is a phone
for once I'd like even though it's not
cheap but it's definitely significantly
less expensive than the 10 yeah and it
doesn't have the compromises if I could
if I see yeah I mean I honestly think
the only reason you know that the only
thing that's like lesser really with
this that you would notice is the camera
yep and that's you know the rest is like
not the lack of 3d touch no I don't know
I think it's okay I'm joking nobody's 3d
touch I I use it I use it for one thing
it's the control the cursor when I'm
writing an email oh that's it yeah
anyway Brian next question next question
comes from DC one four seven Tim Cook
proposed that iPhones are so expensive
today because it's so valuable now do
you think this is a justified comment
well if you do look at the resale values
of the iPhone versus other phones you
definitely are gonna get more money back
if you're selling your iPhone like if
you're trading it in and getting a new
one they definitely make me
like retain their value so much more
than the others and the fact is like the
stuff that they're putting into these
phones now you can hold onto these for a
long time and they're good like the
camera and these are good like they're
you know it's not gonna
they obviously make it better every year
so you're like oh I need the better
thing right but if you have your phone
for three years it's so good I'm going
to it just sounds like a very like
circular argument that he's making or
like chicken or the egg kind of thing it
like they're very expensive because
they're very valuable are they very
valuable because they're very expensive
yes yeah you saying the same thing you
can't really what came first a shyster
of the crook
James fever says people in the USA are
lucky Apple charges more in other
countries I'm in the UK and they charge
upwards of 26 percent more that sucks
sorry Dan from Pamela what do you guys
think about the iPhone 10s and 10's max
not selling out on pre-order I actually
thought that was very interesting myself
because I've covered a lot of these
pre-orders and these the devices sell
out like almost instantly I think a lot
of people I think that that's why we
don't have the 10r right away either I
think that you know that's coming in
October so that people aren't like oh I
need this your refreshment what happened
with the iPhone 8 in 8 plus last show I
don't think those sold either round yeah
iPhone tented yeah almost instantly it
was it was backordered they have gotten
better with supply chain right and if
you look at these they are basically the
same phone you know this is an S year
right it's not a complete redesign so
they figured out kind of all the
manufacturing kings we have like gotten
all of that streamlined but also I think
people just probably don't feel a huge
rush you know these as much as they did
like the 10 was just such a huge change
and such such a big redesign that you
know there was so much demand for that
raised you know it's an S here it's last
year
there you go apparently we need to talk
about 3d touch Steven Joseph R is asking
what's the deal with 3d touch we had
someone else in the chat Ivan are they
really killing 3d touch feature on the
iPhone
no no they're definitely not I mean they
made a point to mention it yep during
its on their presentation to tennis max
but not on the 10r
yeah and we're thinking it's probably
just cost like it costs like you have to
put in that little extra layer for 3d
touch to work and so you want to get the
10r to a lower price point that's a good
way to cut out cut it out from Akash a
trillion dollar company that will not
provide accessories what are your
thoughts on that one wait what do you I
guess dongles not in the barrels nine
dollars and what their effort is that
you shouldn't want to have to have
accessories right isn't that what
they're trying to do yeah I mean they
won't shoot it they want you to be like
buying air pods or beats headphones that
are Bluetooth and wireless and want you
to keep now you end up carrying three I
carry literally three kinds of
headphones every time I travel because
you need the headphone jack like you
can't watch like movies on the plane if
you don't have a regular heavy on Jack
and then you know and then the ear pods
die if you know if you're talking on the
phone for like an hours or you know an
hour to you they're gonna die so yeah so
I'm carrying three headphones all the
time but so anyway
the future yeah from Tammy Thompson what
was the logic of keeping the iPhone 7
and killing the iPhone 10 which people
would still snap them up with the a 11
Bionic chip that's why is it still
better than the other phone processors
okay yeah they don't it's very easy why
they don't have the iPhone 10 if you
looked at the iPhone 10 and the 10s
you'd buy the 10 like if it was a couple
hundred dollars cheaper even a hundred
dollars cheaper there's just there's not
anything really in the 10s that is like
oh my god I have to have that so if they
kept this older device people would buy
it and they want you to buy the new one
and that's why it's dead one more from
Carlos does the face ID unlock faster
did you get a chance to try it out
sharra I didn't get a try face ID unlock
on these phones because you know it's
kind of hard they don't really in the
demo areas you don't really have a lot
of time to set up that kind of stuff
or at least I didn't
I know like when you know when like
reviews come out I know that'll be
something people look at but no I wasn't
able to try that yeah they said it was
supposed to be faster like the sensors
on the front facing camera is supposed
to be much higher on this time around
but I like face out he's already pretty
fast so I I still have like a I would
say like for a while I was a maybe a 50%
success rate I had to type in my
password 800 times a day now I'm it's a
little better I'm like you know 70
percent or something I you know when I'm
watching when it's on horizontal mode it
doesn't unlock out really like if you
were watching a video and it somehow
goes asleep you go back you can't use
face ID at the turn it back over then
you should just stay sideways it's
annoying
doing this over and over again is not
cool no I mean when you set up face ID
scan it so it thinks your heads on
sideways yeah but then it doesn't work
if I'm holding it normal way so get to
phones and alright with the last few
minutes let's talk about that bunker cuz
that was pretty gnarly yeah completely
out of everybody's reach here but still
kind of cool to think about yeah shrim
Joyce says I'm disappointed with the
limitation of the 8.3 million dollar
bunker the highest end model should
allow a pair of species and be called
the bunker of Noah and they probably
could yeah we could probably fit as many
animals in there as you want we just you
know yeah and they would probably be
dead within like a week or so cuz I
would hope they would have like no
circulation and food yeah exactly yeah
they would probably be dead I hope it's
not like a box they just yeah I mean
yeah if you're paying 8.3 million
dollars so you know I mean how many
iPhone 10s is that yes I was just kind
of interested in this tell me a little
bit more about like some of the
amenities that are available inside I
was actually watching this like minute
mini doc series on Netflix about this
guy who's trying to like build an
underground call the SEC I guess really
but so people get a community of people
kinda not like permanent living so that
everybody can have like
fail-safe in light of some kind of mega
disaster but he was putting in like
Wi-Fi and you mentioned the wine cellar
and it's like what are some of these
other things that are completely quote
unquote necessary for these so one
company is doing this thing called the
they're called like rising s they're
based out of like Texas and they have
they're offering these things called
virtual windows which is basically just
a TV with like a live stream of like
stuff going on outside because you're
underground it's depressing there's not
really much to see or do or anything
like that so here's a live stream of you
know like the actual outside world and
you can pretend like you're you're
actually living in like not in an
underground bunker yeah and then yeah
it's like that's supposed to work as
long as you have Wi-Fi but I'm very
curious about how well the Internet is
going to function you know if like a
bomb like struck like a major like city
or something like that you know so I
don't really know how well that worked
there was one other thing that I saw it
was in a poster but it wasn't like in
any of the shelters that I saw I was
called like the power station 3000 which
it's a stationary bike that connects to
a battery bank I ride it for 15 minutes
and it like charges your devices and
stuff the best part was it work out to
was like on the on the poster that was
like trying to sell it was like anyone
can ride a kids teenagers adults
athletes and senior citizens and I'm
like cool that's the future you'd have
to live in if you lived in an
underground bunker trying to think what
else like was interesting that I had
seen like during my research on this
what else was there oh yeah they
mentioned like some of them could have
like smart home capabilities but again
like I said like I don't know how well
they would work like in an event like
it's a waste of power yeah like I don't
know why you'd want to do something like
that but you know smart home yeah you'd
need like a Wi-Fi network like
connecting all of them like a mesh
network yeah yeah there was one there's
one in Las Vegas that was built in 1978
the underground house which is now owned
by like a nonprofit society that is very
mysterious and doesn't want to let
anyone know like it so they didn't let
me in as like a Crestview kind of thing
but I mean they explained it was like
kind of for good reason like they're
trying to keep it more secretive because
like the times that they did show it off
they literally got calls and threats a
lot from people that lived in the area
those basically tell him if a nuclear
apocalypse happens we're going to break
into your house and we're gonna use that
or whatever there was one woman who
basically offered like hey look if you
let us use your nuclear bunker
I will contribute to repopulating the
planet and I'm like and apparently she
wasn't the only one that has done that
as like offered to that because they
were just like yeah we're not interested
sorry don't come to our house but yeah
they that one was really nice too they
have a pool they have a bar they have a
grill underground the bunker I don't
know man exhaust just a chimney in there
and it has like a guest house and
everything is it's ridiculous
so yeah they can get like really
extravagant down there okay all right so
closing thoughts
what is the one feature you would need
in your tiny bunker your tiny smart
bunker go probably you got 8.3 million
dollars to burn what are you installing
in your tiny bunker just happened don't
worry about it don't worry about it
I don't know like survival skills that I
noted this pretty heavily throughout my
story was I usually what the one like
perk or the one like dumb questions just
give me a dog I'll just hang out with a
dog the whole day you like cats yeah
that would be better in a bunker yeah
cuz you don't have to walk it yeah yeah
well basically I noted in my story that
like I have no survival skills so even
if I did have a bunker and I survived
like the initial plan it's so done I
would be dead like a nice day somebody
would find me that's like hey look this
guy is a bunker
so yeah I guess I guess a gun then can I
can I choose gun but no you're paying
like 8.3 million dollars you can get
those like really cheap put likies the
our center gravity like maybe a massage
chairs your mom yeah like that but i
don't know i hate playing these games
probably gonna get like tense if you're
down there and you know stressful I
don't know if I'm gonna eight point
three million dollar I'm not
stressed they're probably like just
chillin a babysitter
alright Shara of save us Mike shots is a
bowling alley I like that yeah that's a
good one yeah I do like the bowling
alley idea cuz you gotta have like
something to entertain yourself you know
I hate karaoke but I could see like a
karaoke yeah but are you down there
alone this is probably not sick sing
karaoke by yourself at the end of the
world swing that's depressing thought we
got Matt says Internet or unlimited
books Matt also included Playboy
magazines and maybe will steer away from
that one for me the ultimate thing that
I'm going to need in my end of the world
bunker is a notch and on that note we're
going to wrap up the show thanks
