Tong and we're here to find out who
silences the competition in a showdown
between noise-cancelling headset in this
week's prize fight it's a face-off
between boses quietcomfort 3 and audio
technica ath anc 7 quiet point the
contenders are ready so let the games
begin in round 1 we're talking comfort
the bose quietcomfort have the word
comfort in their name for a reason
they're super soft super light and rest
on top of your ears the audio technica
is quiet point headset covers your
entire ear the ear cups are soft but you
can definitely feel some pressure
against your face from them when it
comes to noise cancelling I normally
prefer headphones that cover your entire
ear but the pillow like fela boses
headset is music to my ears Bose gets up
of five in this round and audio technica
gets a 4 which headset makes us want to
be seen in public with them the next
round is all about style the bose QC 3s
brings us a small sleek and sexy look
and if you also like silver then you'll
like the shiny accents as well the aths
are big big these guys aren't ugly but
they're almost twice as thick as the QC
3s and the headphone band sticks out
from the sides of your head bows makes a
lot more compelling fashion statement
here the QC threes up get a 4 and the 8
EHS get a lonely too somebody needs a
makeover ASAP now after two rounds bose
leads 926 we need to take these headsets
with us the next round is portability
both of these guys have a fold flat
design and they come with their own
carrying case but the quiet comfort
slimmer profile is very noticeable
between the two see for yourself it's
not even close the QC 3s get up for this
round and the quiet points absorb
another low blow with a 2 audio technica
is looking real wobbly now the next
round is all about sound inside
BOCES build a reputation on their sound
and the QC 3s produce a solid sound for
the size of its speakers but it tends to
have more bass and it just doesn't sound
as crisp the audio technica have a
better open sound and better higher
frequency details and you can use the
headset whether you turn the noise
cancelling feature on or off with bows
it's either music with the noise
canceling or no music at all sound
quality can be subjective but audio
technica finally takes around up with a
4 and the QC 3s get a 3 going into the
final round Bose leads 16 to 12 but the
quiet points still have a fighting
chance the final round is all about wall
factory Bose makes quality products with
great resale value but the quiet comfort
3s are 350 bucks sure they're sexy and
they are pillows on my ears but that's
going to dent your wallet real good now
on the flip side the audio technica
quiet points can be found for around 130
bucks sure they may be a lot bulkier but
you're getting a headset that has better
rated sound for less than half the price
audio-technica takes this round with a
desperation blow that connects we're
giving the quiet points of 5 and the
bose quietcomfort too now let's total it
up audio-technica looked like it was
down and out came back swinging but it
just wasn't enough the bose quietcomfort
threes win 18 to 17 and defend their
name and reputation as your prize fight
winner i'm brian Tong thanks for
watching and we'll catch you guys next
time on another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
