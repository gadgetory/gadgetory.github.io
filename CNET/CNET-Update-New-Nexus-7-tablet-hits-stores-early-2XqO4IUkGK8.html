collect some ease I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update Google's Nexus
7 tablet hit stores earlier than
expected Google said its new tablet
would go on sale tuesday but it's
already available at best buy amazon
gamestop and walmart this new Nexus 7
has some noticeable changes from the
older model the new one is a little
lighter and thinner it's not as wide and
the back is smooth with no texture
there's now a back camera with a 5
megapixel sensor the headphone jack has
been moved from the bottom to the top
and although the screen is still 7
inches the bezel around the screen is
slightly thinner with the upgrade you'll
get a 1080p true-hd display and a little
more battery life along with wireless
charging it starts at two hundred and
thirty dollars for the Wi-Fi only model
now if you want 4G LTE with 32 gigs of
memory that'll cost three hundred and
fifty dollars it's a pretty good deal
considering it's only twenty bucks more
than the entry-level iPad Mini which has
less memory and no 4g t-mobile's trying
to one-up the competition once again
this time with a promotion that lets
customers pick up a new phone tablet or
even a hot spot with no down payment but
the phone has to be paid in full over
two years and it's divided up in
payments between twenty dollars and
twenty seven dollars a month this
promotion will likely only last a few
days or weeks 18teen verizon recently
launched plans that also with customers
put no money down and make monthly
payments on a phone but t-mobile service
rates are lower and i'll end today with
something you may want to keep your eye
on with the nintendo 3ds yeah several
days ago it updated the street past me
Plaza application by adding four new
games that can only be played if you get
off the couch and carry your system with
you throughout the day the street pass
can detect an exchange data with other
nearby 3ds systems while in a sleep mode
so if you pass another person in the
mall with a 3ds you never have to say
hello or even turn on the screen and yet
you've collected their mise which have
special items to play the games it also
gives you coins by just walking around
can take the place of actually finding
another user either way you can't play
sitting down Cena editor Scott Stein
points out that this could be a glimpse
into how Nintendo is thinking about the
future of mobile games by requiring you
to walk around to find another device
and what would happen if intend to
incorporated this concept in some way
with the wii fit that might be pretty
cool that's your tech news update you
can find more details on the street pass
me Plaza and other stories at cnet com /

our studios in New York I'm Bridget
