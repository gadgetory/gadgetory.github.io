not broken down I'm Brian Cooley from
CNET in search of the next big thing one
of the most interesting trends I've seen
lately at the Consumer Electronics Show
in Las Vegas and the North American
International Auto Show in Detroit is a
wholesale move to at least trying
gesture control in cars take BMW for
example they're looking at a technology
would mount up in the headliner or by
the sunroof and look down at your hand
being able to figure out where it is and
what course gesture it's taking like a
rotating motion for example that could
simulate or replace turning a volume
knob or a fan control Volkswagens
technology flips that idea on its head
puts the sensor down in the console
behind the shifter looking up and it can
tell which way your hands moving and
whether it's flat or bladed as well as
picking up push gestures that would
indicate a selection more futuristically
mercedes fo one five concept car sees a
world where the immersive infotainment
system for the passengers would be
gesture controlled and Audi even a
couple of years ago was showing us the
technology where they would turn the
entire windshield into a three zone
head-up display and use gesture control
to kick and slide panels back and forth
between driver and passenger now notice
all these gesture control technologies
are going after a fairly coarse set of
movements and controls I don't see
anyone out there yet thinking you're
going to write out a complicated
navigation address in midair with
gesture that seems to still be best left
to hopefully improve voice command touch
pads or of the good old fashioned
touchscreen but what I want to see is
gesture control prove that it is a
better way of controlling things not
just different so here's the three part
litmus test gesture control has to be
positive in other words it has to work
the first time not require two or three
attempts like voice command often does
it has to be affirmative that means I
don't need to glance away all the time
to see if it got what it thinks I
gestured for and third it has to be
context sensitive smart enough to ignore
my emotions when I'm just talking to a
friend or reaching for coffee and then
monitor my emotions that interpret them
when it does matter and I am trying to
communicate something now what's next at
