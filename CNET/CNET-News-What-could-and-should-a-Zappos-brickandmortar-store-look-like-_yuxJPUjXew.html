resembles a large boutique with designer
handbags couture clothing and an array
of shoes but what brought marshal
champagnes family into shop was the
store's name Zappos we were walking by
and we saw Zappos and I know my mom is a
huge fan of Zappos I actually got a pair
of shoes without even looking for them
the popular online retailer set up this
20,000 square foot pop-up store during
the holidays hoping to entice customers
with the ability to touch hundreds of
products before ordering them when I'm
searching on eBay or whatever whatever
I'm looking for I'd like to hold it and
see the size and material whatever it's
made out of being able to have customers
come in touch and feel products discover
other kinds of lines as Apple's carries
is a really great way to get in front of
their customers this store has a limited
inventory especially compared to the
huge online selection there's not a lot
to try on and there are only a few items
you can buy and walk out with but once
you do find something you like use
self-service kiosks developed by shop
with me you can scan an item see all the
other colors and sizes even if it's not
physically here in stock you can choose
it checkout and celebrit free next day
shipping to you after closing the pop-up
store mid-january Zappos is now
examining the data to help determine if
where and when they should set up shop
permanently there might be more as
Apple's pop-up shops coming the future
or permanent stores we'll see what
happens it's something other online
retailers are also experimenting with
Amazon opened a pop-up store at the
Westfield Center in San Francisco to
sell its Kindle e-readers and tablets
hyper lines new york store carries less
than 10% of what you find on the site
but with online sales growing
why would successful shopping websites
revert to the traditional
brick-and-mortar store 90% of shopping
still happens offline so
brick-and-mortar stores are so capturing
most of the revenue from shopping right
now but they still want to have an
online feel the Zappos store stayed open
24/7 just like the web site in Las Vegas
