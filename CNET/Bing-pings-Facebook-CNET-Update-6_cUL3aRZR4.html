spells on the Kindle and bracing
ourselves for the return of the browser
Wars I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update Microsoft's Bing search
engine now includes Facebook integration
when you search for something on bing a
site panel will pop up showing which of
your friends might help you with your
search say if you're looking at hotels
in chicago it'll point out friends that
live in chicago of course Microsoft
isn't the only one bringing social in to
search just recently Google did a
similar move throwing Google+ comments
into search results but that's not the
only news today for Microsoft the
company is stirring up the browser Wars
again preventing Firefox or any other
browser to run on Windows RT now Windows
RT is the light version of Windows 8
that you'll see on low powered tablets
and smartphones Firefox and Google are
crying foul saying this restricts
consumer freedom of choice and
competitive innovation Microsoft just
argues hey we want the best experience
on these systems and only internet
explorer can provide it and now Facebook
has an app store well it's more like a
nap showcase you see Facebook is
launching a hub that features apps but
it'll just direct you to buy those apps
off apples or Google stores if
developers create an app for html5
that's not for any specific device
they'll be able to sell it right on
Facebook so why is Facebook promoting
apps because the more apps you use the
more information Facebook can gather
about your habits and that's more data
it can offer to advertisers and in other
news we're watching amazon prime
subscribers will be able to get the
whole Harry Potter series through the
kindle owners lending library starting
in June nineteenth it costs eighty
dollars a year to access that library
and all the perks of amazon prime
nintendo dropped the price of the dsi to
a hundred dollars and the dsixl also
dropped to one hundred and thirty
dollars the prices take effect may
twentieth dish network announced that
its new hopper DVR system will be able
to skip commercials with a feature
called autohop it'll skip commercials
recorded during primetime shows in HD
from the four major networks I'm sure
networks are thrilled at the new
and today we're talking about the
Google+ app for iOS it just got a major
design overhaul and it puts a big focus
around photos that's right google
released a brand new version of the
Google+ app to Apple users before
Android how scandalous Android folks
you'll be getting a version in a few
weeks and it should have a few more
features than the iphone version that's
your tech news update for today stay
updated on all the latest news at cnet
com from our studios in New York I'm
