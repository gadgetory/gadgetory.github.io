to be posted until it goes through a
little editing well in iOS 8 app will
give us a few new tools that let you do
just that for starters a lot of the
basic tools are still available they're
just smarter if you just want to auto
enhance your photo you'll now find that
button up here in the corner at the
bottom hit the crop button and you'll
see the interface has changed entirely
to straighten a photo drag the dial or
hit this button to rotate it for
cropping you can either freestyle it or
tap this button for some presets and
like before you can add filters but
selection is still just as mediocre as
it was before now comes the good part
iOS 8 is packed with a bunch of tools
that let you fine-tune your photos to
access those tools hit this knob when
you tap the light option sliding this
tool will intelligently light or darken
the image while compensating for other
factors like contrast and highlights but
if you want to dig deeper and adjust
those settings individually expand the
tool so for example you can tap shadows
and move the slider to isolate just that
detail back in the main menu you also
have color options like before you can
do an overall adjustment or go in and
make specific changes the same thing
applies to the black-and-white option so
you can really get in there and change
things like intensity tone and grain for
an extra dramatic effect those new
built-in settings will take you a long
way but what's cool about iOS 8 is that
you can now add tools from other apps
directly into the Photos app to do that
you will need a compatible app like
fragment then in the Photos app hit edit
and tap this button then head to more
and enable your extensions from now on
you can tap this button choose fragment
and the app will launch that photo into
editing mode there aren't a lot of apps
compatible with this feature just yet
but expect developers to
add it as they issue updates if you have
any questions or tips of your own hit me
