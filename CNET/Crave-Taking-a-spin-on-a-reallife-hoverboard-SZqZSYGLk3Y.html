concept it's a way we're introducing
this technology to the world in a way
everyone can understand
it's a hoverboard and by now hopefully
that's caught people's attention because
what we really want to do with this
technology well frankly it's a lot more
important the hoverboard is fun and it's
cool and yes it does work and I look
forward to seeing you ride here in a bit
but our Kickstarter campaign has a
different purpose besides just making a
production hoverboard what we're really
trying to do is get this new technology
in the hands of inventors everywhere we
want to capture the power of the many
minds in the crowd to come up with
solutions to ideas we don't even know
about and the way we're doing that is
with our white box developer kit you can
back us for 300 bucks and get a white
box and you can open this thing up you
can take out the hover engine and hover
whatever you like it's an opportunity to
explore and I that is the thing we want
people to do explore dare to wonder the
hover engine works with something called
Lenz's law and you can google that I had
to it is a way of using a magnetic field
to create a secondary magnetic field in
a conductive surface like this copper
floor if you can hover a fifty thousand
kilogram train why not a bill why not a
house why not an operating room why not
a sensitive piece of equipment or a
precious piece of art
anywhere there's a wheel there's an
opportunity the wheel is amazing and it
has our most respect but we want to
provide some alternatives in certain
situations where you know there might be
a better way I'm an architect not a
scientist and the way we were able to do
this was by looking at this problem a
little bit differently what we like to
say around Hendo is that we we try to
think outside the box and then off the
page because it's that kind of thinking
that we need to solve real problems
today and by sharing this technology
with well that we're calling all
inventors by sharing this technology
we're going to put the solution to
problems again into the hands of folks
who are working on things that we have
no idea about that's it nothing is
awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
