doesn't give you a lot but also doesn't
cost a lot I'm Dan Ackerman and this is
the Acer switch 10 II it's a Windows 10
laptop / tablet hybrid with as you can
probably tell from a 10.1 inch screen
unlike a lot of other hybrids this one
uses probably my favorite mechanism for
joining a tablet screen and a keyboard
basin at a magnetic hinge so if you just
pull on it like this it pops off cleanly
it's actually a very strong magnet so if
you get close to it it'll actually pull
itself on fairly well and it's pretty
easy to put together and you can lift it
up like this and the keyboard will stay
attached now all the components in here
in the battery and everything else in
the Atom CPU from Intel they're all
behind the screen here which means the
tablet part is pretty heavy and and the
keyboard base is kind of light if you're
not careful you give it a little bit of
a push it's actually very top-heavy can
tilt over backwards but you do get one
nice bonus in the keyboard base and
that's a separate 500 gigabyte hard
drive on top of the smaller you know 32
or 64 gigabyte SSD here in the display
so you have more storage here for when
you plug it in and you can even set it
up so that when you pull the tablet half
off that encrypts the hard drive in the
keyboard base so no one will be able to
like steal your keyboard take the hard
drive out and access the data on it you
do cut a couple of corners because this
thing is fairly inexpensive this
configuration is 300 dollars or a few
variations that cost a little bit more a
little bit less you've only got a 1280
by 800 resolution display obviously a
lower power Intel Atom processor and
it's got this really wide black bezel
around the screen that really just makes
the screen feel even smaller than it is
it's also a bit on the heavy side about
three pounds all together which is more
than a lot of 13-inch laptops weigh even
though this is a much smaller system
this isn't the kind of machine you're
going to use all day every day but low
cost small screen hybrids like this have
their place usually for a secondary
laptop or for traveling if you'd like to
