standing here beside the Samsung food
showcase French door fridge and this is
a new model in the food showcase line
the original was a side-by-side unit and
that one looked a lot better I think it
had slick recessed handles down the
middle it looked really modern and
luxurious elegant this one is a little
more standard it kind of blends in with
the crowd a little more now that food
showcase feature just means that you can
open up the door normally here or you
can squeeze this trigger at the bottom
and open up the front panel that'll
expose those indoor shelves and you can
get it the condiments and butter and
sodas and beer that you've got stored in
there really quickly it definitely has
its appeal but to me it's more of a
novelty than anything else
inside you'll find a number of features
that are designed to help you take
advantage of that space including this
fold up shelf and this slide and shelf
those will make room for taller items
you've also got a shelf here on top
that'll slide out so if you've got
something located in the back it'll be
easier to get to that shelf was a bit
sticky though I wish it wasn't quite so
tough to pull out push back in another
space minded feature is the icemaker up
here it sits up in the top corner of the
fridge and heats up a little bit of
space but not as much as other ice
makers like it they tend to run about
eight inches wide this one comes in
about six inches wide
one qualms though the icemaker feeds ice
down into the door here and it creates
this big overhangs bulky and it blocks
off the shelf below it makes it kind of
unusable this shelf at the bottom of the
food showcase fridge was also pretty
tough to use it's nice it tilts out and
comes out of the fridge even if you want
but it's just so narrow you can't really
fit much of anything in there
performance-wise this fridge did pretty
well it held a fairly accurate
temperature but it did have some hot
spots you see that orange there on the
heat map we made you don't want that you
don't want your temperatures up above 40
degrees like that if he can help it all
in all this is a decent and classy
refrigerator but it's not the most
complete package that I've seen it's
$3,800 which is an awful lot for a
fridge and for about the same amount of
money you can get the LG door in door
French door model I think that fridge is
a more well-rounded choice for high-end
kitchens for the full scoop on the food
showcase fridge check out the full
