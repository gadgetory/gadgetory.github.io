someone's paying your bill for you you
should probably understand how your
monthly plan is gonna work before you
buy a new phone
this really is good to know before you
get your hopes up on any particular
phone so any plan breaks down into three
basic buckets you get your call time
your text messaging and data your bottom
two your plans will likely put a cap on
all three and if you go over your
allotment you're going to be charged a
fee and it's always going to be more
than you think at the top tier you're
gonna find your unlimited plans but even
here data is capped at a certain amount
when you read the fine print now there's
enough jargon and mysterious charges
included on every cell phone bill that
they deserve a master class all their
own but a lot of that stuff is gonna be
there no matter what kind of phone you
buy there are some exceptions though so
here's what you need to know if you buy
a smart phone like an iPhone or Android
or Windows Phone in many cases you'll be
contractually obligated to buy a data
and messaging plan it makes sense that's
the whole point of these phones is to
stay online and stay connected but if
you're just shopping for a basic phone
and you're tempted that the idea of a
smart phone that's being offered for a
penny just know that these mandatory
data and messaging plans are going to
potentially double or triple the amount
that you're paying each month if the
idea of a two-year contract scares you
consider a prepaid phone every carrier
has a contract free pay-as-you-go option
typically they're limited to just a few
models and you'll often pay more upfront
but this can be a great solution if you
need something right now and you'll put
off finding the perfect phone for
another time you can dish this phone
whenever a better option comes along if
you need a phone that can be used
internationally let the salesperson know
that up front they may point you to a
cellphone plan that includes
international use or a phone that can be
used on multiple networks but the price
of ignorance is steep as international
roaming charges are insane finally if
you're buying a phone for a child you
should know that there are phones and
plans made specifically for them and for
parents who want to be able to control
how that phone is used on the other end
there are phones and plans made
specifically for seniors so don't be coy
about who the phone is for it will help
you find the right phone and the right
plan of course before signing any
contract you should read the fine print
and take a lookout for any hidden fees

expect when leaving a contract early for
