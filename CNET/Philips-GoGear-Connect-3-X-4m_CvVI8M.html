look for the Philips go gear connect 3
this is an Android 2.3 based portable
media player priced at $179 it's not a
lot to it for better or for worse mostly
I kind of feel for worse you're getting
a 3.2 inch screen so it's kind of a
cramped screen you're not getting a
camera of GPS we're seeing a lot of
competing products in this space trying
to compete against the Apple iPod touch
Samsung has a few out the galaxy players
sony has one out but this is really the
first one to try to beat the iPod touch
on price at $179 but for the cheaper
price you're also getting a cheaper
experience my main gripe here is that
the screen quality is really pretty bad
it's a really pretty horrible viewing
angle here that practically blinks at
you it turns turns black so if you're
trying to think about this as a video
player you're not going to have a great
video experience the screen brightness
is also pretty dim the screen resolution
is not that great
also with something that the Kindle Fire
out there for $199 just $20 more if
you're looking for a great Android
experience with a great high quality
screen that's a much better product to
go for I did like the default music
player for this this is using the
songbird application there's a pretty
interesting job bringing in Flickr photo
galleries for whatever artist you're
playing there's a some interesting sound
enhancement features here from Philips
there's also a Facebook integration so
that you could post whatever you're
currently playing song is to your
Facebook page there's a last.fm
squabbling of your currently playing
track so a lot of well-thought-out
features here for the music player some
other pretty good music based apps that
are built into this for MOG and Rhapsody
but you could really get those apps on
any kind of Android device you want so
that's not really it's gonna sell this
thing over other devices but you should
just know that the money you're saving
on this device really does make itself
known when you pick it up and you see
the screen quality another gripe here is
that there is no memory expansion so
you're stuck with either that 8 gigabyte
or 16 gigabyte capacity so that's the
Philips go gear connect three Transcom
and all
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
