years and you can thank technology for
making your car that hardened target
I'm Brian Cooley with a look at the top
five technologies that are keeping your
car yours
number five is stolen vehicle slow down
an amazing OnStar technology a
showstopper but I rank it kind of low
because time is of the essence when your
car's ripped off and this kind of cuts
the other way you see by the time you
figure out your car is gone
you then have to file a police report
and then use that as authorization to
get the police to talk to OnStar to then
go look for your car and see if they can
stop it while the crooks driving it by
the time this happens your car could
well be in a shipping container on its
way to a warm sunny place even OnStar
claims I'm near two hundred and fifty
cars have been slowed down with a thief
at the wheel in five years but if it's
yours the smug satisfaction is gonna be
huge
number four is GPS tracking knowing that
your car isn't where it should be and
knowing that quickly is the essence of
dealing with vehicle theft in the last
few years all kinds of products have
cropped up that let you use GPS to know
on your phone if your car is on the move
when you don't want it to be and where
it's moving and of course this same tech
has the daily benefit of monitoring a
friendlier class of car thief your kids
number three is theft sensors here I'm
talking about glass break sensors and
vehicle tilt sensors they work right at
the moment of theft either triggering an
alarm on the car a horn or a bell a
shutdown of its ignition and/or an alert
on your phone these are much more
nuanced sensors than those dumb
vibration things that power the standard
vehicle alarm horn that just keeps you
awake number two remote locking even
today roughly half of all motorists
leave their car unlocked and those cars
make up a huge 40% of stolen cars drives
insurers and cops nuts so the presence
of nearly ubiquitous remote locking in
cars was the first step the key fob
increasingly higher-end cars now auto
lock and unlock via the proximity of
your key fob just leaving it in your
pocket
and now growing fast is the use of apps
that can check and change the lock
status of your car right from your phone
anywhere in the world but people just
like to leave their cars unlocked before
I get you to number one you might ask
where's the car alarm in hell I hope it
had its day as a deterrent a long time
ago but now it is generally accepted
that people are desensitized to
traditional alarms as cars continue to
become connected I look to a day when a
car alarm moves from blowing a horn to
the hood to giving you a notification on
an app now that's meaningful the number
one technology that is keeping cars from
getting ripped our smart ignitions most
thieves want to drive your car away and
it wasn't long ago you could do that
easily by twisting two wires under the
dash
then came ignition locks you could still
Hotwire the car but only drive it in a
straight line not real useful more
recently we're enjoying the fruit of
smart keys which do this little unique
digital handshake between the car's
ignition and the key before anything is
going to start it has made a huge
difference in theft rates the downside
is that you've now got a $300 key you
have to replace it used to be a $2.00
blank high tech cars and modern driving
that's what we do at CNET on cars.com
i'm brian coulis thanks for watching
