now it's finally here I'm Dan Ackerman
with a first look at a lien where steam
machine runs an operating system called
steam OS valve is the company that runs
the steam online game store they've also
created cool games like portal and
half-life and they've invited all sorts
of PC hardware makers to make boxes that
run steam OS and the first big one to be
released is going to be the Alienware
steam machine it should be out in
November for 450 dollars and for that
you get a basic looking box that's
essentially a PC and a console box core
i3 CPU custom NVIDIA GPU but most
importantly this guy right here the
steam controller so that the steam
controller Val sent out to reimagine how
you controlled games so it's got these
two pans on it these two sort of almost
touch pads combined with one stick and a
bunch of buttons and Denton triggers and
paddles this pant especially works
almost like moving a mouse on a mouse
pad or can work kind of like a
traditional old-school trackball if
that's what you want there are a lot of
setup options and frankly in in hands-on
use it works differently in different
games better and some not as good and
others so here's a really good example
in BioShock Infinite I walk around the
left stick like you would with a gamepad
and then I use the right pad to look
around and took a little getting used to
I actually have to go in and tweak the
sensitivity level on the controls we can
actually go into the configure the game
controller section and you can see how
the controller here is is set up and
then you can choose different
configurations either recommended ones
or ones provided by the community and as
more people get this system hopefully
they'll come up with their own key
bindings and settings that work and
upload them
it actually works for here to go out
with things like strategy games like SIF
5 where you really do have a lot of fine
control to zoom all over the map and
then take control of individual units
but you'll also have the flexibility of
using a mouse where you can really just
very easily scroll around and then you
can take the right stick and you can
just move the cursor anywhere so Team
Fortress 2 is a hugely popular
multiplayer game and it's one of the
ones like dota 2 that you can actually
play on steamos and it's one of the ones
where these steam controls even though
it's a first-person shooter actually
work really well so the controls don't
exactly map one-to-one with what you'd
expect from using a traditional gamepad
or using a keyboard and mouse you have
to kind of figure out exactly which
command works with which button and
which trigger and which paddle on here
so it takes a little bit of getting used
to it
the real wrench in the system is there's
a second version of this Alienware box
called the Alienware alpha almost the
same exact hardware but it runs Windows
10 and comes with a xbox controller
instead of the scene controller and that
lets you play all the games you can plan
in here plus the thousands of other
Steam games that are Windows only and
the strange thing is that box in this
box cost exactly the same so if you want
to be adventurous and be kind of a
pioneer in gaming then maybe consider
the Alienware steam machine version if
you're a traditionalist and you want to
play upcoming games like let's say
fallout 4 then take a look at the nearly
identical handling where alpha I'm Dan
Ackerman and that is the Alienware steam
machine with steam OS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
