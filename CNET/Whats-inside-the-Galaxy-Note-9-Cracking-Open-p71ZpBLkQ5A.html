Jason Heiner with bill Detweiller today
we're here to crack open the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 one of the most
anticipated high-end Android devices of
the year this device looks a lot like
last year's note 8 on the outside but it
has a lot of upgrades to the inside
including the processor the battery and
much more it also has the Bluetooth
s-pen which acts like a remote control
and has a number of interesting features
and of course it was the first Android
phone to get fortnight so bill tell us a
little bit more about why we're so
excited to crack this one open yeah so
we're really excited about this one
because of all the hardware advancements
it'll be really nice to see the new
Qualcomm 845 processor yes it'll also be
really cool to see the higher capacity
battery you know it's got this four
thousand milliamp hour battery it's like
a 15 watt hour battery I'd like to see
just how large that is compared to
previous versions also I've always been
impressed with Samsung's engineering now
the note 7 sort of notwithstanding the
battery issues there but I've been
cracking open samsung devices for over a
decade and inside the devices they're
usually easy to take apart they use
standard size Phillips screws all most
of the time and so we're expecting this
to kind of be a pleasure to take apart
so just really excited to get started
excellent so what are we gonna do to
crack this one open what we're gonna do
is we're going to use a heat gun now a
big gun that's right this one allows me
to control the heat and control the
speed of the fan now you have to be
careful with this these will get very
hot you know these are designed to
remove paint um so you have to make sure
that you have it set low enough that we
do not melt the plastic and that we
don't dam you know and we don't damage
the internal components either so you
know with that let's go ahead let's get
started
all right so the first thing we're gonna
do is we're gonna remove the SIM card or
the SIM card holder and then we're gonna
go ahead turn our heat gun on and I'm
gonna make sure that it doesn't get too
hot so that we don't melt the plastic or
damage the internal components now as I
heat this up if you've ever watched our
cracking open videos you'll notice that
I don't usually wear an anti-static or
ESD wrist strap and you know generally
that's a good thing that you want to do
since we're not necessarily concerned as
much about damaging the internal
components and I'm super careful about
touching metal inside the device or
touching the contacts and I use ESD safe
tools most of the time when I'm doing
the delicate work on the circuit boards
I don't usually wear one I would highly
recommend that you do if you were
working on someone else's hardware or
even your own while we're heating the
back of this up we're also going to
apply a suction cup here that will help
us pull up on the back cover and maybe
make it a little easier for us to get a
one of our thin prime tools inside the
device
we're gonna be very very careful as we
work our way around the edge of the back
cover there will be a thin cable that
connects the fingerprint sensor on the
back panel to the circuit board and we
don't want to damage that
and that's what happens if you put a
little bit too much pressure on these
you managed to crack the back cover
luckily when this happens it won't
affect the functioning of the phone on
the internals and will be able to order
a back cover replacement and put it on
there but it sometimes happens one of
the things that's changed over the years
is that as the devices have gotten
increasingly more resistant to dust and
to water they've also gotten
increasingly more difficult to actually
take apart and we can lift it off like
that it looks like actually the this is
the cable that I wanted to try not to
break this is the fingerprint a sensor
here so so bill we're back and I see
that we've got a first casualty of our
early cracking open here what happened
on you know we always try to take these
devices apart on doing a way that lets
us put them back together again in one
hand at other times you've broke it so
actually broking something beyond repair
yes
so in my haste to try to get the back
off especially when we're doing it on
camera I applied a little bit too much
force and we cracked the back panel now
this won't affect the functioning of the
phone it won't affect even the
fingerprint sensor which is attached to
the back of that okay I don't there but
still it's a cosmetic issue could be a
safety issue so we'll order a new back
panel from Samsung we'll put it on the
phone and you'll never be the wiser
very good so what are you gonna do next
with the device yeah so what we're
really interested in seeing inside the
device we talked about the battery we
talked about the logic board which will
be behind here and what what I always
enjoy about taking apart Samsung devices
is they're pretty easy to take apart
once you get inside these are standing
Philips either double zero or triple
zero screw so it shouldn't be a problem
to remove those we will have to be
mindful again of the adhesive that's
holding on like these are the NFC or the
charging coils here I suspect on the
back so we'll have to be careful not to
damage those and then you'll have a
speaker in your port assembly down at
the bottom that will want to make sure
to take out very carefully as well very
good all right let's keep going here
so now that we're inside the phone we
can see a better picture of the layout
we can see the system board here along
the side and here at the top we can see
the cameras and we can see the entire
battery we can also see the sleeve for
the S pin here we're gonna have two
looks like there's a few more screws and
several connectors that we'll need to
detach before we can go any further and
whenever I'm doing this I always like to
make sure that we detached as soon as I
can the battery that'll prevent power
from flowing through the circuits and
make things a little safer to disconnect
sometimes when you do detach the
connectors you can actually remove the
components this is the 8 megapixel I
believe front facing camera now I think
what we can do is with all the cables
disconnected we're actually going to end
all the screws removed we're actually
going to go ahead and remove the circuit
board without removing the battery first
battery is going to be glued to the body
here and so I'm going to leave that in
if I can
I have to be very gentle when you lift
this out not to tear you the cables and
there we go
the remaining components we're going to
try and remove are the three and a half
millimeter headphone jack and in the USB
port at the bottom
there's the USB port and then here is
the three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack Jason's favorite part
turning our attention to the main system
board we're going to go ahead and remove
the camera assembly from the back all
right so bill you've got the Galaxy Note
nine apart tell us what we're looking at
yeah so this was a challenging teardown
to get inside but once they were inside
it's fairly typical of these devices you
know on the body we left some of the
components still attached because
they're there they're glued to the to
the body and I didn't want to damage
them removing them we have the vibration
mode or we left the battery and then we
left the front facing speaker also
attached to the body there one of the
things that's really interesting the
heat pipe here that's beside the battery
is bigger than we've seen on previous
phones and maybe a nod to the more
powerful processor
speaking of the processors we
unfortunately can't see them yeah the
main system board the metal shields that
cover the chips are soldered to the
board I don't want to remove those
because doing so will likely damage the
board's beyond repair we do want to put
these back together now we do know
because of the specs that Samsung has
published that it either has eight gigs
or six gigs of RAM and either has 128 or
512 gigs of storage and of course we
know it has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
processor hidden under here too we can
also see the pair of 12 megapixel
cameras there's the 8 megapixel front
camera we have the USBC connector here
your favorite the three and a half inch
headphone jack and then we have the
speaker assembly here and then the NFC
or the charging coils
yep here so even without taking the
shields off the circuit or the main
circuit board we still have a good sense
of what's inside the device and the very
cool thing is with that upgraded top
version that has 512 gigs of storage you
can also then add it has the expandable
storage you can add the 512 gig SD card
and this becomes the first terabyte
storage media and of course the first
Android phone with fortnight alright
that's it for the samsung galaxy note 9
if you have other devices you'd like to
see us crack open please let us know
post in the comments on SEANET or on
youtube and we will be happy to take a
look we're always looking for good stuff
that we can crack open learn from and
share it with you so that's it for build
