and trucks tangle are people in the car
duh and one of the nastiest kinds of
those accidents is the rear under-eye
when you slam into the back of one of
those big semi trailers a collision so
nasty it became this iconic scene in
that movie from the early 70s the 7-ups
you see that one with Roy Scheider that
scene doesn't leave your memory very
quickly you don't want to get into one
of those luckily if you do happen to
rear-end a semi these days there's
almost certainly gonna be this big bar
that hangs down on on two uprights
you've seen these there.the underride
guard and that'll keep your car largely
from submarining underneath the vehicle
but if you hit one dead-on from the rear
odds are pretty good your car's front
crumple zone is going to engage it and
that's going to largely protect you
inside your vehicle the federal
government requires that the backs of
semi-truck trailers have under ride
guards to prevent vehicles from sliding
underneath them in the event of a crash
plus those guards vary widely in
strength there's not a really good high
standard across the industry some
trailer makers build them real tough
others don't and they collapse far too
easily the weakest underwrite guard in
our Test series was on I hon day trailer
when this malibu struck the hyundai in
the rear and a center impact at 35 miles
per hour the guard was simply pushed out
of the way the attachment bolts broke
the damage to the Malibu was so severe
that real people in this crash probably
would have died
now while about 12% of car truck
fatalities are under ride rear-end
collisions there's a whole big risk of
side under ride if you come broadside
under a trailer or hit that at like a
45-degree even as speeds as low as 35
miles an hour cars often submarine under
the side of the underride guard and
that's much rarer to see the kind of
guards that prevent that they're much
more common in Europe now things have
been getting a lot better on those under
ride guards first of all they used to be
required to be I think 60 inches wide
now I believe they have to be at least
94 inches wide up to I think 110 inches
so there's a lot more width there to
find the sweet spot and while many of
the trailer manufacturers are doing a
better job of voluntarily making them
stronger there's been a petitioning of
the federal government by the insurance
industry to adopt a tougher Canadian
standard that dates back to 2007 but
again it's not mandatory in the US and
some big trucks don't have an under ride
guard at all because of the mechanical
complexity of look at a dump truck for
example because the bed has to tilt the
underride guard would get in the way and
clip the ground or the wheels similar
for some of those big dump trailer semis
you see so here's what the smarter
driver does you allow more space as
you're about to make a lane change out
from behind a semi because the problem
is is you're turning to look for a clear
Lane what if that truck slows down a lot
suddenly you're starting your lane
change he's stopping down and you take a
glancing blow on that underride guard
it's the one you don't want to have
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
