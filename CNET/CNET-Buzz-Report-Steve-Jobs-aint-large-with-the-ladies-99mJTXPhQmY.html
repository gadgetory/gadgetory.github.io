buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
groove rider ipod shirt it's a t-shirt
that features a secure pocket for
stashing your iPod and lets you actually
control the iPod using buttons that are
kind of embedded into the chest area of
the shirt the iPod shirt is brought to
you by an Australian company called
urban tool nuff said folks and now for
the news the Microsoft Zune is coming
out soon and it includes the ability to
send someone a song you like so that
they can listen to it a few times and
maybe go buy it later but in a recent
interview with Newsweek apples Steve
Jobs said that basically he doesn't
think the Zune is a very good gadget for
picking up chicks
he said the sharing feature takes too
long and it's much easier to just take
one of your earbuds out and stick it in
some lovely ladies here whoa what Steve
your idea of social networking is
sharing earwax in other ipod news Apple
announced this week that a small number
of video iPods are infected with a virus
and that virus only activates if the
iPod is used with a Windows PC
oho is that how we're playing it now Mad
Dog a recent Stanford study found that
some people are so addicted to the
Internet that they actually try to hide
their excess surfing from their family
friends and bosses but luckily
scientists say there is a cure for
Internet addiction just give the addict
plenty of free alcohol and cigarettes
and drop them off at the nearest casino
pretty soon the internet will be the
last thing on their mind Nielsen Media
Research says it's going to start
raiding video games much the same way it
currently rates television shows oh
great hey guys turns out the most
popular game in the world is Everybody
Loves Raymond the Wizards quest and
finally is speaking of video games a
federal judge in Florida has refused to
ban the game bully lawyer Jack Thompson
had argued that bully is a violent video
game that shouldn't be sold to minors
but after viewing footage from the game
the judge decided that it wasn't that
bad basically you play a student at an
abusive school filled with violent
cliques that attack you and beat you up
mission is to protect yourself and other
students from the bullies using
fisticuffs and slingshots you also have
to go to class so that you can earn
points and learn skills like talking
your way out of a fight
what dude they should ban that game I
mean if I don't get to kill a hooker
shoot some cops or run down any old
lady's in a hot rod you were just
wasting my time I'm Molly wood and this
has been the buzz report thanks for
