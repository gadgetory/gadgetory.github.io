the internet like on-demand movies and
TV shows from Netflix and Hulu or funny
homemade videos from YouTube but today
you're no longer limited to only
watching that content on your computer
I'm Sharon Vaknin for cnet.com and today
I'll show you how to get your favorite
streaming content onto your TV lots of
devices give you internet to TV
streaming but your choice will depend on
what kind of services you want to access
and what your budget is
for example the $100 Roku 2 XS is a tiny
box that connects to your TV via HDMI
and gives you 1080p video streaming from
dozens of places like Netflix Hulu
YouTube
CNET an even internet radio like Pandora
keep in mind of course that with any of
these devices you still need to pay
monthly subscription fees like 8 bucks a
month for Netflix Roku connects to the
internet with an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi
but keep in mind that if you are using
Wi-Fi you'll need a pretty good
connection at home and as an added bonus
the Roku 2 is also packed with games but
if you want to opt out of games and that
Ethernet port the cheaper Roku model is
80 bucks speaking of games if you have a
PlayStation 3 at home you're already
equipped to stream internet content with
an Ethernet or solid Wi-Fi connection
and a PlayStation Network account you
can stream Netflix Hulu Vudu YouTube and
even some sports channels like MLB TV
the ps3 won't get you nearly as many
services as Roku but if you already on
the console games a blu-ray player and
streaming make it a great all-in-one
device the Xbox is also media streaming
device but you'll have to pay 60 bucks a
year for an Xbox Live account plus any
subscriptions like Netflix now if you're
an Apple fan and you've got iOS devices
and a well-stocked iTunes library your
streaming device of choice might be the
Apple TV for less than $100 this box can
of course stream content from popular
services like Netflix and YouTube but
the Apple TV is the only one that can
also play videos
and music from any of your iOS devices
and your iTunes library on your computer
so you can stream a video you just shot
on your iPhone or the Lady Gaga album
you just purchased on your computer all
to your TV check Apple's website to find
out what other streaming video services
the Apple TV supports and do the same
for the Roku and ps3 so you can pick the
best device for your needs and if you
ever need a simple cheap way to stream
media to your TV an HDMI cable from your
computer or tablet to your TV should do
the trick you might need an adapter like
this one for the iPad but it's still way
cheaper than buying a dedicated device
if you have any other streaming device
