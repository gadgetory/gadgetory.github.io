levy and you're watching rumor has it
the show where we round up the week's
biggest tech room and then we vote on
what sounds a jit what seems like it'll
never happen and you guys can vote with
us look out for the pole in the
interactive player if you're watching on
cnet first up the daily sites to
anonymous sources within Facebook saying
that the social network is on the verge
of creating a new classifieds listing
technique which would let you put ads on
specific friends news feeds Facebook
would charge a fee for some types of ads
the advantage of using this over
something like Craigslist is that this
is specific to people you know or their
friends so then if your company is
hiring or you need a roommate it might
be worth paying for when reached for
comment a Facebook rep told CNET that
Facebook is not working on a product
like the one you described of course
that doesn't mean anything I think that
this is a smart move for facebook using
word of mouth essentially the targets
news feeds for specific friends I find
it a key it suddenly puts us on the same
level as those get thin in two weeks ads
or the beard beanie next it seems that
Apple might be taking a page out of
google's book The Wall Street Journal
reports that apple quietly started a
program that gives some of the company's
employees two weeks to work on projects
that aren't part of their job it's
supposedly code name blue sky this goes
against apple's image as a company with
a top-down management structure side
projects suggest the move toward a
culture that would foster independent
projects that could make their way into
larger products just like google's
program which gave us gmail and google
reader in a follow-up report the journal
noted that blue sky may not be a
long-term thing adding that it was tied
to scott forstall awkward apples former
senior vice president of software who
recently left the company hold on to
something steady this next rumor is
going to rock your world if you're into
the over-the-top super hyped Apple rumor
kind of thing a Chinese news site is
reporting that Apple will drop three
brand spankin new products in the first
half of next year and not something
boring it inconsequential like a new
airport express no the site claims will
see a new iPhone a new iPad and
something called the ITV
china time says it is spoken with
industry sources and though that sounds
sketchy China times was right about the
timetable for the iphone 5 but don't get
too excited the new iphone it's speaking
of is not the iphone 6 it's the iphone
5s which means that it will probably be
the exact same thing plus Syria will now
sing or I don't know yes obviously the
exciting part of this rumor is about the
ITV but that's also the most vague a
couple things it could be it could be a
simple update to apple TV or the set-top
to DVR cable box we talked about a few
months ago or it could be the most
majestic tech unicorn of them all an
apple television set with itunes and
airplay built in which we've been
hearing rumors about for a year who
knows as for the iphone 5s i'm going to
say that it being tested next year is
possible but i wouldn't think that apple
would release it until the fall when
iphone 4s people will be out of their
two-year contracts right because the
iphone 4s was announced in october two
thousand eleven and that came nearly a
year and a half after the iphone 4 i
would totally disrupt its own product
schedule if this were true and people
were pretty upset when it did that with
the ipad 4 so i think they'd be loath to
repeat it or wait Who am I kidding Apple
never learns its lessons and really
doesn't care what we think and what do
you guys think most importantly is the
iphone 5s coming to us in the first half
of next year and what about a new ipad
and what do you think an itv could be
don't forget to vote and leave us a
comment on the rumor has it blog we
asked the cnet council about the iphone
5s release the cnet council is composed
of five editors who cast their votes
anonymously their opinions are not an
endorsement by Cena or CBS interactive
obviously because these are rumors folks
and the cnet verdict is a unanimous no
we got four nose and one hell no they do
not think the iPhone 5s is coming out
early next year that's our show
everybody please share your rumors at
rumor has it at cnet com or call us at 1
800 750 cnet and tweet us and tune in
next week for more tech rumors
