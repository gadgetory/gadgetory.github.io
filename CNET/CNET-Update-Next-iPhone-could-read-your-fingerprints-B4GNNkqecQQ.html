thumb prints I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update Apple pushed out a
new beta version of iOS 7 for app
developers to tinker with and there have
been some interesting discoveries
including hidden code for fingerprint
scanner a programmer discovered a folder
called biometric kitui which includes
instructions for how to read a person's
left or right thumb on an iPhone that
has people speculating that the next
iPhone could have some sort of
thumbprint security protection feature
Apple purchased a fingerprint sensor
company a year ago so it could be
putting that tech into use now Netflix
is testing out individual profiles so
each family member can get their own
user names recommendations and set their
own cues it's being tested now with some
apple TV users and Netflix promise that
these profiles will be rolled out across
all products by the end of august also
in streaming news Comedy Central
launched an app on Xbox called CC stand
up which brings 6,000 videos from more
than 700 comedians straight onto TVs on
demand the only catch is that you need
to pay for Xbox Live to access the app

worried about losing Cable customers

overstock Hudson's book prices even

fight it out you might as well reap the
benefits and sprint just expanded its 4G
LTE coverage to 41 new markets across
the u.s. sprint has been lagging behind
the other carriers with 4G LTE coverage
but now the faster wireless speeds are
available for customers in 151 markets
but there are still many areas without
sprint's LTE including Manhattan

website and released new apps for iOS

website is full of upset users who are
now limited to what cities they can
search for just because it went free
more cities will be added in the coming
months so keep watch for that google
