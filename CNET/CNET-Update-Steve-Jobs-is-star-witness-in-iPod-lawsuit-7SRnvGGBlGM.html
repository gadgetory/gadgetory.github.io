and this is your cnet updates Apple is
back in the courtroom but it's not
fighting against Samsung and patents
this time it's about the ipod and steve
jobs will be testifying from beyond the
grave this is a class-action antitrust
lawsuit about how back in two thousand
six to two thousand nine apples iPods
only played music purchased from itunes
and it blocked music from competitors
like real networks the plaintiffs claim
Apple hurt the market for other music
players and that resulted in Apple
charging more for ipods than they should
have Apple's argument is that it limited
iPods to music from itunes for security
and quality reasons this case has been
in the works for a decade and attorneys
recorded video deposition from Steve
Jobs back in April of 2011 six months
before he died the trial will go on for
nine days let's move from Apple to
google that quirky wearable Google glass
isn't dead yet just as speculation
started to spread about Google giving up
on glass outcomes a report that a new
model of glass will arrive next year and
it'll have intel inside intel would be
replacing a processor that's currently
made by Texas Instruments until an
Google wants to get glass to be seen
more as a workplace tool instead of as
that privacy invading headgear that
makes you seem socially awkward until is
making a big effort to get into the
wearable tech market after sitting on
the sidelines for years now for the past
several days we've talked about online
holiday shopping and now we welcome
another type of monetary cyber event
giving Tuesday it began two years ago
when several organizations joined forces
to promote the concept and awareness is
spread on social media with the giving
Tuesday hashtag this year some MIT
students have come up with a way to turn
Twitter into a donation tool the
services share a tweet but it can be a
little tricky to use you have to first
post a tweet or retweet with a mention
of the chair at wheat account along with
the Twitter account of the participating
organization
you want to donate to and a dollar sign
with the amount that you want to give
now the first time you do that you will
be sent a link to a form to fill out
your credit card info for billing but
the idea is that your only to do that
once and from then on you can tweet
donations to any charity hooked up with
the service as of now there are about 40
groups that use the service and you can
see a list at Cherry tweet com that your
tech news update you can always find
