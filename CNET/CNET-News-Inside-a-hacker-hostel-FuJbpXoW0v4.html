start-up embassy a four-bedroom ranch
style home in suburban palo alto he
rents out beds to anyone coming to
Silicon Valley with a dream all of the
people are abstaining the house are
like-minded they're all intrapreneurs
people sometimes want a desk and

tips and even resources like
introductions to potential investors if
I wanted one day want to raise funds
right now I'd like 20 people that I know
that are coming in and out of these
houses that have gone through the
process I can teach me exactly what how
to do it if I hadn't stayed here
I wouldn't know them room board and
connections in San Francisco I'm Kara
