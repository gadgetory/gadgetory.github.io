tomorrow daily the best geek traction
the known universe okay it's time to
tell you what we've been plotting jeff
cannata producer Logan and I have
decided we're gonna listen to the people
we're gonna continue the short episodes
yeah a lot of you are celebrating but
we're also going to continue doing long
episodes yay just once a week though so
won't make you watch a 20 minute episode
every day but if you want to tune into a
longer format show with guests and
segments field packages and all that
stuff we're going to start doing that
soon we'll keep you posted on that but
jeff cannata is going to start doing one
short episode week starting next week so
you can hope to see his glorious face
Monday Tuesday or Wednesday of next week
all right guys let's at the headlines
the tokyo motor show is honestly the
gift that keeps on giving this week so
yesterday we talked about moto bot and
today we're talking about Toyota's
concept car that aims to power your home
the FCB plus debuted earlier this week
it's a hydrogen-powered concept vehicle
but Toyota thinks the idea behind it is
the future of personal transportation
and energy it's got electric motors in
each wheel a fuel cell between the front
tires and the hydrogen tank between the
two back tires the car converts hydrogen
gas into electricity so that you can
drive your car around but toyota says it
won't stop there and it shouldn't they
think if you haven't used up your
electricity by the time you get home you
could potentially hook up your car to a
larger hydrogen tank and generate power
for either your house a business or
other objects of course the thing
missing here is a pretty huge piece of
the puzzle major hydrogen infrastructure
which won't be cheap or easy to build
out but Toyota seems pretty confident
that this is the future of both clean
power in your car and clean power at
home ambitious but also pretty exciting
to think about speaking of ambition
let's talk about and take a closer look
at the winners of Google's project tango
app developer contests super quick recap
project tango is Google's experiment
that uses handheld devices that bring
spatial awareness through motion
tracking depth perception and aerial
learning technologies basically project
tango devices want to be really really
good at 3d mapping what it sees in the
real war
hold in real time so who won giggles app
contest heroic arcade took Best in Show
with its 3d puzzle game we r cubed tango
which looks like it relies a lot on
moving the device around to solve
puzzles other winners include a 3d model
capturing app for tango from developer
dot products and a fun-looking
multiplayer AR game from developer FLARP
project tango is still in early stages
but you can pick up a developer tablet
for just over 500 bucks if you're
itching to make something really really
awesome using the project tango platform
alright so the very last thing today we
love really cool intelligent toys for
kids on tomorrow daily and linky is
definitely in that category linky is
from designer eun-jung park and it's a
simple looking kit with some bigger
ideas tucked inside the kit comes with a
pegboard 16 bars two circles and four
other shapes that can be assembled and
adjusted to create two dimensional
kinetic designs the bars and shapes can
be hand driven or you can use one of
three kinds of motors included to
animate your design there's a full
rotation motor a limited rotation motor
and an interactive motor that rotates
based on a Wi-Fi signal sent from a
sensor unit Park says the 2d mechanism
is important because it lets anyone
heckling key by making custom parts from
cheap materials like cardboard available
to the user the idea is to offer a toy
that can teach kids about a complex idea
but in a simple way honestly though I
think linky would be really appreciated
by science-minded adults too it would
look really really cool on anybody's
desk it's still in prototype stages so
you can't exactly surf on over to Amazon
and put one in your cart but we'll keep
an eye on linky and we'll let you guys
know if it ever hits retail alright guys
that's it for the headlines of the week
let's talk about into it
this week well it's Halloween so what
else could I possibly be into but
classic horror movies I love this time
of year because it lets me have dust off
yield fantastic 70s and 80s horror
movies like The Exorcist shining the
thing I mean pretty much aunt
poltergeist I mean these are great
classic films and I love to watch them
around Halloween it just amps me up for
getting out there I obviously I can't
trick or treat but I I do get really
excited about the holiday I'm gonna
dress up it's gonna be great but yeah
that's what I'm into this week and if
you haven't seen those horror films and
you're old enough to handle them or if
you like horror movies because some of
you are terrified by them so don't watch
them but if you love horror movies you
should definitely watch the classics
well worth your time all right producer
Logan time for your into it hey everyone
this week I'm into the apple TV yes I
know it's not out yet but I'm really
into actually trying the apple TV the TV
is the most used device in my apartment
I use it because I refuse to watch
content on an iPad or my laptop so I'm
really excited that Apple TV's gonna
consolidate all the streaming content
that I enjoy into one device with that
we get a new Apple TV remote and I will
no longer be pushing buttons like a
sucker the new row has a built-in
microphone for Siri and I can't wait to
try and stump her with all her brand new
movie and TV knowledge what I'm most
excited about is the what did they say
feature which the playhead is backed up
about 15 seconds and the closed
captioning is temporarily turned on so
you can catch that phrase that maybe you
couldn't hear and although I'm not
really a big mobile gamer I am really
excited to see what they look like on
the big screen so any day now that
should be showing up in the mail and I
just can't wait to get my hands on it
all right let's take a look at your
photos it's phone tog refer of the day
