time on CNN TV I'm Jeff aguilon and I'm
Justin you this is the show where we
break through the clusters up bring up
that one yourself Riggins no actually
the New York Post have that has a head
really clusters are clusters they would
ya wouldn't they I think they're trying
to make suck us a thing like they're
trying to get sucked oh it's up then you
lost a lot of money Oh like oh man
billion dollars oh you just got sucked
yeah your bank account just got sucked
up got sucked in the burgh right up in
there sucked in the facebook welcome to
our program yes we've got fine run down
for you fine ladies and gentlemen this
afternoon more of a bum down that a fun
down you know there's just not a lot to
talk about these days a lot you know is
it mirrors like it seemed like the news
is just three things lately yes what I
said you don't feel like no you don't
say yeah I said that yes would you say
so you're saying it's yet it's also
smart yeah what yeah it's always like oh
there's a crazy virus that's gonna steal
all your private information someone on
Google is getting sued for privacy
issues there's 15 new HTC phones out
today thanks today there's 15 yeah
that's real only tech news that we're
seeing these sort of would have feels
nonnamous does something kind of funny
then the next day we'll all forget about
it right it's the 24 hour news cycle is
really starting to get a little stale
even the videos I feel like I started to
get stale like how many pogo stick fails
have we seen in the last year how many
people are gonna continue to just fall
off things and we're just going to laugh
at that maybe it's because we're so
close to the news that we can't take a
macro look at it and for what it really
is you know it's not exciting to us
anymore I don't know oh no the hell
you're talking about why are you it
seems like you're bored with the news
and I'm I'm trying to point out that it
might be because we have to look at it
every day no I don't know what it is
it's just it does I think we're in
agreement it does seem to be the same
crap day and
yeah yeah like Facebook smart phones
Google yeah in no particular order you
know and I don't know we're just get a
little jaded with it maybe so are we
we're saying this is it we're done yeah
we're so with that said this is gonna be
our last show ever ever up speaking of
anonymous but more anonymous online
speech uh legislation proposed
legislation in New York dude try and say
judicials is the road you're older there
is proposed legislation yes in New York
that would eradicate anonymous online
speech yeah uh how does this really uh
this is really have a chance to go
through no I don't think so I don't
think so either by this part of the
internet Protection Act also known as
the IPA that came out uh I believe early
earlier this month earlier those long we
both have been doing some drinking
before the show today uh anyway this
bill would basically require uh websites
to ask for uh personal information of
posters that are anonymously putting up
attack posts so say you have a blog we
talked about this with Jill yesterday
talk a little bit about it yeah but so
say you have a blog and you open up this
blog post comments and someone
anonymously post something that's kind
of offensive um this law would basically
require the owners of that blog to
solicit the private information of that
poster to get their personal uh there
that's crap contacted that's crap yeah
don't get me wrong i'm not in favor of
anonymous online you know blog comments
right they suck right there always
usually you know um malevolent but I
feel like it's no different than
somebody sending in an anonymous letter
in the mail yeah you can do that you can
still do that the believe me the postal
service will take what they can get if
you want to send something in the mail
they will be very happy to deliver it
probably if it's ticking yeah I think
anonymity of the Internet is what makes
it so great is that you can talk to
somebody on omegle or chat roulette and
no one will net you are at the same time
make a stupid comment on YouTube sure
but at the same time you still uh you
know that's that's anonymity varies by
product right so if I'm doing a blog and
i'm only gonna let people who log in
through their facebook account to
comment right well that's my freakin
prerogative right so you know the door
sort of swings both ways but my point is
like where is this going to stop right
are you gonna be asking for the contact
information of the people requesting the
contact information you know i mean like
uh is so you they don't have to get the
identity information of the people that
are requesting the takedown of these
comments either so anyone could flag
this comment and it would get taken down
right it's ridiculous hey it's the
internet welcome you know its nature of
the beast I feel like I don't know and
I'm sure you've done this I haven't
because I'm not a troll but you're a
troll very much you're a dirty troll
yeah I got roller uh you've troll hair
and a troll face yeah and an overall
troll body ah screw you but do you I
mean for you do you think it's something
judging from your personal experience
said that should stay intact yeah I
think it's my first amendment right to
troll whatever the f you want yeah no
I'm with you man yeah and it this quote
here they're uh they're saying that this
will prevent anonymous baseless
political attacks also like so I'm
thinking that this is a probably request
on behalf of like government officials
that don't want people talking crap
about them on the Internet you think
that's just really what it comes down to
yeah people can it's a week it's a weak
attempt is really what how I see it it's
just sent its kind of weak you know it's
like a lids it's a weak shot I feel like
it's a responsibility of the people on
the website to not care about what
anonymous idiots on the internet say
about them right it's like be a big boy
be a big girl and get and move on with
your life yeah this is nice and purposes
people are talking crap about you behind
their back this is just happening online
yeah so now you can just read the crap
that's behind your back trace Buster
Buster exact
What did he say Terrance is demand says
you can use a trace buster buster you'd
get that reference yes what's it from no
I don't the big hit the big I never saw
the big oh really Mark Wahlberg good
never saw it look at this a movie that
Jeff Bakalar hasn't see what tell me
more uh so in that they have a phone
tracking system to see who's calling
because there's a hostage situation okay
but then the hostage taker has a trace
buster no but then the hostage hey uh
finders have a trace Buster Buster yeah
gotcha it's funny speaking of movies we
talked about this the other day our
prayers have been answered there is a
hook prequel featuring Rufio in the
works yes is it really right your shows
are really really crave online which is
a movie website not crave the gadget
blog from seeing it right uh they
recently sat down with dante basco he is
the original actor from such movies as
hook hmm and the day boo and they asked
him you know if there's ever possibility
of having a Rufio original story in the
works a prequel a prequel if you will
yeah and uh basically the story but
behind this is really crazy uh
apparently these college kids wrote an
entire script for the Rufio origin
because that didn't actually exist right
he's in a pan comic he's a completely a
fictionalized character for the movie
hook right even though he is so
convincingly real you know if you told
me all you know I mean that guy looks
like he's there for reason right right
sure his back story seems developed
right but it wasn't originally and these
kids in college apparently made a
musical out of the story of Rufio and
this the in uh interview doesn't really
go into detail about what those plot
points are but uh the musical basically
bankrupted these poor college kids on so
that was when they option the script to
Hollywood and uh you know the original
Rufio actor Dante Basco actually said
that it's being it's being produced well
too bad he's like 45 now it's not gonna
be him you should be in it though in
some capacity that would be cool if it
was like Rufio Sun roof
go has like an amazing phenomenon
there's like a there's a band called
Rufio all right live in yeah they based
on yeah go Hawks you know I just
remember before like uh the title track
they would play that that roofie oh you
know bite Rufio yeah I mean I don't know
I feel like this is something I would
really embrace yeah we're talking rude I
love feel like we just we think it and
it happens I feel like we can kind of
take credit for what else do you what
else do you want it'll happen just
anything hahaha ah mrs. Doubtfire sequel
you know why man I got you know what
yeah would you be mad at that yeah I
wouldn't be mad I wouldn't be mad
especially if Robin Williams did it he
hasn't had a good movie in a long time
writing one thing he did uh I don't know
RV did better with you it might be true
what was the last the last one he was in
his old dogs Oh more happy feet two was
in 2011 you know that came out yeah oh
also night at the museum battle of the
Smithsonian no it's all that pieces he's
um I really do like Robin Williams I
really do here's a Family Guy where they
just kind of tore him up a little bit
recently tough luck for him yeah but
he's a good dude anyway so they are
looking for the next young filipino /
asian american actor to take over the
role of Rufio in the prequel so i'm sure
a casting call will be out shortly
thinking I was gonna say honk oh my god
Brian town's gonna be here next week
maybe we'll get him on the show and
confront him about being rufio rufio
seek in the prequel you gotta think
about it so what are they going to do
are they going to basically explain how
Rufio and pen you know cuz it sounds
like they were sort of enemies all along
me well I think the story was that when
Robin Williams is peter pan left uh
Neverland an adult somehow somewhere
along that timeline Rufio came in and
swooped on the leadership role right I
can't even there he like rain eep
there's probably a lot of politics yeah
they're like I know if I want an asian
guy leading this group no I don't know
if it was
something yeah I don't think Neverland
is like was it never Lander never
Neverland never ever let you never these
three three Nevers never never never
land never ever never there's no way
this is a land I feel like they uh you
know they were like he had a like
campaign together the voting right and
what's mud but had a like Doug but man i
wana voted for thing i right i'm sure
they had a like a really really man by
campaign candy don't like to frame on
the table yeah killing you Peter oh that
he did that and that one of the
electrode yeah it was it the second he
crowed it was over he's like you can't
crow old man love that crud they're like
okay you can wear the red page right
yeah wasn't review a little older than
the others it seemed did was a little
weird Rufio seemed he was it like in his
early 20s yeah and everyone else is like
pushing 15 yeah a little odd bhangra
bangarang I didn't have like the super
super hot fairy right who I don't know
just hung around with them but then she
got big she did get big yeah Julia Rob
did you say she's like I busted my cage
your precious issue man we love that
movie um alright we're gonna switch
gears just a little bit just the tad
weird showed it it's a weird show today
but there's not a lot going on but
there's something interesting going on
with yahoo yahoo has launched a browser
now get this it's like a browser within
a browser uh-huh um it's called axis and
they're sort of doing something really
unique do you can use I have a hard time
wrapping my head around it yeah right
now I'm just looking at the logo is it
just me or does this look like a
combination of the activision logo the
verge google drive an adobe and adobe
yeah it's all of that in one I think
maybe that's intentional triangle so hot
right now right they are pretty hot um
yeah I mean what would you do you make
of this thing uh so basically this is
Yahoo announcing their new visual based
web browser and uh if you look online
our own rafe needleman did a review
of it and he actually liked it yeah
surprisingly um it's not on there are
browser people using yahoo yes not a
conventional browser it's a two-part
thing one it's a mobile app so this is
kind of cool the way the mobile app
works is instead of actually bringing up
a list of search results when you type
in something right it'll actually bring
up thumbnails on the bottom of the
screen of the website that's associate
much more visually uh engaging in
friendly experience right so you see web
page thumbnails at the bottom that you
can flick through with your finger on
mobile browser and you want you can just
drag that thumbnail up into the screen
and we'll make it into the widescreen or
what do you think we're like dumbing
down the web too much for people yeah I
think it's because people don't like
reading ever know but it's more than
that I feel like AOL dumbed down the
internet to begin with right cuz it was
just like welcome here are the only ten
categories on the internet you can
browse through you know p all along you
could have gone on to and enter the URL
and ghanta where you wanted to go but
they sort of like presented the internet
in this weird customized fashion yeah I
feel like this is the same idea I mean I
think so i think it's also like a
different way of doing like previews on
the side of a desktop browser no you
know like in google for example when you
hover over something you could see a
preview of it on the side it sort of
takes out the middleman right no one
likes looking through pages and pages
they're sure without knowing what it's
going to be sure so I don't know this is
kind of a way around that yeah the
mobile version is a little bit I'm sorry
the desktop version of access is a
little bit different but what's cool is
that once you sign in to access it will
record it will remember your search
history and bring those tiles to the
desktop version so you can kind of
seamlessly move between mobile and desk
you can do that already do that in crow
in Chrome yeah speaking of which people
are talking that these numbers are
inflated chrome apparently has taken
over I ass used browser I saw that which
is crazy are you surprised I'm not
surprised but it's crazy how fast it did
it yeah you only mean like it did this
in less than five years how long was
that what do you know long was it out
for before I reached this I feel like
five years right how long has chrome
have been around that long like that you
know that's what it feels like at least
it's really is amazing
all right we're gonna say break when we
come back we'll get to our interactivity
portion of the show featuring 40 for
pets we've hit a new low on this show I
don't know how this happened or evolved
or what what but we're really embracing

ice surrounding your heart ya think so a
little puddle on the ground and look

slaughter puff nothing's good that thing
is freaking cute with that will get the
calls from the public time to show the
love
for Xena you ever get that feeling where
something is so cute you just want to
like hit it or like strangle it what is
that I don't know I just want to like
take this dog it's so freaking you're a
whore like I just want to grab in Italy
squeeze it it's the same thing like
grandmother's do where I don't know if
Asian grandmother's do this what looks
like oh you're so cute I could eat your
face what or something like that I never
grandma's never said that it's like oh

a lot of what the f's man why cuz they
don't want this dog to die dogs not
dying no way okay ah calls from the
public time brought to you by hero
slaughter puff that's that do you aren't
great name I just understand is that
what he says to the dog when he's like
trying to calling here heroes letter but
no I think it's part of like here puff
or here here or something like that um
this is a really good rant about things
that need to be improved in on a
day-to-day basis washing your hands in a
modernized bathroom what's up for four
guys mathis is Colorado Springs from so
I've been racking my brain over the past
two weeks you guys were asking your
listeners to come up with some ideas for
technology in a modernized world where
technology might be needed however I
found something that doesn't mean
technology that unfortunately has
technology they were going to the
restroom of a public restroom and they
have those automatic taps I was it was
in a restroom near the face wash no I
was working hard sweaty so I decided to
wash my face and needless to say I got
the soap on but I couldn't get it off
because the damn can shut off on me
there's the most annoying thing in the
world reach it brother damn stupid
automatic times like I need some machine
to tell me how much water I need and how
or cold I need it and then you wave your
hand in front of the paper towel
dispenser because it's automated yes
what happens no no there so I walk out
of there soap in my eyes and I reckon
you're a Russian space yeah so I think
we need to band together as 40 for
listeners and come up with a way to get
the stupid automated sinks out yeah uh
he brings up a great point and he's
reached the appropriate amount of anger
pneus yeah right he's at that level
where he needs to be over this there's a
lot to be pissed about there's a lot to
be upset about they've not perfected
that yeah I you know I used to have like
preferences I don't anymore I kind of
like this I like the soap automated soap
dispensing some things all right but you
know I don't know there's just oh it's
bad yeah it's bad it's bad news why
can't we figure that out and I've yet to
use aside from one amazing blow dryer
you get to use one that aggregation
thing doesn't work no it works just as
much as the normal one you stick your
hands under and that barely works too
and I can't stand the automated water
dispenser sinks when it's like you go
into a bathroom and there's eight yeah
right and only one works yeah what is up
with that and why aren't the flushing
handles at the bottom of a urinal like
why do we have to do a ninja kick every
time I want to flush the toilet if you
put a pedal yeah it should be a pedal
should be a freaking pedal the other
thing that I saw the other day which is
freaking genius is it was at my friend's
house in his toilet he had a tab on the
toilet that you could use to lift it up
with your foot or your hand don't mean
as it like when that when both seats are
down you shouldn't have to put your
finger underneath that gross toilet seat
on the bottom there was a nice little
tab there to kick it up another awesome
invention I believe I discussed it here
in our fine program as well what you're
gonna say well the thing that prevents
the seat from hitting them no no no no
no no there's uh there's this thing that
it's like a hook that's basically like
shoulder level okay and it sticks out on
the door so instead of having to grab
that handle to open the bathroom door
after you've cleaned yourself up you're
short
like hook your army Oh adore Ali yeah
yeah I like that is smart I use my foot
for that too I become an ape wont to do
that how was it doorknob yeah yeah I
like kick it all I kick it yeah and then
pull it open with my foot no crap you
know I'm sorry Richard that's tough yeah
I don't like he's been here at all where
you stick your foot into the little lat
yeah yeah saw like pushed down little
fits on the doorknob right and then hook
my that's underneath that you can't do
it on everything oh yes I can I'll do it
on this one right now oh that's easy
that's easy to do that's easy to do
that's easy to do it now oh so this is
you trying to get out of a bathroom yeah
justin is literally okay oh and then
what and then you just sleep and then
you're gone I don't know dude that looks
like a lot of work I don't know if I
don't know if that's how Roger sits
right there you just add a very alarm uh
yeah I don't know man I exit a bathroom
this to me and it seems like more work
than it's worth anyway a paper towel or
something Yeah right dude seriously
right just use that publisher and you're
not every door you hurt yourself to my
door handle is like that it's built for
speed like that uh what happened that
was awesome let's go cooee does not
upload this show it's fine it'll be the
Phantom show next call hey guys it's uh
Bree Ontario from cody and I'm just
about to watch The Devil's and rangers
game and I thought right away I think of
mr. bakalar and I thought of a question
here that I have sure every day i'm at
work and i listened to the 404 live and
sometimes I'll catch up on an episode
and I watch it using my iPhone just
curious how much data does i use i have
six gigs a month I haven't gone over but
I'm still curious so I love the show
thank you okay first off good job
watching the hockey game number two we
needed we need like a scientist in here
yeah I don't have no idea it depends on
the version they're streaming so if you
download our full show unencoded in its
raw form it's rough
five gigs I don't know where that's
available I don't think that's available
anywhere right I don't think so so
compressed to what it is I mean maybe do
you have any insight on this um how
could we know this I feel like it seems
like when I when you could be like I
don't know around like 500 I was going
to say look at it like this when you
download the SD version in itunes it
comes in at like 150 I think so I would
imagine that's what you're streaming
you're not streaming the high quality 10
yeah over your phone so maybe it's about
150 megabytes I can't see being more
than like 300 yeah right would you want
to download our show if it it's that big
it will streamline it streaming is one
thing arm can't you look at isn't there
like some sort of interface you can look
at on the on the website like on your
carrier's website I know on my verizon
side I can see how much i've downloaded
yeah so do that cuz i'm really really
curious about it tech enthusiasts no has
nothing to do with gigawatts it's
unrelated to our situation right now but
thank you for your input uh so yeah
sorry we can't provide more information
on that front but that's what I think it
is next call next two calls dealing with
the talk about the DC gay superhero
coming out of the closet right and we
have some insight few viewers listeners
think they know who it might be making
from Jeremy I just finished listening to
tuesday's episode when you're talking
about a Wonder Woman and gay superheroes
in DC Comics and said that it seemed
priapic she would probably one well I
would say yes considering that she's an
Amazon she comes from an island full of
women know if she wants to get some
action only got one way to turn since
Truman also mentioned something about
her thing to be like should be into
bondage in the original Wonder Woman
comics if she was tied up by man she
would lose your powers so yeah she's a
little bit on the freaky side all right
keep up the great work who's not I
didn't know that did you know if wonder
woman gets tied up she loses her powers
no I didn't really that's her kryptonite
but uh no she has a lasso that's also
made out of group I guess that's a
golden one is that true can anyone
confirm in the chat room his Wonder
Woman really lose it all when she's tied
up it doesn't everybody lose it all we
know tied up Superman Superman that
would just be like you know just brush
that off right Batman would just cut it
with one of his like you know things
Wolverine would be fine with it I mean
you know uh yeah I don't know we don't
have people in the chair I'm saying no
she's not gonna rope herself Justin yeah
jeremy'll says they should tire up with
toilet paper though every weird anyway
yeah very possible that Wonder Woman is
a lesbian but we will leave the comic
Lords you think it's gonna be new
character the lesbionic woman in the
last be on again oh crap on stick that's
just ridiculous hey Richard he loves it
look at Richard just turning a bright
red right there less Bionic Woman less
Bionic Woman love it okay um d shale has
a lot of insight here I he wrote a lot i
have to give him some credit injury this
one of Wonder Woman's main weaknesses is
her silver bracelets are bonded together
she becomes ultimately perilous and a
slave to whomever does so another
weakness you could add on his seduction
because she's a stupid whooped no
getting a man could seduce Wonder Woman
and Wonder Woman is so filled with a
graduation she could fall for the trap
what another thing about Wonder Woman is
that she's human so if you shot her I
guess so if you shot her she would die
that we the worst superhero ever hahaha
also food he basically said yeah the
Wonder Woman her biggest weakness is
over and then for one week every month
she can't fight I did say
stuff we are not saying I didn't say
that we are not saying that we could be
seduced saying like because she's so
what yeah she's because male superheroes
don't have that see this is this is the
mentality of why a woman will never be
president it's not cool yeah that's not
cool she'll put a JK after that JK
seriously Oh somebody clipped this one
out there's no way okay yeah it's got a
stronger mind and do a Seldon says no
for one week show you way too violet
just aren't killing criminals haha
that's me that's me that not cool and
you all can have you all need to know
that oh my god not feel that way but we
love what not a superhero i love minute
too much except Catwoman she can off
with her head all right moving right
along finally we have the last chiming
in about what uh what gay DC super this
is kind of becoming a really good topic
yeah just because it's interesting but I
like who they're gonna out let's get to
it hey for four guys it's will from
Atlanta just calling in about the DC
Comics gay well rumor I guess it's not
really a rumor but I still read comics
i'm a 31 year old guy my son basically
is named after two comic book characters
Grayson Kent by the way I'm just kind of
throw my two cents then if it's going to
be Robin it's going to have to be I
really think the third Robin you know
Dick Grayson he's an adult he's now
Nightwing yeah yeah there is a
well-documented relationship between him
and Barbara Gordon gone off on again off
again true it has to be Tim Drake you
know he's part of the team Titans he's
now red robin no longer Robin Robin is
actually a psycho pack of 10 year old
illegitimate son of Bruce Wayne so
that's a whole other story I don't know
that um you know it has to be Tim Drake
he's part of the team Titans and one of
the new found members of the Teen Titans
is very openly gay um Hispanic superhero
named bunker so I think he kind of shows
him the way to find out who he truly is
that that really makes more sense i'm
going to be Bruce Wayne or Superman
and as much as people like jokes or
Aquaman you know ah Clemente has a very
Harris mature relationship with Mira so
that's really not going to happen I
don't think I got upset into the big
three you know Wonder Woman Batman
Superman just my two cents I'll talk to
you that a lot thank you kiss doesn't
awesome voice mail he school bus ultra
informative yeah dude keep calling in
with that knowledge man dude I was man I
love the way he talks about superheroes
in fact he's later named Shannon Grayson
yeah who is this blonde credible this is
bunker uh one of the gay superheroes and
Teen Titans that he was speculating
about huh uh yes with address Tim Drake
the way showing him the way yeah I get
an who's that I don't know some guy he's
beating up oh but there's Robin in the
background making sure his boyfriend
doesn't get hurt nice that you don't
know that yet you don't know we don't
want to speculate on what relationship
he's in yeah that's pretty cool all
right no rock and roll can't wait to
find out it thank you for the calls

want to add to the conversation a 66 404
