Mollywood once again
with the buzz reports but first the
gadget of the week
it's the Motorola RAZR 2 or razor
squared doesn't look much different than
the old razor doesn't but it has a
completely different interface they
assure me runs a version of Linux has
bigger high-res screens inside and out
and get this is 0.07 inches thinner than
the current razor that's right point
zero 7 what really bothered me though is
how Motorola's CEO called this part of
the new razor its quote double chin hmm
comparing your product to a fat person I
don't believe that's how Steve Jobs
ignited the iPhone and now something
that is really really amazing we're
really excited about this turn the
iPhone around and here's what we call
its fat ass ok speaking of the iPhone
this isn't even funny a fake email went
around Apple's corporate servers
announcing the iPhone would be delayed
from June to October gold that got out
on the web and pretty soon Apple was
worth two and a half billion dollars
less now within the hour
Apple declared the email was bogus the
stock recovered and Steve Jobs grabbed
his elephant gun and snugged up his pith
helmet to go pith on whoever started
that email but I feel bad for Motorola
in all this you see they announced a
real phone in fact a handful of phones
the day before I could barely grab a
headline maybe they should delay
something or not new research this week
on how many of us only have a cell phone
at home made a lot of buzz 29% of
Americans aged 25 to 29 have no landline
at home just a cell 25 percent of
Americans 18 to 24 and yes it is
generational once you go to 65 plus less
than 2% have ditched their landline for
a cell but of course they're probably
still dialing their phones another stat
the household type most likely to have a
cell phone only is describing the serve
as unrelated adults with no children you
sounds like a swingers colony no wonder
this study was done by the Centers for
Disease Control and it's hard to argue
with this one driving while texting is a
bad idea and it's soon to be against the
law in Washington State starting January
1 of next year you'll score a $100
ticket and you can lose your phone if
you're caught DWT now of course this is
another case of legislation lamely
chasing technology and falling on its
face because the law carves out an
exception for things like selecting a
name from a contact that's not against
the law so that opens the door to
sending photos from your camera phone
browsing its little web browser through
bookmarks here's something to take to
the family dinner table tonight sex is
worth more than porn porn com just sold
this past week for nine and a half
million dollars but the URL sex com sold
last year for 11 million by the way the
buyer of porn com is a company called
MXM and their unique genius is in
convincing themselves that URLs and
front doors are still worth much in this
era of googling everything i'm brian
Cooley
this has been the buzz report thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
