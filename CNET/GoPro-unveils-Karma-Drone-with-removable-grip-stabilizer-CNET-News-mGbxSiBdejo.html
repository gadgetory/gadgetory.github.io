try and get that profile to be as small
as possible so we move the stabilizer in
front we wanted to achieve portability
in the product moving the stabilizer up
front was also important because
typically when you fly another drone
your propellers will be in view and that
will almost never happen with karma the
fact that you can fold in the landing
gear you can fold in the arms you can
put the controller in the case the
aircraft with the stabilizer it's the
Karma grip all in that case ready to go
is amazing the Karma grip has a really
cool ability to be an extension of your
camera so on the grip itself you get to
control the camera shutter buttons you
get to change camera modes you change
the stabilizers angle and you get to
power on the camera and off and then
furthermore you can take the Karma grip
and mount it into the full GoPro
ecosystem of mountains when you're out
there holding the controller it feels
amazing
it's optimized for outdoor conditions
it's super bright and it utilizes all
the same familiar gestures that you
would have on a smartphone so it's
really familiar when user picks it up
there's one button takeoff and landing
there's return-to-home that are
automatic for you press the button all
with the goal of creating this very safe
and responsible method of flying
we've got a flight simulator at the end
of this setup process that explains to
the user very simply all the things that
they need to know to fly the Karma
system has a feature called Auto Shop
hounds and that really creates this
powerful combination of the flying robot
doing some of the work and you creating
the start of the scene and the capture
the Karma controller has this great
feature called passenger app allowing
you to share your experience with a
friend it allows them to see that live
video it allows
to control the camera through their
iPhone through their tablet it allows
them to capture the shot without
actually having to worry about flying I
think everyone wants to be able to fly
and being able to control something or
see something that's flying it there's a
lot of power behind that we need to make
karma not only a flying solution but
also a handheld solution a mountable
solution basically karma needs to be
used in all the ways that our customers
use GoPro in that way karma has become
in some sense the ultimate GoPro this is
exactly what I want from a drone but the
whole thing unfolds and now you have
this aerial capture device it's
something that really blows your mind
it's magical
when you review the footage that you've
captured on Karma you just see things
that you've never seen before
the quality of content that our
customers will capture with karma I
think is going to change everything
again
now you know now you finally know what
we mean when we say karma is so much
more than a drone it's Hollywood caliber
stabilization in a backpack that you can
wear during almost any activity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
