Google issues for everything Google we
can pack inside of a show
now next week Tuesday August the second
is Samsung's big reveal for the note
seven but new leaks continue to pour out
from Android authority this time it's
the lockscreen and security settings
that shows irises as one of the options
but their disclaimer also details how
the iris scanning may not work if you're
wearing eyeglasses or sunglasses well
duh on that one or either color contact
lenses and even circular contact lenses
now if you've had LASIK eye surgery it
might not work as well and you'll need
to hold it at eye level in well-lit
conditions with all those caveats it'll
be very interesting to see how well it
actually performs now other screenshots
from this show off the s-pen air
commands and the ability to video
capture specific parts of your screen
but details of the iris scanning setup
revealed that users will be asked to
position their eyes into two circles at
a distance of 25 to 35 centimeters from
their face patently mobile uncovered the
Samsung patent that outlines how its
iris scanner works now the iris
recognition system uses three lenses to
capture the image and then checks the
iris of the user based on the image it's
generated and we'll also use images of
the user's face for additional
information right now it might not be
fast enough to replace a fingerprint
scanner but we'll see how it all plays
out and then the most important Samsung
news of the day the Samsung one font has
become the company's universal typeface
for all of its products like Apple and
Google Samsung now has their own font so
to be important in this world you need a
font like everyone's doing it well that
in Bakke Monaco in Google News Google
has lost the title as world's favorite
company to Apple but on a technicality
future brand takes the 100 largest
companies by their market cap size and
asks 3,000 consumers and industry
professionals questions and then ranks
them by what they call perception
strength and not their financial
strength Google dropped all the way to
21st overall because it's now part of
alphabet no one really knows alphabet
and people still call them Google like
even in the show number two was
Microsoft number three with Samsung and
number four was Walt Disney Google's
phone app gets a nice update that will
now warn you when you're getting
potential spam calls the incoming call
will show a red screen and label it as
suspected spam caller it's only
available for Nexus and Android one
devices right now with the latest update
on the Google Play Store
also Google Maps is getting a few visual
changes and cleaning up there look it's
subtle but Google is taken away Road
outlines which allows for a cleaner look
and it's a good thing typography for
points of interest is more
distinguishable on the map and it stands
out they've also added an orange shading
to areas of interest where there are
activities to do and a new color scheme
to help you easily differentiate between
man-made or natural features so let's be
honest it's a slower news week but this
might be my favorite story of the week
and especially for my comic book readers
on Android devices the Google Play Books
app is introducing a new feature called
bubble zoom and it's freaking cool using
Google's object recognition tech it can
now recognize speech bubbles in comics
and bubble zoom expands the speech
bubbles with a tap on your mobile device
while keeping the art exactly the same
making it easier to read even on a
tablet there are times where this comes
in handy and this really needs to be
everywhere all right that's going to do
it for this week's show you can email us
at Google issues at cnet.com or tweet me
at brian tom thanks much for watching
we'll catch you all next time for some
more of that delicious
