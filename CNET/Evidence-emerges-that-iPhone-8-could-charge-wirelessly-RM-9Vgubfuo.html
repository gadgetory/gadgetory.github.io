the first to include wireless charging
rumors have been buzzing about wireless
charging on an iphone since before the
six came out so obviously we were
skeptical but this kind of proof is hard
to overlook Apple rumor site 9to5 mac
reported that the Cupertino company is
now listed as one of the 213 members of
the wireless power consortium an
association of tech companies and
manufacturers promoting the wide market
adoption of this method is charging
companies listed on their side includes
Samsung Electronics welcome LG and as of
this week Apple Inc is listed at the top
previous rumors about the iphone 8
suggested Apple might skip wireless
charging all together until it could
incorporate a form of long range
wireless charging but this new
development suggests they're going with
the simple method of inductive charging
that Android and Windows devices have
been using for over five years in fact
Apple already uses it in the Apple watch
now don't expect to get a wireless
charger as a freebie in the box the
report also states that this would be an
added accessory that you would have to
purchase separately along with all those
audio jack adapters and with the iphone
8 reportedly costing over a thousand
dollars this year you best start saving
your pennies now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
