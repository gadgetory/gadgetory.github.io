cnet.com and right now we are taking a
first look at the brand new motorola
moto x smartphone we're at Motorola's
launch event in New York City so this
device has been long awaited it's born
out of a partnership with motorola and
google who owns the company we have a
very distinctive design you can tell
it's got a 4.7 inch AMOLED screen that's
720 resolution what's really nice though
is that it's very thin the shape of the
back is actually a very kind of a
rounded scalp shape that has little
tapered edges here on the side on each
side here that will hopefully fit in
your hand a little bit easier the back
of the phone uses a soft touch surface
here and the whole device actually is a
nano coated for some water resistance
now on back you can see there's a 10
megapixel camera it uses the clear pixel
technology which is in the droid phones
that just were announced on verizon and
what's interesting you can tell it's got
a little like dimple here where you put
your finger when you hold it it's kind
of cool on the motorola logo we've got a
sim card slot where you can put in your
sim card it's going to be available on
five carriers in the US among those will
be verizon AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and Sprint the
phone itself is going to cost 199 99 and
the other key features of the phone here
we can see it's you've got the typical
stuff like the volume very small Vaughn
control power key and you know front
facing camera on top headphone jack over
here this phone is running Android 4.2
to jellybean it's not 4.3 some of the
features that make the Moto X very
interesting is that it uses the x8
processor potentially it has what
Motorola says is 8 cores but really is
based on the dual-core 1.7 gigahertz
Qualcomm s4 pro processor that processes
information for applications and then it
also has a quad-core a dream
graphics processor and then underneath
that it's got to process there's one for
contextual computing and one that
controls you know voice recognition that
kind of stuff so as part of the this
whole Motorola touchless interface where
you will just address the phone and say
okay Google now you know please do this
please do the search will tie into
google now's service which analyzes your
voice and basically does lots of
searches and things really quickly
without you having to touch the screen
other features include the ability to
customize the phone basically you will
be able to customize a phone in
thousands of different ways and it's all
going to be handled out of a factory in
Fort Worth Texas and basically that will
enable you the customer to order your
phone and receive it within four days
that's pretty cool another interesting
feature on the Moto X is this ability
called quick capture that enables you to
take photos within two seconds so
basically if you have the phone and it's
sitting down we could just pick the
phone up like this and then twist it two
times and that immediately fires up the
camera and you can quickly fire off a
shot boom like that just by touching the
screen to reach the other kind of basic
settings and scene modes you just kind
of swipe the screen on the left side and
you've got a rotating little control
here where you can access you know
panorama mode location settings
additionally on the Moto X is a feature
called the active display so you have
the phone in your pocket or exceeding
like this on the table it uses the
ambient sensor to immediately fire up a
notification area on the lock screen so
here we go we have the notifications
here we can see who is texting us or
setting a message we can also just push
up and jump straight to that message so
we can do exactly what we need without
having to waste time messing around the
menus firing up the screen for a long
time and hopefully that also will save
your battery so there you have it folks
i'm brian bennett for cnet.com and we
just took a first look at the motorola
moto x check back soon for
