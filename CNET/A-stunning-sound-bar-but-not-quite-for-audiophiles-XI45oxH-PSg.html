today we're taking a look at the sony HT
st 7 this is a premium price sound bar
system that's selling for thirteen
hundred dollars that's a lot of money
for a sound bar but you feel like you're
getting your money's worth with the
design it looks and feels like a serious
piece of equipment with a brushed metal
cabinet and a hefty 17 pound weight it's
also a sizable unit at over 42 inches
long and over five inches high and that
height means it might end up blocking
your TV's remote sensor if you place it
on a tabletop
luckily Sony has included the ability to
add IR blasters to the back which is a
nice workaround to the problem although
you do end up with more wire clutter
hidden behind the speaker grille is a
front panel display that gives you
useful feedback when adjusting the
volume and selecting inputs the speaker
grille itself is also removable letting
you expose the drivers for a more
in-your-face style there are nine total
drivers driven by seven discreet
amplifiers and the low end is handled by
a 100 watt wireless subwoofer which
sports a 7-inch driver and a passive
radiator the included remote is a little
unusual it has a stick like shape with
angled triangular buttons that are
pretty easy to navigate by feel slide
the bottom down and you get even more
controls including the ability to tweak
the subwoofer level right on the remote
around the back of the bar are the ports
most importantly three HDMI inputs while
most sound bars rely on your TV to
switch between devices Sony gives you
the option to connect your devices
directly to the sound bar which means it
can receive full high-resolution
soundtracks like Dolby true HD and DTS
HD master audio the HDS d7 also has
built-in bluetooth with the ability to
pair with NFC up in the convenience
factor even further is the Sony's
Bluetooth standby functionality letting
you wake up the sound bar simply by
connecting via bluetooth all together it
makes the HD st7 great for casual
instant gratification listening although
some audio fidelity is lost with
Bluetooth compression
it is surprising that Sony doesn't
include airplay on this system which
doesn't suffer the same loss of audio
fidelity for this much money it feels
like you should get both the big
question with the sound bar this
expensive is how it performs well the
HDS d7 does some things remarkably well
the sound quality wasn't as impressive
as you'd want on a $1,300 system we had
resident audiophile Steve Guttenberg
give the system a listen and he was most
impressed with the sense of space the
Sony could create especially with movies
it can sound much bigger than the sound
bar itself with soundstage accuracy that
isn't common on sound bars on the other
hand the Sony doesn't have quite the
same powerful impact as some other
systems with both the less expensive
harman kardon SB 16 and the JBL SB 400
more visceral experience and on music it
sounded thinner than you'd expect
especially given the price it's not that
the Sony sounds bad but overall it
doesn't sound dramatically better than
less expensive solutions so altogether
there's no denying that Sony has set a
new standard with the HTS d7 style so
it's worth considering if you've been
searching for a great-looking sound bar
with good sound quality and are willing
to pay for it but if you're more
concerned with sound quality or value
the HDS d7 just doesn't offer enough
performance to justify its sky-high
price I'm Matthew Muscovy ak and this is
the sony HT st 7
