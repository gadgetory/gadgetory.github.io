using the most well I think the thing
that's changed my life the most in the
past 12 months is the thing called
iTunes Match the fact that iPhones are
maximum at 64 gig but you can have all
your music stored in the cloud and just
stream it to wherever you are I think
that's just a genius idea yeah we're a
tech site and everyone that just saw
that what you said is falling in love
with you they're like he knows iTunes
Match yeah I just think that my mood
swivels on a 6-pin sometimes so you
never know what tune do you want to be
listening to any one time so I choose
magic just perfect the soundtrack in my
my kimochi was live and what is your
go-to my go-to app especially when I'm
on a press tour like this is what's up
because it's the best way of staying in
contact with my friends and my family
sharing sending them you know the
pictures quickly videos texts it's the
best thing do you find that really hard
because you're so busy up to date with
what you do like your closest people in
your life up to speed with what you're
doing and so technology has transformed
that when you're working away from home
which actors we do a lot it's the best
way of staying on contact with loved
ones well I have a whatsapp name so I
could give that to you and if you feel
like you know texting me feel free
anytime you know there's a few apps I've
got I love kind of quite practical apps
so I've got an app called hug mail which
is I've just discovered which is where
you can just send a postcard with a
personal message one of your photos to
anyone I'm sure you know of it around
around the world I love that I've been
sending ridiculous postcards to all my
friends if I give you my email would you
send me a hug mail yeah why not
you just want a hug right here you don't
want a hug mail right here all right
I send you a postcard
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
