come with prescription lenses and frames
the smart headset isn't expected to
launch to the general public until the
end of this year but for the Select

twenty-five dollars and Americans with

prescription frames have been the most

early testers of glass several news
agencies are reporting that US and
British spy agencies are gathering
personal user data from smartphone apps
and games these agencies have apparently
found a way to tap into data from
popular apps including Angry Birds
google maps and facebook the data
reveals a user's age sex location and
sometimes even address books and buddy
lists location data can sometimes be
pulled from the photos you share to
social networks the unsettling news
comes from the classified documents
provided by Edward Snowden the former
National Security Agency contractor and
the news comes right as we commemorate
data privacy day how appropriate keep in
mind that many apps do collect some
information about you to send to
advertisers and it could be that the
governments are tapping to that same
pool of information Angry Birds creator

of being shared with spy agencies but it
is now going to take a closer look at
its relationships with third-party ad
networks in other news Twitter updated
its Android application to include an
option for rotating photos and cropping

recommended tweets trending topics and
suggestions of folks to follow and will
