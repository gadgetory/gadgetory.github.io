report this week a mini-computer 7
billion baht murders and android falls
apart but first it's the gadje of the
week the gadget of the week is the
cherry pal desktop it's a computer
although you'd hardly know it it's super
tiny it cost two hundred and forty nine
dollars there's no operating system and
it's got only four gigabytes of on-board
storage it's a terminal computer my
friends it's just a super cute one the
operating system is the Firefox browser
and the idea is that you buy one of
these little jobbies get on the internet
and you store all your information in
the cloud like facebook or myspace or
amazon s3 or gmail well except not
facebook so they can't be trusted but
anywhere else I love this and now for
the news according to Oh gizmodo com the
official body count for halo 3 has
surpassed the population of Earth almost
seven billion enemies have been killed
in the halo verse while the world
population is hanging in there at
roughly six billion 705 million 66,000
871 the milestone was apparently reached
sometime last month and they say the
video game world is too violent I mean
what's a little virtual annihilation of
the human race it's just for fun
analysts are starting to wonder whether
Android the big open source mobile
software platform headed by Google is
falling apart word has it that Google is
spending so much time getting t-mobile's
Android device done by the fourth
quarter that sprint won't get a phone
out this year plus developers are
starting to revolt over what they see is
poor communication and a lack of
openness in the super open standards
project trouble in Android land um yes
why because Google is like a
five-year-old with a billion-dollar
allowance I want a video sharing site I
want to do an office suite I want to do
VoIP I want to go to Mars I want to
build cell phones wait you now I want to
go to Mars on a robot Teletubby and then
the cell phone industry is like mean
parents with lots of rules because they
secretly rather die then allow totally
open devices on their networks that run
any old application or service that they
don't get to charge for and me
while the developers are like out of
control monkeys who are thinking I can
build any app I want that does anything
on a cell phone okay this one is going
to remote control satellites up in space
while video conferencing with the
Norwegian Lyon babies and it's also
going to write term papers using an
advanced algorithm that makes it sound
like a kid wrote it oh yeah the
interface will be super simple though
recipe for disaster am I the only one
who saw this coming really and finally
let's have a look at what's clogging the
tubes this week it's the culmination of
the where the hell is Matt adventure
this guy's been traveling around to
different places doing a little dance
since like 2006 with corporate
sponsorship and last year his sponsor
set him around the world to the dance
with other people the final video went
up on YouTube about this time last month
and I dare you not to watch it and just
like maybe cheer up a little bit
it's just that song so good and all
those people look so happy you shut up
you just watch the whole thing you're
gonna cry you'll see I'm Molly wooden
this has been the buzzer board thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
