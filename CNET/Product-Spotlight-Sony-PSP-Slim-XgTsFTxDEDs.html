like playing a console at home i'm brian
tom from cnet.com and today we've got
the light shining on the latest sony
playstation portable the PSP slim is the
lighter slimmer and sleeker update of
the original PSP that's packed with
features galore let's check out the
design it's 19% thinner than the
original and one-third lighter owners of
the older PSP will feel the difference
immediately but what's the first thing
you notice it's got a huge 4.3 inch
screen that dominates the device and
everyone familiar with the playstation
control layout will feel right at home
the PSP also has the best graphics for a
gaming portable hands-down it's really
like having a playstation 2 in your
hands there are plenty of killer titles
like Final Fantasy 7 Crisis Core and the
innovative pot upon's but the PSP tends
to cater to a more hardcore gamer this
is a gaming machine but what makes it
unique is all the other stuff it can do
there's a ton so we'll try to get
through most of it the PSP is a solid
music player it supports dm3 mp3s wma
WAV AAC and 8-track 3 files and album
art too it also can display JPEG gifs
and tips for photo viewing there's no
surprise that the PSP supports video
playback you can purchase UMD video
discs but that never caught on because
they're only for the PSP and selection
is limited you can convert your own
video onto the memory stick duo card or
even use the TiVo to go software to
convert recorded shows for viewing on
the PSP you can also stream live TV
using Sony's location free TV device
it's like their take on the Slingbox now
how about some Internet features that
take advantage of the PSP's Wi-Fi
there's the Remote Play feature that
allows the PSP to turn your ps3 on or
off remotely and stream its media
content there's a built-in web browser
that's decent and it's at least better
than most cell phone browsers you have
the ability to make Skype calls and you
have access to over 22,000 internet
radio stations now Sony continues to
release firmware updates and each one is
brought even more features so I don't
see that changing and it's a constantly
improving device so what do we still
want to see improved on the hardware
side the screen is great but it's still
a plastic surface and it scratches
pretty easily - scratch a few days after
throwing it into my bag
so you guys got to protect yours there's
also video output on the latest PSP
through the new AV jack on the bottom
here and it's a great feature and video
content can support the full DVD level
resolution but games only output at the
PS PS locked in native 480 by 272 res
I'm hoping a firmware update will fix
that in the future now game load times
could be better and they've improved and
I know it's the nature of the UMD format
but I wish they were faster battery life
could be better - sure it's a big screen
but I got about 4 hours of gameplay
before I have to go for recharge I
probably noticed it a lot more because
the crazy battery life on the DS Lite
and a personal wish I wish it had 2
analog controllers instead of just one
if they want us to play first-person
shooter the right way that's the way to
do it it could also really open up some
new types of gameplay
I'm Brian Tom for cnet.com and the sony
playstation portable is not only a great
gaming portable but it's a multimedia
machine with features that take it
beyond gaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
