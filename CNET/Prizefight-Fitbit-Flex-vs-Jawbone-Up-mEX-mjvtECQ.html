and wearable tech is here to stay tor
bringing you the cream of the crop in
surprise five punch-out between the fit
products and the job bone rare our
judges for this fight are senior editor
Brian
boom-boom Bennet and myself railing a
dating column now we'll take both judges
blind scores and average the mounts in
the nearest tenth each round the final
prize fight score will be an average of
all rounds using the same decimal system
it's four rounds to the finish first one
is designed the Fitbit flex brings on a
new design with its first wristband and
a tiny pebble that fits inside but
charges separately it's light and
compact and it's five LED indicator
lights show you how close you are to
your goal with a DoubleTap it's not the
easiest wristband to put on and it can
really be a pain to secure it sometimes
now the jawbone up brings the most
unique and stylish fitness wristband
with multiple colors and a unique design
element it's real easy to put on since
its molded to fit on your wrist with
metal accents but it's a little more
rigid and slightly less comfortable it
also has a single LED display that shows
whether you're active or sleeping now
the eyes don't lie and the jawbone up
takes this round with the poor and the
Fitbit flex gets a three next round is
features
the Fitbit flexes major distinguishing
feature is it's Bluetooth syncing that
works flawlessly but phone owners will
need either iPhones galaxy s3s fours or
galaxy note phones to use it now if not
you'll also be able to sync it to your
Mac or PC sleep mode is a must-have
feature but it can be difficult to
activate since you have to tap the Flex
six times at a specific tempo to
activate the mode it takes several tries
in I still haven't mastered it now
fitbit's app may not be the prettiest
looking one but it packs better
goal-setting and data entry it's
compatible with their Fitbit Aria scale
and its food calorie counter database is
more robust as well now the jawbone up
brings no wireless syncing capability
and is said you'll need to physically
connect it through the headphone jack
every time to sync your data when you
have to do it multiple times it becomes
a hassle and a pain in the butt but it's
not a product killer now the up app is
hands-down the best looking fitness app
with its bright colored graphs and
displays and it's organized in a cleaner
way the only issue is that you can only
view your data through the phone app and
there's no way to view it on your
computer at home the up sleep mode is
super easy to get into with just holding
down the physical button at the end of
the wristband and that's what you want
to do before you go to sleep both
wristbands are water-resistant and the
data collected can also be synced to
other fitness apps to track the Fitbit
flex takes this round with the 4 and the
jawbone up gets a 3 so after averaging 2
rounds we're tied round 3 is data it's
all about the data and these 2 fitness
bands I like the number of steps you've
taken calories burned distance covered
and the quality of your sleep it's
really a push here oh there go those
charts again now the Fitbit also offers
a premium service that's a deeper dive
for $49.99 a year and that gives you
even more advanced data analysis and
overall better goals
it's close but the Fitbit flex gets the
edge here with the four and the jawbone
gets a 3.5 we've got one more round left
to go the final round that decides it
all ends value the Fitbit flex retails
for $99.99 and it's a solid price
compared to its competitors with
Bluetooth syncing really being the
killer feature here now the jungle up
retails for 129 and it still brings
everything you expect but it feels like
you're paying a little more for its
unique styling especially without
Bluetooth so when you add it all up the
Fitbit flex offers you more bang for
your buck and we're giving it a 4 and
the jawbone up gets a 3 so let's average
out all four rounds and a prize fight
that went neck-and-neck Fitbit flex push
a little harder in the end taking this
prize fight three point eight to three
point four and is your prize fight
winner you can really go either way on
this prize fight but these are the top
two fitness bands that bring you data
you can really use instead of some
calculated number called
fuel it really doesn't wrap anything
specific
I'm Brian Cho thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time for another
prizefight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
