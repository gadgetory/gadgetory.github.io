be good no but it might make a good
coffee maker that much better the 329
dollar be more connected coffee brewer
has useful smart abilities that have
been grafted onto the body of a quality
drip coffeemaker built on be Moore's
excellent brazen plus coffeemaker this
machine is all about control you can
adjust the brew temps and pre-soak times
and it carries scaa certification but
those are all features the brazen plus
offered and this connected version
simply removes them from the display and
puts them on your phone for example you
can select the amount of coffee the type
of coffee and the length of pre-soak
right from the phone bmore hopes that
this will make the machine easier to use
because the machines display is in
effect the screen on your smartphone you
won't have to deal with small lcds or
tiny buttons in practice I found it to
be useful but a bit wonky sometimes the
app would lose connection and alerts
sometimes arrive late you can't even
schedule the machine to brew at a
certain time like when you wake up in
the morning that's a pretty basic
function and it's sorely missed still
the machine makes great coffee and some
of the apps features are useful like
advice for pre-soak times and bring
temperatures that will match your coffee
type so if you really want a coffee
maker that can brew quality drip with
some app connected abilities this is the
machine for you for sheer performance
and speed choose a techna for mocha
master or bonavita a 1900 instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
