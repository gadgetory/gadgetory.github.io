is episode 360 one of the 359 podcast my
name is BVG and your host today are
alfred Inge and Bridget Carey what's up
guys Apple heavy show today we have
rumors about three new lines of iPhone
tens or iPhone X's whatever you want to
call them and you know report came out
yesterday which was confirmed today that
Apple is starting its own health care
unit or whatever word they have but it's
only for Apple employees but you know
just taking a look into what that is and
what that entails so hang out everybody
we are going to record our form an audio
podcast and when we come back we're
gonna take your questions and comments
in the chat we hope they're good so
we'll be back in 3 minutes and 59
seconds from 3 to welcome to the 359 I'm
Alfred Inge and I'm Bridgette Gary Apple
is rumored to be dropping three new
iPhones this year which I like to call
the three bears of iPhones there's gonna
be the largest iPhone 10-1 that's an
upgrade to the current model and then a
third cheaper one so the really big one
is going to be the size of the iPhone 8
plus but it'll have this screen size so
it'll be like completely there of the
iPhone 10 so yeah that rounds out to
about 6.5 inches the cheaper one there
making it cheaper by not giving it like
stainless steel on the back it's
supposed to have like an LCD display
aluminum edges and a glass back I mean I
to me this feels very like unlike Apple
right like their major selling point was
always like simplicity like here's the
iPhone you'll like it and if you don't
you have no other choice yeah but last
time it was here's the new iPhone $1,000
or more and now maybe you can still have
all the cool inside features and I can
do all the cool photo tricks but if you
don't care about it being like the best
outside material you have another option
there ought to see how that works out I
mean the 5c I remember that still in
that and that wasn't - yeah oh that was
almost gonna be my first iPhone for a
while and then I looked at like the
processor and all the stuff is I don't
I wanna do this but I do applaud Apple
for you know choosing to go for whatever
the cheaper choice is here if as our
listeners know I'm like very very like
frugal about this kind of stuff I'm
curious to see how much like the cheaper
one will be like like does the stainless
steel back like really cost them that
much more no it's probably gonna be the
same like starting price as your iPhone
8 you know and then just you know with
that happening I wonder what that means
for the iPhone like 9 line or whatever
if if the 10 is supposed to still be
this like premium model like what's
gonna happen with them are they what are
they also gonna come out with like three
different like iPhone nines or anything
like all them numbers there you go we
need to go to X let's embrace the X and
like you said let's make it extra large
yeah so like X I'm like x1 they should
have called it at the rumored name is
supposed to be iPhone 10 plus which know
if you have an X just make it extra
large let's just just do that so you
know speaking of Apple and more options
there's a report from CNBC that Apple is
launching its own healthcare service
it's called AC wellness which they
quietly launched a website for in
December right now it's only available
for Apple employees and it's expected to
launch this spring you say the Apple
employees at the headquarters in
Cupertino because they have worldwide
like a hundred and twenty-three thousand
employees at stores no this is not for
like all the store employees yeah
imagine being like a genius employee in
New York and then like flying all the
way out to see your doctor in Cupertino
because that's where the two clinics are
you can FaceTime Oh God we'll just check
what your pulse is like on your Apple
watch just tell us your ID they're not
the first to like get into the
healthcare business you know we saw this
last month with Amazon working with
JPMorgan Chase and the Berkshire
Hathaway group going how can these tech
companies go hmmm let's put our smarts
together this put her money and check
together and find a cheaper way to
tackle healthcare for our employees
internally so by having two centers one
on the campus and one near the campus
you know they're able to kind of test
the waters here they're hiring doctors
they're hiring people to create healthy
lifestyle environments but to me I go I
look at this and go home you just got
okay there's 12,000 employees on campus
you just got a bunch of test subjects
for your next healthcare yeah that's
what I was wondering like do you think
this is more like a guinea pig thing
you know they're gonna be unleashing
this on everyone else once it's like oh
here's what worth with our own staffers
and here's what did and we're very sorry
about that by the way yeah I would hate
to be the one where a test goes wrong
right yeah I mean I'm just wondering the
like is this generally gonna be our
future like I feel like it's not enough
that like tech companies know everything
about our social lives or businesses you
know who we talk to on a day-to-day
basis now it's like oh we also know it
like your blood pressure level and all
this stuff - yeah it's easy for them to
make health care cheaper but right what
about us do you Facebook really poking
you I don't know yeah so you know that's
all the time we have for our show today
if you liked what you heard check us out
on CNET I'm Alfred Dean I'm Bridget Gary
thanks for listening
I miss Ben's a cappella version of our
end theme that was me that did the a
cappella oh yeah I'm always my eyes are
on the screen and I'm not paying
attention if it isn't I just assume that
it's Ben we both have a very similar
singing voice I'm curious as what's
going to happen with Apple branding at
this point I just Apple heart it's
frivolous titling as far as the iPhone X
plus xx LS read like what's what's
coming next down the pipeline just fancy
and just go with X - the best thing to
do have you say so or you could be like
Kingdom Hearts I'm like my square enix
like velocity right now whether it's
like Kingdom Hearts where it's like ten
and a half birth by dreams or something
like all right everybody thanks for
hanging out and joining us for the
recording of today's podcast which you
can subscribe to anywhere you subscribe
to podcasts let's take some questions
from the chat first up sir enjoy first
we had lots of beauty and health
products at CES very astute now Apple
health care will 2018 start a new branch
of health tech well more like these tech
companies probably just just want more
places to test it and then to and to
figure out ways to gather your data more
cuz like sure more places of surface
their brand right you have all these
gadgets that can measure this and
measure that but how can you make it so
it makes sense yeah Tim Tim Cook I feel
like at every Apple Keynote has all
talked about like hey check out this
Apple watch that we're coming out with
by the way I got this letter from
somebody that used an Apple watch that
talks about how it like saved their
lives by their lie by like detecting of
their heartbeat was like off pace and
then they were able to alert somebody
and the right time I'm like oh yeah I'm
sure everyone uses their Apple watches
for that yeah you know i phone saves my
life and doesn't save lives though when
you're texting and walking fall into a
ditch wait people use the Apple watch
yeah apparently it's actually it's
actually the most sold watch like in the
world like high-end wise like it like so
that like beeped out like Rolex and
sales which I know people aren't going
out every day I'm buying Rolexes but
like still the with with with all of the
stress that my constant checking of my
phone has given me I'm so glad they're
looking into my health now and to make
the circle complete yeah they actually
have physicians that like check for like
your neck damages for Mike staring down
their neck is real people look at my
story on seeing it was an experience but
back to some Joy's question though yeah
health tech is definitely like an
emerging field our reporter or Brar al
he is has actually been reportedly
extensively on that have you seen that
thing Scott Stein's walking around
wearing in the office lately because
there's always something he's doing this
scan is yeah vitals guy last week he had
a headset kind of thing that's supposed
to like reduce your stress levels I
think he's writing a story about it have
you seen it who's up Scott it was one
thing there's a photo of it on Twitter
that like that has been like making the
rounds for a bit I don't want to pull it
up right now but yeah I mean that's one
of those things to where it's like hey
you but part of me is like concerned
though that there's a lot of like tech
like snake oil salesmen kind of thing
there was a the story in the New York
Times yesterday called like about
digital phenotypes or whatever which it
was like it's these like physicians and
and psychiatrists that like try to see
if you're depressed based on like your
social media habits which is really
really weird it's like something oh you
you haven't talked to your friends as
much as you used to like are you
depressed and if anything it could be
healthier by not looking at a screen
that was don't know that that was one of
the counter-arguments though that was
basically saying like no maybe like I
went on camp
trip or something that's not really
don't use that as an indicator of how I
feel so much of that movie this circle
is let's go back into the chat Michael
Brown says I think a phone of the 6.5
inch screen is crazy big I agree with
you Michael that's too big for my tastes
but since we are here with this 6.5 inch
screen do you think at WDC we'll see
some split screen features good question
hmm I don't think so from Apple not from
Apple I don't think yeah maybe they're
warming up to them maybe we'll see that
by the end of the year yeah possibly at
their next keynote because if it's
offered about if they haven't done it
for their iPads I don't really see them
doing it for their phones or thinking of
something else I thought there was some
sort of iPad weight of yeah I would
agree though that 6.5 inches is that's
kind of absurd for a phone like that's
that's literally like you know half an
inch smaller than like most like mini
tabloids jeans are not keeping up like I
can't fit my phone image in I remember
yeah I remember when tablets first came
out I I saw a dude like on the train
using like one of the smaller ones like
a 7-inch one like as a phone and I just
like kept laughing and like what an
idiot he looked like but now that like
there's gonna be a 6.5 inch like phone
it's just oh I'm the idiot I'm the idiot
well that's you know supposed to put it
to your ear if you have you know ear
pods that's that's the solution people
buy more to look cooler the question of
the day of course is coming from I'm
gonna try say racy
I'm sorry as always if I'm
mispronouncing your name well we ever
seen any mind-blowing innovations coming
from Apple in the near future now isn't
that just the ongoing question for the
last couple of years has Apple actually
blown your mind as of late I'm going to
go out in the limb here and say not so
much my mind has always been blown not
by what Apple has done but by how much
people are willing to buy into it like I
think when earpods first came out I
thought this is ridiculous these are
just Bluetooth headphones and yeah my
mind has been blown by you know me
walking around on the train and seeing
all these people with it I was like
that's are you kidding me kind of thing
but you can attribute that to the
introduction 10 years ago not to I any
current developments in Apple it's the
sheer fact that it got so ingrained in
society ten years ago but yeah even like
iPads - I remember when iPads came out
and everyone was making fun of it just
saying like this is just a big iPhone
and there's like there ever that's like
that's most of the ways of my mind
herbal is blown not by the products
themselves but by like how many people
like adopt them well why is it I don't
know about you but I feel like Amazon's
more interesting lately because they
have more motivation to try some crazy
stunts yeah I mean they have a different
goal than Apple Apple wants you to buy
products Amazon to buy things that they
sell on their website you know so it's a
different beast but still like yeah
they've been throwing a lot of stuff at
the wall I I was just thinking about
this the other day when I was getting
dressed I do you remember the the Amazon
look yeah yeah hey we'll rate like how
well you dressed like oh no one uses
that now so yeah that's Amazon is
definitely throwing a lot more at the
wall because they're trying to establish
themselves as more like we have our own
products - not we're not just like a
marketplace kind of thing for other for
you to buy like cat food to get here in
two days I think the real innovation is
gonna be thinking about screens
differently because what does Apple care
what what I guess content Facebook has
they they want to deliver things in a
product I can buy yeah I think people
are hungry for something that isn't so
addictive on a phone so what do they
care
I guess what's in it they can they can
think differently about how we're
getting our information Andy and the
chat says I think the air pods are great
I would argue that that's more one of
the better up there type innovations
apples had in a while but I just don't
think that with groundbreaking them and
we've seen wireless headphones before
maybe Apple accelerated them into the
mainstream yeah you separated yeah it's
rather than the connected by cable it is
right now the highest rather say that
the most popular wireless headphone
helped to take off I read some statistic
that 80% or so of the money being spent
on wireless headphones is going to air
pods yeah that's awesome yeah it's the
same thing smartwatches - like I'd say
like higher than 80% of the money going
to smartwatches going to right like the
Apple SmartWatch and yet they can't get
iTunes right I would just like a nice
easy way to make my
NSYNC Thanks iTunes was right like eight
years ago it was fantastic I'm gonna but
yeah I'm not I'm not disparaging
anything from like the air pot itself I
actually think they're like a really
nice pair of bluetooth headphones the
microphone on it is like one of the few
that like actually works even though it
doesn't have like the microphone right
in front of your face yeah like it picks
up the audio really well I was impressed
at the reception on the microphone too
but again it's not really that
innovative that's my point I wasn't
polishing the fine tuning and yeah that
has to happen from time to time they
have not blown her mind in a while face
ID I will say did like blow my mind for
a little bit just because like of how
much better it is than like any other
facial recognition like biometric out
there
yeah like the fact that like it actually
does a 3d scan of your face and like you
know they I'm pretty sure they
originally put that in for an emoji yeah
and oh wait like this is also the thing
that we can do still astonished - an
emoji such a sell point these days I
like this comment from Gopal says Apple
is a stronger lifestyle brand than tech
brand lifestyle healthcare yeah exactly
it's all aspects of your life yeah for
sure it's definitely an aesthetic more
than it is like like people that are
buying Apple products aren't exactly
looking into it as like I need you know
like this much RAM and Papa blah it's
more so like they know what they're
getting and they it's it's yeah it's
like a status symbol at this point can
they solve problems or they just wait to
do it stylish Lee you know
yeah definitely so yes that was like a
big like selling point for that mm-hmm
coming in from Balwinder and MP Cody
asking about the potential for the Apple
healthcare to come to the public but
winders specifically has this Apple
testing this on the employees in hopes
to roll it out to customers and I MP
Cody's wondering if it there is any kind
of date or potential for this to see
public eye I think the the where it's
going is when you have a company like
Apple like Amazon with all this money
where they can do their own investment
of like fixing their own their own
employees healthcare just to cut down
costs internally you're gonna see other
companies maybe mimic that model so
it'll affect you if you happen to work
at a larger company where they maybe can
like you know take those ideas but I
don't think they're going to
I mean gosh can be so weird to like have
Apple doctors yeah I'm also saying oh my
god and an apple a day keeps the doctor
in the office there's some joke in there
I am interested to see how this will
affect like if I'm an Apple employer
like how does this affect my health plan
like am i paying less for like if you
have to pay more for Apple health care
which wouldn't surprise me at all
I've wondered like just essentially like
would you be allowed to get go out of
like Apple care or something like
probably option yeah but then again they
really want all those testers yeah next
watch it'd be so great if you can come
by and sign this NDA on this new thing
we're trying out yeah yeah I'm not sure
if they're I like I feel like the end
goal would have to be for this to go
public like you know oh you can sign up
for this now kind of thing but at the
same time there are so many hoops that
they would have to jump through to get
this like out in the world for everybody
of that yeah the motivation isn't to go
through more stress to make it for
everyone look at Amazon what's their
motivation hmm they got into grocery
stores maybe they can get into your
pharmacy degree you know so there's
always another motivation to behind it
like if there's two layers Brigitte you
were talking earlier about other
companies who have kind of gone down
this path
who else has like maybe in brief detail
have we seen go down the healthcare path
well you know Google in the alphabet
know line up they're trying to tackle
some some ideas like oh how can we stop
death you know you know those really big
questions I don't
what is this Star Wars Episode three
yeah basically oh god one that they
would the Jedi would tell you yeah have
you heard the tale of dark Plagueis the
wise know so I don't be surprised I
think this is a new idea though and and
and I think we have folks like Google
thinking oh how can we solve weird
problems like self-driving cars and
health and different and different
spin-offs and this is Apple you know you
know okay I am interested to see what
like tech they're like talking about
implementing in this just because I'm
like that's why I'm saying there's gonna
be a lot of Hoops for them to jump to if
they try making this public I think it's
more about saving
because like so anytime I met a doctor's
like and this is like with my dentist
and my vet to where I get very paranoid
when I see that all their computers are
still running like Windows XP and all
this stuff I'm like oh my god all my
information is on here somebody's
definitely stealing this it's it's one
of the big factors it's too expensive to
upgrade for a lot of these companies
yeah Michael Browns asking why do you
think Apple is so ingrained in the US
culture how much time do you have I got
the easy answer US citizens will throw
money at silly things present company
included yeah cool right yeah I mean I
don't know that I think they spend a lot
of time on advertising and they spend a
lot more time on like presentation than
other companies do and this goes like
all the way back I think like for a
while like you know caring about
computers is very much as like this like
really like nervy like thing you know
like and then and then you know I think
Apple is like done and like a very good
job to like bring it to the forefront as
like Oh literally everybody uses
computers like this is not like a nerdy
thing and I think they've done like a
really good job at like presenting it
and like that way I hear you there I
like this concept here from Scott might
again maybe healthcare is way for Apple
to collect a user data as it doesn't
gather much user data of like the likes
of Google is this meant to just gonna be
a small-scale petri dish I wouldn't I
wouldn't see it that way I mean for one
it only be their own employees I don't
think they need to collect user data
about their own staffers but it's a way
to test what they want to do next in
like your phone that's coming to you
yeah like all right we're gonna have a
new iOS that will Trek XYZ I would also
make the argument that Apple has never
really sold itself on like user data or
like user information like Google does
that a lot and because it's like at its
core it's like an ad company but Apple
has always been more about the product
yeah yeah like these are really good
phones we don't really care about your
data
I mean Amazon like is it this is the
same thing as Google where it's like
they're collecting your data because
they needed to improve like their sales
but like with like even with like Siri
which is able to collect all your voice
data like it doesn't like in anonymizes
it so it's like they're not really doing
anything like with your day
yeah it's always been more about like
their products but if they can have an
ecosystem where they can maybe do some
good and have make sure every doctor
around the country wants to have the
same thing now suddenly doctors are
buying their gadgets and and the
third-party people who make the things
that track your heart and your polls and
love them suddenly now you have to have
an Apple product right because all these
doctors you have and outside of Apple
all use it so we are almost out of time
but let's bury ourselves in speculation
first with the forthcoming tentative
iPhone x2 electric boogaloo do we have
any inspiration or any any indication
that's the right word about cost and
timing especially for hi-hi Terrace and
chunks during the chat chunk stirs
really wanting to know if he should wait
it out if it's gonna be worth the money
I say it's always worth taking a couple
extra minutes taking a step back doing
your homework and research waiting
because ten to one even if you end up
not liking that new model you get a
discount on the old model well then I'm
gonna be an old model this year that was
another story like the iPhone 10 that's
out right now I almost said x10 that's
out right now they may not sell that
exact same one for cheaper instead this
third or this middle one because there's
three of them right this new one will be
an upgrade to the ten and they might
just not offer yes III wrote that rumor
so yeah the idea is that they would be
afraid that the current iPhone 10 now
would take away from sales from like the
one that they're making the upgrade for
because really it's not all that
different to begin with there so there's
nothing on speculation as far as like
price or anything like that goes but I
would assume like release date this year
yeah rumor is all it's all suppose for
this year will probably be like after
Labor Day when they like around
September whenever they do they're big
like here's our new iPhone like event so
but there's also like the mid-year like
like release that they usually do around
July that's when they drop the SE in uh
2016 oh you think they're gonna separate
it no way i I've also read a lot of
rumors about like a new and upgraded se
so it's literally just gonna look the
exact same thing but like the process
is gonna be like up-to-date we kind of
light phones in the fall I think we
probably get six if it's like beyond the
exelon at least yes he won't rip the
pocket out of your pants all right let's
talk WD see real quick to close things
out
Josh boy de what Nokia smartphones will
be coming to the u.s.
yeah the 8110 yes but this is this is
actually a story that's on our front
page right now the only phone that's
from Nokia that's coming to the US is
the Nokia 6kt Collins has the story on
it on our front page is literally the
nokia sake so you're not gonna be
getting any of their like retro phones
for a bit from enjoy as bezels are
coming down to zero we need to shuffle
our phones to reach top and bottom of
the screen will these shifts in center
of gravity pose a problem actually I was
thinking about this yesterday actually
is a thought that did not occur to me I
actually think it will and I think that
because like it's gonna be harder to
grab your screen I think you know the
like really annoying phone cases that
are barely cases one is it just like a
stupid pop socket thing you know yeah
like that's gonna be really popular and
then the ones that's just like a hook
kind of thing it's like it looks like a
like a bottle like tab open Herta thing
and it's just like there on the back of
your phone and you put like your thumb
through and you're just hold it that way
oh yeah yeah I know what you're talking
about I do like those like I've seen
something like a ring yeah yeah I hate
all of those I also think that because
like people are gonna be less inclined
to like hold their screens because
there's no bezel like is probably gonna
be like much more popular like because
you know what they should do is just
make the back of the phone like really
sticky now so that you don't have to
really grip it's already gross enough I
don't need them to be sticky too but I
just imagine what's gonna come out of
your pocket I do like that idea there
was that prototype at MWC where the
selfie camera cuz you can't have on the
front yeah it just pops up like a
toaster bespeaks out on the top actually
did like that just for like privacy
purposes like there's not a camera like
always all the time they know of yeah I
would love to see some kind of like
add-on peripheral so like you have to
eat a magnetized glove to hold on to
your phone an Apple charges you $80 for
it
accessory yeah Apple glue uncle glove
and then all the doctors wear it to
recharge the glove like absolutely of
course you would
why wouldn't the that Club just be
the phone I mean you can do this too
because then you could because then they
couldn't charge you extra all right and
the closings out from James Cook hi
Bridget what do you think about Sony's
comeback Sony's comeback
oh you mean like that venom looks sick
but yeah like I really know is about
there i Bodog and I think that's fun
yeah that was fun though I would I
wouldn't call it a comeback just yet
don't call it a comeback they've been
here for years um no but I haven't been
volley neither oh yeah I think I think
you might be going soon so I don't know
but yeah I mean like they announced like
two new phones at MWC I don't know how
many people are interested in it to be
honest if you get yeah if you want to
let me know why you think it's like a
big comeback for them I think I think
