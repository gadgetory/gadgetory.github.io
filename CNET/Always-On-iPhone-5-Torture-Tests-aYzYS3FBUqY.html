for less than two hours and over the
objections of many in this building
we're starting our torture test it's
going in the freezer for two hours
all righty good luck
bye little buddy spilled even more wrong
than usual there have been several CNET
rescue attempts but we managed to keep
the iPhone 5 in here for the full two
hours let's see how it's doing right
the bigger screen shows the how diddy
the crystal pattern is it's my favorite
part
alright see nice and iced over well
screen comes on no problem perfectly
responsive look at that little a6
processor not fazed at all by the goal
and look actually unlike the iPhone 4s
the cold did not drain the battery at
all and went in almost full and it's
still almost full
our iPhone 5 came through the cold test
with no problem let's see how it handles
the heat test a little change in the
heat test we've decided in the interest
of all of that plastic very close to
heat sources we're going to try wrapping
these in a towel so that we get a lot of
heat but maybe not so much melting all
right so wrap it up you may remember we
did this with our iPad back in season 1
okay let's put our little look it looks
like kind of like bread dough
200 degrees 1 hour
sounds like our iPhone is cooked let's
make that stop all right and see how
it's doing okay
extremely hot to the touch as well try
to turn it on ooh yep we have our
temperature warning fo needs to cool
down before you can use it so that's
such good feedback so we will indeed let
it cool down and then we'll try to use
it we let our iPhone 5 cool for about 15
minutes it's a little warm to the touch
but otherwise seems fine let's see if
our temperature warning is gone oh yeah
performance seems unaffected still is a
crazy fast all right
and we think seems to be working just
fine Hiep test not a problem
let's see what happens if say we're
sitting outside and we accidentally
shuffle Puckett across the concrete it
happens now let's see how bad it got Wow
I think even some of the glasses chipped
right yeah
oh I could actually get a little cut
right here you're gonna need a case
iPhone 5 is already a little dinged up
but it is time for the drop test again
so light so easy to just sort of lose
track of while I'm at the playground oh
no Abbi
the concrete we have some ship being on
the front we've actually cracked the
glass on the back it could have been
already in a weakened condition but that
was only one drop but I think we need to
keep dropping it
how about shoulder height okay looks
like no more problems
one more ear height if you only looked
at it from the front you would say this
bone is amazing it's this view that's
the problem
now let's see if the actual phone is
still functional comes on looks like we
don't have any screen damage like we did
with the 4s so the phone is still
functional but I think with a cracked
back we're gonna have to call this one a
fail
still functional after the drop despite
the cracks let's see how the iPhone 5
handles water oh no I dropped it in the
toilet ah this is the part where I
overcome my fear of germs screen still
on by the way very similar to our iPhone
4s bubbling probably get it out a little
faster than that if you really drop
yours in the toilet but this is one
thing that's pretty amazing about the
iPhone actually both the 4s and the 5
now really not very affected by water
the screen stays on there's no evidence
of immediate shorting and that's with
some pretty severe damage on the back
that could let some water in just to be
on the safe side I'm going to power it
all the way down put it in our rice bag
all the way off of course I cannot take
the back off or the battery out to make
sure we really get drying on the insides
but it's not really acting like it has
water on the inside check on you later
let's see how our iPhone 5 did with the
water test we've had it in a bag of rice
for about 36 hours just to be safe now
you remember it was on when it came out
of the fish tank but sometimes the water
sinks in a little later we did a little
charging but I don't know how it's doing
oh it's on screen seems perfectly
responsive it's doing its thing that is
pretty impressive just like the iPhone
4s this one has no problem with a short
dip in a pool which is good news for a
lot of you now I do also want to revisit
the drop test at the end when I was a
little bit shocked by all the damage
that we had caused by dropping this
tongue I declared it a failure
but on second thought I think I have to
take that back I mean it's totally
functional if you put a case on the back
you'd still be perfectly happy to have
it so on second thought it's a pack
overall I'd say the iPhone 5 is very
tough but also not that tough compared
to the Samsung Galaxy s3 which went
through all the same tests this
obviously came out pretty damaged and
our s3 had no scratches at all that said
any phone that can take a dunk and still
come out working fine is one that you're
gonna feel confident with I would just
say get yourself a case if you don't
want to get a case this might not be the
phone for you and I do want to issue a
little bit of a warning because this is
my personal phone which I've now had for
five days and the front the front glass
is covered in scratches just from
carrying it in my purse if you are the
kind of person who really prefers to
have a phone without a case I recommend
thinking twice about iPhone 5 although I
am going to take this one back to the
store and see what they say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
