experiencing the crave podcast I'm
Donald L i'm eric franklin i'm ready for
the experience if you get warmed up I'm
already crying though our pre-show
spandex conversation um Bonnie chaozhou
twith us today she's blogging from home
but she's with this fair enough come on
bear with us we'll get through this
together all of us all of us together so
say we all what she might be playing
around with right now from the comfort
of our home is the cria scope she might
be this is a out at a weather
forecasting device that uses half thick
technology to translate tomorrow's
forecast into a temperature that you can
reach out and feel with your hand on
this aluminum cube okay all right all
right yeah I can see where this could be
useful you know it's like how hot
exactly is gonna be tomorrow like 70
degrees means nothing to me right or and
I don't know what that means you have no
frame of reference I've never even been
in 70 degree weather numbers hurt my
brain yes how just let me feel it up
yeah I want to feel things up I don't
like thinking about numbers it is what
I'm saying uh so so you touch that thing
yeah okay told you manicured fingernails
right and it gives you a sense of what
the temperature is going to be like
Isaac and of course you know like any
good project that we talked about on
crave it's ultimately powered by an
Arduino interface of course because you
like saying the word Arduino Arduino yep
and you know it's my only no aboard you
special um so get hot or cold also has a
little LED light on the bottom to
indicate either through like red or blue
this is me cold yeah they know you have
to touch you just kind of look at the
glow on so when it's 100 degrees out
there so is that piece of metal getting
up to a hundred degrees is that let's
cook an egg on that Oh freezing some ice
or freezing tonight
right uh-huh but yeah I'm ething in the
event of Armageddon could probably send
your fingers off right so so when
tomorrow comes you know what to wear
right basically you have to go outside
or use any kind of judgment two reasons
moments two reasons I like this one is
that it it's another way to kind of trip
beyond the the screen or a number it's a
way to translate outside information
into something in the home that you can
kind of interact with right all right
second reason is it's another one of
these little tiny dedicated cube-like
devices that we would have now a row of
in our home like the little Molly
dragonball spitting device the low
printer thing the little printer thing
and now this thing right all translating
the world's information into our homes
through these adorable little cubes yeah
the future is in cubes should I invest
in cubes is what you're saying cubes in
and Arduino Arduino ology yeah that's it
there you go yeah that's the secret of
Donald success gives in to check it out
it's a it's a concept right now but it's
pretty interesting another one another
kind of a naught cube this is a pig
shaped thing is also something Bonnie's
probably playing with it home right now
it could be she's lucky um Kissinger all
right and we talked about trans global
kiss devices before the one we talked
about before is like you put it like
yeah there's like a little tongue
control yeah you french-kissed over the
yeah yeah I remember that oh we're gonna
get this one in here this one's a little
bit more lip based well that's kind of
so the outlet the outside of your mouth
doesn't get violated or the inside of
your mouth doesn't you violated just
that you know that that kiss started off
is a little bit hot went on a little too
long yeah i gotta say just like pressing
your lips that long not hot little bit
i'm just kind of cool
yeah i'm not i'm not as told about this
i think it needs to be square i think
all these things need to be q like yeah
if this was cube like it'd be kind of
cooler it'd be cooler much hotter well
things are getting weird now so i think
it it uses like a little motor to
vibrate the lips and translate that yeah
to take a little lengthened and the fart
sounds are great yeah that's if there's
something that says sexy it's a little
flaps of skin being blown by that could
be an issue of technique because I I
kind of do that when I kiss I do you you
just raspberry your wife no it's not
gently romantically yeah sure there's
there's love behind that behind that
that lip vibration hmm well they say I'm
sure there's alternate uses for this
device speaking of reading lips um yeah
so this is not again it's not on sales
another concept but this is a thing this
is officially now this is the thing this
is something you can sell you can buy
something or selling you can buy it now
I can give this um 10 so you see not say
no say no I just mean the this this idea
of these little dedicated devices for
communicating information across the
internet right to your home yeah and
interacting with it either by touch or
through your lips or through a gumball
or through a little printed sheet of
adorable paper or something you're right
I agree with you like this is it should
be a recurring segment on the show at
this point because we're talking about
things like this every week yeah and I
feel like that must mean something that
must have some kind of meaning that we
there's more more devices out there that
can do that kind of thing that can
transmit this kind of physical
information across the Internet maybe
we're going in that direction you know I
don't know but you know what I don't
care because you shouldn't care glow
specs are coming I'll get to see those
glow specs close you can say our coming
just say glow specs we can ensure right
there this guy
he's right here you're mine is coming is
he oh oh no we skipped one oh sorry I'm
I threw you off because I might have had
them in the wrong order but what I want
to talk about right now is glow specs I
mean you want to see super cool dudes
with Van Dyke's there we go yes this guy
Raven Dyson ring in the future of
illuminated sunglass technology in his
uh nineteen sixty spy jacket it looks
like he looks like a James Bond villain
it's a it's another Kickstarter project
another thing that we should have a
recurring segment theme on here
Kickstarter sure you know yeah gadgets
it has he reached his goal yet I think
so yeah he's saying these are these are
already coming in april okay gal cast
his ten thousand dollar funding goal
awesome sunglasses where the future well
where there is to their
electroluminescent so they'll uh they'll
project that cool looking neon glow
outward right so people would see you
having this super cool light up glasses
and by cool you mean blue right you know
thing come in different colors you could
have your logo on them their novelty
glasses yeah you can advertise yeah if
you want i want them for my band yeah
but uh the wearer doesn't see anything
odd oh they don't see it's like a
one-way clicking when we mirror kind of
thing yeah yeah sure yeah I I can find
all you get to you on your side of asses
and just enjoy all the turned on looks
by all the ladies around you right
looking at your super cool blue space
twenty bucks $20 pledge gets you some so
you know if you're you're into the
novelty eyewear thing help us get even
if you're not I I kind of want to see
this I kind of want to see people
walking around with you know with these
on I feel like yeah it seems so 80s to
me I yeah this is like I kinda want to
see a DS come back so well remember the
eighties
no no yes mame member video games in the
80s I'm a Nintendo let's not fall down
let's play nes cuz this is all this
nostalgic i think i can get whatever
into know it just it ends with us
hugging and crying at the side wanted to
add usually the ocean italy in that same
vein of illuminated gadget tree there is
this new light up cable concept for
actually this might actually be coming
dexin is creating this visible green
illuminated charging cable that uses
electroluminescent wire i believe to be
able to show you how much when your
gadgets are charging Oh with the draw of
electricity that they're doing it as the
gadget fills up and this battery life is
sufficient it starts slowing down and
then turns off automatic so that's not
as wait this is simulation that was not
this is not this is not the cable itself
yeah yeah supposed to look this dope
support so it's not done yet I mean
what's you know if they haven't finished
it like it can may not show a real video
of it cuz this like the way this concept
because the concept video is selling me
they're already problem being sold
already pricing on this get in a purple
dark seriously I wine this right now for
thirty-five dollars alone but if it
doesn't look that cool I'm gonna be real
disappointed assume it looks like cool I
why are they showing a real video then I
don't know that I kind of yeah I hear
I'm a little suspect I hear you yeah but
I hope it happens oh we have a suit
looks we need more cables helping us
reach out on a daily basis and distract
us yes we don't have enough things right
now more distractions for me the better
but it's also supposed to be a measure
for green energy conservation that
you're not you can see when your gadgets
are drawing power when they're you know
and also they can automatically shut off
when so this will automatically shut up
that's good yeah I love that yeah it'll
be drawing power the oh you're not using
right it's a green except when you're in
the future corning's vision
the future vision version version of
their vision version four of their
vision a glass filled future from
corning i love these concept videos
where they show you hello how
indispensable their technology is going
to be in the future so is that supposed
to be happening yeah somehow their glass
allows them to project Hollywood's into
a room but yeah I know they're glad the
architectural glass here is slowly
revealing the sunlight outside so is
that a electrochromatic glass what does
that little girl own a tablet and then
like the samsung vision which we've
already seen you've got the the touch
screen window right helping you yeah
yeah this looks we're mad cool um
well this is a rich family right here
like each little girl has our own tablet
mm-hmm and it's that same brand of
tablet that doesn't actually need any
components inside of it it can just be a
solid for a sec um oh yeah they're
beaver Oh dad's so embarrassed guys I
told you after I killed your mom you've
been next you kidding me crap right
remember that yes dad will turn it off
they're dimming the windows at their
school all runs on a strike you're happy
Dow Corning powered photovoltaic glass
help keep all those tablets charged up
we really have do something out dad can
we kill him and sleep yeah okay we'll
talk about later yeah look at this lose
gonna kill pin in this discussion all
right kids we're gonna learn about
Chrome so you have the dashboard the
desktop everything is just glass
everywhere making this happen it's
fragile future what's it like it's gonna
be a very smudgy future they're not each
other we're all the teachers are as hot
as her and then all the little boys look
like a teacher like my kids have the
same salt and pepper fantasy that day
anyway discussing earlier I'm pretty
sure he is how little boys are like
interesting you're trippin out or if you
saw this happen in front oh if I mean
that that was my teacher that's all you
need to say like I just mean the
technology talk about technology because
they're used to that by that they're
jada the all these kids a jaded I don't
care about this is doing this because
you know the girls are doing is just to
be social what was doing I cuz the
teacher saw that they want to please a
teacher well you know is because she was
able to get dressed in the morning using
Dow technology or Corning technology to
help her pick out her outfit that
probably yeah izing her teacher yeah
that's cuz she had that to help her pick
out her outfit at the school with
uniforms like it's usually she didn't
have to spend that much time till I art
see what our hospitals of the future all
made out of antimicrobial glass so I'm
guessing that this is a doctor in some
other country he's talking to that or no
not on the other side of that wall if
that would in a little bit
counterproductive what you guys doing in
there
I'm waiting yes ma'am his brain is now
this big your eyes sir hmm let me think
what a frozen we which wich llegar we am
dating today I don't know you guys say i
only have to be here for a couple
minutes we did here for course i want to
see my family we're gonna press in
between two pieces of glass now we're
gonna teleport you in this experiment
hmm it's next ugh i don't know how the
glass is doing that
hmm
I think they're gonna make him in today
Mary still wow that was the easiest
brain surgery I've ever stand it salt
congratulations you've been give it a
little bottome I think that was a two
finger gesture I think that was this
multi-finger oh that's a guy with the
what the dayglo glasses would have
everything it might be less a good ah
the screw genetic engineering we glass
can make Jurassic Park yeah cg will be
so cheap in the future but anyone do it
oh I think it's someone's long so hey I
think they're on Ninja Warrior now they
have to press that button make sure what
up we're dead even in the future CG
animation will be what an adorable
dinosaur he's fun yeah oh wait a minute
wait is dad out here there is dad's
become adhirata toys r us is gonna kill
us hope ya corny can provide the glass
diaper after taking her scare session is
that the mom how about the one was dead
we established this oh he works during
the day or wait what why was she in the
morning he was the two different kids
yeah I'll spend the rest of this podcast
trying to figure out the exact family
dynamic here yeah oh this is the same
look she's back in the pit right no I
think this is difficult oh is it all
right oh god features can be so amazing
so the futures gonna be lonely for
parents as they're all single parents is
what they're saying well it glass is
what separates them Corning a life
morning like that's good yeah poignant
yeah even that smudges smudgy so that's
the future um you're welcome yeah I'll
support that what else do we have to
talk about Eric maybe a segment called a
while oh I like that I like I like that
you kind of will it into will the
beginning of that segment into being
with your mind you're just kind of I
think it goes something like this it's
better than me like trying to romance it
out with my my dance skills right well
that's not your dance melz this is your
dansk that's right now I'm working on it
okay all right if I really it was who's
ami did to make that happen I couldn't
yeah same you could write better i use
my willpower yes and speaking of making
it happen how the Avengers make it
happen Donald yeah they will make it
happen The Avengers is a team of very
powerful beings that are more powerful
better looking than you or I will ever
be and there's a movie coming out if you
haven't heard about this have you guys
heard about this there's a vendor's
movie mm-hmm looks pretty good yeah his
new trailer out they played a super bowl
trailer 30 seconds good I was like thing
is missing something yeah then I glow
specs yes close specs where the glow
spanks someone should be wearing gold
specks but now there was no glow specs
but there was a one minute version of
that trailer that was released on
YouTube and we're gonna play that all
right right I won't see this
the world has changed at this point i
doubt i think would surprise me we are
hopelessly outgunned
mr. stark captain it's time
I still believe in Heroes
the adventures it's what we call
ourselves Earth's Mightiest Heroes thing
I have an army we have a Hulk
I'm sitting over here I'm a Neelu and I
need me a sniper is he died need the
glass diaper right now I've seen that
trailer like 50 times already and I'm
just watching it just I still get as
excited I so is as excited for so I
actually was noticing myself when
watching the trailer for first I was
painted to myself and how was reacting
be the most embarrassing thing in the
world if you were filming in hats yes I
was literally doing that and I was
putting my hand over my mouth right like
oh my like like a little kid is I'm such
a low key when it comes to this kind of
stuff I just revert back to that that
kind of motional state when I'm watching
this because it's so exciting and it
looks like it's done so well yeah I know
I know you're not as athletic I know
you're not as excited about it but what
a couple of things I really like what
that trailer that they point out well
first of all it features like the best
shot of Hawkeye we've seen so far when
he's like falling out of something also
i notice is like a girl like bunny ears
running through that first shot but oh
anyway from me there's a girl on the
right yeah right yeah I saw that I saw
that too like yeah you're right um she's
right by that you missed it already yeah
um wait yeah it's kind of hard it's kind
of that the stream is kind of free me
it's kind of hard to it went okay right
yeah it looks like she has bunny ears
but I bet she I don't think this is a
test your head but could she if she's
not in this oh yeah right only right
you're right that is it said she I don't
know if she's gonna be a future place
she one of the Avengers no I probably
not no no I don't know any vendors a
bunny is really awesome but although it
would not be honest the ball of the
bloody supersonic hearing and ability to
previously supersonic hearing I don't
know all of the buddy well Cyclops
doesn't have laser eyes or whatever
other I don't know but he has one I see
yeah well bunnies have big friggin years
you can run fast there you go she's
skip up around um yeah so what like is
it has a first great shot of Hawkeye
yeah it also um I the way that movie
plays out to me and this is probably
pretty predictable oh that's so awesome
um every knows he has a kind of a
grappling hook arrow right now cuz he's
falling out of some uh yeah I looked at
this few times the way that movie plays
out for me is you know Nick ferry gets
all these guys together and they're all
full of egos and whatever else like I
won't work this guy or you're not
anything like your father mr. stark you
know let's go stuff and gough and then
they add this we have this big fight and
you know fight and it's awesome and
they're just kicking each other's asses
and stuff but then you know there's
something that happens something
something like it's al-kamil fun and
stuff then something serious gonna
happen Josh Wheaton loves to do that
kind of stuff he loves to throw you like
that oh this is fun oh I mean you know
I'm a leaf on the wind and then two
minutes later you're dead you know I
said hi um he loves to do that kind of
stuff and I bet that's gonna happen
they're all going to band together and
they're actually gonna fight as a team
for the first time and you don't see
that one shot that one hero shot and
money shot the camera goes around and
that's gonna be their first time were
they like alright we're we just did
something and we're you know we're gonna
come together as a team and now we're
gonna take down take these guys down and
they're gonna do something it's gonna be
awesome yeah well I think like you're
saying about the hot teachers effect on
the students I think when they realize
that Scarlett Johansson's involved in
the movie they'll probably all bond
together over that you think so yeah
you're saying the students or the
Avengers I don't know looks like let's
just stop fighting and i'll appreciate
the scarlet johansson is here with us
yeah I could do that yeah I can
appreciate that else we have what else I
could reach another thing I could be she
ate Donnell is the amazing spider-man um
I wasn't very excite about this movie
actually I kind of forgot it was coming
out can I july third um until I saw this
trailer this trailer really has me
excited gonna go to it we talk about
later if you want but let's just play
the trailer it's kind of long so let's
get that going
that's not the same opening shot how'd
you get out there fires game its twenty
stories your doorman's intimidating tell
us a little bit about yourself mr.
Parker not much to tell really Peter
lives with his aunt and uncle did you
catch that spider guy yet no but we will
this guy wears a mask like an outlaw I
think he's trying to do something maybe
the police can't hint you know if you're
gonna steal cars don't dress like a car
thief you a cop you seriously think on
the cops and the skin tight red and blue
suit who are you
I know it's been rough for you here I
forgot all about that thing he was your
dad's your father was a very secretive
man Peter dr. cutters I'm Richard
Parker's son
your father and I were gonna change the
lives of millions including mine
extraordinary how did you come up with
this
there's a rumor of a new species in New
York it can be aggressive if threatened
I kind of stopped him because I created
him
that's not your job maybe it is
38 of New York's finest versus one guy
in a unitard Wow
if you want the truth Peter come and get
it
I am issuing an arrest warrant for the
masked vigilante known as spider-man
travel
I'll see that here's the thing that I
want you to talk okay I feel like it's
trying really hard to be Batman you know
as far as it being like darker and I'll
like like Nolan back Batman you mean
like Chris renewal yeah Batman Begins
dark established coming so I was that
kind of tone for a new spider-man reboot
and doesn't have the kind of rainy
whimsy that was like prevalent in the
last couple films I don't know I mean I
can't we all know I don't want to see
that it also like all like the is it
that the power the power stride the
police power structure of Gotham like
right like being both for Batman but
then against them and then like sure and
then but I feel like those are gonna be
universal themes if you really tackles a
superhero story realistically yeah those
are going to be you know those kind of
plot points those kind of themes are
going i canna intrinsic to that kind of
that John wave I feel like you know what
is the police what what do the police
think about this what um you know duty
like them do they not like them at you
all did kind of and when you break away
from that you get for right right wishes
let's take the rainbow bridge over to
like the right exactly attention yeah
yeah and yeah even in Thor there's a
little bit of that with the shield
agents you know it's kind of hard to to
separate a superhero story from that
kind of thing like he's a law enforcer
it but he's taking the law into his own
hands how do we handle that you know so
i guess Superman's only movies never
really tackled that didn't really go in
till I guess and especially what is the
spider-man thought i was going for it
though is that it's like the most
underdog character well yeah that
character has always been he's a nerd
he's a nerdy kid that gets these
superpowers we still nerd you know but
you know now he's super strong and agile
nerd and what I really like about this
this new movie is that they're very
going back to the original mechanical
web shooters I and I'm sound really
fanboy that's right now but in the
movies they went with organic web
shooters which at
time I know if you guys remember this
big big stink you know was made about
like from fanboys just why I going to do
it didn't bother me that much but I
really do like that they're going back
to the mechanical rapture web-shooters
it it kind of adds a little bit to his
character and his his um just his
intelligence his intellect because I
don't really didn't feel like they
really were able to convey that really
well in the other spider-man movies like
how smart he is what do you think about
this that I remember this is a this is
opening up an old it's kind of like a
new thing to me but I think it's an old
edition that comma it's like Donald
Glover had that campaign for a while
sure about him being possibly being seen
spider-man yeah like I see that I think
man actually would have been really cool
yeah well as like some other way to make
to give a new dimension to like these
characters yeah sure um I don't know it
breaks away from the actual like
traditional spider-man story sure um
Peter Parker in the comic has has always
been betrayed as you know a white guy um
and I really like Andrew Garfield the
dad's plane ominous he was in the social
network and he's really great net soha
stories from me yeah yeah so I really I
really I think that kid is really good
actor and recently they kind of so
spoilers spoilers if you haven't read
the ultimate spider-man comic book okay
well spoiler spoilers Peter Parker dies
and then alternate universe when someone
dies their dead so he died and this
other kid who's half a Latino and half
black has taken over as spider-man um I
think is in miles more out Morales so it
was it literally Peter Parker um but he
may he looks he's a he's a kid of color
you know and he spider-man now so it's
there's a lot of controversy behind it
and a lot of support the same time and
people like to see it so I think we're
coming closer to seeing that kind of
thing where you can have a different
take on a character despite you know not
taken into account necessarily his race
but cuz spider-man is more than just a
white guy in a suit he's he's kind of
symbolic right he's when he puts that
mask on that's why so many people relate
to him cuz he inputs that mask on it's
like Master Chief in halo no one can see
who he is when he has a mascot no one
can say look on ask off for a little bit
in that he was he could
damask and that at some point well yeah
I guess that's the new spreadsheet that
converted to a Batman where you just
like assaults made some rich there yeah
there is yes area is and is some rich
you know waspy dude it's gavin newsom is
that man in all it's basically um so
yeah so I yeah i agree with you i would
have liked to have seen that I think
there's the chances of that happening or
higher now that they're establishing
that they're establishing now that they
can do something different with the
spider-man character yeah you know
someone else could be him so anyway I'll
see a trailer looks good yeah it does
yeah so that's all I have this week
thought we have all right cool done all
right we're done with we've done stick a
fork in it if you want to contact us you
can do that at krave at cnet com yeah we
it's been a while since we've gotten any
kind of contact we're outside world
we're also on the Twitter yeah you got
that you even bathe that you want to if
you want to rant and rave about a review
or story well done no no no you don't
want to do that you get enough of that
uh and you can find the stories will be
talking about next week on our crave
blog right there I'll be hitting the
