a robot that can play baseball I'm
trying do art well do or do not ok
Spotify and we are collaborating to make
your ride so musical and speaking of
music a music video is using scientific
techniques to bring sound to life hmm
very exciting stuff a lot of sound straw
daily
greetings citizens of the internets
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm hero
stash lease can enjoy me as always
punching the sky on a Monday kill
anonymous you look like link today that
thank you smile tell you it's all this
is my heroes tunic thank you very much
I'm playing too much mario kart that is
true but right the master cycle this
weekend very exciting that hyrule castle
track is so much they change all the
coins in rupees sorry alright we have
other things to target we do so let's
say the headlines ok baseball robots
mm-hmm once again teaching robots things
is either really cool or really scary
this i would say falls on the really
cool side of the spectrum that's cool
this is awesome this is the work of the
ichikawa watanabe laboratory at the
university of tokyo for the last several
years apparently a team of researchers
at this university have been working on
perfecting a range of separate robots so
they've been using multiple robots here
they are there's one throwing know the
others are they so each one of them can
perform a separate task this one's
tracking so you can see the cameras are
watching the ball got their eye on the
ball and the end goal of this is
combining them into a single humanoid
robot that can play baseball so there it
is one robot yeah look at this one is
batting yeah so there's lots of
different kinds of robots so they have
the throwing robot which we saw that
uses finger similar to humans use them
to throw a ball precision apparently
they can throw into a strike zone with
ninety percent accuracy what god the
throw so then there's the tracking
system it uses pan and tilt axes to
achieve a wide field of view there's
high speed actuators in there a high
speed visual feedback to track a target
moving at high-velocity this is the
running robot on the batting robot you
just saw uses high speed stereo vision
to track the ball and hit it anywhere in
the strike zone and then there this is a
bipedal running robot that uses high
speed visual feedback to note the
position of the robot and adjust its
balance in real-time and then there's
catching robots it controls a it they
have this hand that can open and close
ten times a second Wow it measures the
ball's flight using high-speed track in
the same tracking
cameras and everybody so this is one
group working on on all of these
different robotics yeah yeah they're
working on all these different aspects
of playing baseball and and they're
hoping someday that they'll be able to
like just like Captain Planet put like
or a Power Ranger yeah like put all of
them together and create Megazord cute
that plays baseball so it's pretty be
like perfect at baseball it would be
really good I mean it would be really
really good at it the thing is it is
though some people would argue that that
would be very boring to watch an all
baseball robot baseball game because you
would have to program the games you kind
of know what the outcome would be so
with humans you there's margin for error
there's like things I could go wrong
with robot baseball if they really
perfected be kind of boring yeah but
then we add like obstacles and like
deadly things like trash fire yeah okay
sorry all right like that I like it but
it's battle bots but with like baseball
baseball battle box I like it vanilla I
saw this I just thought it was so so
cool and and I always just love the idea
of you know someday we're just flip on
the TV and it's like oh it's you know
it's the world series of robot baseball
but this whole alternate world yeah hey
bob babe ruth spot that's pretty cool
pretty cool I thought it was really neat
so okay I heard about this partnership I
don't know all about it and I want to
know if it's available here so tell me
about uber and Spotify so I don't know
if you listening or viewing have used
uber but uber is a like it's like it
instead of a cab you use your phone and
you call up and a basically a town car
comes and picks you up and take you to
your destination it's pretty cool well
they've partnered ebers partnered with
spotify which is a music service that
you can use on your phone or what not
streaming music action music action and
it now there is a button inside the uber
app that lets you pick a playlist to
listen to inside your uber rides okay so
this girl is requesting an uber mm-hmm
okay she's requesting an uber and she's
also picking a playlist so now when she
gets in the ober it will play the
playlist inside of her uber so she can
dance straight from her house oh they're
jamil's how yeah I didn't hear the do
burr okay she's leaving that's a very
slim door yep there's the town cares
this guy I'm sorry but can I just say
I've never had an uber driver get out of
their car smile
waiting for me though and be handsome
too like ambient like a definite time
right excited iculous um but it's cool
yeah you get to pick any place you want
the driver gets to control the loudness
of course well that's good uh but but
this is a we didn't expect this
partnership to come along so it's pretty
interesting it's a little weird yeah
it's it's weird but it's kind of cool if
your party it feels like your friends
are going out to a party you need a ride
like so you can get your get your party
mix on LMFAO on its launching and only
10 sit it's fun to content see what you
don't still less it'll just be you know
what the sad thing is is okay wait tell
me about the launch cities and then I'll
tell you with the same thing ok launch
cities are Los Angeles London New York
City Nashville Mexico City San Francisco
Singapore Stockholm Sydney and Toronto
these are all the major cities
rotational cosmopolitan city yep it's
where it's you know they're already
pretty big we should I can do but right
after this so that hears that here's the
issue you do have to have a spotify
account which is like okay nine dollars
i may have a premium right yeah I
premium ok Spotify and you you know have
to order uber have to take a new for
someone yeah so there you go also
they're gonna have a live live events on
Friday oh look at it where you can win a
chance to get a ride with some artists
uh if you sync up and use this how the
artists like Andrew WK Jake Owen and
Diplo one of my favorite musicians I was
gonna say two out of three of those
artists I may have never heard of which
one but I won't say but I two out of
three of those artists you'll have to
just guess okay um you know the two out
of three okay guess that the sad thing
for me is that I could just imagine like
I feel really bad for some uber drivers
who are gonna get like a bachelorette
party and it's gonna be two o'clock in
the morning and these girls are gonna be
like whoo and they're gonna have their
gonna just play over and over and over
again turn down for what like a repeat
and this poor uber driver is just gonna
be like I think this kill me this is
like a response to though the fact that
they pretty much when they get in a car
look cuz they're wanting they're wanting
a tip right there wanting a good review
or whatever and so this is kind of too
like up that like likely well haven't
you ever taken an uber and like the
radio like with somebody's playing
something you're just like I hate this
song and you would try danger they try
to assume what you
into the like are you the only kids love
a rock maybe a guest by your picture cuz
it has like your paper like your profile
picture whatever maybe they try to kill
you would be I'm guessing Taylor Swift
well Taylor Swift not available on
Spotify over if she took all her music
off of it so there's no shake it off for
me thank you very much trouble when you
walked in oh boy so that brings us to
our hashtag of the day which is TD uber
spot and because of this live event on
Friday happening I the question is what
playlist or song would you want to hear
when an uber driver came to pick you up
we using the service and what famous
musician would you want to be in the car
as a ride along ok any post any play
even a song or album whatever ok uh
Taylor Swift oh boy and the music to
listen to while Taylor's away playlist
Oh perfect I like that that's good I
wonder if she'd she'd probably one I'm
throwing no but if I was thinking about
Steve you Sean Taylor Swift they answer
uh Jack Black okay cuz that'll be fun to
write amazing my fallout3 playlist I
like it though I'm wearing my Fall Out
shirt today anyway said I was surprised
you and say like tenacious d that you
were fighting no you don't listen I'll
listen to our music yeah alright so what
else what do you got what do you want I
would want to ride in a car at being
inspired recently by sonic highways I'd
ride in a car Dave Grohl Oh seems like
really cool and funny I'm like that you
could have a lot of fun with him
depending on where you're writing and in
la car rides take a really long time and
then I think I would want to listen to
I'd want you know what because it was
Dave Grohl I'd want to listen to like
Britney Spears circa like early 2000s
throw him off his game when she was hot
and had the snake no because I feel like
we would totally like fant like fangirl
out a little bit and be like and did
like dance and go crazy to it I feel
like Dave Grohl is a teenage girl on the
inside in his heart of hearts I feel
like maybe he's just just a little bit
of a teenage girl Jess and I love that
about him I feel like we could have a
lot of fun listening to old britney
spears and we can sing along i'd love to
make taylor swift let's not spotify woof
be good that would be pretty basic all
right so so that's the question for you
guys basically so what
who would you ride in a car with and
what do you have would you listen to
would you force them to listen to you
what would you just want to listen to
alright so our third stories also
music-based this is really really
awesome you have to check this out we're
going to show you this video if you are
listening to the show only you have to
watch this part of the video I would say
this is like the must watch also mean
the baseball robot pretty amazing yeah
um I always love really cool music
videos this music video is from a guy
named Nigel Stanford and a director
name's Shahir Dowd and I Nigel Stanford
decided one day after seeing and a
documentary about people with
synesthesia uh it's stuck with him these
are people with like audio visual
disorders think people who say like when
I hear sound I can also see color like I
can see the color and sound things like
that so he then saw a video years later
called cymatics which is the study of
visual sound so he decided he wanted to
make this video so this is really cool
each sound and each audio track uses
cymatics visualizations to form the
basis of the tracks composition so how
it's all put together so um this right
here is a collab me plate I hope I'm
pronouncing that right it's a thin metal
plate that vibrates when sound waves run
through it so they put Sam sprinkled on
the surface and then this right here
this speaker the bass track has a thin
dish of frozen of vodka inside there to
make it was a little more viscous so
that's why they put frozen vodka inside
gotcha and water and then the drum is
visualized using a hose pipe attached to
a subwoofer so you can see it changes
like based on the frequency it's a very
specific frequency to be able to get
water to do that wow that looks amazing
it's really really cool and ok so then
they had this which was um cards on a
record player that they are playing and
then they flick against the microphone
to make this sound and then they also
had the piano track right here this is a
ferrofluid it's in a long shallow dish
and there's magnets that are activated
by the keys so he puts all these things
together and creates this amazing music
video
and and also a really cool electronic
track that you can check out you can
head over to his website again his
name's Nigel Stanford oh and make sure
he gets a bunch of credit he's in New
Zealand ER he's a musician he obviously
loves the study of cymatics and also and
the song conveniently is called cymatics
so it's really easy to remember and this
is off of his new album solar echoes
cool isn't that neat like a music it's
really cool like I really it's very
easily it's there's a lot of like Browns
and things like that in there because
you like don't hang up soon uh no I
wouldn't call it upside is like
electronica Oh interesting sort of like
industrial electronic music like kind of
what I would refer to it as yeah I guess
you have the most control of her like
crazy sounds are you doing electronics
oh yeah well I mean they just had a lot
of control over everything they're
making inside that studio so I just
thought that was really neat um you have
to check out the music video you watch
it and listen to the song it's pretty
cool link to Lincoln in the in the show
description yes of course we go over to
the article for the show you can find
all of the links and stuff to everything
that you see and hear about on the show
yeah and if you're on YouTube you can if
you go to the cnet tomorrow deal I
noticed a lot of people are having
problems finding those legs I know
they're on the there on the cnet thing
well maybe what we could try to do is
put them in the description for our
youtube yeah we can because i love the
youtube people i'm gonna hook them up oh
come on alright alright well known that
note we're gonna take a quick 30 second
break but we'll be right back with very
exciting colleague of ours let's take a
trip to the bionic or oh okay quite i am
ii i'm severely excited about this so
we're gonna painful we're gonna check
that out and then of course we have your
user feedback and our phone tower for
the day so i'll click away
welcome back to the show we have
returned a kiss is awesome this is
really really really clean he's jacked
up about okay because what happened is
here I'll lean it in a little bit okay
what happened is when we reported on the
show about this cruise ship that's only
a robotics it's the bottom of the season
high tech cruise ship ever to be Korean
right and during the show I was like
it's like one of the first ones Rose
like let's see if they can send us or
whatever like huh that'd be cool and
they never liked yes they actually like
you know we always go like hey call us
they did I did which was pretty cool so
we couldn't get we couldn't go there
right it's in New York sorry this is how
except it's in New York but they were
like oh cover this whole ship and
everything whatever like no no no the
thing we want the most is the robotic
flat bar bartenders all we care about
okay you finished so we sent our very
own CNET's update reporter Bridget carry
over to the ship because she is based in
New York and we had her go hang out with
the Bionic bartenders so it's as cool as
we thought of it was this really cool
surprise like spinning boats it's great
check this out well it's not often you
can get served by robots in this case
we're at the Bionic bar on quantum of
the Seas where robot bartender serve up
drinks constantly all you have to do is
order your drink from a nap and about a
minute later out it comes with each
cocktail the robot arms reach up above
to gather the proper liquor proportions
when the drink is ready is poured into a
plastic cup for it to be picked up you
have to tap your wristband if ordering
from a soulless machine concerns you
there will be waiters the waiters also
serve as the eyes on the ground to make
sure minors don't try to use other
people's bracelets to order alcohol but
there is a plus side to order
from machines you don't have to tip now
Royal Caribbean didn't make these robots
they're actually from a company called
maker shaker they've been working on
these for a while now and they made a
deal with royal caribbean to get it on
quantum of the Seas and you may see it
on other cruise ships later too but the
challenge in building a robot like this
goes beyond programming the arm but
actually the big challenge was to build
everything around rubble in a way that
this would become like an extension of
your arm when you want to make a
cocktail these robots were developed in
the city of Torino Italy which is a
fitting home for a cocktail shaking bot
Torino is the birthplace of martini and
vermouth next to the bar are these
really cool screens they give you an
idea of how much weight time you have
for the next drink you can see who's up
next so you can see how long it takes
until your drink comes along in the
queue and get some trivia on what most
popular drinks are with different age
groups I keep having enough of these I
want to start wine to tell this thing my
problems it's been a hard day at work
guys I don't think human bartenders need
to worry about losing their jobs just
yet well that is until they can teach
this thing to put the little umbrella in
the drink
not bad for a robot I'll take another
one of these keep just keep them coming
keep them coming so that was Bridget
Kerry's trip to the bionic bar on the
quantum of the Seas its royal
caribbean's flat new flagship cruise
ship if you want to check out a full
tour Bridget actually did a tour of the
other parts of the ship which are also
very very cool over on her show update
so if you want to check that out make
sure you head over to see nuts update
and you can check out the rest of
quantum of the Seas but Thank You
Bridget yeah thank you very much Bridget
I'm going out and drinking on our behalf
yeah that looks great I didn't she
didn't tell us what she ordered though
it looked like maybe uh I was gonna call
a tokyo tea that's what it look like
tokyo tea yeah you guys it's like a Long
Island iced tea but it has Midori on it
instead of oh okay like Coke so it
changes the call a classy lady I've
never better fun fact seems nice I used
to be a bartender so oh really yeah yeah
God fun fact bards used to be a
bartender I can even flip like I can
flip the bottles after you a little bit
of flair really wow that's right yeah I
like the fact anyone has a tip them too
yes I really quite enjoy that um but you
know it's like that's another couple
bartenders who aren't working now they
can go on a cruise I have time to go on
a cruise they're not working on the
weekend time to get more tattoos all
over the body hey hey hey laughs relax
so that was our that was our fantastic
little trip to the Bionic bar once again
thanks Bridget Carey and let's move on
to your user feedback last week we asked
you guys I know it seems like forever
ago we asked you about playstations view
service oh yeah the view service
introduced by sony to kind of cut out
the middleman of your cable service and
provide you with television straight
through your playstation where people
happy or mad here's the thing yeah we
got really mixed responses on its
response so gabs wrote and said i would
try it but it does depend on price and
channel availability i love my netflix a
lot but i'm a huge playstation fam so
there you go all right Stefan wrote to
us and said i would need BBC actually
should I read this in a British accent
yes i would need BBC that is all I would
want from it mostly for Doctor Who and
Sherlock and top gear and about a
million others oh yeah was that a good
British accent oh this is great terrible
i'm not that great there's not that
great ya know uh but DBC point yeah
that's our news BBC though I think they
can lock that down I think they could
probably lock down one channel for you
Dane wrote I would have to be paid to
leave cable bottom line he's just
straight-up like you would have to pay
me to leave my cable / writer the end
period and a story glad there is one
person that's tucked inside no cable
yeah cable all the way d then we got an
email I guess we have email from Chrissy
said I am all about any ala carte media
offerings but I hope they have an
advertisement free offering amazon
allows you to pay a little less and see
ads or pay a little more and not see ads
I really like this business model sony
could do this or even offer different
advertising tears and then he gave us
some examples Netflix and HBO is pay
service no ads basic TV free service
with ads cable TV pay service with ads
what boo haha I don't make any sense but
it's like a blue but it's a hulu it's
like Hulu you pay and you have to watch
ads and they're really frequent yeah I
mean not to complain about hulu plus but
guys dial it back yeah an SNL there's
like there's more commercials than there
is sometimes it skips I think the
commercials are actually Saturday Night
Live sketches a few jokes on you if you
look at it in a very meta way you can
actually get through hulu plus Saturday
Night Live yeah if you think like these
are all really bad Saturday Night Live
sketches or just passed off as
commercial well it's just like whenever
you watch like a clip from lie close the
clip from the simpsons or whatever and
the commercials longer than the clip how
does that even happen I just don't her
set happens with YouTube videos too yeah
you watch a trailer and then they play a
trailer mobile for 30 seconds no
particular this is supposed to be an ad
already it's a 24-second clip and you're
just like why why what just happened
here so yeah I know we totally get you
guys um I love it uh they sound honestly
kind of torn on it they do I think a lot
of nobody they need to give this Eastern
three for everybody for like two months
to get everybody kind of like see what
their maybe they'll put it in beta like
PlayStation now yeah and then I'll say
like what would you pay for this service
and then whatever people say Sony will
make it triple haha good point guys
great great price guys what's triple
that too bad that is what the price is
ok it's time for our final piece of user
feedback which is of course
