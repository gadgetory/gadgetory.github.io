we're here at the k1 speed race track
what better venue for a mobile browser
speed test we've got three different
browsers here we're gonna see it going
with one over the other could give you
an advantage that's right in order to
make it a fair test we're all using the
same phones we're all using iphone 5 s's
we're all connected to the same 4G
wireless hotspot we all make sure that
we've cleared our caches cleared our
cookies and cleared our browser history
and what we're going to do is load three
types of web pages okay we've got a new
site a picture heavy website and a
meteor rich site and i'm going to use
chrome i'll be using safari
I've got opera the underdog all right
New York Times at first sure let's go NY
key rhymes com I'm gonna go one two
three go and I'll go thank you go all

some coffee Big Mike I'm taking a bit
longer than I expected yeah I think it
knows i press GO oh I was coming come on
opera fun you sure we're all connected
to the same 4g hotspot does it not like
opera what do you think about moving on
to it won't come back tomorrow and we'll
see how this goes
so it's just it got a hiccup but I mean
I think that's a real world result it is
yeah for whatever reason we that happens
for sure all right well maybe it's going
to do better in the next round all right
where we going up we have one of my
favorite websites pinterest.com water
come on my family obvious i hope i
spelled it right all right come on two
three go all right we're off again and
and Sharon done already problem I'm

pinners man no no that was an accident
so I'm done now shadow zone all right I
wouldn't that one opera what are you
killing me actually explode and
everything done oh nice nice came

I'm like win this one again I might win
this weekend Oh reading through the way
there it's almost yes that's like almost
there final girl Hank right seriously oh
oh I got some HTML fun maybe our hot
spots for two reception it's not super
excellent no I'm done oh cool i win haha
I'm step a little weird glitchy hiccup
do you guys mind if we do that you get
the HTML well we'd have to clear the
cache yeah so guys let's redo this
because my loading experience ran into a
little glitch so we're going to clear
our caches and try that one again it
happened sometime
doing a real-world test ready yeah yeah
yeahs dogs kind of that one two three go
all right oh gosh I'm nervous as an age
up opera has the page up we're still on
whitepages go no problems again maybe
your dad's button is a reset all right
4g hotspot rebooted it says it's ready
to go maybe that's gonna help us get a
little extra speed one two three go all
right wow this is so much better done
yeah Oh done yeah oh dang I mean why
water wasn't helped by that I knew it
I'm sorry to say that I had a lot of I
had a lot of hope for opera yeah but
opera just flopping all over the place
oh yeah real quick let's go through some
how-to tips and quick tips for each of
our browser okay all right so on opera a
couple different things i would do to
really optimize the speed here maybe
actually get me to finish loading a page
i'd go into settings and there's these
the first two options here are for
loading images you guys could turn load
images off especially on a text heavy
page like New York Times that might be
helpful or if you want to keep your
images there but change the quality of
them I could change image quality from
high down to low and see if that helps
me and I'll just say briefly about
Safari is that it is your default
browser so any link you click on like an
email or something it's gonna open in
safari that's nice little perk right
there but also if you have an iPad you
can take advantage of the reading list
so if you don't have time to read a
story on a web page you want to just
push it to your iPad you can totally do
that very easily with Safari and chrome
is jam packed with features one of my
favorites is that one that preloads
pages based on where the browser thinks
you're going to go next and then another
great one is tab sinking so if you're on
Chrome desktop and you move over to your
phone you're going to be able to load
those exact same tabs pick up just where
you left off all right we can all safely
say that chrome was the winner of this
particular test yeah
yeah no chrome is the winner no no no
I'm not cruel you know I'm me and Grill
heroin it was good you pressed the
button I press the magic button with my
magical finger yes sorry guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
