information please called a hotline for
911 update me whenever you learn
something did she mention anything
unusual going on you guys are friends I
know she has friends right she keeps to
herself a lot how would you guys
describe this film to people haven't
seen it okay uh so um basically the way
we like to describe it is that searching
is a very very very classic thriller
told in a very very unconventional way
the classic part about it is that it's
about a dad played by this guy whose
daughter goes missing and he tries to
find her and the very unconventional
part about it is that the majority of
the film takes place on his daughter's
laptop screen as he breaks into her
computer to look for clues to find her
when I say the majority the rest of it
takes place on other computers and
laptops and tech devices so it's all
told on the screens we use every day to
communicate yeah and I think one a small
neat moment at the beginning was just
how emotional like deleting a calendar
event can be and how they like elicit a
like Pixar up like reaction from the
crowd last night
now how did John how did you get
involved in this film it was sent to me
the traditional way can I do that can I
do the summation of the movie but in a
different voice yeah okay
it's about this Harold
right Harold is his dad
and then Harold's daughter goes missing
right and then he's like gotta find her
on the computer nice it's in luckily
maybe there is a freak show at some
point so he came to be the traditional
way through my agents and I my first
impression was that I really loved this
the story the genre I wanted to do I was
very suspicious of telling it via
screens and on that basis ended up
saying no you know in retrospect I like
to say I wonder if it was because Aneesh
and I spoke by a device through the
telephone instead of meeting
face-to-face and he came back at me and
we eventually sat down and it was then
that I was convinced that it was going
to be a a movie not a YouTube video you
know and he explained what he and what
his intentions were in the storytelling
and also I just sort of developed a
crush on an ish and decide on the record
and decided we I think there's a path to
doing this movie and if anyone could do
it I felt at the end of the meeting that
it was him and said how would you
describe as a co-writer man how would I
describe John's crush on an itch or like
describing a street here I mean no I
think the way in each describes it is
exactly how we always talked about it it
is first and foremost it's a thriller
it's a regular film it has all the ups
and downs and twists and turns and as
you mentioned like the emotion that you
get with any film we just happen to make
it in a really crazy unconventional way
to be honest with you like when it you
know a nation our writing partners and
he directs and I produce when we first
had the opportunity to make this film we
also said no actually it seems to be a
pattern they you know we depict it as a
short film and the company who had also
produced unfriended it was like can you
guys make that into a feature and for
the same exact reason as John I think we
were
hesitant and it wasn't until we kind of
came up with this opening montage for
those of you guys who saw it it was it
was an opportunity for us to like use
this crazy conceit but tell a really
grounded human and most of all emotional
story in it we kind of call that opening
montage like a Pixar's up meets Google
commercial montage that's really good
and I think it's also because you come
this year for your first feature film
you have a background in short films and
so I'm asking this for a friend a friend
who's intelligent handsome maybe a tech
writer who also does short films but how
do you leap from doing shorts into an
indie film and specifically this one
maybe nobody asking that how did you get
to Sundance and win carefully in over a
long period of time no it's a so
basically before I had was was making
this film I was at Google in New York
City at the Google Creative Lab and I
was sort of writing and developing and
directing commercials which was a gig
that I had just kind of found my way and
to thank God but you know it was there
where I really learned how to sort of a
moat on computer screens and you know my
bosses had made some of the best Google
commercials I you know actual
commercials period you know there was
one if you guys remember like on the
Super Bowl a few years ago 2005 it was
one called Parisian love where it's all
told on a Google search bar and it's
about a kid who goes to Paris and meets
the love of his life and it's just told
to the searches on Google and then
there's another one that was on just on
Gmail about a dad writing letters to his
kid culty or Sophie and it kind of
follows the growth of this kid and I
remember thinking like wow these are
such unconventional ways of telling this
story but the story itself is so
universal and something that we can all
relate to and so really it was this
whole project kind of came together
after seven met with this company that
wanted to make a movie on a computer
screen and so I was like hey my boy
works at Google you should meet with him
too and so you know it really felt like
this movie was sort of like a very very
kind of seamless next step in it
although at no point did we ever feel
like this was a home run you know this
was like III quit my job at Google to
make this movie and we made this movie
with like five people on a very very
small editing room with touka my Mac
computers that were crashing like every
two hours and we would lose like 15 to
20
progress like and we were kind of going
from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. every single day
for the court almost two years and you
know if this movie had failed if this
movie fails but if it had failed you
know no one would have batted an eye
because like no one believed in this
movie from the beginning so to have that
you know we just kind of took a crazy
leap of faith and sort of trusted that
we all had done enough at that point to
just figure out how to do something
absolutely new and it somehow we applied
to Sundance got in and then like 12
hours after our premiere became a
worldwide distribution deal so it was
funny I remember when we got the call
about Sundance if you guys would like to
hear about that cuz it's like a
filmmakers dream come true they normally
call the director right and I've been
lucky to have a couple movies and son
and it's always a director would call me
and give me like the best news of my
life and each was I think traveling yeah
I was I was I was on the jet way from
India to Bali and was trying to find
himself
I'm sort of flush my brain actually
every screen that I had seen for the
last and we we had like strategically
planned this out we're like a nice you
should change your voicemail message to
be like hey I'm out of the country blah
blah blah if you're Sundance leave a
message I'm checking so we did all the
steps and then literally like we I
happen to be at lunch with like my
cruising partner Natalie our editors and
everyone else on the film cuz we were
like doing a technical test of the movie
like a month before in case we got into
Sundance and I got the call from
Sundance to my phone and I was like Emma
look like it and like it was like yeah
I'm acting like really chill out cool
yeah like we'd love to come sure cool
Thanks and then we hung up we just sort
of going crazy in this restaurant were
like holy shit like Aneesh doesn't know
so we like called Aneesh and like he's
like hey man like I don't have a good
service I'm about to take off on this
flight and we told you the news right as
you guys are taking off right I turned
off my like data because it's like my
international data plan sucks so I
basically had to time it every 20
minutes to check my like if I got any
messages in in the 20 minutes I missed
the call from Sundance and I was like
damn but I'll tell you one thing
Sundance tells us the most important
thing is like you cannot tell anybody
your movies in Sundance cuz they're
gonna announce it you know two or three
weeks from then so we told the Nisha
like just don't tell anybody and you
were trapped in a plane with how many
people I was trapped or the jetway and
everybody knew that something major had
bit that just happened in my life
but I don't think they knew he was
positive or negative because my reaction
was just like oh my god you know so
hopefully one day they'll piece it
together but I doubt it which is many of
you online like what's going I was like
okay well I wondered - okay so John I
rewatched the hair of an Kumar Go to
White Castle trailer and in know no word
trailer and the the voiceover in it for
the original trailer describes you as
that Asian guy from American Pie now
watching the film last night I was
struck by we were just basically
watching a story about a father
searching for his daughter and losing
his family who just happens to be Asian
American and I'm wondering what are your
thoughts as an actor and a performer of
how like your career has changed that
definition of being like that asian guy
- now you're doing these leads and like
movies like this in Columbus it's
certainly an interesting journey you
know for me this movie is a bit of the
future right now and what I mean by that
is the race and ethnicity and culture of
the family and it is a whole family
that's represented in this movie that
those things are specific they're
germane to who the characters are and
yet it also doesn't matter and I think
and I've been saying that for a while I
used to take pride in my in the fact
that I would be cast in white roles that
that was a point of pride because I had
resisted what they had written for me
well for Asian men and but this is to me
where this is an example of the end game
which is to get to a place where the
character was written on the page
Asian but it also is not a point in the
plot
and so this is I in some ways a
culmination of that journey and I of the
auspicious start I wonder like to follow
that like as we see other movies coming
out right now another Asian movie out
very it's in the title crazy rich Asians
I'm wondering like what does that
feature to look like continuing to move
forward what I I guess you know some of
the what I've been reading the kind of
in the Millia of Turan agents press is
and and I wholly support the I that this
idea that no one film should have to
carry the the banner for a culture it's
absurd because we are diverse we're deep
and I think it's insane for I mean
that's the trap of representation is to
have to say this person this story
represents all of us and I think where
we want to go to is moving towards
plurality and
and and only then can it represent us
because no one story no one person known
one narrative no one culture can
represent us and and really
representation starts with being
absolutely specific and you know when
you voiced the the yoke of
representation on any one project or
person you're gonna have to be general
and that is not authentic it is false
and it will not work I am oh so going
back to the conceit of the film again so
the unusualness of the screens I think
added like this beautiful like kind of
like tension within moments that you
waited for that start screen
to happen in David's bedroom and deceive
the the lava whatever that is a lava
screensaver
just to release that tension sometimes
how is this like to make because it's a
great story
but I imagine making this seems really
unusual I'm just thinking of all the
details on the screen the shots how
you're acting I say something like I
don't know if everyone knows it's it's
I'm just gonna pay these guys a
compliment which is that we know when I
first saw the movie I texted him and
said this is contributing to the
vocabulary of cinema which is incredibly
difficult to do and I think for many
years now storytellers in my business
have been struggling with how to
dramatize what's happening in in our
culture which is that we more and more
human beings or having exchanges through
technological devices scenes that would
have happened face to face now we are if
if we film them sometimes face to face
we're not being authentic because people
are texting those those exchanges people
are emailing those exchanges they're
having those exchanges on facebook or
FaceTime and so how do you dramatize
that and I think the traditional way has
been to film a person typing and and
shoot from behind their back and if you
recall you know like meg Ryan
sort of mouthing her her instant
messages out loud while she's typing and
it has it's been false we haven't gotten
it right and it was the first thing that
I read that offered a solution to that
problem as a storyteller which was to go
inside the device and it was quite
thrilling when I saw it you know one of
my impressions was that I was shocked at
how much it made sense you know we are
on 7th and 8th generation of devices and
we have nostalgia for devices and so we
have a shared history and I think it's
the first year that we could have made
this film you know because our
collective understanding and history
with these
devices has arrived I mean I'll talk a
bit about you you know you mentioned the
movie is tense and like part of what
makes a tense for those that saw it is
as you're watching you know you're just
waiting for things to happen on the
screen I think that also kind of
reflects how we felt making the movie
and post-production specifically like an
itch mentioned we were working on two
computers probably like the computers
you guys used to write articles are
stronger than computers we ended up
using to edit and we all became really
religious during the making of this film
we started we like we became like
followers of the rainbow god you guys
know the spinning Rainbow God like every
time we'd be editing like it would pop
up and we just are praying like please
like like don't like don't delete
everything we just did for the last
three hours and it usually did so it was
there was kind of like it was it was
crazy because we were trying to like
come up with a path that hadn't really
existed before yeah and speaking of a
path that didn't exist one oh the first
thing that we did with this film so
basically for those of you guys who
don't know like how exactly we shot it
you know in the film there's all of the
footage that is on a computer screen
there's a Skype camera or that there's
like YouTube videos there's there's news
footage there's every website just
basically your computer and then there's
the way that we're seeing it which is
our additional camera that we're adding
to all of that so basically in order to
make this movie and this was idea seven
weeks before we even shot a frame of the
movie after we had written the script
the first people we hired weren't the
actors or anybody who comes on set they
were the editors who traditionally work
after the film is shot so in this case
they came seven weeks before and they
just basically opened up these two
computers that would be their home for
the next two years and basically I
started screen capturing the internet
and and taking the screen message as
photos of text messages and taking a
bunch of photos of me and basically what
we ended up with in it after the course
of seven weeks was an hour and 40 minute
cut of the entire film starring me
playing every single role like the dad
the brother the mother the all of our
friends just talking to my specially to
daughter as well yeah my best
performance but you know and and this
was honestly to teach us and teach
ourselves how to make the movie but on a
very practical level John when he's on
set like you're looking at his face the
entire time shot on a GoPro so every
single tiny eye motion is extremely
exaggerated so he needs to know
basically where every
where the cursor is at every single
point where every pop-up window is
happening where every webpage is popping
up where every like text messages
popping up so everything has to be
matched perfectly and he needs to know
everything that he's always doing so we
needed to like make the movie first so
we could make the movie so we could take
that footage and put it back into the
movie that we had made first
and then continue to make the movie
again got it yeah
got it no I'm talking about like YouTube
window as a facebook praise of
Pomodoro's how did you get like do you
need to get permission to use that stuff
on screen or how did that go about yeah
so I mean for us one of the most
important things like I think
historically or one of the big kind of
ideas that we wanted to do in this movie
is get the internet right and I feel
like no Hollywood movie or television
show or anything for that matter ever
does technology right like they always
cut to a phone and like the text
messages are massive it's just like
shows you what you need to see or like
you cut to a website and it's just
totally made-up and they never show you
logos and we were like no no for this
movie to work it needs to feel like this
is your computer nothing here is made up
you know everything is totally real so
from day one our biggest kind of like
philosophy was and this is something
that we backed with basically a legal
team that had made unfriended which is
another movie that came out before and
also represented Family Guy was just
basically like if we're showing these
applications the way billions of people
use every single day in a way that isn't
lying or isn't portraying them in an
overtly negative light on purpose why
not use them you know and we're not
doing that this movie isn't a indictment
on technology it's just in a weird way
showing that we live our lives on
screens but a your fact that we're able
to tell a story that has about a dad
looking for his kid on screens yeah in
fact that actually it adds like a layer
of comfort to me your first watching the
first few minutes you're like oh yeah I
get this or like you hear the windows
chime and it's like oh yeah
but I think also because of that that
allows you to get to know the family
anthem are the windows but allows you to
get to get to know the family and set
the plot up so when later things happen
or just like losing your mind like don't
want to I don't want to see it but I
want to see it kind of thing so going
back a bit here with
there's all these details on the screen
it's like all these side details and one
that popped up was like a new scroll and
it said something like Hollywood
producer was suspected in film as
Hollywood producer prime suspect in
murder of film editors so there could be
so many people it could be a lot of
people yeah it could be a lot of people
it could it could possibly be said the
press the editors are fine okay we have
not seen alive I'm not seeing them guys
so basically you know if this film on
the script we're always talking about
the plot but if you pause this movie you
can always see other things so once you
see this film - the majority of you guys
like try and like like look at anywhere
apart from the main action the second
time you see them the second time you
see or the first time if you want to pay
attention for clues but like this every
single line of text in this movie
whether it's the side text messages if
you open up iMessage or every single
email or every single description of
every finder file what date that was
added the size of the file the type of
the file every time every single web
site it all was written by us for this
movie so like every single line sort of
like had to have added significance and
there's a lot of clues side stories
subplots everything going on so we had a
lot of time for fun I mean my favorite
one that a nice road was early on when
you see you know David texting with his
daughter one of the side taxes from a
woman named Hannah who I guess he'd gone
on like a harmonie date the week before
and she's like hey had a great dinner
would love to get a drink and then
couple days into the movie she follows
up no response and then like when his
daughter's missing everyone knows about
it she's like oh your daughter's missing
maybe next weekend like so it's like
like we we like we want you know the
movie so tense like there's all these
really fun subplots and in huge Easter
eggs that no one hasn't you know people
haven't caught yet so we're gonna be
really excited you can use the movie
together if you look to the left and
right but I don't think like the first
time we're trying to kind of distract
you it's hard because I mean cuz going
back to it like having that camera
mostly centered on John's face his
reactions his eyes and eyebrows tell so
much I'm wondering John as you're
filming this how did you link like the
emotionality of it but also just the
technical hurdle of kind of being
between like literally being wedged
between two cameras one in front of one
kind of behind
yeah uh I felt you know kind of a little
lost or I was just struggling with my
performance of the whole movie it turned
out okay but uh he's great he's a
phenomenal yeah but yeah this is so
unlike anything I've ever done before
that it was I just didn't have anything
to hold on to and you know and also
there were no people on set and so I was
doing all of the I was performing alone
and that's really unnatural I always try
to avoid even blocking scenes sometimes
people like blocking is like how you
staged a scene and and sometimes
directors like people you know that shot
of the guy talking gazing out the window
and ruminating to a person behind him
and sometimes it directors will like
that kind of staging and and I don't
even like that because I want to if
there's a person in the room I want to
look at them and talk because it always
gets it's the best way to a good
performance and so not having a person
on set was was strange and difficult so
it just really was about being super
specific like even some of those like
there's cats with other characters
they're not even like in like another
room or in the part of the studio it
sometimes there were Debra Messing was
on location she was in another room and
we communicated by an earpiece but
that's also another weird thing for me
just having an earpiece in and she was
on the screen but we couldn't do
normal-size because this program
wouldn't allow us to expand this video
of Debra Messing in this other room
that's like this size I like we kept
trying to open it up but it wouldn't let
it to be clear we were using software
that you used to set up security systems
in your homes
yeah there were supposed to be four
cameras we only had one yeah so we have
a unique thing here we have a gentleman
where the first feature film an indie
film you've
produced several a wonderful independent
film trefi Fruitvale station but John
you've been in a lot of popular films
like the Star Trek series and Harold and
Kumar and I'm wondering what you guys
think of this proposal for the Academy
Awards of having a popular film genre I
don't know the details of what those
details are gonna be I certainly
personally you know appreciate the focus
on quality and I hope that that doesn't
obscure the overall goal of Academy
Awards which is to reward craftsmanship
well what do you bet you guys isn't like
getting you guys I think we went from
having no shot at the Academy Awards
like one so it's pretty excited about
that no they haven't released any
details about how it's gonna work
you know what best popular film means
like what is the definition of a popular
film is its box office is it marketing
spend like we don't know any of that so
they just sort of announced it and I
think it's part of a larger proposal to
to kind of bring a viewership and
everything which but you know I love the
Oscar so I'm sure they're at it I mean I
don't like to pass judgment until we
have more information but I hate it like
I think like I think it's like I feel
like it take right now we have a point
five I think
I think totally about it I mean I just
worry him it might it might give films
that would otherwise be up for Best
Picture nominations like if I'm an
academy voter what I want to vote for a
black panther for Best Picture if it can
get most popular film like that's why
I'm not a fan of it perfect Panther
Award this year well you know what
because you actually you worked with
Ryan cooler and so uh if this had been
around for say something like Fruitvale
station that might be different than the
fact that his first major giant film
Black Panther has probably got a benefit
from this no I don't know I can't speak
for Ryan
but again in my opinion Black Panthers
should be up for Best Picture so
pivoting a little bit here so it's not
another series associated with you a
star track and I noticed that Star Wars
has been kind of doing these like b-side
movies where it's kind of like off the
main plot and there's like there was
solo this earlier this year I'm
wondering is there room for something
like a Sulu movie as well same letters
almost
[Laughter]
so really good character if solo why not
Sulu
yeah I'll produce yeah I mean he's on
he's on like the computer the whole time
right he's on the navigator
what if yeah what immunised did the
screen like the searching version of
Star Trek where it's just all the
computers I don't know that there is a
day on shooting Star Trek that Chris
Pine did not call me solo
what did he have a retort when he did no
no I answered you solo
you wouldn't do like a wookie thing you
know I'm not walking into that fair
enough Jon this is like a really weird
question sighs comment I love your over
here you have like the most amazing hair
and like I'm curious like do you use
like pomade you use like gel is it like
like egg whites like what it say I wish
I had that hair like all my life whale
blubber no no like artisanal though
probably right yeah so as we move moving
away from searching a little bit what
are some products you guys are be
working on next or hoping to work on
next um well you know one at a time I
can't really it's hard for me to
multitask on two major projects but our
next project right now when this has all
been like a result of you know our this
movie coming out of Sundance and now
coming out is that people actually care
about what else we want to make which is
like I never thought that that's what I
wanted but now that's all I want you
know and and we basically got a chance
to write another film that we've been
developing for a long time
about a year before in the editing room
of search or searching and basically
it's another thriller it's still about
parents and kids everything that we've
made so far has been about parents and
kids this one's about a mom and a
daughter it's very very very very very
dark and twisted it'll probably the only
truly dark thing that we make and it
definitively does not take place on
computer screens and it's called run and
we're shooting that hopefully in the
fall I'm doing a feature next that that
hasn't been announced so I I don't think
I should say anything Sulu the Star Trek
sorry so the last art direction and I'm
with the nation so seven I wrote run
together Steph is producing it I'm
directing it in the Natalie Kasabian's
also produced searching is also gonna be
producing that one as well yeah we
actually have a shout out to searching
and run that we can probably talk about
so in in the movie run our next movie
that's not on screens at one point a
character like desperately goes to a
computer and tries to look online for
information about something but the
Internet's disconnected and that's it so
like regular cameras so you've been like
oh you're doing a family sticking with a
kind of the family genre with the idea
of like a father looking for his
daughter I'm wondering or any of you
guys fathers Here I am and like how does
that when you see something like
searching like how does that affect the
way you look at the way your children
interface with the internet or with
social media you know my my oldest is 10
and he's not quite there but it's tough
that with what the film addresses is you
know we used to tell our children be
watch out for the the weirdos at the
park but now all the weirdos in every
Park in the world have access to your
child in his or her bedroom and so you
know what do you do with that I I don't
know because partially because my kid is
already more Internet or a computer
literate than me and I know that that
gap is only going to widen so I think it
probably has to do with being an actual
good parent but but making sure that
your children feel loved and safe so
that you know so that they protect
themselves I don't know this whole
family thing I will say like I'm gonna
go back to Sundance which was forgive me
but it did remind me of this
and one more political point which is
that you know when we premiered the
movie and I it was so interesting
because I we made this movie and it was
wonderful to sort of have the the
politics of it be absent or the the
representation question largely be
absent while we were making we were so
sort of focused on making a working
thriller but it wasn't really it didn't
hit me in an emotional way until we were
at Sundance and saw a family and that's
what really did it for me because I've
noticed that some of you are Asian I you
know let me know if you agree with this
but so much of Asian representation in
film has been our families is you know
that generational story where an Asian
person is running away from their family
to find love so which implies that love
is excluded from your nuclear family and
that culture prohibits Asian culture
prohibits love or even lust you know and
I always thought that that was bullshit
and hated it and it was at Sundance when
I saw this complete family you know the
the film is premise tap on you know my
character is a widower
and her shadow the mother shadow is very
long through the film because it's
really about two people me and my
daughter mourning separately for the
same person in a different way and so
it's a family trying to be united and
it's a loving complete Asian American
family and it was not until we were at
Sundance and I was watching the audience
watch our film that it hit me like a ton
of bricks
because Sundance I guess is to me the
most important Film Festival in the
world
all right makes sense so let's give a
big hand to these guys for coming out
they're coming out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
