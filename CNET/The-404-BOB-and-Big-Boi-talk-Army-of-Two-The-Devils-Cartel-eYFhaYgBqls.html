guests up in the floor floor lab we got
bov and Big Boy let's make some noise so
what brings you guys here I know you
guys gotta help that with the game army
or two the devils cartel right well uh
how'd you guys help out with that well
there's like they reached out to us and
you know who else better to pick the two
players from the lamb you know just I
mean just all day yeah just the game is
a co-op game you know and they wanted a
dynamic duo it was cartel you know army
or two and you know
ambos yeah with the RAM bro we're going
to Mexico protect them politicians still
in drugs nice living cocaine a shoe drug
though you guys did a song double or
nothing for the as a soundtrack right um
but you guys are also in the game right
you guys are a couple of characters in
the game and you went through the whole
process yes and for everybody who
pre-orders the game that gets a play as
US special mission and you know get the
pic of custom skins cuz of mass weapons
that we weaponized I know I'm saying so
so is that only if you pre-order the
game yes yes pre-order the game oh lord
have the got cold i don't i don't have a
goggle yeah infinite lives you never die
so what came first was a double or
nothing or was the game that came first
and then you use made the song afterward
um well actually we got requested for
the song first and got the track for the
song but then we actually ended up doing
all the motion capture stuff before we
actually recorded the song so we went in
and you know had on a tight cat suits
like a batman christian bale batman suit
uh you know Jamaican bobsled suit it
sounds comfortable yeah you know about
hundreds of cameras around you and you
know acting out the script and we did
that for like five or six hours and then
that night winning studio and just
clicked off man you know and did the
record now I know you have experience in
acting played roles before how is it
different like was it a lot harder to be
in this suit and all these little balls
all over you well it was hard for my
balls because it was like two sides
slung to the side maybe if he wasn't a
slung you know we did that it was a
little uncomfortable at first but you
know you get into it it was it was a
girl out there so you know it was great
living work there wasn't a sausage party
per se night but we had a good time yeah
that's cool that's cool so I going back
to the song I know you guys have had
made music together in the past yeah um
and big boy you could you're definitely
a vet in the game in the hip hop game
hbu be i consider you probably in the
new school you know
I know me I'm a young prince don't say
shit you're very I mean we were talking
about how young you are make us feel
like some losers aren't you crazy like
I'm like unless you wikipedia people
don't know that I'm 24 some people think
I'm like older yes a lot of rappers get
in the game all these days yeah yeah no
doubt no doubt and they followed it so
so being from two different generations
you guys came together but it seemed to
work so flawlessly why do you think that
is it because you guys are from Atlanta
or is it just go past that I think
because it means is natural chemistry
you know when you and the vicinity or in
the presence of another dope MC like to
get in the studio and work is nothing
for us so you know we traded bars like
it was just sparring actually you know
so I mean we around brothers I can wrap
this it makes a pretty easy you know
saying one thing I notice about big is
that no matter what direction no matter
how genetically modified the rap
industry goes and big as always has been
doing his own thing this is on sound so
you know what kind of gives the artist
like me you know hope that you know
saying is is is there's a definitely a
chance for a brighter day you know let
me let me touch on that little bit more
because both you guys are really pushing
the sound not just for the south but for
hip hop because and and I would say you
guys don't have the traditional like
South Sound definitely as rappers you do
but you guys are definitely pushing
something outside of the box now I just
moved out here a year ago and I was
checking out a lot of young cats
everybody's on that quote unquote trap
you know ratchet sound right now how do
you guys feel about that because I mean
that originated in the south you know
what I'm saying and now you got these
people that aren't from the South that
are adapting to that you know I'm saying
yeah I mean man it's like you know I
want to say monkey see monkey do it's
like you know I mean you just gotta
really sometimes when it's hard for you
to pull from your inner creative person
and do things you really have to follow
with the trend is no answer I mean to be
on outskirts be able to make music that
you love and and that's challenging for
you to make you know it's definitely
more gratifying than just following what
everyone
else is doing I mean it's more fun for
me that way I'll know five part of
things and then and it for me my whole
thing is always been you know there was
I remember the whole swag movement with
that when that first star I did a
freestyle you know side of the
freestyles like you know I guess people
interpreted as me going against it but
really it just got so monotonous that it
was like shit yeah say some somebody
just do some do everything swears like
so now I guess I guess it's in that same
like I honestly me being from the south
because I grew up around it so I didn't
think ratchet will become like the trend
definitely yeah and it's in right now so
I mean how do you guys feel I mean do
you take that as a compliment or do you
see and like okay here we go again I
mean just like you know is it's like
they're like you said there it is again
you know and but I mean when something
special happens with some special type
of music hits then it stands out apart
from the rest of it you know I'm saying
so you just got to really keep creating
that's name of the game you know you
can't ever really knock artists for what
they feel safe at doing you know i'm
sami some people just don't have balls
yeah to kind of step out of their
comfort zone hey they just think got a
tea bag dang baby I got a tea bag skills
then got the bag they got the bag
excellent but as you think about the
video game again cuz uh you know I was
looking through you guys as files here
and strange clouds is actually an iOS
game that's out right now I feel like
every time we talk about video games it
always goes back to like the console
versus like the smartphone gaming thing
and I see you got an iphone there do you
guys do both or is you do one over the
other you guys still into the console
thing I mean we're talking about double
dragon earlier so I know you guys got a
history oh I'm a console guy yeah I mean
that's what a harder video game is gonna
be I'm never gonna be like man just
gaming having gaming all day swiping
okay yes that's but that's but for
airports and you know in lobbies you
know exactly when you have nothing else
yeah right exactly the tetris hand
that's what it is yeah but you know i
mean foot for you know jaan road though
is definitely consoles on the bus
and you take it you know away from home
and you just you play like that so yeah
I mean kids are more into the handphone
games or whatever that that in working
women yeah always timeless yeah working
with so when is the game coming out was
March 26 on xbox 360 and playstation 3
um once again so how do they get you
guys as characters on the game man we
had to go through a facial I mean
everything from from a sensor picking up
every contour detail in our face to the
gum line I mean everything then to to
the we had they had sensors on the side
of our eyes that monitored our ball
movement so like even when we closed
eyes can tell you where we're looking in
the only way you can play as us you got
to pre-order the game gamestop calm or
army of two calm and you only have a few
days left cuz games come out under 26
and you could play as us and there's
special missions get special gun skins
and the whole nine yards so yeah you
want to check that out so big why you've
been in a game before a beer we have you
been in a game before this is my first
time but what about the future gonna be
do more games man you know what I was
thinking about you know being in a game
uh but I'm trying to figure out what i'm
going to do you know i'm saying so many
things i love me from just from women to
weed I mean Mary Jane yeah I mean plants
that's what I mean you know it there's a
game though I think with Africa was
caught us on the phone though us up now
yeah well you plant plants and then you
don't tell them up and they come to the
monsters come try to eat up your plants
so let's plan for assignment I love that
so I just couldn't I didn't I did I

time I had my old family my wife my kids
