welcome to the Apple byte we know it's a
different mood here with the passing of
Steve Jobs at the age of 56 and we
wanted to use this show to say thank you
Tim for making a real impact and
influencing all of our lives and for
generations to come
SJ brought a childlike joy to many of us
with products that he personified and
when he took the stage for his keynotes
or what onlookers started calling Steve
notes we were all watching really cool
piece of hard work we're really excited
about this one of the most amazing
things we've ever created these
beautiful things we've ever made this is
really hot an all-new design let me show
it to you this is it right here this is
what it looks like this is the result we
show to you now there it is
it is the thinnest even thinner faster
thinner it is the thinnest of fun too
small nothing even approaching this
amazing stunning just beautiful
beautiful it's really beautiful really
nice gorgeous how thin it is fantastic
incredible astounding and it feels even
better in your hand almost flows very
beautiful I'm still stuck I forgot there
is one last thing you know there was
always one more thing from Steven we'll
always miss that now I didn't realize
that I would actually have such strong
feelings about his passing in I wasn't
the only one after learning of his death
people went to a place where they felt
connected to him the Apple Store so
here's a collection of their thoughts
and reactions
Jia's only comes around once I know
couple centuries so like this
sing thanks and you know recipes I think
through Apple and iPhone and everything
is gonna leave all
I don't really think that words can
really describe like anything about
Steve other than just greatness it's
just right to do you know to respect a
guy who had given the world so much like
in terms of technology and you know
rejuvenated a company that was on the
edge of disaster
mr. Jobs was a visionary who changed the
world and changed the face of technology
and his perfectionism shows itself and
everything he did and this is where we
go to recognize what his achievements
I was founder and CEO of an app
development company he made that entire
company possible I wouldn't have been
doing what I was doing for last few
years if it wasn't for the iPhone and
his inventions just feel incredibly sad
I think the world over has lost a really
incredible man and a visionary and he
will be he'll be deeply missed Apple
stores also turned off the light behind
their iconic logo to remember Steve but
those crowds will soon be replaced with
the iPhone 4s launching in the next week
we're not done talking about Steve yet
and his legacy will be felt throughout
Apple's future products including the
iPhone 4s so here's a preview of what
you guys can expect when it launches
Brian Shawn here with cnet.com from our
headquarters in San Francisco California
with our recap of the iPhone 4s now the
phone looks a lot like this the iPhone 4
and we know from your feedback that
plenty of you we're hoping for something
more design wise but really its biggest
improvements are under the hood now the
iPhone 4s is loaded with an a5 dual-core
processor which apple claims has twice
the power and seven times faster
graphics for gaming while also improving
talktime battery life by an hour so
we'll see how it fares in our lab tests
the Florist also improves on one of the
best smartphone cameras on the market
with an eight megapixel camera that now
shoots 1080p video they've also made
improvements to the antenna design and
the phone has faster mobile data speeds
with HSDPA compatibility it will get all
the new features in iOS 5
but exclusive to the iPhone 4s will be
Siri they like to call it their
intelligent voice assistant you hold on
to the home button to initiate the
feature and then you can ask it
questions like what's the weather find
the nearest burger restaurants near you
or create reminders with your voice
remind me to grab the present when I get
home
to reminder for when you get home it's
the next level voice control in
interaction with the phone so once we
get our hands on it we'll see if it's as
impressive as it looks now the iPhone 4s
will be available on AT&amp;amp;T Verizon and
now Sprint in the United States it's
also a world phone that's compatible on
GSM and CDMA networks it will come in
two colors black and white and three
flavors the 16-gig will be $1.99 with
the two-year contract the 32gig will be
$2.99 and the all-new 64 gig capacity
will be 399 pre-orders start online on
October the 7th and the phone will go on
sale on October the 14th so there you
have it
i'm brian Thomasina comm and there's
your quick recap of the iphone 4s now we
know there was a lukewarm reception when
it was announced but it really has the
guts of a next generation phone and with
everything that's happened in the past
week calling the iPhone 4s the iPhone 4
Steve doesn't really feel that silly at
all now we wanted to leave you with a
feature that was put together by our
team with Brian Cooley and it's a
retrospective profiling the highs and
lows of Steve Jobs career he had an
amazing run and he was a man so unique
we probably won't see anyone like him in
our lifetime thank you Steve for
everything and we'll all miss you you
have to trust that the dots will somehow
connect in your future you have to trust
in something your gut destiny life karma
whatever because believing that the dots
will connect down the road will give you
the confidence to follow your heart even
when it leads you off the well-worn path
a philosophy Steve Jobs learned to
embrace after a life of victories
setbacks and surprising diversions that
made him an agent of change in how we
communicate and are entertained he is
gone but his vision of our digital world
very much remains the story of his life
in technology played out in three acts
the magnitude of which can only really
be seen now looking back
act 1 it's 1977 Jobs and Apple
co-founder Steve Wozniak introduced the
Apple to the first successful personal
computer but 1984 brought a much bigger
milestone the first personal computer
that was really personal today for the
first time ever I'd like to let
Macintosh speak for itself
with a graphical interface Mouse
creative software and whimsical design
it was a completely different animal
from the sterile machines coming from
Microsoft and Intel just as different
was the TD commercial that announced the
Mac one they still talked about in the
ad business today and which showed jobs
new technology sells better with a
little height but none of that would be
enough to hold back the juggernaut of
Intel and Microsoft and the difficulties
Apple faced in growing the Mac business
led to jobs being shown the door at his
own company in 1985 I was basically
fired from Apple uno his food that was
difficult
when it happened but maybe the best
thing that ever happened to me at 2:00
shortly after Jobs ouster he founds next
to produce a new kind of advanced
workstation computer that runs on an
object-oriented software architecture
which would become the basis of a
dramatically new and better Mac OS years
later
similarly telling was the design of the
next machine stylish austere and
breaking convention sound familiar
in 1986 Jobs also acquired the graphic
arts division of Lucasfilm turning it
into Pixar the studio that mainstreamed
animated features and can boast that its
films deliver the highest average gross
revenue of any studio in the film
industry but in classic form act 3 with
jobs biggest he retook the helm of a
nearly bankrupt Apple and introduced the
iMac the following year with what was
the first of what we now call a Steve
note iMac comes from the marriage of the
excitement of the internet with the
simplicity of Macintosh it was the first
personal computer designed around the
Internet what Bill Gates and Microsoft
Word of the PC era Jobs was about to
become to the Internet and eventually
mobile era we got a lot of incredible
stuff to show you today his presentation
skills at events such as mac world would
become legendary examples of showmanship
and star power in industry it's really
beautiful this is what it looks
detractors would derive jobs hype as a
reality distortion field but the iMac
worked and Apple began to turn around
but Jobs single biggest course change
for Apple was not a computer but the
iPod what is iPod but I haven't had one
right here in my pocket in fact there it
is right there
introduced in October 2001 it was small
in size spacious and capacity and looked
good but more importantly it diversified
Apple away from head-on competition with
the wind tail computer makers while
luring away their customers when iTunes
launched Windows support in October of
oh three I'm here to report to you today
that this has happened
Apple began to rewrite the music
business become a major media player and
got its first taste of market dominance
but in terms of financial success
nothing tops the Apple product that was
built on the shoulders of the iPod
today Apple is going to reinvent the
phone but Jobs and Apple showed an
uncanny ability to once again get the
formula right appear the originator and
make a piece of advanced technology
seems simple magical and fashionable
with that same DNA the iPad arrived in
April 2010 we'd like to show it to you
today for the first time and we call it
the iPad and again legitimize the
category that other companies had only
nibbled at the edges of for year it's so
much more intimate than a laptop and
it's so much more capable than a
smartphone Apple has had its share of
flops but they mostly pale compared to
its hits and there were always notes of
hubris around the latter day company
seen most in jobs almost dismissing
documented problems with the iPhone
fours antenna we think it's affecting a
small percentage of users and we think
some of that problem is inherent in most
every smartphone but mostly apples since
Jobs return has been a culture changer
as much as a technology company one of
the biggest success stories in American
business and virtually indivisible from
the identity of its CEO and it seems
right that the best epitaph for him
might be found in the words of an Apple
TV commercial but wasn't really selling
anything except Apple and while some may
see them as the crazy ones
we see genius because the people who are
crazy enough to think they can change
the world are the ones who do
