make Apple a little nervous I'm Bridget
Carey this is your CNET update Samsung
just announced two large screen
smartphones the galaxy note 5 and the
galaxy s6 edge+
both of these models have new features
that will challenge whatever new iPhones
Apple plans to unveil next month let's
start with the galaxy note 5 it could
become the new BlackBerry the ultimate
phone for getting work done not only
does it have a built-in stylus for
jotting down notes which has been
redesigned and it can be used when the
screen is turned off but it also has a
cover keyboard accessory for $80 this
keyboard with physical Keys snaps on the
front or you can move it to the back
when you don't need it the note has some
style to boot it trades in the cheap
plastic and fake leather backing for a
shiny metal design it's also loaded with
Samsung pay which I'll explain in a
moment
Samsung has a new trick to take on Apple
it's selling this phone now the same day
it's announced and it hits us stores
next week on Friday August 21st
that gives it a two and a half week head
start with Apple's expected iPhone
announcement also coming out that day is
another model the galaxy s6 edge+ this
is just a super-sized version of the
galaxy s6 edge that came out earlier in
the year in fact it's the same screen
size as the new note I was talking about
it measures 5.7 inches it even has all
the same hardware specs as the new note
and it works with that snap-on keyboard
the difference is that the edge screen
curves over the sides which has some
feature perks like getting highlights of
your notifications on the curve and it
does not come with a stylus both phones
are boasting new faster wireless
charging by putting it on a wireless
charging map Samsung says full charge
from am beautiful now takes two hours
instead of three samsung pay is on both
of these phones which has one major
difference from Apple pay the store
doesn't need to have a special NFC
reader you can't have to pay on most
retailers machines that have a basic
magnetic stripe card reader the top to
face service launches first in Korea
then in the US on September
twenty-eight and it arrives soon after
for the UK Spain and China Samsung also
wants to make it easier for you to
livestream video to the world but not by
using an app like periscope or meerkat
but with a tool called live broadcast
that lets you send your video feed
instantly to YouTube and finally Samsung
teased us with a glimpse of its upcoming
round SmartWatch the gear s2 it's the
first round watch from Samsung and it's
the first SmartWatch since the Apple
watch landed in April we'll know more
about it on September 3rd at the IFA
tech trade show in Berlin that's it for
this tech news update you can dive into
more details on the new phones at
