here's is happening this week on Fiat's
crave the US Navy has a new drone and it
looks exactly like a sharp now this is
terrifying for me because I'm even
scared of inflatable sharks and swimming
pools the drone is called the ghost
swimmer scary all one word and it is
five feet long and weighs about a
hundred pounds ghost swimmer was
developed as part of the Navy silent
Nemo project which sounds innocent
because of the name Nemo but it's
actually terrifying if you think about
the reality the ghost swimmer drone
shark can swim to depths of 300 feet and
can be autonomous or piloted via laptop
from 500 feet away the Navy plants use
ghost swimmer for a variety of purposes
including aiding and low visibility
intelligence surveillance and
reconnaissance missions as well as whole
inspections of friendly ships but you
can bet your bottom dollar that
eventually that will be outfitted with
lasers on their heads in honor of the
release of the Hobbit movie this week
Hollywood prop designer Tim Baker in a
team of his colleagues built a Lord of
the Rings cat litter box along with a
tower of Sauron cat scratching post for
superfan Misha and his kids what
the project was featured on youtubes on
me channel in an episode of super fan
builds where they build cool stuff like
weapons that are featured in popular
movies well this cat litter box is an
impressive work of Hollywood magic and
fabrication worth taking a closer look
at NASA scientists have announced that
they have detected an increase in
holiday lights that are visible from
space images captured by Swami NPP a
satellite that is a joint mission
between NASA and the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration show a
seasonal increase in light coming from
US cities according to NASA scientists
and member of the Swami npp land
disciplined team Miguel Roman it's a
near ubiquitous signal despite being
ethnically and religiously diverse we
found that the u.s. experience is a
holiday increase that is present across
most urban communities these lighting
patterns are tracking a national shared
tradition roman notes that the trend
begins around black friday continues
through New Year's Day mars curiosity
has found organic matter on the planet
Mars now my conspiracy theory friend
John would say that NASA's been
withholding this information for years
but this is finally some definitive
proof a company with an official
statement from NASA these organic
molecules consisting primarily of carbon
hydrogen and oxygen atoms are the
building blocks of all life on Earth
however it is important to note that
these molecules may not have come from
life-forms on Mars the team responsible
for curiosity's sample analysis at Mars
instrument suite have several hypotheses
the first is of course a biological
process others include chemical
reactions in water at ancient Hot
Springs on the red planet your arrival
from off-planet via dust meteorites
asteroids or comets some molecules were
found in a drilled sample in the sheep
bed mudstone of the Gale Crater the
location of curiosities exploration
the mudstone on the crater floor is
consistent with the clay found on earth
from dried up lakes formed from sediment
on the lake floor creating optimum
conditions for the preservation of
organic matter alright guys that's the
