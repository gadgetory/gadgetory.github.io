Bridget Carey on cnet.com and it's time
to get loaded amazon already has its own
App Store for Android but now it's
taking a page out of the Apple playbook
and is testing in app purchases it's a
way an app can charge users for add-on
services and features from inside the
app and Amazon with still look at a
thirty percent cut of the sales
bloomberg reports that there's been a
pilot program for a month with a company
called skin below which sells physical
fitness programs this could bring a
whole new level of apps and usefulness
to Amazon's Kindle Fire tablet which
uses android apps facebook is under fire
for lack of women and diversity in its
leadership a new movement has launched
called the phasic campaign and it's
designed to draw attention to the fact
that the board of Facebook consists only
of seven white men since the world's
largest social network is about to go
public after announcing a five billion
dollar initial public offering the
phasic campaign says a change is needed
in the board to better reflect
Facebook's own mission to make the world
more open and connected Facebook is not
the only tech company to exclude women
from its board Twitter paypal and four
squares boards or all-male Apple Amazon
and Groupons boards have just one woman
and as for Google three of its 10 board
members or women Facebook CEO Mark
Zuckerberg has gone on the record in the
summer about why the board has no women
he told The New Yorker that quote I'm
going to find people who are helpful and
I don't particularly care what gender
they are or what company they are I'm
not filling the board with checkboxes
the latest buzz about the next iPhone is
that it will come out this summer a
recruiter at Foxconn that's the factory
where apple products are made told the
TV tokyo reporter that the plant is
hiring 18,000 people to make the iphone
5 which is going on sale in june hmm and
speaking of Foxconn the factory is
pledging to pay workers more and cut
back hours in response to complaints
about its labor practices the fair labor
association conducted an audit of the
Chinese factory used to make apple
products and other popular gadgets and
most workers put in more than 60 hours a
week and workers were not being fairly
compensated for overtime or for the cost
of living there's drama in the mobile
payment world one of the co-founding
engineers of Google Wallet has quick
Google to join square the engineer
worked on technology that lits users
just wave their Google Wallet phone over
a sensor to make a payment so perhaps
Square might be adding this tech to its
payment offerings since Google Wallet
has launched in May it's been plagued by
security concerns and not many consumers
are using it because it only works with
one phone those are your headlines for
today I'm Bridget Carey with cnet com
