like learning a new language or learning
a magic trick or playing the guitar I've
been using the iPhone 10 for a couple of
days now and it's got a whole bunch of
new features and a whole bunch of new
gestures and they're pretty different
than the other iPhones that have come
before it but don't worry that's why I'm
here
I'm gonna teach you the iPhone 10 there
used to be a home button on the phone
that's gone instead you swipe up from
the bottom to flick your way out of an
app so to go through that again it's a
quick gesture and you flick the question
is will that affect any apps that you
use so far not yet what happened to
Control Center it used to be a swipe up
now it's a swipe down from the top right
to get to all of your shortcuts don't do
swipe down from the middle that's your
notifications it's the top right to get
into your phone in the first place if
you have face ID you lift wait for the
unlock and then swipe up it doesn't have
to be that slow though if you want to
speed it up a bit you could lift the
phone swipe up and then wait for the
unlock to kick in how do you get to the
rest of your open apps you swipe up from
the bottom and hold and it brings them
all up they have to bring it up and hold
so again swipe up and hold and then if
you want to close an app if you want to
force quit you tap and hold on an app
and then these little red things appear
you tap on one and it's gone if you
wanted to quick multitasking on the
iPhone 10 all you have to do is look for
the black bar on the bottom and then do
a swipe to the left or right to look at
all the apps that are open and quickly
swap between them how do you get to Siri
it's hiding inside the side button click
and hold and Siri is waiting for you
how do you turn off your phone it
doesn't happen with the side button
anymore that just puts your phone to
sleep instead you hold that button and
you hold the bottom volume button at the
same time and that brings up not just
power off but SOS mode if you see
something you like you you want to take
a screenshot you hold the side button
and the top volume button to take the
screenshot now once you've done that in
iOS 11 you can then choose to edit it
before saving or deleting Apple pay used
to be a double click on the home button
now it's a double click on the side
button bring it up and then when you
look at the phone in a nabel's face ID
for Apple pay and finally one more thing
to keep in mind with the iPhone 10 to
wake it up you don't even need to click
any button just tap the screen
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
