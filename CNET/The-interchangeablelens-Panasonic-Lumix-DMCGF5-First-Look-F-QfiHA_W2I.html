the panasonic lumix DMC gf5 remains
among my favorite choices for snap
shooters who are looking for a faster
better camera but when it's similar
enough to a point-and-shoot or a phone
that they're not forced out of their
comfort zone while the bodies compact
sturdily constructed and very similar to
the G f3 Panasonic is added a few
physical controls that had disappeared
from that model but the most important
physical change over the G f3 is the new
grip the GF 3s was very slippery and
this larger rubberized grip is huge
improvement especially if you need to
shoot one-handed the camera keeps the
direct access intelligent Auto button
that Panasonic wisely puts on top of all
of its models my only wish is that when
you pressed it it didn't override your
autofocus settings the camera operates
much like a point-and-shoot albeit with
more sophisticated options such as the
ability to fully customize the Quick
Menu interface to go with the new higher
resolution LCD Panasonic redesigned the
look of the touchscreen interface and
it's a lot more attractive than before
it also incorporates the flyout tab that
debuted in the GX 1 as well as interface
hints the new touch screen is very
nicely responsive as with the G f3
you can tilt the flash backwards to
produce more attractive flash exposures
as well the power zoom kit lens is
convenient and it collapses to make a
very compact package but it's a so-so
lens and reaching that zoom switch is
annoyingly awkward the GF 5s feature set
is pretty standard for its class though
it is one of the few models that still
has a built-in flash and if you're a
touchscreen addict you'll probably
consider the ability to operate the
power zoom lens via the screen a very
nice feature it also has a full
complement of configurable special
effects and it saves a raw file
simultaneously when you use them though
it's the same resolution as the GF 3 the
GF 5 incorporates a new version of the
12 megapixel sensor and enough
version of its image processing engine
there's some improvement in the noise
profile and JPEG processing over the gf3
especially at low ISO sensitivities that
seems partly because the image coming
off the sensor looks less noisy an
expected advancement from one generation
to the next
however although the colors look very
nice and the default settings push
saturation and contrast gently enough
that there's no discernible huge shift
and while it has a reasonable dynamic
range you do lose some detail in shadow
areas that can't be recovered without
introducing color noise none of this is
unusual in the price class though
metering and exposures generally on
target and JPEG photos look slightly
over sharpened but not crunchy and
finally the video quality is fine for
typical consumer use
you know vacation clips cat antics and
kitty goalscoring the full time
autofocus pulses a bit but works well
enough
well the gf3 is fast the GF 5 is faster
most important from a performance
perspective though the camera never
slows you down while you're shooting a
problem which I've encountered with some
of the higher resolution models shooting
raw plus JPEG feels fast and fluid and
they never had to wait for the camera to
finish writing an image file before I
could review a shot or change the
settings and the LCD is sufficiently
visible in direct sunlight which is
essential since the camera doesn't
support an add-on viewfinder
I think the sony alpha NE xf 3 has
somewhat better photo quality overall
and that one has a tilting LCD but
otherwise i like the design and
interface of the GF 5 better i'm laura
grinning and this is the panasonic lumix
