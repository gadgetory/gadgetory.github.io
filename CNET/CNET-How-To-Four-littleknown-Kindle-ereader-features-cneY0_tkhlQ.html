paperwhite or voyage are easy enough but
if you're new to Kindle or you just want
to get more out of your device here are
some of my favorite tips ebooks aren't
the only things you can read on your
Kindle you can also get Microsoft Word
documents PDFs and even view photos
right on your device for reference or
for later reading there are several ways
to go about this but the most
straightforward method is to email those
files directly to your device to do that
you'll need to find your Kindles email
address so from the menu head on over to
settings and then select device options
here select personalize your Kindle and
then you'll see your son - Kindle email
now you can compose an email to that
address attach your file and within a
minute or so you'll see the doc show up
in your carousel another handy trick is
taking a screenshot it is great for when
you want to save a photo from a book or
save a page for reference to take a
screenshot just tap the upper left and
the lower right corner at the same time
the screen will flash letting you know
the screenshot was saved then to access
that file plug your Kindle in to your
computer open the drive and you'll see
all of your screenshots in the root
folder
you can do a similar thing with
highlights any passages you highlight in
a book are automatically saved to a file
on your device which you can access on
your computer when your device is
connected look for the Documents folder
double click the my clippings file and
you'll see all of your highlights in
text format you can also view all of
your highlights and annotations by going
to kindle amazon.com slash your
underscore highlights and finally it's
worth knowing that the button on the
back of your kindle actually has two
functions tapping it once puts the
device to sleep which is great for
saving battery but if you keep holding
it you'll see a menu where you can
choose to restart the device this is
really useful for when your Kindle
starts acting weird or slowing down if
you have any questions or tips of your
own hit me up on Twitter and check out
