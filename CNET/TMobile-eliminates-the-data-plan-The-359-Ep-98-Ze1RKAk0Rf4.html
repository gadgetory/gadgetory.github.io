the top tech news of the day and all the
other crap we want to throw in I'm Joni
salzman and with me is Sam roads hello
and in a first for the 359 we have a
special guest dialing in to discuss our
top news for today t mobile tmobile is
getting rid of data plans the carrier
said today that it will offer just one
unlimited data plan instead of the
different data levels for different
prices joining us to explain more is
Maggie Reardon one of cnet's most senior
reporters who has been covering mobile
news for years hi Maggie hi thanks for
having me great to have you so tell me
Maggie what does this change mean for
t-mobile customers well now it means
that everybody there's going to be only
one plans that they offer postpaid
customers and it'll be unlimited and to
get in is just you know one person it'll
be seventy dollars a month which you
know it's pretty good for unlimited you
know currently they charge 95 dollars a
month for their unlimited plan but it
also means that like the cheaper plan
you know the two big plan is going away
that one was I think fifty dollars a
month so you're going to have to pay
twenty dollars more even if you don't
use that much data if you want to be on
t-mobile's postpaid plan now what they
say is if you're a light data user you
can go to a prepaid plan and get into
that at you know about thirty dollars a
month but still I mean you know they say
they're making things less complicated
but yeah I'm not sure how really
uncomplicated things are you still have
to look sit down with your calculator
and figure out which plan is going to be
best for you right it sounds like some
people are going to be saving so many
people that were already heavy users
people that already had the unlimited
plan but people that were trying to save
money with a lower plan might end up
paying more is that right yeah and you
know all of this is being enabled
because of what t-mobile says was their
success with their binge on program
which was basically you could get free
you could watch some videos because they
were basically compressing
all the video so now what they're going
to do is they're going to do that sort
of across the board and every video that
you want to watch is going to be free
will anything you want to access I mean
so they say it's not really free because
you're so paying 70 bucks a month but
there's no limit essentially so you know
it's interesting I do think this is sort
of a new day for wireless because what
we're seeing here is the carriers are
trying to make their network more
efficient so that they can give more
more data away I guess so people don't
have to worry about like am I going to
go over my data cap and usually video
has been a big suck for that so now you
know so we'll see if others are able to
follow already Sprint is saying that
they're going to do the same thing and
they're also going to be compressing
data so i don't know maybe we'll see
Verizon and t-mobile eventually bring
unlimited back yeah so it sounds like
how does this compare to what Verizon
and AT&amp;amp;T are doing those are the two big
dogs the t-mobile is going up against
yeah well currently you can't get an
unlimited plan if you're a new custard
customer to AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon they got
rid of those plans years ago there are a
few stragglers who have kept on to their
their grandfathered plans but not many
of those folks still remain so you know
so right now the two big dogs still have
these plans now they've come out with
different pricing they're they're giving
customers more data but it's also
costing you more you know they've pumped
up the pricing on their plans and
they've also done something very
t-mobile like as well where if you go
over your plan you now don't necessarily
get hit with a big c or you know a
penalty you you can just keep keep using
your data but your service is slowed a
little bit now for that privilege
horizon is charging you five dollars a
month to do it and as John ledger the
t-mobile CEO called it he he basically
said it was like a mafia shakedown
okay uh yeah yes but you know he's a
pretty colorful guy as a color food user
yeah he's a lot of colorful language
like that yeah you Maggie thank you very
much yeah speaking of yikes McDonald's
had a fitness tracker for children and
it failed miserably yeah them skin
irritation and now no one wants them
yeah McDonald's was trying to its latest
attempt to get kids moving after they
binge on fries and burgers they offer
the began offering a step at activity
band it's basically a fitness tracker
for kids but they had to within days
remove the toy from happy meals because
of reports of skin irritation now
receiving limited reports but still I
mean nobody wants skin irritation when
they're trying to have their burgers and
fries yeah and you don't want to mess
around with anything that is causing
kids harm yeah especially if the point
is to get them to not be fat yeah that's
the point for all of our coverage check
us out on cnet big thanks to our guests
