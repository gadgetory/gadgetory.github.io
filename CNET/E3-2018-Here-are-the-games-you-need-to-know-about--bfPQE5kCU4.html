there's a lot of games going into the
show that we kind of knew about already
like the death strandings the fallout 70
citizens of the world but I want to
highlight the games that me getting know
a lot about maybe their surprise
announcement maybe there's a little more
clarity about what these games are like
so here are those games and you should
be keeping an eye on
all right so the first game I'm really
excited about is a game I had no idea
existed before the press conference RB
and that's called control and it's a new
game by remedy these guys made an Alan
Wake quantum break and a few other games
that have a lot of history in terms of
unique narrative storytelling don't know
a lot about what this game is it's sort
of like a strange telepathic MC escher
third-person sort of thing but it was
super intriguing it made a huge blast at
that Sony press conference and it's
definitely a game you gotta keep your
eye on the next game I think everyone
needs to start focusing on is anthem
okay
when anthem was first announced I'll be
honest I wasn't too psyched on what they
were kind of pitching through this game
but I've talked to a lot of people who
played the game here at e3 and I gotta
say they've kind of sold me on what this
game is about and mostly I'm really
psyched to sort of experiences is this
idea of the flying around in this game
everyone says it controls like a dream
and you know Bioware is really focusing
this game as a shooter first in an RPG
second and I know that kind of like
rings bells of Destiny perhaps but I
like the aesthetic of what anthem is
trying to do more so that has me more
intrigued about what's going on it's
open world there's a lot of exploration
going around
and everyone I talk to that's played
this game at 83 is sold on it and we're
not gonna have to wait that long to play
it because anthem comes out this
February Resident Evil 2 the remake why
because I had no idea this was gonna be
a game and it's a fully reimagined
remake and the best part about it is
that it's essentially Resident Evil 4
controls but that classic Resident Evil
2 gameplay which is going on 20 years
there's something about the fact that
this game coming out as a remake the
nostalgia factor it's like the first
time in video games that I felt the same
way I did about a movie remake where
it's sort of important and very well
realized re-envisioning of a really
legendary video game I'm super excited
for it and it comes out next year
here's another game I had no idea about
was only teased barish quickly by from
software this is their new game makers
of Dark Souls and blood-borne their
brand new game Sakura shadows that twice
Kumada a tree a lot of real mystery
surrounding what exactly this game was
going to be about and now we know action
which ends really tight for size control
don't really know much about how it
actually plays but really looking
forward to checking out their brand-new
game this is definitely one I
and you should do
and finally the last game we want to
talk about is obviously cyberpunk 2077
yes we knew this game was a thing
developer CD Projekt RED had announced
it a while back but after seeing almost
an hour of gameplay of this game I can
confidently say it was the best game I
saw at e3 opened up a brand new
cyberpunk world that is filled with
objectives unique character to strange
places to explore this game this style
and amazing sense of self-awareness and
I cannot wait to jump into it I can see
this game may be coming up by 2020 but
that's nothing but speculation so from
now until whenever this game comes out
I'm just gonna have to keep thinking
about this beam play session I saw
all right so that's it those are the
games you should have your eye on coming
out of e3 2018 thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
