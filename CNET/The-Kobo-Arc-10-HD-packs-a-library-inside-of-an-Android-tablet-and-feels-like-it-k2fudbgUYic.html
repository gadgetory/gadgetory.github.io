first look at the kobo arc 10hd this ten
inch android tablet is geared towards
avid readers with useful bacon software
that makes organizing buying and
exploring your books simple and it
doesn't skimp on the Android experience
giving you full Google Play Store access
it has a headphone jack as well as micro
USB and micro HDMI ports on the left
corner power slider on the top right
corner and volume buttons around the
edge the power slider feels a bit cheap
and there's always a lag when waking up
the tablet there's a fuzzy but decent
1.3 megapixel front facing camera and no
rear camera I like the tablets faceted
back it's smooth matte finish is
comfortable and my fingertips never got
tired or strained after holding it for a
long time however the Talbots designed
suffers from its heaviness and pointed
corners its hefty weight makes the
corners uncomfortably dig into your
palms and doesn't make for the coziest
reading session the Kobo arc 10hd
features a traditional android home
screen the reading life dashboard and a
collections menu the dashboard has appt
interesting look to it and displays a
mix of books you're reading
recommendations and other selections in
your library it isn't organized in any
particular way it's a bit messy and
there's a borderline overwhelming amount
of content being shared swiping right to
the left one more time takes you to your
collections which are like virtual
folders that allow you to save things
like articles and videos for easy
finding and viewing books and magazines
automatically sort into their respective
category but you can easily make your
own even though it's a tablet geared
towards bookworms the Kobo arc 10hd
could satisfy any movie buff it's sharp
2560 by 1600 pixel resolution displays
vibrant and saturated colors and HD
video looks crisp with rich tones
the kobo reader has many built-in useful
tools for organizing highlighting noting
and exploring your books it also
includes a reading mode which removes
distractions while reading the Kobo arc
10hd houses the zippy quad-core
processor and 2 gigabytes of RAM it
performed consistently smooth and I
rarely had any buggy issues with it
mobile games ran without a hitch and it
handles larger games well with moderate
load times and smooth gameplay the Kobo
is a great option for those who want
more than just a simple ereader
experience but it's uncomfortable design
flaws might be a deal-breaker for cnet
I'm xiomara Blanco and this has been the
Kobo arc 10hd tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
