facebook announced something but don't
call it email highlights from the 2010
LA auto show Google TV just can't catch
a break and a new app that's no tech
turkey it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of our bottom line
let's start with the good when is email
not email when it's brought to you by
Facebook of course earlier this week the
company announced a new communications
feature that will bring chat text
messages and even email into your
facebook inbox but they said it's not
email confused yet here's Rafe Needleman
to explain sort of hi this is Rafe
Needleman with a first look at facebook
messages this is the revamp of the
private person to person messaging
system within facebook there are some
big improvements facebook messages now
keeps all your conversations with their
contacts together no matter how they
communicate everything you say to people
and messages be it in an email message a
chat or an SMS has filed in one long
conversation thread in messages to reach
someone all you have to know is their
name facebook will find users wherever
they want to be found on the facebook
website and chat or on their mobile
phone depending on their preferences it
means you don't have to think about how
your message gets from you to them but
it doesn't post some limitations for
example there are no subject lines and
facebook messages essentially the
subject is now the relationship but as
facebook's goal was to combine SMS chat
and mail like messaging together there
really was no other way to blend the
communication modes facebook is clear to
say that messages isn't email in fact
but there is a little confusion on this
since facebook's messaging system now
for the first time actually gives
everyone on the network and optional
email address when the system is rolled
out everyone will have a facebook com
address you'll be able to receive
messages from the outside world to that
address and send from facebook to other
systems as well one of the other big
features of facebook messages is that by
default the only messages you see in
your inbox will be those from your
network of friends other messages like
invitations alerts and spam show up in
the other inbox and you have to promote
people to have messages from them appear
in your main inbox likewise you can
demote people so their communications
don't clutter your main
box if you prefer facebook messages is a
necessary and useful upgrade of the
platform's current very limited private
messaging system facebook says it's not
email and that's accurate the product is
missing standard features in email
there's no concept of a multi-person
conversation for example Facebook's has
the group's feature for that and you
can't even forward a message to someone
else at least not yet in this current
version it won't replace email for those
of us comfortable with that platform but
for younger users who communicate
primarily an SMS N and Facebook it's a
welcome upgrade facebook says messages
will roll out slowly over the next few
months and users will get an alert when
they log into their account when it's
enabled for it users who have messages
can also invite a very limited number of
their friends or seen it i'm rafe
needleman i really don't see how
facebook messages could be an actual
email killer although to be honest I
wouldn't have guessed that our company
would ditch outlook for Gmail either so
I guess Never Say Never now a few weeks
ago we showed you a preview of the new
color version of the barnes &amp;amp; noble nook
and we asked if maybe it wasn't more an
android tablet than just an e-reader
well here's David Carr nguoi with his
answer to that question I'm David Carr
no way and I'm going to give you a quick
tour of the barnes &amp;amp; noble nook color
back the end of 2009 bars owner will
released an ink reader the nook that
differentiate itself from the amazon
kindle by having a small color LCD at
the bottom of the screen for navigation
and keyboard entry among other things
now the company isn't messing around
with a strip of color is instead betting
the farm on a full color e-reader that
features a 7-inch touchscreen LCD
built-in Wi-Fi and as people asking is
it an e-reader or a tablet the short
answer is both or as barnes noble is
spinning it this is a reader's tablet it
just a shade less than a pound it's
about twice the weight of the latest
generation kindle but it is
significantly smaller than an ipad which
weighs in at around 1.5 pounds the color
screen is a next-generation LED backlit
display supplied by LG which is bright
yet energy-efficient the products
designers added a special layer of
laminate to the glass that covers the
display to help cut down on glare and
improve off-axis viewing however like
any screen that has a layer of glass
over it it's not immune to glare and
like the ipad screen it is a fingerprint
magnet and will potentially crack if
dropped that said the touch mechanics
are quite responsive and the device as a
whole is zippy for those who are hoping
for a full-fledged Android tablet you
get such features as web browsing and
multimedia functionality along with a
little Pandora and some basic games and
the ability to read format such as
Microsoft Office documents and PDF files
but one thing missing is android
marketplace yes more apps are on the way
but Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is really gearing
this toward readers first and those
looking for a multifunction device like
the iPad second we were generally
impressed with how elegant the user
interfaces and how easy the new color is
to operate and navigate well I selected
the designers included a physical home
button it's the end at the bottom of the
device rather than a virtual one the
hard but makes going back to the home
screen easier and it's well placed along
with its large selection of e-books the
company is making a bigger push into
kids content with its new new kids brand
that features digital picture books
designed to take advantage of such color
devices as a new color and the iPad the
same time the company is highlighting
how well the new color handles
periodical content particularly
magazines at the end of the day despite
the limited number of apps available at
launch the nook color is a much more
polished ereader than the original look
was when it launched we've called this
the poor man's ipad in the past and
while it doesn't offer nearly the range
of functionality from a reading
experience standpoint it certainly
rivals that of the ipad just on a
smaller more portable scale and at half
the price i'm david carr know and that's
the barnes &amp;amp; noble nook color e-reader
it may rival the iPad in terms of
reading books and magazines but I think
that's about it in fact I think we can
safely put the Nook back in the e-reader
bin for now the 2010 los angeles auto
show is going on right now and although
it's far from the biggest car show of
the year that doesn't mean you can't
find some surprises while you're there
or better yet why not just watch Brian
Cooley's highlights from the show right
now in the last 18 10 years Cadillacs
really reinvented itself but can they go
this far that's why this concept is
being shown here at the LA auto show
it's a very compact urban luxury vehicle
a city car if you will about the size of
a mini cooper though it presents much
more massive which is kind of that
Cadillac design language they're really
sharp sort of blades here along these
side flanks inside of course strictly
concept car stuff but they're trying to
get it to say luxury for the urban
dweller this was actually designed in a
los angeles-area studio for this kind of
a car culture that is very much in need
of mobility loves their cars but at the
same time wants to get into something
smaller but maintain the luxury well
here it is the nissan murano wait that's
not new but this is come here look
what's missing it's the nissan murano
crosscabriolet nissan says and i'm
pretty sure they're right it's the first
all-wheel drive crossover without the
top i think they've got a hit on their
hands it's just quirky enough and also
useful enough because let's face it open
air cars are once again all the rage and
this one retains the high seating
position of a crossover which kind of i
think is gonna add to the exhilaration
of open-air driving you're up high and
you're in the open air two things people
tend to like at a visceral level inside
it's pretty standard Murano stuff
although you do have a little bit of a
difference shaping in the rear
compartment here which brings us to the
Bose audio system it'll be available on
this car which has an auto sensing
position to know when the tops down and
adjust I believe volume and equalization
to make sure the music still prints well
the murano crosscabriolet is perhaps
most surprising and that it's coming to
dealership soon this is not some design
studio trial balloon
early 2011 in showrooms pricing around
46 for before destination a little high
but realize they only sell it in a high
trim model like we see here there's no
stripper version so it's got all the
cabin tech obviously the convertible top
the nice Bose audio system the fancy
interior trim and of course the
all-wheel drive is standard didn't have
minivans when I was a kid just had
things like econo lines so I feel
somewhat cheated and with vans like this
on the market who wouldn't Nissan's back
in the game in there with Toyota with
Sienna Honda with Odyssey now the
all-new Nissan Quest is getting back in
the market and as you can see they're
following the current trend on the Asian
minivans go high style quasi luxury kind
of a sporty look that isn't doughy your
dopey nissan points to this kind of
vanishing dipping line in the body here
that really says it looks like it's in
motion even when it's parked maybe not
exactly but you get the idea kind of an
aggressive as opposed to a doughy front
end and the Lions overall have some
style to them now in terms of Technology
here's when it's interesting you'll be
showing up on a lot of cars soon but
when you go down here to the filler
valve on the tire if the tpms pressure
monitor on the dash says you're low you
pull into a gas station start filling
that up and because most folks don't
know or have a good tire pressure gauge
let alone how to use it this car will
beep when you get to the proper pressure
this talks to another sensor in the car
that then tells the horn honk when we're
at the right p.s i kind of cool okay
let's talk about some other technologies
in and around this car you got to have
serious rear seat entertainment in a
minivan the Asian cars are getting very
serious about the size of that monitor
Nissan chose to go with an 11 inch
center of the roof drop-down LCD that's
as big as the smaller of the two new
MacBook Airs it's a pretty good size
screen unfortunately the bigger the
screen the more it obstructs that
rearview mirror I'm not a big fan of
these centres roof dropdowns I liked
them better when they're here in the
headrest but you can't make them that
big when they're in the headrest unless
you just bring your own iPad and
velcro tape this vehicle will also offer
a blind-spot warning system and you're
also going to find a interesting
partitioned duel panoramic roof I'm not
sure if that's going to be a continuous
glass roof if you get it without the
rear seat entertainment or if it's
always these two pods like this and of
course in modern minivan technology
you've got to have a totally
disappearing third row of seats an easy
flip second row check and check I'm not
sure what's cooler the giant Hot Wheels
track or the car coming off it the giant
Hot Wheels car here it is finally the
Camaro in ragtop form and it'll come in
three potencies if you will be available
with a 3.6 liter v6 doing about 312
horsepower or go for a v8 6.2 liter that
has an automatic that's going to give
you 400 horsepower or go up to 420 plus
horsepower if you get it with v8 and
manual transmission now they're playing
to the faithful beyond that it's pretty
much the same canary you know but that's
like saying a convertible is no big deal
it operates a lot like the Corvette top
does you release it at the center latch
here and then it's a power retractor
that goes into this well behind the
seats and largely leaves the trunk
intact and one of the best improvements
about going topless in this guy no more
of that bunker feeling that I get in the
regular Camaro now the key question is a
Camaro ragtop for posers because that's
a big deal among folks who buy cars like
this I don't think it is we just talked
about the engine choices nothing phony
there and the engineer is a GM say they
were able to use the same suspension
setup and settings in this car and get
the same ride quality which means they
were able to stiffen up the body too
rigid eyes it with improvements and
various buttresses to get the same kind
of rigidity which means the car should
handle as much on point as one that has
a metal top ok availability this
convertible camaro will hit showrooms in
February of 2011 exact pricing is still
TBD and of course it'll vary widely by
the powertrain choice you decide to put
in here but this is the Camaro a lot of
folks say is the one it was designed to
be
now that's what I call a bitchin Camaro
right does anybody remember that song no
well I do anyway can't get enough of
Brian Cooley stick around because he
will be back with this week's top 5
countdown when the cnet tech review
continues
welcome back to the scene at tech review
our weekly video digest of all things
good and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good as the debate
over the dangers of cell phone radiation
rages on it's still terribly unclear
whether it's harmful or not but if you
feel like hedging your bets check out
this list of the top five smartphones
that won't kill you at least not right
away
thus our number specific absorption rate
it's the government's measure of how
much your cell phone is treating you
like a bag of microwave popcorn it's
expressed as wats absorbed for kilogram
of body mass but nobody is really sure
what it tells us nonetheless it remains
the only yardstick you've really got now
in our third decade of this debate over
whether a cell phone causes cancer so
with all that in mind here are the top 5
smartphones of 2010 that rate high with
cnet and low on their SAR number number
5 the samsung vibrant scene at rating of
8.3 and ass are number of point 8 9 just
over half the legal limit of 1.6 pretty
low this tmobile android phone is a
looker with a 4 inch AMOLED screen and
16 gigabytes of memory as well as speed
performance all around but much of that
helps make the battery life a bit soft
and that beautiful screen is way nicer
than the plasticky case around it oh and
no flash with the camera auto mission
number 4 is another Sammy the epic 4g on
sprint seen that rating 8.7 and SAR
rating just point six eight under half
the limit this guy can utilize Sprint's
4G network where available and it's got
just about everything else including 5
megapixel camera another big am OLED
display and it can be a hotspot for up
to five other devices unfortunately all
that stuff needs a place to live and the
epic is just plain epic in size number
three is the HTC legend on well not
really on any carrier in North America
because it isn't compatible with 3g
networks here hmm but if it works where
you are you'll enjoy a phone with a cnet
rating of 8.3 and ass are number of just
point 5 6 nice and low another Android
phone here another AMOLED screen but
mixed results from its built-in camera
the number 2 smartphone on our list is
the samsung fascinate on verizon cnet
rating 8.3 SAR number aamir point 57
sister phone to the vibrant we saw
earlier but on verizon in this case and
with some service tweaks including the
annoying lock-in of its search function
Microsoft Bing before we look at the
number one smartphone in this list of
clean ones let's update thats our story
the FCC recently announced it's no
longer sure what the hell this number
means and that any phone in its opinion
under the 1.6 our limit is as safe as
any other which doesn't really make any
sense because the number represents
radiation absorbed by body mass doesn't
more mean Bourque so while the mystery
continues the choice to play it safe
remains yours which brings us to the
number one smartphone on our list today
the samsung captivate cnet rating 8.3
SAR number just point for two that's
like a quarter of the legal limit this
phone is the virtual twin of the
fascinate and the vibrant but running on
AT&amp;amp;T so notice how the phone you buy is
not the only factor in radiation the
network it's on has a big impact another
reason to think about carrier and phone
when you're making a choice for all our
smartphone reviews go to cnet's cell
phone section and to see that's our
ratings which sort them by maker as well
as by top 20 cleanest and dirties i'm
brian cooley thanks for watching
so I guess if you're really worried
about radiation go with Samsung for
entries in the top five is not too
shabby alas the time has come for us to
check what's up this week in the bad now
that more google TV enabled devices are
coming on the market the service seems
to be getting more notoriety for all the
things that can't do so if you're in the
market for a blu-ray player should you
take the leap and go for one with google
TV built-in Matt Mackowiak has an
opinion on that hi I'm Matthew Mackowiak
senior associate editor at cnet com and
we're here with the Sony nsz gt1 with
Google TV this is the first blu-ray
player available with the new Google TV
platform which means it searches through
your online and offline media controls
your cable box and handles your blu-ray
and DVD movies from a single box and
it's selling for four hundred dollars
the exterior design is bigger than we
were expecting coming in at a little bit
larger than a standard blu-ray player
the top has a glossy black finish while
the rest is white which is in our
favorite color since it doesn't blend in
well with other home theater products
now controlling the google TV requires
quite a bit of typing so the way you
control it is important sony's include a
controller it looks a little bit like a
ps3 controller with a keypad at it and
while it feels comfortable in your hands
we didn't really like it for controlling
Google TV the right thumb pad is touch
sensitive and it's used to control the
on-screen cursor but it's inaccurate and
that can be frustrating to use the
controls for the blu-ray player are also
small and sometimes require you to use
the function key which makes it hard for
technologies to use hardware issues
aside our experience with the Google TV
software has been mixed as well it has a
built-in chrome browser capable of
playing back flash and html5 video but
major content providers like Hulu CBS
FOX NBC and ABC are blocking Google TV
devices from streaming video it
currently has some basic apps like
Netflix Napster Pandora and Twitter with
the included Netflix interface
outdated compared to other devices like
the Apple TV roku XDS and the ps3 cable
and satellite box control is fully
integrated if you have a dish network
DVR but if you don't then Google TV
can't schedule recordings or season
passes and while we love that we could
bring up the Google search bar at any
time to find content Google currently
doesn't find programs on Netflix and we
also found that some of the listings
info isn't accurate for shows like The
Colbert Report and the daily show
altogether although we love the idea of
Google TV and blu-ray in a single box
right now we'd recommend the competing
logitech revue over the sony for early
adopters because we prefer Logitech's
excellent wireless keyboard but for
mainstream buyers we pass on both the
review and the sony for now until Google
TV can iron out its issues I'm Matthew
miskovic for cnet and this is the Sony
nsz gt1 with Google TV we had such high
hopes for Google TV when it first came
out I mean I've even on it pete's sake
but having all the networks block their
websites is not a very good sign the
least it plays blu-ray right all right
now let's see what we've got going on in
this week's bottom line
we're less than a week away from
Thanksgiving so don't wait too long
before you start planning your turkey
dinner and if you need a little help in
that department there's a new app from
our friends at chow com that will hold
your hand every step of the way
hey everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome
to tap that app the show where we
rundown the hottest applications for
your mobile doohickey or whatever this
week it is all about Thanksgiving here
in the United States and for a lot of
you I know that means you're starting to
panic maybe you've never made the big
turkey dinner before maybe grandma's
coming and she's going to judge your
gravy you need help our sister site chow
com has created the thanksgiving dinner
coach app it's free for the iphone and
ipod touch actually i downloaded it onto
my ipad and i made it big because i like
to use this for cooking so hopefully an
ipad version is next also speaking of
cooking thanks to chow for letting me
shoot this in their Test Kitchen I'm
never leaving anyway dinner coach app
lets you choose from nine recipes here
pretty basic thanksgiving fare nothing
that's going to scare off your picky
eater friends you can delete whatever
recipes you don't think you'll use
except for the turkey actually so
vegetarians you might want to look
elsewhere anyway once you choose the
recipes you want to use let's see green
beans turkey gravy yes it creates an
entire shopping list for you now what I
really like about this shopping list is
that it also includes the gear you're
going to need like the pitcher the whisk
the frying pan the roast or that kind of
thing but anything you already have you
just tap it and then it disappears from
your list off you go okay then and this
is where it's really helpful it creates
an entire cooking schedule for you by
day so what you need to do on Monday
defrost your turkey what you need to do
wednesday and what order you need to
cook things so you can have everything
ready all at the same time this is a
super useful organizational tool now
this is a pretty basic app it's probably
best for people who haven't cooked
Thanksgiving dinner before or who are
just interested in keeping things simple
and organized for example I wish that
you could import other recipes from the
child database there's a lot of good
stuff there but in this case you're
pretty much stuck with these ones here
if you wanted to customize you might
want to try something like I feast
thanksgiving or you could combine this
with the turkey recipes app in the
itunes app store that's got 38 different
turkey recipes also i would love it if
there was a way to email someone the
shopping list so that you could send
someone else to the store
maybe even printed out all in all though
if you're nervous about Thanksgiving
dinner or you just want a good way to
stay organized this app is dead simple
to use and it's free so you know if you
can take the stress out of cooking that
means that you can just serve a good
meal sit back and go to your happy place
while Aunt Alice criticizes your
housekeeping again for tap that app at
cnet com I'm mollywood the bottom line
this week better cooking through
technology I am a little disappointed
though that the dinner coach app didn't
include that recipe for turkey cake did
you see that thing I can't decide if I'm
disgusted or craving it probably a
little bit of all all right folks it's
time for me to go join us next week for
a special black friday buyers guide
episode of the cnet tech review until
then there are tons of great videos
available every day at seen at tv.com
thank you for watching and happy turkey
