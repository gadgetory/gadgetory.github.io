of the Mercedes line as I thought it was
for a long time let's go see what's
happening with the 2012 ml350 BlueTEC
and check the tach
the ml gets a major restyle as you can
see it's cabin though is still about the
most luxurious in its class the lack of
a third row is going to some buyers
there's no longer a hybrid or a v8 but
the smart pick is this 3 liter turbo
diesel inside the technology load is
solid but a few things are missing in an
insulting way that are a hallmark of
high-end German cars
now all MLS are going to have this color
LCD but you're not going to get
navigation for free that's an option
we'll talk about in a minute good-sized
screen good dot pitch that's not a
really wide aspect ratio like BMW their
archrival nor as big I don't think as a
Lexus but it's a decent screen you see
we have 3d building rendering here
there's also live traffic because you've
got serious and traffic services in the
same option package that brings you this
GPS navigation now on the audio side you
got am/fm HD radio streaming Bluetooth
SD card slot 10 gigabytes of hard drive
space what you don't get standard though
is a backup camera everybody who buys
this thing would appreciate that
another gripe I've got about the rear
view camera if you have the radio turned
off which isn't all that unlikely the
backup camera doesn't work why doesn't
that wake up the screen when I go into
reverse and then when I go back to drive
turn it back to black another
operational gripe I have is seat heaters
you got to turn these seat heaters on
with a micro switch toggle turn the car
off go in the grocery store come back
out on some frigid day and your seat
heater resets back to ice-cold they're
basically tracking the logic of seat
heater to let's say a rear defroster
which resets every start cycle why
wouldn't you tie that to the HVAC that
doesn't go back to zero every time I
turn the car off nobody would accept
that so premium one package has a lot of
stuff you're going to want from camera
to better voice command to enhanced
input options 3,600 bucks kind of chunky
we also have premium 2 which rolls in
premium one and more and goes to 53 70
additional that gives you this logic 7
Harman Kardon rig the keyless go
technology and some fancy lights under
the doorsills I could live without the
diesel is the way to go on the current
ml it's a three liter turbo diesel v6
giving you 240 scrawny horsepower but
455 big old foot-pounds of torque that
gets this 5000 pound beast up to 60 and
7.3 seconds
that's quite a trick but the mpg isn't
stunning it's 2027 that probably means
20 over all it's a big vehicle heavy as
I mentioned one choice only on the
gearbox 7-speed automatic through a
dainty column shifter and then something
congruous sport paddles on the wheel by
the way this vehicle also uses urea
injection down in the exhaust chain to
clean up the diesel particulates that
means it has to be refilled occasionally
with fluid called AdBlue I would add
that myself because the dealer may
charge you a lot more than you'd like to
do it you can find it on the after
market now the reason I like this turbo
diesel so much is because it has the
kind of power this vehicle needs every
day which is grunt not a bunch of high
rpm floaty peaking horsepower but the
real stuff that gets an SUV around the
way you want it to the ride is kind of
Rolly Jhansi bouncy there is a more firm
adaptive suspension option you can go
for at that point I'm thinking you've
piled on too many thousands and options
because you got to put the tech in here
and that's going to come first in my
mind now some driver assistance tech we
have in here for a hundred and fifty
bucks combination of passive blind spot
notification and lane departure
notification if you drift across the
lane the wheel vibrates if you have
someone in your blind spot you get a
little icon that turns red if you signal
into them it starts to beep at you as
well go up to about $3,000 and those
become active technologies that will
prevent you from drifting or Lane
changing into someone it's a big Delta
in cost
I think I'd stay with the passive stuff
okay a 2012 ml350 with a D so it's
called the blue tech model it's gonna
run you about fifty one three delivered
and then you go 5,000 to 8,000 more in
big chunky packages to get this guy done
up seen that style it's definitely the
class leader for luxury and comfortable
ride you're looking for sporting you're
looking elsewhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
