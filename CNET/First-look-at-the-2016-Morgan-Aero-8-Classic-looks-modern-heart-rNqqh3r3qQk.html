design styling at morgue 15 years ago to
this day
Morgan launched the arrow 8 this was a
car that repositioned the brand it had
an all-new aluminium chassis aluminium
bodywork v8 engine and it really
separated Morgan away from the classic
Morgan and put us into a new marketplace
the 15 years on the arrow branders
witnessed a lot of changes in a lot of
evolution we can prove the chassis and
suspension the vehicle's capabilities
and performance we've introduced to ku
pays and a target up on top of this
platform and we've no longer created a
soft top open car so 15 years on it was
the anniversary of this era way we
wanted to look back to our roots and
reintroduce a proper British open top
cut within the aero platform so we
approached this project with quite a
holistic view of the whole design you
take all the best bits of arrows
throughout the years and we tried to
create a car that is the most complete
and resolved of all the Aero products so
we looked at the chassis this has got an
all-new chassis underneath we've
drastically improves the torsional
stiffness we've moved the cantilever
suspension which was inboard to the
outside with your wishbone suspension
which enabled us to combat some of the
body roll and create a much more stable
car not only at low speeds but a lot of
flatter in the corners too we've got new
anti-roll bars we have a new limited
slip differential on the back of the car
too
one of the big focuses of this car for
me was really emphasizing the fact this
is an open top British sports car
so the styling itself in the body is
meant to really exaggerate that we have
some very long shoulder lines which run
through the car which is inspired by a
lot of sort of 1960s OpenType cars that
really did focus on that driver
interaction with its environment so
these long shoulder lines flow around
the occupants
they're almost echoing that of a boat
deck adding to that sense of escapism as
well
the interior itself has been drastically
reworked what I've tried to do is take
away a lot of the leather which is in
the car originally we've always used
very fine natural leathers and the cars
were bathed in them by taking some of
this leather out and replacing it with
other materials like classic box weave
carpet we're actually able to really
celebrate the individual materials and
the leathers so you have fine leather at
every point of contact and then it's
framed with it's very classic carpet
we've also looked at a lot more wood
finishes more than obviously work with
wood we do this very well and bringing
that into the car in a very aesthetic
way as well as a functional way was
important for me in terms of the
interaction we've looked at different
dashboard variants I think it's
important well at this point this has
got the most elaborate options list of
anymore than we've ever created so the
dashboard for example could either have
a very tactile mechanical interface or
you can have a multi touchscreen system
which gives you all those modern
conveniences inside the car you've also
got carbon seats or the traditional sort
of foam leather seats again completely
transformed in the way this car looks
the same is to be said of the hardtop on
this vehicle as well what we didn't want
to do is consider things like hard tops
as an afterthought and we try to provide
as many different possible variations of
this car in one go
so we've considered the styling of the
hardtop right from the offset to the way
we're selling this car is very much not
as a limited run of maybe 300 vehicles
but 300 one-off cars
everyone will be so different with that
extensive options list and the different
coupe a variance or open top variants
that we anticipate quite an exciting
eclectic mix of cars for me every Morgan
has a lot of inherent drama especially
within the arrows but there is the noise
or the length of some of these elaborate
lines the way they drive that view down
the bonnet and what I wanted to do is
bring a lot of drama back into the car
with a very dramatic opening panel but
it's quite multifunctional that real
hood clamshell actually conceals a fuel
filler and it seals around the hood line
which eliminates unnecessary shut lines
so there's only the very various minimum
shut lines on the actual
as this boot opens up towards the rear
and closes again it actually tensions a
soft top which is neatly stowed away
underneath this is the first morgen ever
to have a hood for this stowed away out
of sight in in production which isn't
quite a big one for us so this car uses
the BMW v8 that we've used previously on
our products it's a fantastic engine we
work really close to your BMW on the
development of setup for this engine and
we we really love the way it drives and
performs so the output is around about
370 brake horsepower with similar sort
of performance figures to the previous
era in terms of torque delivery and top
speed and acceleration however it's
important to add that we really looked
at the aerodynamics of this vehicle
which does improve that on-road
stability when you combine this with the
improved chassis which is now stiffer
and the jewel witchburn suspension on
the outside and more refined
road-holding
I think it will keep a sensation of much
more exhilaration especially when that
roofs down and you could hear the
exhausts and you're much more in contact
with your surroundings I think it would
be fair to say without getting ahead of
ourselves we enter production autumn
this is probably the sharpest festive
handling era we've built to date
