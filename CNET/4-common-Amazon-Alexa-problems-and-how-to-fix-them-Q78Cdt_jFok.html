echo echo dot or Amazon tap can be a
great addition to any living room
kitchen or even a bedroom especially in
a smart home and typically after the
initial setup there's not a lot of
tweaking or maintenance that needs to be
done but that doesn't mean that things
can't go wrong here are four common
problems with Alexa speakers and how to
fix them if you're having trouble
connecting a smart home device to your
Alexa speaker first make sure it's a
natively supported device while the list
of compatible devices is growing many of
those devices are actually only
compatible through a third-party skill
from the skills catalog to add a new
device open the Alexa app on your smart
phone and go to smart home in the left
menu under your devices click discover
devices if your device can't be
discovered go to the skills section also
in the Left menu and search for the
brand of your smart home device if there
is a skill available and able it and
follow the on-screen instructions for
connecting it through the skill instead
even if your device is not natively
supported or there's no skill available
you're not entirely out of luck there's
an if this in that channel for Alexa
which connects it to many other smart
home devices that would not otherwise be
compatible if you're having trouble with
the Alexa speaker disconnecting from
your network regularly there are a few
things you can try first power cycle
everything unplug the router the modem
and the speaker then resore power after
a few minutes if that doesn't fix things
try relocating the Alexa speaker closer
to the router and away from other
devices if that doesn't work and you
have an already you may want to consider
switching your Alexa speaker from a 2.4
gigahertz network to 5 gigahertz to
decrease interference you may also
notice that the Alexa speaker doesn't
hear you quite as well as it used to
this could be explained by things being
added around the speaker and it being
cluttered or the speaker physically
moving closer to the wall to fix this
try to remove obstructions from the
speaker and keep it at least eight
inches away from the wall also consider
what's around the speaker if it's near a
noisy appliance or air vent you may want
to relocate it to another part of the
room and finally you can try voice
training which is under settings in the
Alexa app voice training will have you
read twenty five phrases allowed in a
typical voice from a typical distance so
Alexa can better understand you and
finally do too
increased popularity marketing and
sometimes pure coincidence the
television can activate your speaker if
you're watching a TV show or movie that
has any of the wakeboards included or
anything that is audibly similar while
harmless it is a nuisance and there are
three things you can do to help prevent
it 1 simply move the Alexus speaker
further from the television so it
doesn't pick up on the audio from the
sound system quite as well to hit the
mute switch so it stops listening to
audio altogether or 3 change the wake
word that is used commonly in the show
or movie that you're watching be sure to
