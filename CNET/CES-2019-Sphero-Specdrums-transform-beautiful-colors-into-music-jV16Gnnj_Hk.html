lot of different toys and Star Wars
robots so what's a company like Sphero
doing making a musical ring scare oh
spectrums is what the company is
announcing a CES 2019 and this little
musical ring device can sense colors and
turn them into music and it's an
initiative to create coding music type
experiences for people if they want to
wear one ring or two or a whole bunch I
got to play with one before and during
CES Sphero acquired the company that
made spectrums and what it is is a
little rechargeable ring that can sense
color and then it turns that color into
an assent aesthetic experience by
converting that into sound it comes with
a mat that provides a bunch of colors
and you can pair the ring with an app on
your phone that then plays the music so
if I tap these colors you can play
various sounds and build up different
set lists I don't know how to play music
as you can see
the app comes to the number of different
instruments set lists that you can
activate to create different keyboard
sounds or you can record your own voice
samples and assign them to different
colors see that it's also compatible
with Bluetooth MIDI if there are apps
that are compatible with that so you
could possibly use this as a more
elaborate musical instrument beyond what
the app enables well Sphero eventually
use this in robotics who knows really
what you're doing is converting color
into something else so there are
possibilities for coding there's
possibilities for all sorts of play and
by the way you don't even need this
keyboard because spectrums works on any
color at all like a table or my hand or
my watch band or the colorful carpets at
CES or snacks or your friend's Christmas
sweater who knows you just keep playing
this anywhere and that's what I was
trying to do so come with me as I play
in a painting I have no idea what
spectrums will ultimately be used for
but Sphero is trying to enter into the
steam landscape not just stem to
incorporate arts in addition to Science
and Technology and engineering
we'll eventually spectrums become part
of the larger sphere robotics family
will we see robots that can scan color
and turn it into sounds or use it for
some sort of coding tool we'll have to
see in the meantime for $65 for one ring
or $100 for two rings starting this
month you can start playing around with
color drums just on your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
