conference just wrapped up but we
actually have a chance to check out the
new vibe Pro this is an upward version
of the VR headset the original vibe that
was introduced you go and here it is
these blue it's got the the headline
feature here our CRISPR resolution
supposed to be 78% sharper which is a
big deal in virtual reality where you
need to have clear crisp images as you
can see has built-in headphones here
it's got new it's sort of got this new
ergonomic adjusting thing so it's
supposed to be a lot more comfortable
it's got noise cancelling microphone
it's got dual camera head tool cameras
here in the front not sure what they're
used for they just say it's really for
developers and then it'll have a
wireless accessory that allows you to
cut the cord on this VR headset which is
a lot more convenient than having that
cord wrapped around you so there's no
price on this yet right Roger there is
no price on it they said it's a it's a
weird rollout they said this is
available first quarter to existing
customers as they upgrade to their
headset and then developers will be able
to get it throughout the year it's
unclear how they're gonna sell this to
new customers down the line so that's
not an upgrade to your headset in terms
of attaching it that's a whole new
headset that you would then yeah you
would basically have to buy a new
headset not sure again let's turn on the
pricing yet they haven't really talked
about they did see the wireless adapter
which will work with both the original
version as well as this will be
available in the summer of this year and
you mentioned those cameras they didn't
discuss any better sense of
incorporating the real world into them
yet so there there are more for
experimental development purposes that's
exactly right there they're hoping
developers will take advantage of the
dual camp setup for more it's at this
point I'd be speculating on what they'd
even use it for but definitely it's more
for the developer community and I
noticed in the release as well that
there is also an expansion in the number
of room sensors that it's going from two
to four is that meant to create a larger
area that this can work in that's
exactly at the supposed to work with
steam tracker 2.0 which will enable it
to go I think 10 by 10 or 10 foot by 10
foot which is what they said businesses
are actually
really asking for whether it's you know
be our kids whether it's hotels it's a
lot of business customers are asking for
a larger experience for I guess for
demonstrating or for experiencing
workplace type activities or maybe for
like maybe entertainment is it for like
it like a sort of our VR arcade purpose
that you might want to step up
experience and that's absolutely a
potential I mean I know the V arcade
business is a big one for it to see I
see a lot of vibes in in the few B
arcades
I've seen so it's definitely opportunity
there can you actually put it on you see
someone's head in it and that's a cloudy
I can't put it on because I've got my
headset on right now it's tough to can't
cam on right now
can't Claudia do it can Claudia put on
the headset let's see yeah you want to
put it on be a VR model this is Claudia
Cruz from Cena espanol who happily did
me the favor of holding this for me
there you go
there we go well and so that the way it
attaches look similar to vibe and
updated some of the straps and
headphones on the first generation
version and looks like they're
integrated here yep exactly
have you played anything yet did you
play any games or do any experiences no
we we rushed over here to check out the
unit itself our colleague Sean holster
is checking this out right now is doing
the full first tank you'll be able to
get his experiences shortly how
comfortable is it body how comfortable
is this she likes it better than
anything you've worn comfort Wiser's how
long would you wear this how long would
you wear this body
I usually concede the floor underneath
the device the headset and this is
actually pretty confident on my cheeks
the earphones seem very very tight you
know they're it's not on so I can tell
you about the noise the noise
cancellation quality or the resolution
but it's if I could keep this on for a
while so maybe it's I mean it's it's
it's definitely improvement over the
original and she says she could
definitely keep it on for a little while
it looks like it's better wait
distributed it looks like it's like yeah
that definitely made a point that this
was more centered weight wise than the
original one which was very front heavy
yeah it's interesting where its
positioning is again like no price on it
but they're still going to make the
original vibe the one that they're
selling to everyday consumers was there
any talk of a price drop nope no talk
about it's a tough market
I mean it's I'm excited to wear it too
and try it on it looks yeah it looks
like a blue Sletten from the outside a
similar to the other vibe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
