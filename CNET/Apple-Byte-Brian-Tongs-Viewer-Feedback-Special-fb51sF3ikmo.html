might recognize me as one of the hosts
of seen it shows like the apple byte
google ish asst and prize fights and i
know we'd really be nothing without you
now through the years we've received
thousands and thousands of emails and
tweets from you the viewers and we
wanted to share with all of you your
comments and stories that continue to
make us better each day why do you have
a show you are so annoying seriously did
cnet lose a bet brian Tong looks like
such a to hang out with brian Tong is
annoying and as dumb jokes and is hard
to look at wish you could change him i'd
like to touch you Brian does brian Tong
have to be a dbag all through the video
cnet are so foolish you remind me at TMZ
I like TMZ like I said we really
appreciate the feedback you may want to
consider moving the Justin Bieber
autographed photo on your sideboard to
another position in your office so it's
out of the camera shot brian Tong you
are an apple brainwash idiot WTF is
wrong with Brian all of a sudden just
hating on apple sucking the android POS
a lot of you also appreciated our
editorial integrity whoever made the
background music should make porno
background music dear brian i must say i
had to remove your podcast from my home
because of the very strong sexual
content and innuendos you so enjoy
expressing like saying that you had
intimately touched all the prizes on
your last cast or licking the phone i
had to explain to my daughter why you
had your ipod cables in your pants
brian Tong is not funny was never funny
it will most likely never be funny like
how old is Charlie he looks like a
billion years old however he still rocks
this oriental guy is a real gym is the
man that's right I am and it's comments
like these that really warm my heart I
feel like the show has been scraping the
bottom of the barrel in terms of gaining
viewership having sex in the back of a
station wagon was not Apple bites best
moment hey I'm Blake that kid you met
the nike store in bend it would be
awesome if you did a shot out for me in
the apple byte hi Blake OMG please
please PLEASE Brian leave the apple byte
I hate you so much please leave forever
finally guys finally we've got a good
one I know it was tough but uh we got
one apple byte is great if you were 15
alright that's gonna do it for this show
until next year we're going on a holiday
break in we'll return after the consumer
electronics show in las vegas around
mid-january so don't worry we didn't go
anywhere and all of a seeress unit just
wanted to say thank you i'm brian Tong
and we'll see you guys next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
