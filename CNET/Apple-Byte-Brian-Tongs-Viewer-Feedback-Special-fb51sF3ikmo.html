might recognize me as one of the hosts
of seen at shows like the apple byte
google Isha's and prizefights
and i know we'd really be nothing
without you now through the years we've
received thousands and thousands of
emails and tweets from you the viewers
and we wanted to share with all of you
your comments and stories that continue
to make us better each day why do you
have a show you are so annoying
seriously did CNET lose a bet Brian Tong
looks like such a to hang out with Brian
Tong is annoying and as dumb jokes and
is hard to look at wish you could change
him I'd like to touch you Brian does
Brian Tong have to be a d-bag all
through the video CNET are so foolish
you remind me of TMZ I like TMZ like I
said we really appreciate the feedback
you may want to consider moving the
Justin Bieber autographed photo on your
sideboard to another position in your
office so it's out of the camera shot
Brian Tong you are an Apple brainwashed
idiot wTF is wrong with Brian all of a
sudden just hating on Apple suck in the
Android POS a lot of you also
appreciated our editorial integrity
whoever made the background music should
make porno background music dear Brian I
must say I had to remove your podcast
from my home because of the very strong
sexual content and innuendos you so
enjoy expressing like saying that you
had intimately touched all the prizes on
your last cast or licking the phone I
had to explain to my daughter why you
had your iPod cables in your pants
brian tong is not funny was never funny
and will most likely never be funny like
how old is Charlie he looks like a
billion years old however he still rocks
this oriental guy is a real Jim is the
man that's right I am and it's comments
like these that really warm my heart I
feel like the show has been scraping the
bottom of the barrel in terms of gaining
viewership having sex in the back of a
station wagon was not Apple bites best
moment hey I'm Blake that kid you met
the Nike store and bent it would be
awesome if you did a shout out for me in
the Apple byte hi Blake oMG please
please PLEASE Brian leave the Apple bite
I hate you so much please leave forever
finally guys finally we've got a good
one I know it was tough but uh we got
one Apple bite is great if you were 15
alright that's gonna do it for this show
until next year we're going on a holiday
break in will return after the Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas around mid
January so don't worry we didn't go
anywhere and all the Cirrus unit just
wanted to say thank you
i'm brian tong and we'll see you guys
next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
