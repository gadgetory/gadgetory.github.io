back in you know a little browner and
welcome to another episode of your
favorite panda friendly show now we'd
also like to take a moment of silence to
remember Bao Bao the world's oldest
panda who passed away this week I love
pandas all right it's all the good and
bad inside the world of Apple and we'll
start things off with an apple byte
exclusive right here now according to my
well-placed sources I can confirm what
you're all already expecting obviously
the next gen iphone with the mini dock
connectors coming in September and the
seven point eight five inch rumored iPad
with a mini dock connector as well is
coming for sure but here's the surprise
my sources have also told me in a move
that I refuse to believe earlier that
Apple will indeed be releasing a new
version of the current third-generation
iPad with the use of the new dock
connector to push the new standard
moving forward alongside the other
devices now expecting the next gen
iphone to be unveiled at the sep tember
12th event but if the iPads don't make
the keynote my sources say they will
still be released this year in time for
the 2012 holiday season but the ipad
would just a new dock connector is
actually happening I've also been told
that the Apple TV isn't even close for a
production standpoint and it won't make
the 2012 time frame that's some analysts
continue to pound on like we've been
saying now some other stories that
piggyback on the new iOS devices the
good times reports that the 7 inch iPad
will begin volume production in
September with a target of 4 million
units per month to launch before the
holidays also USB cable specialist
beister claims to have the sync cable
for the next gen iOS devices that
features the smaller dock port
connection on one end with this picture
they sent out to multiple outlets and if
you're curious about all those iphone
parts lying around repair site I rescue
was able to take the docking port and
headphone jack assembly that they showed
off last week then placed it in the
alleged iphone 5 back frame and they
were able to put the pieces together
with all of the threading and screw
holes lining up perfectly just like
fitting together pieces of
complex puzzle but forget about what
you've seen if you don't believe any of
that and really guys you should because
that's just the iphone maybe you're
thinking what Adam Sachs is thinking
check out this clip about what he thinks
the iphone 5 will be people only use
iPhones to take photos of their food
they're sad and alone so they use
pictures of food to create the illusion
of a fulfilling life with that knowledge
we went back to the drawing board
introducing the iphone 5 we rethought
everything from big stuff like screen
resolution to small details like the
size of the screws and the inclusion of
a 50 millimeter macro lens these
pictures look so good that nobody would
ever imagine you lie awake at night
wondering why you can't feel happiness
and within minutes I had friends telling
me how much fun I was having and you
know for one brief moment I almost
believed in myself yeah I'm gonna have
to agree with him on that alright now we
mentioned the Apple TV earlier but that
might not be the only TV based project
Apple's working on according to The Wall
Street Journal last week apples and
talks with US cable operators about a
set-top box that would make it so
viewers could watch any show at any time
through a cloud-based DVR that would
store shows online and viewers could
then start streaming the show minutes
after it begins airing live it's really
an ambitious idea but there's huge
challenges before this becomes a reality
even if Apple is able to sign deals with
the big cable operators individual
content owners will also have to give
their permission we finally just saw
Hulu Plus get on board with the Apple TV
and CBS our parent company has been
let's just say reluctant to let their
content be viewed anywhere else outside
of their walls and you won't see HBO or
Showtime jumping on board unless they
are getting paid handsomely so right now
this is kind of what i call a tech
unicorn all right let's take a break and
check out our app of the week
this one is a fun one from ustream
called the BFF app it's free and it's
available for iOS devices right now with
an android version coming soon now it
doesn't stand for best friends forever
but instead broadcast for friends yay
now what's cool about this app is once
you connect it to your Facebook account
unless you stream video live from your
iOS device and straight to your facebook
timeline where friends can watch it live
and comment on the video you can also
add Instagram like filters and save the
videos to your timeline it's really
simply using if you have something cool
to show people or if you think your
friends really want to watch you eat
your lunch this is the app for you
alright guys now we're still waiting for
the final ruling between apple vs
samsung after closing arguments were
made by both sides Apple called samsung
the iphones biggest fan and a copycat
samsung then also argued that apple is
stifling competition and if they win the
case consumers lose billions of dollars
are at stake here and it could set a
precedent for future cases so we'll keep
you in the know but one thing you have
to know about is ATT after they decided
to make themselves the tech world's
number one target when they announced
that facetime over cellular on iOS 6
will be only available for people who
choose to go with their new mobile share
plans now if you're on an individual or
family plan right now it won't matter
you won't get to use the feature now
these plans might make sense for
families but they're really made to be
more expensive for heavy data users
which is a lot of you now sprint has
already said they will not put any
limits on facetime over cellular and
we're still waiting for verizon's
position then AT&amp;amp;T had the nerve to say
since base time is a pre-loaded app they
don't have to support it but if it was a
downloadable app that's not bundled on
the phone FCC net neutrality laws would
force them to allow it to work properly
two words bad apple and now honestly I'm
considering leaving the carrier with a
jerk move like this hey verizon let me
know what you guys thinking of doing so
call me maybe all right guys let's end
things on a high note and we wanted to
let you know that the apple byte is
celebrating its 200th episode 200 in a
few more weeks with a party in san
francisco on sep tember the 7th for
a night at 111 minna would get this free
drink specials over 300 giveaways from
gelaskins and in case iTunes gift cards
and a raffle yes a raffle for the best
tablet on the planet and if you can
unscramble these letters you know what
it is all right we're also doing the
shooting of a skit that you could be a
part of two so why wouldn't you go so we
hope to see you there and you can follow
my twitter for more details alright
that's going to do it for this week's
show send us your emails to the apple
byte at cnet com I'll start catching up
to them i'm brian Tong thanks for
watching we'll catch you next time for
another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
