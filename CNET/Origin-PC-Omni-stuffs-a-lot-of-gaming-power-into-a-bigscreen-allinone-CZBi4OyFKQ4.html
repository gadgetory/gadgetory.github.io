of an all-in-one is a gaming system
argent pcs Omni custom build with its 34
inch curved display it does deliver a
great gaming experience for wide
field-of-view play the display is pretty
much like every other 34 inch wide quad
HD curved monitor I've seen lately
it's got a decent 100% srgb gama that
looks good as long as you're viewing it
dead-on without tilting it the matte
display is great from a reflectivity
perspective but it suffers from color
and contrast shifts when viewing through
even a little off angle the system
performs as fast as you'd expect given
its components in our case that includes
an NVIDIA Titan X card and a 4.2
gigahertz CPU and it was only
occasionally outpaced by others that we
tested they've incorporate the Intel
extreme CPUs with more cores I've got
few complaints about the gameplay we did
experience some crashes from overheating
when driving it hard though and the
system is almost fully upgradable it
fits as much gear as a standard desktop
though only a single graphics card you
can put in a full sized current
generation Nvidia or AMD card up to 32
gigs of memory 2 drives of either the
spinning or solid-state variety and a
sound card but the only one layout isn't
very good the motherboard and graphics
cards connectors come out the bottom
while it's crammed with useful ports
they're kind of hard to get to and I'm
talking about frequently used ones like
USB you gotta lay down the system there
are a few connectors conveniently
located in the back as well as an SD
card slot but all the powerful ones like
the 10 gigabit per second USB connectors
or the ones earmarked for VR are
underneath for a lot more details about
my experiences with this novel system
you'll have to read my review on CNET
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
