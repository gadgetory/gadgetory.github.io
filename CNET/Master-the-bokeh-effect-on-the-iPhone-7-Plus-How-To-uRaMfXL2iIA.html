the battery the main reason you would
spend $100 more on the iPhone 7 plus is
that dual lens camera so is it really
that much better well it is now the
phone launched with a 2 X optical zoom
and a 10x digital zoom that lets you get
closer than ever on an iPhone but the
best new feature is coming with the
upgrade to iOS 10.1 portrait mode will
create that sense of depth in a photo
usually achieved only with a DSLR camera
where the subject is in focus and the
background is blurred in photography
it's called a bouquet effect Apple is by
no means the first to attempt this in a
phone the dual lens setup dates a few
years back and the mode itself can be
found on a lot of high-end Android
phones today but Apple may have just on
that sweet spot between hardware and
software and the feature is easily
accessible right from the camera app to
swipe until you hit portrait and
portrait doesn't just mean people you
can use it on pets plants or pretty much
any inanimate object as long as you
follow the same guidelines once you're
in portrait mode identify your subject
and pay attention to the directions on
the screen because it uses a telephoto
lens for the foreground it will appear
closer than with the regular camera so
you may have to move away you'll know
you've hit your mark when the yellow
depth affects sign pops up on the screen
this means you're ready to lock in your
focus and make any adjustments to the
brightness now just hit the shutter when
you're ready if you want a more dramatic
blur you'll need to increase the
distance between the subject and the
background the closer you are to the
subject the greater the blur pay
attention to the lighting and make sure
the subject is brighter than the
background for better dimension and
lastly try to keep the phone stable the
shutter is slower on this mode and the
picture takes a while to process now go
to your camera roll to check out your
masterpiece as with HDR mode the camera
stores an original along with one of the
effects so you'll be able to see the
difference right as you scroll just
check for the depth effect tag on the
top left the image will retain the
effect even when you share to other
devices and this may be just the tip of
the iceberg for the dual lens camera
because depth perception is not just for
photography and the later update could
bring 3d mapping and augmented reality
like features to the iPhone 7 plus so
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
