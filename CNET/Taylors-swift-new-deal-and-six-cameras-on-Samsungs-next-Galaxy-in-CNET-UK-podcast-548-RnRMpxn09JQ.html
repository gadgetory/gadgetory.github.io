for more Spotify artists Samsung's s10
may be absolutely massive and we find
out how good a Netflix Christmas really
is it's all coming up on the scene at UK
podcast episode 5 for 8 hello and
welcome to the show I'm Andrew Hoyle and
joining me today is rich trend home oh
wait no you don't it's that rich oh no
way it's Katie Collins no oh it is right
I'm just very good at disguising myself
as Katie Collins European correspondent
exactly that's me
rich Tran home in here just just confirm
for me that you are actually Kate
Collins okay fine I am wow that's good
because I've tailored this show a little
bit around you and I do mean that pun to
be as good as it was I have tailored the
show in I'm talking about Taylor Swift
your your BFF your face a very natural
segue that was I thought so too
this is our first news story you're
absolutely right to say in those precise
words because Taylor Swift has got a new
record deal with Universal and you may
be thinking well what the hell's I got
to have seen it and you're probably
silly thinking that at the end of a
story but we're gonna try anyway because
do you think this is relevant and you're
gonna tell us why on you absolutely so
the the background to the story is that
Taylor Swift assigned a brand new record
deal it's the first time in her career
since she first signed her record record
deal at the age of 14 that she's done so
14 yes she's been in that deal since she
was 14 she hundred four terms of change
but this this new deal the one that
she's had obviously had all of the big
record labels that kind of bidding for
her but the thing that's kind of
literally has sealed the deal for her is
that she wanted to make sure that there
was a specific Clause to do with Spotify
front and center okay and ever wants to
be on it again is that right that's not
at all so effectively all of the big
record labels
of shares in Spotify since the company
went public
now when the there are sort of rumors
that Universal Music Group is going to
sell its shares next year in Spotify and
what Taylor wanted was for all of the
artists that are sienten Universal to
get a share of the money
should-should Universal Music Group cash
in on on its equity that seems like a
good a good positive move yes on
Taylor's part
indeed and universals agreed to this and
to also to make sure that it's not and
it's not recouped it doesn't kind of
collect and recouped money through the
through the share so effectively if
artists Oh outstanding money to the
label for for whatever reason it's not
going to offset the money that that it
gets from these shares against that
amount so it no matter what happens no
matter what the kind of financial
situation is between the label and the
artist they get a nice bonus they will
get every single artist will get money
you know what I'm not entirely sure I
agree with that or maybe I just don't
understand it in quite the right terms
because in a nutshell the way recording
contracts tend to work is is is a record
label will effectively upfront the cost
of a band's music production or VAT or
or you know they basically give them
this upfront amount of cash whether
that's 10 grand or 100 grand or whatever
and the band basically earns money by
releasing albums of my touring and pays
that money off that is effectively alone
now I'm not really like the label is
owed that money by the band so I'm not
sure if they were to sell those shares
and then say to the band well here is
effectively I don't know you would get
20,000 pounds from the sale of a spotify
money but we're keeping that and
knocking it off your debt like that's
still money that they'd be paying back I
don't necessarily see that as long as
they do as long as that is knocked off
in some way as long as it isn't just
more profit for Universal but if it if
it is still knocked off that debt
there's still money effectively money
for the artist I think the the whole
point of this is that streaming as a
kind of way of making money for artists
has been extremely volatile you know a
lot of artists feel like they're being
like very much under compensated and
it's take it takes ages for the money to
get between you know from from when we
as consumers are streaming a song for
the money to arrive in the bank account
of the artist there's so many hands yeah
it takes a long time and often they're
not compensated the way that they should
and I think this is a way of investing
in creators long term saying to writers
to artists to producers and you know you
streaming is an incredibly volatile
difficult industry for you but what we
want is for em you know we want you to
keep doing what you're doing we want you
to keep whatever your kind of talent is
and your skill is and whatever kind of
music you're making we want you in the
long term to feel like you it this is a
profitable industry for you that you can
you can keep making this amazing music
that we're all effectively prophesying
at sure so I so I think that that's
basically that you're effectively then
is it is it is and it's it's an
important it's it's a show of support to
the artist it's a show of you know it's
a real because a lot of artists struggle
with this and you know it's it's it's
okay for big artists like Taylor Swift
who you know Taylor has got a long
history with Spotify where she pulled
all of her music off and every year
music on Spotify that's a big deal yeah
and so and but when she rejoined the
service you know that the terms were
slightly renegotiated slightly but we
don't know exactly what those terms are
it's hard for a smaller artist and and
you know more independent artists and
whatever to make that kind of stand to
say you know to throw it because they
don't have as much weight to throw
around and I think the point of this as
well is that it's about bigger artists
saying you know it's not just about
getting money for themselves but it's
about making sure that across the whole
of the industry that you know the
artists are ultimately treated for
and it's effectively like a big artist
standing up for all of the smaller
artists out though and I think that that
is a really you know when it comes to
negotiating how things kind of pan out
in this brand brave new world of
streaming there that the people who do
have clout effectively using it to
ensure the the future of the music
industry which is good that's really
positive and in fact Universal on the
only major label doing this Sony in the
summer of this year sold half of its
Spotify stake and that was valid at
seven hundred and sixty eight million
dollars and and the and I believe shared
it with did share with its artists yeah
so it's sold half it's it's taken and it
has again it's shared it with its
artists and Warner which is the other
kind of a major one yeah as a major
label has also sold some of its stake in
Spotify and gave the you know it said
that it would allocate money to the
artists but it is offsetting it against
the money that the art of the artist saw
them yeah again I don't necessarily
think is unfair like that money is is
owed and and the artist is effectively
getting that money like if you if you
won ten thousand pounds now whether you
got that in cash or whether they I
lopped it off say like your student loan
that's still money that in the long term
is coming back to you I guess it's about
saying - it's about the the label saying
to the artists you know we respect what
you're doing and we respect the fact
that you know we that this is not an
easy industry for you to produce the
kind of work in the is making us money
and that is allowing this industry to be
sustainable for the future so it's it's
a show of support really and you know
maybe they don't have to do it at all
but maybe they should be doing it yeah
and you know it's it's a it's one of
those cases and ultimately the labels
have agreed they've had they have said
yes actually we do think that we should
be doing this you know they
have to but they but they've made the
made that call and they've said that
actually yeah and they can see that this
is really important for the further
future of the music industry yeah so
it's not like it's just artists against
the labels and like fighting over who
should own them you know who should get
that money the labels are in agreement
here ultimately but this was this was a
real it's it's interesting that that
this hard fought over record deal that
this is one of the we don't know many of
the details about this record deal but
we rarely do we know is it's a
multi-album agreement this is one of the
stipulations the other is that that tell
us with will own all of that will own
all of the masters that she makes of for
all of the music that she makes from now
on or they'll revert back to her five
years after they've been released
effectively sure so so it was good for
her there's one there's one thing there
that's good for her and one thing though
that's good for all of the artists so
I'm sure there are lots of artists at
Universal Music Group who will probably
be incredibly grateful to her yeah
making sure that that was in there
because it is something that that it's
been rumored and that they've been
talking about and thinking about and you
know the artists a you know unless
somebody uses their leverage to ensure
it ensure that that happened and she has
leverage and asking issue but she's
using that she recognizes that she is a
big deal and not that she's you know
she's not trying to like hold him over a
barrel and anything like that she's not
trying to go in with these big big
demands that would be like negative on
the industry this is this is the whole
idea is that it's it's about doing
making a good step in the right
direction for more artists and the fact
that they have supported that is good
and as you write if it was a small
artist coming on they are they have to
fight to get with a good a good label
and often they don't get that they're
the terms that they want and and
therefore they can't turn around and say
we want to do we want to do this and
that's why we're seeing a lot of artists
who are coming in on much smaller labels
and
launching their own labels and launching
their own music independently because
they just can't make the money when when
Spotify doesn't pay I don't know what
the figure is but I know it's it's a
really shockingly poor amount if like
per stream like it's it's it's such a
zero point zero zero zero zero percent
per stream they'd have to have however
many thousands of streams in order to in
order to get even any money at all
but that's not what we want to talk
about cuz because we didn't we don't a
lot of this is is very sort of behind
closed doors Spotify and the labels
generally don't talk openly about how
much money is made and so it is
sometimes difficult to work out exactly
how much of changing hands it was a lot
of things where we only kind of hear
when certain bands or certain labels
will basically try and get a little bit
of publicity by by kicking up a fuss
about it but it's interesting for Taylor
has because she has very publicly gone
out against Spotify she also criticized
Apple music for the amount that it was
paying fans and an Apple both Apple and
Spotify worked to rehash their terms in
in in line with kind of what she wanted
but for all artists she wasn't she
wasn't just trying to do this for her
own music it was also for other artists
I feel like the the Spotify thing
obviously that was a good three years of
going back and forth and negotiating
never the Apple music thing was quite
extraordinary because that was a
turnaround of around 24 hours when that
happened you know she that effectively
it was when Apple said that it was going
to be launching its music service and
during the during the trial period when
when people can use the service for free
in order to decide whether they want to
sign up and pay for it or not they
weren't going to be paying artists the
you know for streams that happen during
trial periods which is kind of
outrageous you know given especially
given that they are one of the
wealthiest companies in the world and to
say that actually that they would were
not going to be paying artists for their
streams during his free trial that they
were giving away it was really I mean
now when you think about it even I mean
at the time but like now in retrospect
that seems totally out of
the less I actually didn't know that was
the case that is absolutely bonkers yeah
and the fact that Taylor Swift wrote
this letter and then 24 hours later Eddy
Cue he was in charge of Apple music when
we hear you fine we'll pay you yeah it's
almost like they've been caught
red-handed and they knew they had to
make this quick decision so you know I
don't see that as a good thing that
wasn't like they sat down and negotiated
over a period of time that was like oh
yeah we tried to get away with this and
we can so let's change it but again it
just shows that it really is it's
difficult for people to to create that
kind of change in the music industry and
to you know make stuff happen unless
they are a big-name and they can
guarantee a certain amount of publicity
and and it is up to the bigger artists
out there to to stand up and to sit and
to make take a stand in these situations
and that is not like it's great that
when you see artists doing that but I
mean it's a terrible precedent to set
for the music industry on the whole that
like the only way that things will ever
get better for artists and and change is
if like one person really takes it upon
themselves or perhaps a group of people
take it upon themselves you know I think
if the balance was more fairly
distributed in the first place and it
wouldn't necessary to do that it's
almost like the labels want the most
money for themselves and power that's a
surprising news thanks for joining us on
the scene at UK podcast where we bring
you the biggest tech scoops
moving swiftly on see what I did there
we're gonna talk a little bit of a
sampling Galaxy S 10k t is it that time
already we're getting close to that time
and we have mentioned this phone a
couple of times already on the podcast
but we're coming back to it now because
we have a new report this is coming in
from The Wall Street Journal credible
source we might we might say and those
guys say that the S 10 is going to come
in an immense six point seven inch size
that it will have six cameras and they
will have 5g what do you think of that
well I mean it's a tablet that's note
size
it's it's this whole thing about about
more cameras on the back of phones it
reminds me of like the a few years ago
when when phone manufacturers are having
that battle so kind of who can put the
most megapixels it's exactly the same
battle yeah and and it's so like it's so
like I think it's one of those things
that makes people it's probably I'm not
saying that there's no technical benefit
to having those six cameras on on a
phone but I think it's almost one of
those things where it's a its massive
one-upmanship and you know almost trying
to persuade people were more is better
you know and what what we spent a really
long time as tech journalists doing
during that like megapixel battle was
explaining to consumers actually more
isn't always better it's not that simple
like it's not the only thing that you
need to look at when you're deciding on
earth well it's not as it's not even as
simple as that because it's gonna be
four on the back two in the front so I
have two front facing cameras and
they're before cameras on the back at
the moment I think the most we've seen
on the back you know in a in a flagship
mainstream phone I'm not including
things like the Amazon fire phone which
had a billion cameras the huawei mate 20
pro and the the p20 Pro they had three
cameras and probably others so yeah four
is four would be probably quite a lot
and almost certainly we will see like
different things in terms of zoom like
telephoto zoom and they'll be almost
certainly things like 3d depth
recognition for like a better portrait
mode pictures or even like 3d scanning
objects and that's not of things I'll be
I'll be interesting um yes six point six
point seven inches that's gonna be very
very very big that's again in line with
a note range so we're not expecting this
to be the only s10 fermius will probably
be the biggest in a range of s10 phones
there's also had rumors where we may
have a whole range including like a
budget option almost like an s10 light
going through to you the flagship and
then this may be like the max
version biggest hyper powered phone of
the range 5g isn't surprising because
next year in UK is when we're going to
start seeing 5g launching EE and
Vodafone have both said that is next
year we're going to see 5g launching to
consumers right now we have already got
trials going on trials don't count its
when it actually goes on sale and that
is gonna be next year in I think
starting in 20 cities in the country but
it will start to spread so that's gonna
be really interesting because it will be
MD BC in Barcelona and that's the big
mobile showcase where we see all the big
brands showing off their new wares we're
gonna start seeing a lot more talk about
5g phones and a lot more phones actually
going on sale so it'll be interesting to
see 5g launching in that phone but not
surprising that's in line with what we
expect to see I mean I so when it comes
to 5g phones
I expect actually we might start to see
some announcements over the next few
weeks and the reason that I say that is
because a lot of the 5g phones will be
at will contain Qualcomm z-- 7 nanometre
chipsets that it's been developing for
5g and I stand there and Qualcomm's do
to make some announcements I think over
the next few weeks I don't know
specifically what they are but I imagine
they might not announce these specific
phones but they might and they might
announce some partnerships and you know
sort of say we will be seeing 5g phones
from these manufacturers specifically
next year I don't know if Samsung will
be among them and when I definitely will
like we know a lot of the Chinese
manufacturers and but but we yeah we
expect that we will start to see these
first 5g handsets in in the flesh
hopefully at Mobile World Congress next
year and the the one thing that is going
to be really interesting for Samsung
specifically I think is that often
Samsung is at the top battling out with
Apple to see who can have the most
exciting flagship phone of the year and
ever six cameras yes and what we do as
far as we know and we might not be
getting a fighty iPhone
year in you know in accordance with the
kind of the life the the life cycle the
release cycle of I phone so we could be
getting a 5g flagship phone from Samsung
but not from Apple and so if you are one
of those people that always wants to get
you know a flagship phone every year and
you know you're agnostic when it comes
to operating system and then this could
be a really crucial thing if you see
yourself as an early adopter of new
technologies because you know it's
possible we don't know for sure I just
like to caveat that and but it might be
a choice between getting a 5g phone and
an iPhone next year yeah but that also I
think it's gonna be worth remembering
that 5g is exciting as a concept but 5g
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to
have suddenly supercharged speed it's
not suddenly everything's going to be
faster and better quality and it 5g goes
a little bit beyond that the way and I'm
not gonna get too technical because a
lot of this is still a little bit
surprisingly theoretical but it's about
the way it uses the networks is is more
its talked about bigger bandwidth so
connecting a lot more Internet of Things
devices so as everything you have in
your house your car your office place is
connected from you know not just your
phone and your laptop but fridges and
light bulbs and and everything else in
your house there's a lot more bandwidth
into 5g to support those devices so it's
not just about suddenly you can stream
YouTube 4k even faster we can already do
that now so things like that isn't gonna
make a lot of a lot of difference so
yeah I think at the moment it's
important not to get blown away by what
inevitably will be that hype around 5g
is bigger and better you have to have
finally almost certainly EE Vodafone the
other networks when they launch 5g it
will be targeted as this is the fastest
the best thing to have and there's gonna
be a lot of rhetoric going around about
that but realistically in certainly in
the early days that isn't necessarily
going to mean you have you have got the
best service there's a lot of things we
don't know about how well that signal is
going to penetrate into rural areas some
apparently 5g will help with because of
the way that this thing signals work so
there's a lot of unknowns basically I'm
saying right now is like if that battle
between Samsung on potentially 5g and
Apple potentially not being on 5g is not
necessarily one is going to be faster
this is very true and I think that them
for the majority of people I don't I
don't think that 5g will fight or 5g
contract will necessarily be something
that you will either want to pay for and
or that you will feel that you need
maybe for another two to three years
realistically and you know it's
important to remember that 5g is built
on a base of 4G and you know you can the
the 4G is also improving and 4G is
getting better all the time
and that the the advante advanced
contracts out there you know the ones
that are offering really really high
speeds you know probably are gonna be
equally as desirable for a while as 5g
yeah I'm a services that you use won't
won't immediately catch up to demanding
those speeds in the same way as you know
Netflix now on the go you get support
you can you can now use get much better
quality video and you can stream it very
comfortably but those services weren't
really designed for phones and apps when
4G first launched anyway it's only as
its developed and P and more people have
it that those services become available
the same thing will happen so it's one
of those things that isn't you may not
necessarily need to be an early adopter
back to the phone no will it fold
because of course we were talking last
time about Samsung's foldable phone
which is showed off and will be an
official product we believe no that is
going to be a second product line we're
not going to see the s10 as the first in
that a foldable line of smartphones
instead the follow ball phone will
probably be the galaxy x or the galaxy f
and that will almost certainly be a
product line launching alongside the
Galaxy S line of phones which makes
sense because that is another one of
Samsung's I'm gonna say gimmicks I don't
necessarily mean that in a concert
experiment it's fine again like you know
we talked about last time with the
Galaxy K zoom their camera
phone and they have their their curve
not bendy but curved phone before and
out so yeah I something did want to
something LG I think HTC may have had
one there at very few and thankfully
they went away pretty quickly but yeah
so we're gonna we're gonna obviously
keep our eye very very closely on
Samsung's Galaxy S 10 and the foldable
phone and of course 5g developments I
would be interested actually to know how
excited our audience is podcast
listeners or watches how how keen you
are to get 5g and how do you think it's
gonna make a difference so if you do
have any thoughts on that please do let
us know the email address is seen at UK
podcast at CBS i.com or you can tweet
Katie Collins or battery HQ if you'd
rather do it that way I'm genuinely do
you want to know what you think about
that so please do tell us but I think we
should move on to something a little bit
more festive and that of course is
Netflix yes who apparently have a good
line in soppy Christmas films they do
and some of them have already been
released some of them are still to be
released over the over the coming weeks
for example if you were a fan of last
year's the Christmas prints I think that
there is a sequel lined up - that should
be coming out sometime over the next
week on that but there are also a whole
range of other Christmas movies there
should be should be either available to
you now or coming soon the big one that
they're plugging at the moment yes the
princess switch now we watch that over
the weekend with ex of this show Luke
Westaway and I'm gonna say it's not
exactly a corker of a film I mean I I
would say it's deeply flawed and and
deeply flawed do matter that on the
poster but I do think you know I'm
currently writing my review of this and
I have said that I think the while it's
kind of a botched attempt at a Christmas
rom-com and has many faults
do think that there is a strong argument
for maybe stickiness on the telly on
Christmas Day and as a sort of cross
generational people-pleaser I don't
think I think for kids I think that they
might not notice a lot of the
inconsistencies and weirdness that
adults might pick up on adults and we as
we were watching it I think we had a
really good time just laughing at some
of the ridiculousness
the whole concept is flawed as a basic
spoiler-free premise it's a baker
attending a baking competition in a town
or a country what a small European
country called Belgravia oh yeah which
is effectively supposed to be like
Monaco I think where it's basically a
principality and and in this town where
there's bacon Commission is happening
there was a princess do to marry a
prince but she's not a princess she's a
duchess princess the title is not
actually a pretty no she's actually a
duchess and the princess and Baker find
out they look identical and decide to
switch hilarity ensues now I yeah I did
say that this is it is charming in that
it's just it's very nice and it's it's
just a bit silly but Vanessa Hudgens
gives a great performance in both of the
lead roles
yeah a princess it's just very I don't
know if it's poorly done or if it's
intentionally done to be a little bit
silly for example like they over there
they go to Wembley studios to film
things and I use to try and make it
English even though it's not supposed to
be England and there's bad English
accents all over the place and and
weirdness oh it's all over the place I
really think that this is one of those
shows well one of those films sorry that
like in the in the age of like made for
TV specials in America that the Disney
Channel would have got away with this
and nobody would have questioned it
because it would have been made for
American audiences and you know a lot of
Americans might not have been to Europe
so they might not know what your apps
like but in this age of streaming where
they're pushing it as hard to European
audiences as American audiences and you
know this is you know there's more
international travel going on these days
as well I think that their depiction
if Europe is totally overblown and
ridiculous and it's the most like it's
so American and twee that like I I just
it's it's very kind of hard to believe
it is we said over time one of the the
main house where they stay in it looks
just like they've just taken one of
their Western sets one of the western
movie sets and just blasted it with the
snow because it's a total like American
ranch house sort of thing but they're
just dressed it up to try and look like
some swiss mountain town chalet and it
doesn't work yeah that's one of that is
but frankly the least of my concerns
with the film but it is it is charming I
highly recommend giving it a watch
because it's funny
in its awfulness in a sense and but I do
suggest watching with a group of friends
where you want to feel a little bit
festive if you're a student in holes and
you want to get everyone together and
watch a movie and you've all seen home
alone too many times and like me you
don't agree with a die-hard as a
Christmas film pop this on but have a
good few drinks with it it's definitely
one that I think a certain amount of
beer and wine will improve it
dramatically like for us anyway I think
you know if you're a family and you're
watching you on Christmas Day like I
said I think the kids will like it I
think the parents will laugh at it and
the grandparents can happily fall asleep
during it and can't have sherry too many
with this one but what about a different
film was you've been to see a fantastic
bit too recently yes so well I suspect
that the princess which is something of
a low-budget effort for for a Netflix
film this is like the opposite end of
the spending more money was spent on
this too is its kind of it's got a real
epic sort of sense to it you know before
we go on sorry to interrupt you we're
going spoiler free here aren't we just
in case anyone is switching off its
spoiler free I haven't seen this either
I will need to be careful yes I will
concentrate on what I'm saying you spoil
this for me and with but we've got so on
CNET we've got a spoiler free review
that you can read and then we've got a
piece that I've written which is all of
the outstanding questions
that the film threw it for me which
there were a lot of things that I was
left wondering about at the end that you
know does contain spoilers so if you
have seen film then maybe check that
list out and see if you agree because I
was left feeling a little bit confused
and frustrated at the end of it so if
you are a Harry Potter fan and also felt
like that then you might find some some
questions on those lists what frustrated
you the most if you can say without can
you and oh you know I think I probably
can say so I feel like oh actually it's
not rip that's not risk it let's let's
go let's go a different a different way
then and did you enjoy it
did you enjoy it as a Harry Potter fan
and would you enjoy it as someone new
like would you recommend it to anyone
who's new to the franchise no we didn't
and because I think that it relies on a
lot of knowledge of like past films okay
I also don't think that it necessarily
be fine and you have a vague idea of
Harry Potter then you probably okay
watching it but like don't watch it on
its own and I think that is probably I
did find it enjoyable like I didn't I
did enjoy the process of watching it but
it's not one of those films that you
would ever just be like oh we'll stick
crime so Grindelwald on the telly like
yeah as a standalone thing and I think
that actually if you if you are gonna
create a film like this I spend that
much money on it
I actually don't I think that you should
be able to watch it as a standalone and
I do that with a / Harry Potter feel
less less so with definite Hallows one
and two but with three other ones I will
happily pop certainly Prisoner of
Azkaban because I think that one out of
all of them is the story that stands up
on its own the most but the other ones I
mean yeah it's obviously still following
the same the same general overarching
plot but it's still got its own distinct
beginning middle in it exactly and I
think it also really helps that you know
they did though the stories are very
distinct and they had different
directors for each of the different
films so that you kind of have like a
different thing kind of going on then
and actually that inconsistency doesn't
really matter because the
the you know if you know anything about
Harry Potter you know the how much the
story changes and how it gets really how
it gets much darker yeah as it goes on
and so the kind of femme the more
childlike qualities that the first felt
first two films have both in terms of
the storyline and the production values
I think really really shifts later on
and it allows the stories to stand up on
their own this is not a film that will
stand up on its own I don't think I
would like to be proved wrong in future
I genuinely I wanted to like this more
than I did and I think I enjoyed it but
fundamentally it is not a good film
damning thoughts so we shall leave it on
that note obviously fantastic piece to
is out now I believe and I mean I think
some of those things that even if if
you're if you're a potter fan already
even being told it's not a good film
you're gonna go and say it yeah why
wouldn't you unless unless you've been
told for some reason it's so terrible
it's not worth your money you'll still
say at some point but I mean and it's
it's beautiful it's high budget like you
know it the sets the costumes the
creatures you know that there's still a
lot to admire in there is there another
cute steely sort of moly from the first
fantastic beasts film make a return and
kind of play a crucial role in the plot
I think don't watch it to find out what
that is there a highlight okay that's
good to know
yeah let's move on very quickly before
we end on a little talk about our
favorite iPhone games now I don't want
to talk about this because we got
chatting about this earlier in the day
and maybe realize that we don't really
talk about iPhone games at all on the
podcast I talk a great length as you'll
know about some of the triple-a console
titles like Dead Redemption 2 which I've
talked about three episodes in a row and
is still brilliant by the way and my
horse Mary Poppins is fantastic um but I
want to talk about mobile games a little
bit because we've both had our noses
firmly stuck in a couple of games for
weeks and weeks and weeks now months in
fact
for me but why don't you start tell us
about your game and yes so I've been
playing a game called home design home
design and I found out about this
because my one of them one of our
editors in the US
Leslie Katz wrote a brilliant piece
about how she'd become really obsessed
with it and it sounded great and so I
decided that I would download it and
also have a go and I will link to the
piece in them in the story and in the
show notes
I mean I will yes but ultimately this is
a game that is its it kind of is does
what it says on the tin you design homes
I mean you design creative names is it
for a creative game and it's very
descriptive I suppose but the yeah it's
a sort of a comment if there's a
competitive element to it so you design
a room and it's judged against other
rooms that you know have you been given
a kind of a blank slate as it were and
and a concept a little storyline about
about people that perhaps live there so
like it's gonna be a Alpine chalet
retreat yeah or Manhattan stylish
apartment I might try and pull some of
the descriptions up actually because
they are really rather good but at least
you place furniture and your place art
and you place other decorations in and
those are believe all the decorations
all the furniture and stuff they are
actually real products and real
designers real stores so everything
you're creating could be made yeah this
is correct and it's not sponsored by any
it's not like it's not like you know
it's not kind of created or sort of
officially sponsored but I think certain
challenges are sponsored by certain
interior decor companies and is a very
amateur home decor enthusiast I don't
actually know a lot about the company so
I couldn't really know you know I'm new
to interior design but there may be like
a habitat challenge where habitat site
you don't you know decorate this room
all but were there anything
from our catalogue yeah habitat is like
the only place I could think of it
wasn't John Lewis it was one and it was
you had to design a kid's room in
Queensland in Australia and the brief
was to design a giraffe seemed bedroom
for a little girl and which you'd like
that which was one of my favorite
challenges the here was another one this
was that they can get quite specific so
this one was you need to do to need to
design a living room in Edinburgh
Scotland style style a modern study for
a Lepidoptera test I think that's how
you say it moving into her new home in
Edinburgh Scotland with top I am had to
had to google that and it was them I
think it's somebody who studies
butterflies so yeah like they can get
really like specific so yeah I really
like I love this game I find it like
really kind of meditative I usually do
like one or two challenges a day you get
like a daily reward for kind of going
these challenges right how what's there
people people vote to like decide you
know whether whether you and you get a
kind of overall you get a score out of
five stars and and if you get over four
stars you get certain prizes you get
more furniture and if you get 5 stars
you get even bigger prizes and you know
for each no I only had a couple of five
stars it's really hard to get five stars
and four for each of the challenges you
also earn money for your duties real
money your services now as an interior
designer so and you know I am NOT one
for gaming that much but when you know
when there is something like this then I
quite take there's more of a creative
challenge yeah yeah the gaming element
is is pretty minimal yeah you just want
to design a really nice looking room I
think that's cool and I do like that
it's it's brand diagnostic in the sense
that it's not it's all game that I can
really see I care have made given that
they do basically have that technology
already they use it yeah and you can
design rooms using there so you can see
what things look like but
defying it it seems like a really really
cool idea isn't it it's an Android it's
you know you can obviously pay to buy
more stuff within the game I've paid a
little bit I would say no more than ten
pounds maximum aying it for a few months
so yeah you've definitely got that value
and I think is good with with any any
game is free to play like that I on one
hand I'm always loathed to give in to
any eye pop-ups and anything like that
it's like you know basically means pay
to win if you want to actually play any
more than you've got a pair yeah the
other hand when I when I find a game but
I enjoy and I think a lot of hours in I
will pay what I believe I should have
paid or maybe would have paid if I'd
have bought this for the amount of hours
I've played yeah or a games like true
skates like a skateboarding game on the
iPhone which I play I would love to know
how many at much I play because I reckon
I play that in the certainly in the
hundreds of hours if not thousands
because I will play that at least an
hour every single day on my commutes and
have done for the last several years is
that the game that you wanted to tell us
about no it isn't no I wanted to talk
about asphalt 9 which is Gameloft's it's
their big high-profile
racing series and they asked well now I
came out I sought my legends I believe
it's called came out a good few months
ago now but I've been playing it pretty
solidly since it came out and it is
brilliant it's so much fun I did like
the asphalt Series before but not as
much as I've enjoyed this one it's I
don't know what it is I mean one looks
brilliant but the gameplay is a little
bit easy because it has these like Auto
Drive functions basically it's a car
racing game like I'm gonna ask the car
racing game yeah but there is like these
Auto Drive functions where instead of
having to focus on like tilting the
phone to get it just right which can be
a little difficult to do or if you're
playing on your commute it does the
driving for you and use of decide the
routes you want to take there's are
always different routes and if you want
us or take this route which will take
you on a particular jump and you earn
like basically extra speed for the
tricks or if you want to go and get like
a a bottle of nitrous which I meant you
go
you know it's a bit more tactics rather
than it is about skill at racing but it
is a game which is it's free to play and
is fundamentally revolves around the
money making part of it is you know do
you want to buy like card packs to get
new cars do you want to pay to upgrade
certain cars but you can do all of that
without paying a penny should you want
to you can get it's more difficult it's
certainly more time-consuming but you
can but you can do it and I actually
think they've got a really good balance
in not by blasting you constantly with
oh by this and it's this much money and
you know I think they've got a good
balance I played plenty of games which
certainly EA games who have historically
been really bad at this sort of thing
where it's really like if you want to do
anything in this game you've got to pay
money there they're real suckers for the
whole o if you know in Sim City for
example you wanted to a building to be
built immediately then spend like five
quid or whatever for it to be done or
wait three days in real time for it to
be done so I think they've done really
good it's a lot of fun to play and it
you really kind of for me I feel
committed to wanting to unlock more cars
and when you do I want to actually play
I want to I want to build them up I'm as
a good multiplayer thing as well where
it matches you with other real players
around the world and I think that's good
as well because I often I don't have
that in a lot of games there's not a lot
of a multiplayer element but a racing
game obviously makes a lot of sense and
I think they've got a good balance of
how they match you up with other people
I tend to be able to come first or
second on some and some of them I will
come 7th or 8th and it's almost got like
that Mario Kart thing where you can be
doing really really well the whole race
and then someone takes you down because
there is that you know you can crash
into people and take them out of the
race and then suddenly you're in the
last place and it is really annoying but
in a way that you kind of want to keep
playing again like Mario Kart where two
laps you're in first place and right is
about to cross the finish line someone
hits you with a shell in your back at
the end which is annoying but it's kind
of fun in the same way yeah I guess it
it's just like there's always everything
to play for yes a nice feeling yeah but
it's great yeah and I say it's freeze on
iOS and it on Android it looks great I
think it's probably quite demanding I'm
playing an iPhone
and I've been using it as my benchmark
game on a lot of the other flagships and
it plays really really well I haven't
played it on a really low end Android
phone so I'm I'm not sure if it will run
particularly well because it is so
glossy there are so many swooshing
effects and light things and all kinds
of other things going on so I suspect
it's probably for higher-end phones only
but it's definitely worth checking out
if you are after a racing game the only
downside that I do have is it you do
need an internet connection to play it
so oh and that same thing for that yeah
and I find that a little frustrating if
you're on the tube a lot but I tend not
to go underground as much anymore
because I'm not womble so there we go
to games that are great and if you want
to spend some time away from your family
at Christmas and just having a bit of
gaming then those are good ones to go
for but that does bring us to a close
