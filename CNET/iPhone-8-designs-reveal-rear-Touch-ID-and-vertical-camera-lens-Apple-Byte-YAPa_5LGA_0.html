the Apple bite for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple let's get
to it and a new potential design for the
next iPhone has now surfaced from two
separate sources now buckle up because I
know some of you might not like this a
user on the Asian blogging site Weibo
released an image of what appeared to be
a manufacturing design to the rumored
5.8 inch OLED display iPhone and look at
that is that a touch ID sensor on the
rear side below the Apple logo now the
image shows a vertical dual camera lens
and appears to be in the engineering
verification testing stage it also
features a larger display with minimal
top and bottom bezels just like that
galaxy s 8 then reputable iPhone leaker
Sonny Dixon just released his own
picture of the rumored iPhones design
schematics that feature guess what a
touch ID sensor on the rear with the
vertical camera design and height and
width measurements that match up exactly
with the previously is this fake or not
we heard counting companies report from
last week's show that Apple is having
problems with yield rates for
integrating the under glass fingerprint
sensor directly into the display now
Samsung had similar problems and now
Apple may have to consider one of their
alternative designs we know Apple is
working with at least 10 different
iPhone designs from previous reports but
I'm just going to take a step back here
now there's a lot of you that are saying
no no do not do this Apple but you know
what
I'm completely ok with this design if
they can't get the fingerprint sensor on
the front panel this year it will be a
stopgap until then and you know what it
has to be now maybe it'll surprise and
do what Samsung couldn't do this year
get it working on the front now I've
used the rear fingerprint sensor on the
Google pixel and it naturally just feels
right like check this out just try
putting your phone on the table ok pick
it up I'm going to pick this one up and
your hands they don't grab around it
they in fact kind of just naturally fall
into this spot in your index finger ends
up roughly in that sweet spot now the
biggest bummer is for people who are
used to unlocking their phone while it
rests on a desk or table and look at it
without picking it up I feel for you but
remember Apple told us it took courage
to remove the headphone jack courage
the courage to move on do something new
that betters all of us and our team has
tremendous courage so maybe they'll call
this move bravery
all right and guess what
none of this is official so we could all
be worried about nothing at all
so what do you think of the rumor design
leaks are you okay with it you
completely despise it let us know in the
comments and I'll read the ones that
don't call me a skunk or a ladyboy all
right another follow up report from
digits x confirms that the new pro iMac
will likely be ready for very late 2017
described as a server grade the new iMac
will feature an Intel Xeon e3 1285
processor with ECC Ram up to 64 gigs and
nvme solid-state storage up to 2
terabytes with USB C ports and support
for a new AMD GPU now the report adds
that the consumer versions for the 21.5
inch and 27-inch sizes will be
manufactured by quanta and could launch
in July or an August timeframe but the
pro iMac will arrive at the end of the
year and if you've been holding out or
haven't purchased iMac since 2013 Apple
is making iMovie GarageBand and Iwerks
apps for the Mac and iOS free for all
users I said free now they made these
apps available to new Mac and iOS owners
but now everyone can get them and
speaking of free I have to mention that
Blizzard has made the original Starcraft
available for free to promote the 4k
remastered version of the game coming
out later this year now you know how
many hours I play to this game instead
of meeting girls
but check it out it works I downloaded
it you can play online and it even
includes the brood wars expansion so
just check out this link and you'll find
the download for both Mac and Windows
all right if you think that Apple has
left the creative world in the dust
because of its lack of powerhouse Mac
support there are still some cool
stories about how creative pros are
using the Apple's current product line
for amazing work now check this out
publisher Conde Nast unveiled the first
ever travel publication cover to be shot
on an iPhone 7 plus in its May 2017
issue of traveler they use the iPhone 7
plus as portrait mode and applied the
depth of field to the shot of this boat
taken in st. Barts now that's pretty
awesome
our good friend of the show CNET's owned
a videographer John Kim uses his iPhone
7 plus to take pictures of fish from
Thai restaurants and yeah that was
good alright and what about that iPad
pro my favorite Apple product because
that screen is so juicy artist teacher
and sports fan Rob generate the third
who goes by the name Rob Zilla uses the
iPad pro the Apple pencil and Adobe
Illustrator draw to create some amazing
illustrations of NBA superstars he's
done work for the Washington Wizards who
have no chance of getting to the NBA
Finals and my team the Golden State
Warriors with everyone's favorite player
Kevin Durant who left to join a team
lightyears ahead of the entire NBA now
this is just amazing stuff you can check
out his work on his Instagram right here
and also I can't wait for the Warriors
blue a 3-1 lead comments all right
that's going to do it for this week you
can email us at the Apple bite at
cnet.com or tweet me at brian tong and
again let us know how you feel about
that
iPhone rear touch ID design thank so
much for watching we'll catch y'all next
time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
