her friends joining facebook and asked
her mom if she could do the same even
though she didn't meet the minimum age
limit of 13 he just did what most people
do and just put like fake birthday on
facebook and i wanted to do that but i'm
in all said no mum Luna was firm but
child advocates say underage facebook
users are common about 7 million kids on
facebook under the age of 13 and five
million are under the age of 10 luna
allowed kieran to open an account once
she was old enough but the privilege
came with advice I told her anything you
post on Facebook is out there so it
always come to haunt you experts say
parental guidance is key when kids start
using social media for younger kids
parents do friend their child when you
sign up for facebook sit next to your
child walk your child through the
privacy settings creative friends only
environment at first and then as as he
or she acclimates to social media you
know Leo pin' their privacy settings and
how should you handle passwords with
some coaxing Luna got ahold of Kieran's
I didn't really want her to have my
password because I thought if I wasn't
fair but then I just gave it to her
anyways but there is a strong argument
against that I think it's really
important to be consistent with your
children about setting strong passwords
and then keeping them to yourselves
often times kids will share their
Facebook passwords and that can get kids
into a lot of trouble because other kids
will post on on your behalf and how they
manage that reputation is super
important not just because of how their
peers are going to view them but also
potentially how colleges will look at
them future employers that advice
applies to popular photo-sharing apps
like Instagram and snapchat too although
snapchat carries an additional caveat
since images sent from that app can only
be viewed for a few seconds before they
delete automatically snapchat doesn't
teach kids the long-term lesson of a
digital footprint parents should also
watch
warning signals that their child is
spending too much time on social
networks for example if they unfriend
you good advice would be to keep your
computer in a central location like a
family room or a kitchen so that you can
see what's going on above all it's
important for families to have an
ongoing conversation as their kids use
of social media changes and evolves in
