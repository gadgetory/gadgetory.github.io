console I ever bought with my own money
it holds a very special place in my
heart and the hearts of gamers from that
very special generation now before you
get the torches and pitchforks ready
there's really no way to declare the
best games of any console generation so
just know that this list has been
crafted with the help and input of
countless industry professionals
listeners of the giant beast cast the
404 and dozens of tips from Twitter and
other social media outlets in no
particular order here are the best 10
PlayStation 1 games of all time Tony
Hawk's Pro Skater became an instant
classic overnight and the game sequel
introduced us to the game staple
mechanic manuals who doesn't have
memories of staying up all night just to
find the secret tape in the schoolyard
level I don't know about you but Silent
Hill was one of the first games to ever
give me a genuine scare all right sure
Silent Hill looks dated by today's
standards but nevertheless it totally
nailed a terrifying atmosphere and
cemented the survival horror genre for
many years to come the original tomb
raider harkens back to a time where
there were no tutorials and you were
simply on your own that's the amazing
sense of isolation Tomb Raider was able
to create forcing the player to discover
and explore the world at their own pace
the game also spawned one of gaming's
most recognizable characters Lara Croft
who's been in a few games I think since
then while it may have been dubbed a
sleeper hit when it was first released
Castlevania Symphony of the Night
quickly gained success through
word-of-mouth this was the first
Castlevania game to feature a nonlinear
map where players weren't necessarily
led down the same path it set a
precedent for the franchise which has
been continued from there on out
Final Fantasy seven shocked players with
its gorgeous pre-rendered 3d graphics
and gripping storyline it also marked
one of the biggest promotional campaigns
for a game of its time something that
was mostly unheard of up until then the
game had such an impressive legacy that
it's actually getting a full remake not
just an HD reboot but an actual let's
build this game from the ground up all
over again on PlayStation 4 it seems
like the car combat genre has fallen off
in recent years but nothing could touch
twisted metal - on the original
PlayStation it was the ultimate couch
game for split-screen multiplayer
twisted metal to feature totally unique
vehicles and even crazier personalities
to drive them smartly designed
battlefield maps and an ultra satisfying
control and gameplay scheme so where
Silent Hill helped cement the survival
horror genre Resident Evil is the
franchise that started it all it's 1998
sequel Resident Evil to set the bar even
higher and is widely regarded as the
best Resident Evil title of course
before the masterpiece known as Resident
Evil 4 the game's legacy continues today
and its story is often referenced in
countless works of fiction and it too is
also being rumored to be getting a full
remake treatment next up on our list is
Gran Turismo 2 which at its time was the
absolute most realistic racing
simulation of all time the game featured
somewhere around 650 drivable cars which
was totally unheard of
Sony's first-ever gaming mascot spins
his way onto our list Crash Bandicoot
with Sony Sonic there Mario if you will
and gave players a go to charming
platformer that also served as many
players introduction to the console as
well crash went on to see many sequels
but none have had such a special place
in our hearts like the original I bet
you thought I forgot it I bet you were
sitting there thinking oh man this guy's
not gonna forget that game did he he
didn't forget Metal Gear Solid did he of
course I didn't I mean this game changed
my life
it's tough to put into words just how
important Metal Gear Solid was and is to
gaming in general it introduced
countless game techniques and forced
people to change the way they thought
about video games it innovated where no
one had done before and basically
created the modern stealth genre by
itself not to mention to this day Metal
Gear Solid still has the most clever use
of a game controller in a boss fight
fought for many Metal Gear Solid was the
first game that they played that
actually felt like a movie did I want to
include more games in the list of course
I did I wanted to make sure cool borders
3 was represented I wanted to have room
for Chrono Cross for jet moto for Rayman
bushido blade
what about wipeout and vagrant story and
legacy of kain Soul Reaver parappa the
rapper how could you leave out the most
important rhythm game of our time stay
tuned for the next roundup of games
until then I'm Jeff Bakalar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
