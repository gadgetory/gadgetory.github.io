here with the review of pure
imaginations perfect bake now this $70
kit comes with a digital scale a stand
for your phone or tablet three mixing
bowls and an oven thermometer basically
pure imagination just wants to make it
simpler for you and your family to bake
the foods you love one of the ways they
do that is by using this digital scale
they say that measuring is less precise
and you don't really want to be messing
around with that when it comes to baking
it's really more of a science than an
art another way they want to simplify
the baking process is by their app the
perfect bake app it's available for free
for Android and iOS users I think it
works best with a tablet so you can
really see everything you simply connect
the scale to the headphone jack of your
phone or tablet and start baking and it
makes the process so simple I think this
would be particularly good for families
with young children for a really
interactive fun baking experience or for
novice bakers who really don't want to
deal with measuring cups and imprecision
and just have something kind of take all
of the guesswork out of it so I used
pure imaginations recipe index and I
made lemon squares and a flourless
chocolate cake
both were incredibly easy to make and it
walked me through the whole process
without any issues whatsoever so to get
started you just hit the bake button at
the bottom of whatever recipe you want
to make and then from there it'll tell
you how to prepare everything how to set
out the baking sheet if you should cover
it with parchment paper if you should
use butter to grease the pan as you're
adding ingredients it tells you how much
you've added how much you have left and
it'll ding when you've reached the right
weight so once you've added all your
ingredients the app will instruct you to
whisk them or mix them or whatever needs
to be done and walk you all the way
through to the baking process where
you're actually putting it into the oven
including a timer that will go off when
it's finished baking overall I'm really
impressed with perfect bake it's
definitely a niche product geared toward
beginner bakers or families who want a
fun interactive experience but 70 bucks
isn't bad and I have no problem
recommending it thanks for watching be
