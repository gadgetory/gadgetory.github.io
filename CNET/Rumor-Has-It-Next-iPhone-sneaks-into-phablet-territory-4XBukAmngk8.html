has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors you can vote
what you think about the rumors too in
the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet this week Motorola
could be dreaming up a tattoo that
rivals the microphone that I already
have on my wrist an apple might be going
bigger in 2014 let's get started first
up google-owned Motorola Mobility filed
a patent that details a wireless
microphone that can be tattooed onto the
throat the tattoo would be used to
reasonably improve communication because
it would lessen acoustic noise so now
you'd have a neck tattoo and it would
only work marginally better than a
jawbone bluetooth headset the Atlantic
dug a little bit deeper into the patent
revealing that the tattoo could have a
display that lights up different colors
and it could also basically be able to
detect if you were lying based on
whether you were struggling to say words
just what the world needs a light up
tattoo on the side of our necks that
light up when we lie so no thank you
unless that thing can send texts I'll
stick with my microphone tattoo that
does nothing but sit there next not five
minutes after the new iPhones were
revealed a source told Bloomberg that
Apple's developing new iPhone designs
including bigger screens with curved
glass and enhanced sensors that can
detect different levels of pressure
curved phone screens are relatively new
and rare but they're not unheard of
there's the samsung galaxy round and the
LG G flex which curve to help make
holding the phone easier to give you an
idea of what it could look like the
folks over at my voucher codes created a
pretty awesome-looking 3d rendering I'd
buy that people are split when it comes
to the phone screen size debate my
producer likes a smaller screen phone
that can fit easily into a pocket but my
mom is super stoked about our galaxy
note 2 because she can read the screen
what do you guys think what side of the
screen debate are you does a curved
screen make a difference or do you just
want something bigger than what we have
now don't forget to vote in our poll and
leave a comment that's our show
