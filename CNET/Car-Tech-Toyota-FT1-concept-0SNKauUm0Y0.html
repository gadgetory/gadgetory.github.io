been really seen fuel-efficient and
reliable cars such as the Camry in the
Prius but in the 2014 Detroit Auto Show
they brought out this this is the FT one
concept car this car is a signal kind of
a shot over the bow that Toyota has
returned to dramatic styling has
returned to the kind of sports cars that
they had with the Celica in this car we
see a lot of aerodynamic features such
as these huge air intakes in front to
feed the engine and these air vents on
the side to add cooling to the brakes we
have this big spoiler in the back it's
an automatically adjustable spoiler it
looks like it'll come up or down
depending on the speed of the car and
even the side mirrors have aerodynamic
features they're kind of away from the
body of the car to allow better airflow
around the vehicle we have two bumps in
the roof of the car that should allow
the passenger and driver to wear helmets
while sitting in the cockpit we even
have a transparent cover over the engine
that's sort of a four are any kind of
thing so you can actually see the engine
here we've got red valve covers you can
even see the the strut brace on the top
here of course all of this is kind of
for show this is actually not even
intended for production Toyota has
released no specs about this this
supposed engine we can see here is a
dummy and in fact Toyota designers
actually made this car about a hundred
ten percent of the size it would be as
an actual car because that size will
really give it more presence on the show
floor it's really intended just as a
show car now we also have some high tech
elements around this car such as LED
headlights and let's go look in the
cabin to see some of the high-tech
elements they have in there as well now
in the cabin here we have a head-up
display on a little panel above the
dashboard this will show the drivers
speed and engine speed and stuff like
that and Twitter has also put a couple
of little displays at the top of the
steering wheel here we get to see what
mode the car is in whether it's in sport
mode or normal mode and also what gear
it's in now gear is interested in this
car because there's no shifter on the
console so we can assume it has some
kind of dual clutch automated manual or
just regular automatic transmission
there's paddle shifters on this
during wheel so even though this car is
really just a concept and Toyota's not
gonna put anything exactly like it into
production you can drive it in the Gran
Turismo 6 video game they've got a
version as downloadable content so you
can put it on the track try it out
apparently it handles really well in the
game but we won't be able to try that on
the road I'm Wayne Cunningham here at
the 2014 Detroit Auto Show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
