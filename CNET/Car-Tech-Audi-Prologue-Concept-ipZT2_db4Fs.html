this is a new era of exterior design
they think will Express technology on
the outside of the car
not just on the inside like they've been
doing leather admirably lately now I'm
not sure the outside of the car says
tech to me but it definitely says two
things power because it's wider more
muscular has these haunches around it it
also says Quattro because it really
emphasizes the bulges around the wheels
that of course then underline Audi's
all-wheel drive Quattro system the power
plants being expected a relatively
conventional fashion in terms of
architecture a four liter twin-turbo v8
what's interesting is they're also
talking about introducing a 48 volt
electrical subsystem alongside the
conventional 12 volt that 48 volt
subsystem is tied into a mild hybrid
system where it basically uses the belt
for the starter generator to kind of
recap the engine and also add a little
more torque now let this going on inside
this car a couple of interesting themes
first of all we have this all video
instrument panel all virtual we've seen
that in the latest TT but notice here
they've got 3d depth you'll see some
animations there of both information on
the wings and also your driving path is
rolled out in a 3d representation down
and deep in the center now along here
this entire band if you look carefully
it's going through different video modes
video screen video screen video screen
all of this is video and touch there's
hardly a knob or button in this entire
vehicle just a couple of stalks around
the wheel and some shift paddles what's
interesting here is Audi says by getting
rid of buttons they have not forced you
into lots of stacked menus that can be a
real drag instead they're surfacing a
lot of functions in kind of a dedicated
zone here's our last treat right here
this is a flexible OLED panel that
powers up and tilts to your hand when
you start the vehicle I'm not sure why
it needs to be up and down and can't be
up all the time but it's pretty cool now
the Prolog is technically a concept car
but if you look at it it's kind of
missing a lot of the concept cues there
no gullwing doors no rear cameras
instead of side mirrors this looks like
a relatively producible car
howdy says this is going to fairly soon
start to inform the look of their models
so get ready for the future of their
look a wider grille a beef
your stance on the road</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
