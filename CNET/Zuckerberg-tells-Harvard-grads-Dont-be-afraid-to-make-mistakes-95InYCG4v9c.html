we have a generational challenge to not
only create new jobs but create a
renewed sense of purpose and today I
want to talk about three ways that we
can create a world where everyone has a
sense of purpose by taking on big
meaningful projects together by
redefining equality so everyone has the
freedom to pursue their purpose and by
building community all across the world
so first let's take on big meaningful
projects our generation is going to have
to deal with tens of millions of jobs
replaced by automation like self-driving
cars and trucks but we have the
potential to do so much more than that
every generation has its defining works
more than 300,000 people work to put
that man on the moon including that
janitor millions of volunteers immunize
children around the world against polio
and millions of more people built the
Hoover Dam and other great projects and
now it's our generations turn to do
great things now I know maybe you're
thinking I don't know how to build a dam
I don't know how to get a million people
involved in anything well let me tell
you a secret
no one does when they begin ideas don't
come out fully formed they only become
clear as you work on them you just have
to get started if I had to know
everything about connecting people
before I got started I never would have
built Facebook anyone working on a big
vision is going to get called crazy even
if you end up right the reality is
anything we do today is going to have
some issues in the future but that can't
stop us from getting started so what are
we waiting for it is time for our
generation defining great works how
about stopping climate change before we
destroy the planet and getting millions
of people involved
Manufacturing and installing solar
panels how about curing all diseases and
getting people involved by asking
volunteers to share their health data
track their health data and share their
genomes you know today our society
spends more than 50 times as much
treating people were sick as we invest
in finding cures so people get sick in
the first place it makes no sense we can
fix this how about modernizing democracy
so everyone can vote online and how
about personalizing education so
everyone can learn these achievements
are all within our reach let's do them
all in a way that gives everyone in our
society a role
let's do big things not just to create
progress but to create purpose</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
