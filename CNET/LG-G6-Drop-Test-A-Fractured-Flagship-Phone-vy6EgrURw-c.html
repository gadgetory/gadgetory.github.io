makeover
it's got an all-glass design with a
gorgeous screen and barely any bezels
which makes this all the more painful
the price of beauty more surfaces to
break if you drop your phone and not all
surfaces on the g6 are made equal the
curved glass panel on the back is made
from the strongest Gorilla Glass 5 but
the front which is the most important is
made of Gorilla Glass 3 how does this
four year old glass stand up to our
tests you be the judge our first test
was inspired by an actual event I
flipped the phone on a cement surface
while shooting our pre-production unit
and somehow managed to crack the screen
to test if it was a fluke we recreated
the scenario using a brand new g6 same
surface different foam
let's assess the damage it looks like it
passed our first test no visible damage
on the screen not cracked not even a
scratch actually so for our next test
we're going to increase the risk level
and take it to the streets next up we
wanted to mimic the more likely scenario
of a phone dropping onto the sidewalk
from your purse or pant pocket the drop
height three feet
that one sounded like it may have caused
a little more damage let's take a look
at the screen oh there's a few scuffs on
the side it's cracked there is a small
hairline fracture across the entire
screen if you look at the border at the
bezel over here you can start to see
where it cracks and goes all the way to
the opposite side so we broke the main
screen which is probably the one you
care about most
but since the back is still intact we're
going to continue with our testing this
time we wanted to see what would happen
if you accidentally drop the phone wall
taking a picture we set the drop height
at 5 feet or about eye level onto a
stone floor
so the front screen was already broken
no surprise that it continued to break
and now we have spiderwebs but the back
which is what we are actually testing
sustained no visible damage except for a
slight little dent on this corner but
that's about it the actual glass is
still fine let's see if the back holds
up to our final test I really hope this
never happens to you but in the
unfortunate event that you forget your
phone on top of the car while fumbling
for your keys may be in for a nasty fall
onto asphalt will use 5 feet 10 inches
for this test
this time it landed back down so yeah it
is completely shattered from the front
and now also from the back definitely
did not survive the car drop but then
again that was pretty ambitious there's
spider webs everywhere and the front
continued to crack even more even though
most of the impact was sustained on the
back based solely on our unscientific
results it would appear that the front
screen is more susceptible to cracks in
the back but take it with a grain of
salt each drop is different and the
outcome is unpredictable so it would be
nearly impossible to determine the exact
breaking point of this phone but put a
case on the g6 for some peace of mind
and if you identify with any one of
these scenarios protect that screen
above all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
