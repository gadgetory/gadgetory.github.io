the alpha buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple now you
know there's so many rumors and reports
flying around the next iPhone but we're
gonna put it all in one place and break
down everything for you now let's get
this out of the way it's believed that
there will be three models for the next
iPhone a new 4.7 inch one a 5.5 inch one
both with their current LCD screens and
aluminum backings let's just call those
two the iPhone 7s and 7s plus for now
these names are not official reports
also claim that a new higher cost stack
logic board will allow for a larger
capacity l-shaped battery to fit inside
the updated 4.7 inch iPhone that will
give it an extra hour so juice similar
to the current iPhone 7 plus now there
will also be a new premium 5.8 inch
10th anniversary iPhone that we've been
calling the iPhone X for fun but it
could end up being the iPhone 8 it's
going to be the flagship iPhone and
really every feature known to man is
being thrown at it so here's what we've
heard the iPhone 8 will feature a 5.8
inch flexible OLED screen from Samsung
that will allow for the screen to curve
at the edges with a minimal screen bezel
reports say the new design will feature
two reinforced glass panes for an
edge-to-edge glass design with a
stainless steel metal frame between the
two it's really taking design cues from
the iPhone for one of the best iPhone
designs all time but even more
streamlined now why is the glass packet
born because we're also expecting to see
wireless charging for the first time on
an iPhone Apple recently joined the
wireless power consortium with over 200
other companies that uses the Qi
wireless charging standard it's believed
Apple will use this charging method that
typically requires it to rest on some
type of a charging mat or plate but
there are some of us hoping for Apple to
make its patents and dreams come true
for a long-range wireless charging today
beyou with the iPhone 8 even you know if
it feels like a stretch now patent
filings from Apple even featured a
method where the base of an iMac could
be used as a transmitter to wirelessly
charge your devices either way wireless
charging is coming ok let's get back to
that screen and with little-to-no bezel
that makes you wonder
where will the touch ID and home button
end up going rumors point to a potential
fingerprint sensor that is embedded
under the display removing the physical
button completely now an Apple patent
for an acoustic imaging system would
include acoustic transducers placed
directly under the display they would
generate waves or pulses that would then
be able to read anything that gets in
the way like your finger but even down
to the details of the ridges of your
finger other rumors say Apple might even
just ditch the fingerprint sensor
completely in favor of new biometric
technologies like a 3d laser scanner for
facial recognition now beyond unlocking
your phone or using it for payments a 3d
sensing front-facing camera could help
with apples push for augmented reality
in the future as well reports say Apple
already has 1,000 engineers working on
AR in Israel and over the years they've
acquired primeSense
the team behind the Microsoft Kinect and
real face for cybersecurity and facial
recognition a 3d depth sensing camera
could be used for augmented reality
applications as well we know Tim Cook
has made it very clear that Apple is big
into AR and it could be the next big
feature Apple pushes with the new iPhone
now reports also point to Apple and
using USBC to the iPhone lineup in the
form of accessory cables or power
adapters similar to the 29 watt power
adapter for the iPad pro that makes
sense because guess what the new MacBook
Pros are also all USB C as well plus you
can expect an improved camera on the
iPhone 8 and some rumors claim we might
see the dual lens camera come to the
standard 4.7 inch iPhone as well now
there's an IP 60 rating for even better
waterproofing and s protection an all
new 10 nanometer a 11 processor that
will be faster and more efficient and an
all new iOS that also needs a huge
upgrade to Siri these are pretty much
common sense upgrades we expect to see
so let's just recap this all bullet
pointed out for you and go down this
list for the premium iPhone we're
hearing a 5.8 inch OLED screen an all
glass body wireless charging no home
button a potential fingerprint sensor
integrated into the display a 3d sensing
front-facing camera with facial
recognition the Lightning port it stays
but there's USB C charging capabilities
and improved dual lens rear camera ip68
rating for even better water and dust
resistant
and a new a 11 processor running iOS 11
whoo now if this all comes true Apple is
going ham on the 10th anniversary iPhone
and without a doubt it's got to be the
iPhone to have all right that's going to
do it for this week's show you can email
us at the Apple buy to cnet.com or tweet
me a Bryan song they so much for
watching we'll catch you all next time
for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
