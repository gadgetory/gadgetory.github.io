it's time to get loaded Microsoft is
taking credit for taking down one of the
biggest spam email rackets the software
giant worked with the feds to raid
equipment from the operator of the
rustic botnet a network of computers
around the world that blasts out spam
Microsoft has stepped up its digital
vigilant a work in recent years because
it feels as though these bots hurt their
reputation especially considering that
the bots mainly go after windows
machines Microsoft is also suddenly a
Content company this one's a bit odd the
software company released an app for
bros the man's man the guy's guy dudes
you get the point it's a windows phone 7
app called on it it's being billed as a
guys guide to girls cars gadgets fitness
and life advice plus a touch of humor
not something you usually think of going
to Microsoft for it is free because who
would pay for that samsung launched 3d
video on demand in Korea it gives
customers 3d music videos TV shows movie
trailers and more using samsung smart TV
app on samsung's 3d TV this is expected
to hit the US and Europe next and
samsung says to expect it soon the New
York Times has unveiled its pricing
structure the newspaper said it would
start charging for online content months
ago but we are just now getting the
price it is not cheap if you want to
access nyt calm on any device it costs
thirty-five dollars every four weeks or
four hundred fifty five dollars per year
if you want it on your tablet only it is
twenty dollars every four weeks and if
you want it on your mobile device only
its fifteen dollars every four weeks if
you don't want to pay you still will be
able to see up to 20 stories per month
free on the site and the homepage and
top stories section will also be free
the FCC may not allow cell phone
boosters to remain on the market these
are the devices that boost cell
reception in your area so you can make
and receive calls in otherwise dead
zones the makers of these devices say
that they feel a need but the US
carriers say that they interfere with
their signals the SEC is expected to
make a decision about whether or not to
allow these soon and finally Twitter may
be a good way to tell if you are happy
research
Cornell found that people whose Twitter
accounts showed them to have a high
amount of subjective well-being we're
more likely to exchange tweets with
other people with a high amount of
subjective well-being the same was true
of people with low amounts of subjective
well-being so in essence depressed
people gravitate towards other people
who are negative and happy people
gravitate towards other people who are
positive I guess that's not surprising
that our behavior online would follow
pretty obvious human behavior patterns
offline that's your news of the day and
for the week we will see on Monday
remember cnet com flash loaded for links
to the stories we've discussed I'm
Natali Morris foreseen it and you just
been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
