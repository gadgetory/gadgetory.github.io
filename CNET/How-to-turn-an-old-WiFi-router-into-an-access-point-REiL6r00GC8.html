right here which I just replaced with
this brand new one and that means I can
get this on away right but I won't I
have a better idea
I will change this Wi-Fi router into an
external access point why well because I
can't and also then I can put it at the
far corner of my home and then connect
it to the new one using a network cable
or a pair of powerline adapters and that
is the best way to blanket my home with
Wi-Fi signal and the ladies they'll ever
home like that trust me
now some Wi-Fi router have the access
point mode and that's easy just turn on
that mode and you're done
but many routers do not have that mode
and this one doesn't either
and that means I have to forces to work
in the access point only mode
essentially disabling is routing
function and here the steps first get
his piece of tape and block is one port
because you are not going to use this
port anymore
next you have to figure out the IP
address of the existing router this one
right here now it's very easy just
connect computer to the router using
either Wi-Fi or network cable now if the
computer is a Windows computer just run
a comment prompt and type in ipconfig
and press enter you can see a lot of
thing but what follow the default
gateway is the IP address of that router
now in this case it is 192.168.1.1 if
you have a Mac just go to System
Preferences go to network and then you
can easily find out the routers IP
address again is 192.168.1.1 now from
that IP address we can deduce two things
number one that IP address is taken it's
no longer available number two if you
want to add a device to this router here
you would have to give an IP within this
range 192.168.1.2 all the way to
192.168.1.254
why that's how networking work now in
this case we're going to pick
192.168.1.2 for this router right here
just remember that and make sure that it
will not manually pick that IP address
for any other device that connected to
this router okay we connect a computer
to router and find out what IP address
it currently has to turn out this one
have the one ninety two dot one sixty
eight dot ten dot one now with IP
address we can actually open it web
interface let's do that in this
interface we will go to the network
setup part and go to the land I P
address and here we change the IP to the
one which is pic earlier 192.168.1.2 and
one more thing we have to turn off the
dhcp server for this over our save the
changes and that's it now if you connect
the old router here using a network
cable to the new router it will function
as an external access point you can
always go back to it web interface by
using the new IP address to customize is
Wi-Fi network and that's it quite simple
but Wi-Fi is now everywhere and now that
you know be prepared to be very public
in fact I'm hiding my office right now
because my home is often filled with
ladies loving the signals or maybe this
is because I'm dumb no but hey it sure
is crazy how sexy Wi-Fi can get
