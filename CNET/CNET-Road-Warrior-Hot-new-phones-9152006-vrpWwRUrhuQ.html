cnet.com and welcome to road warrior
where we take a look at the hottest
gadgets for life on the go coming up
we're looking at all phones today
including the blackberry pearl and the
new trio 700 WX let's start with a basic
VGA camera phone from Samsung has a few
nice features for the road it has
support for a busy navigator which is a
Verizon this GPS location service
it also has speakerphone it also has
bluetooth and as we mentioned yesterday
is the VGA camera that's it
just a nice basic phone I see some of
you want more fine how about some style
ken German shows off the Nokia 73-70 as
a fashion phone it does have a lot of
design touches on it do have its lines
right here that can start here go down
below the display on the back you do
have a sort of a textured covering it is
kind of almost like a leather of course
it's not real leather but it kind of
feels like that and the phone does have
a megapixel camera you can see the lens
right here
exterior controls or you do a volume
rocker dedicated power button and a
camera key and don't judge the 73-70
just on its looks it also has bluetooth
and a speakerphone still not enough for
you demanding viewers no problem
Bonnie Shaw has the hot new rim
blackberry pearl there's the form factor
it's really nice and small also it's
called the pearl because it has a little
trackball here that looks like a pearl
pretty interesting it's a little takes a
little getting used to
they've gotten rid of the jog dial and
the skate key that you usually have the
back keys right here and you can access
the Menu key here as well two things to
know the Pearl has no Wi-Fi but it
should be available through t-mobile not
to be outdone palm rolls out the trio
700 WX Bonnie explains what's new in
this model but actually the WX will be
available through Sprint and it also
offers more program memory which has
been a problem with the other trio so
you should get more memory out of this
and better performance you shouldn't
have too many lag times but when you're
switching between applications we've
tested it out a little bit and we found
it to be
fast by the way the W in 700 W X stands
for Windows if you didn't know this is a
windows mobile based trio and to be fair
we should note this one doesn't have
Wi-Fi either that's it for this edition
of road warrior I'm Tom Merritt check
back next time for more gadgets to keep
you armed and dangerous ly productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
