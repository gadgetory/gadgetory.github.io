through the land of affordable German
sports sedans you have to pass by this
guy the 3-series well Howdy's got
nothing to be ashamed of these days
let's drive the all growed up refined
and polished 2011 a4 and check the tech
first there are two really big
differences between an a4 and a3 series
and a4 is generally speaking a
4-cylinder turbo car whereas the BMW 3s
almost all use primarily sixes turn to a
non turbo but as we'll see I think
you'll get over that and the a4 is
available still as a wagon or an Avant
as they call it which the 3-series that
matter the c-class are not now one of
the first things to know about an a4 is
that Audi's going to keep telling you
how big it is in this generation it's
not that big a car but compared to what
it was it has come up to class you look
at the car outside and say ok it's a
normal size but they've really
emphasized legroom I've got this car
already set up with the right leg room
for me but I can really keep going and
I'm pretty tall and I'm still going and
I'm still going ok
this seats all the way back I'm is over
6 - and this is ridiculous you could be
six five or more and you'll drive this
car just fine I can't even reach the
pedals right now it's like I'm a midget
now our car is a Premium Plus that's
important to know right off the bat
because unless you get the top trim
above this the prestige you can't get
blind spot technology you can't get
adaptive cruise control and you can't
get out E Drive select which would give
you a bunch of pre-programmed buttons
down here to change the transmission
behavior steering and suspension
settings so those three are off the
table on this trim level now let's see
what we do have thanks to a lot of our
cart toys we have the Audi MMI LCD and
control surface down here this is not a
widescreen it's basically a four by
three aspect ratio unlike most BMWs for
example but it's got really good quality
check out the dot pitch on that Audi's
really big on this synthetic world stuff
you've got 3d buildings there at least
generic blocks the graphics that power
this are Nvidia by the way so things
move along real nicely and that
rendering is partly thanks to that good
powerful graphics engine and getting
around this guy is really easy once you
figure out outies logic if you haven't
seen it before one central controller
here that turns it has a click on it and
also has a little bit of a wiggler right
there on the knob see this you can move
around with a little black knob on top I
find it a little bit fiddly for
automotive use when you're driving along
I wish the whole thing moved but this is
Audi's way of doing it and in most menus
you've got these four buttons that
correspond to those four corners this is
the Audi MMI thing different from I
Drive different from Mercedes command
different for everybody really now in
terms of media the first thing we get
here because our car is a premium plus
is we get that guy there in the glovebox
that's the ami the Audi music interface
you can get a bunch of different cables
that go into that master connector in
this case we have the all popular apple
dock connector I have my iPod Touch
connected in there now upper right
button again gives me source and there's
my iPod now one thing you're going to
like about this car is it Scrolls things
well I don't know if it's pre caching or
just accessing the device quickly in
real time it doesn't matter here's our
SD card slots now T's kind of the folks
that are hanging onto that idea we've
got two SD one and SD two optical disk
slot here of course they've got an mp3
CD it reads just fine finally jukebox I
can import from either my optical disk
or my SD cards it's kind of nice and in
terms of radio we have AM FM and Sirius
Sirius AM and FM are on every trim of a
4s by the way HD radio comes in as par
of this navigation package so how's it
sound well pretty good because we have
the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen audio system now some
of these Audi's have Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
systems that cost $6,000 you know the
ones that the pop up tweeters I've never
been $6,000 impressed by the sound of it
however this guy's got a much more
affordable $850 B&amp;amp;O upgrade the speakers
don't go up and down those little
tweeter acoustic lenses whatever the
hell they call them or not here but the
sound is here it it sounds good
especially for that price as part of our
nav package there's a lot rolled into
this guy we also have the backup camera
looks like so we've got trajectory we've
got three zone four proximity and we
have two different ways to look at the
parking situation using my button here
in the upper right see that icon up
there I can change that to help me park
parallel or perpendicular okay the
engine the a4 is the same engine in all
a fours 2-liter intercooled turbo on a
dual overhead cam in line for this guys
got all kinds of awards ward's 10 best
engines International engine of the year
it's got direct injection all the latest
technologies it is really an outstanding
smooth mode the numbers 211 horsepower
not a lot but then that turbo kicks in
258 foot-pounds of torque that works
gets this 3600 ish pound car up to 60 in
about six and a half seconds that'll
depend on the gearbox and the drivetrain
we'll talk about that in a minute
mpg is 21:29 on this car with a
Tiptronic you do a little better if you
have a manual now there are three things
you can hook up to the back of this
engine first of all a CVT continuously
variable transmission that's kind of
your base configuration then you can go
to the six-speed manual as I mentioned
for the best zero-to-sixty and economy
or you can go with this 8-speed
Tiptronic we have with the Quattro
all-wheel drive
now one thing you hear me say about
outies all the time is how damn smooth
they are and this one is no exception
even though it's relatively low on their
lineup this a4 has got all the silkiness
of an a8 to be honest not the same
presence and weight but things that spin
don't get any harsher here than they do
in the much expensive brethren it's a
fun car to drive and I find the cabin a
lot more pleasant than a 3-series and
much younger and more youthful than a
Mercedes cabin now this engines a turbo
of course the powers ample and silky my
only gripe is at least in this
configuration I catch the car
flat-footed all too often whether I'm in
Drive or down here in sport it just
seeks high gears too often for mpg
reasons I'm sure but I got to wait for
it to kick down a couple years more than
I want it to that takes away some of the
some of the snaps some of the
responsiveness you can put it over here
in the Tiptronic gate but if I buy a car
than automatic I don't want to spend a
lot of time shifting it to be quite
honest I wanted to do a better job of
doing that itself
okay let's price an a4 grab a cup of
coffee this may take a while one of
those complicated cars its price range
to configure base on this guy with a CVT
gearbox in front-wheel drive is 33,000
then it gets complex add about 2200 for
a Tiptronic gearbox and Quattro or close
to a thousand for a 6-speed manual with
Quattro Premium Plus is 30 for 50 more
which brings you the Audi music
interface Bluetooth triple zone climate
control heated front seats and better
headlights step it up to prestige adding
$5,200 and you get the MMI interface GPS
Navi and Olufsen sound rear camera and
sensors total keyless and bigger wheels
and blessedly the be a no audio rig on
this guy is only 850 and probably worth
it unlike its $6,000 big brother to my
ears anyway
