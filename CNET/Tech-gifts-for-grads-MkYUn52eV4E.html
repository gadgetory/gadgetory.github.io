brilliant young minds are being cast out
into the world confident that with the
right job and enough time they could be
out from under their student loans in as
little as forty years so to distract
them from the inevitable despair of real
life why not buy them some cool tech I'm
Donald Bell and in this top 5 i'm
counting down some of the best gift
picks for grads selected by cnet's team
of editors i'll start off with the low
tech option at number 5 the hamilton
beach set and forget slow cooker not the
flashiest gift but infinitely more
practical than anything else on this
list if you're eating on a budget or
working with a bare minimum of cooking
skills this thing is a miracle worker
you literally dump stuff in the pot turn
it on and walk away you can pick this
thing up for 60 bucks comes with a lid
that clamps down so you can take it in
the car and a temperature probe so you
can safely cook a full chicken or if
things get really bad maybe a pigeon or
a squirrel slow cooks squirrel at number
4 get them a ps4 400 bucks put some on
the cutting edge of gaming plus you get
a great media player with support for
blu-ray movies and streaming services
like Netflix and Hulu I mean now that
their brain is brimming over with big
ideas it's time to take them down a few
brain cells so they can fit in with the
rest of us at number three a new TV
really what good is a game console if
you're playing on some tiny lame dorm
room TV for a can't fail upgrade grab
something from the samsung UN 863 50
series there are eight sizes to choose
from but that twelve hundred dollar 55
inch model is right in the sweet spot
for more of a statement you can try this
philips creamy oh it's an eighteen
hundred dollar ultra short throw
projector that can project up to 100
inch screen size but if all of that
sounds way too expensive dropping 100
bucks on a Roku 3 will still keep you in
their good graces or how about a smaller
screen at number 2 tablet iPad air if
you got money to burn or a kindle fire
HDX 8.9 if you still want to keep them a
little humble now that they're out of
school they won't want to look at a
laptop for a while a tablet keeps things
interesting and fun
gives them enough flexibility to get
real work done in a crunch all right and
finally my vote for the top gift for
grads at number one a smartphone HTC One
m8 is the hottest phone out there right
now it's on every major carrier it's
stylish enough for any 20-something and
powerful enough to blast out resumes on
a daily basis by this and they'll
genuinely think you're cool for at least
a minute so there you go five tech gifts
that any grad will be thankful for but
that's just the tip of the iceberg for
more ideas head over to grad cnet.com
and for more top five from me top five
