the technology we use every day can be
turned around to spy on us your cell
phone calls your text messages email
online habits if you've got something to
hide you've picked the wrong time to be
alive
and the really bad news it's only going
to get worse I'm Donald Bell and this
top five I'm counting down the five
trends and consumer technology that are
like cabinet for intelligence agencies
starting off at number five the cloud
Google Microsoft Apple Amazon even
relatively small guys like Dropbox are
all tripping over themselves to offer us
free online backup of all of our
documents our emails photos videos
anything you would traditionally store
on a hard drive on top of that the
physical storage on today's devices is
getting smaller we used to be all up in
arms about having to fit our music
collection on an 80 gigabyte iPod but
now we're suddenly fine with the 16
gigabyte iPad or a MacBook Air laptop
with just 128 gigs of storage the point
is putting your digital life in the
cloud is no longer optional it's the
default so now instead of the government
having to keep a file on you they can
just wait for you to upload the file
yourself if you're not paranoid yet how
about number four a connected car one of
the biggest trends in car tech is the
idea of having a cellular data
connection baked right into your car GPS
navigation pandora radio roadside
assistance all available to you right
off the lot whether you have a smart
phone or not but who has access to that
data and how long before that
information is used against you in
traffic court in theory they'll know
exactly how fast you are going at the
precise time exactly how loudly you're
listening to Justin Bieber radio pretty
soon all the drama of a high-speed chase
will be eliminated by the flick of a
remote engine kill switch kind of takes
the fun out of it I mean
attempted bank robbery by foot just
sounds exhausting okay the number three
tech trend that Big Brother is all about
cameras on your TV whether it's a smart
TV with a Skype camera or an Xbox with
Kinect we've now entered the era where
TVs are watching us and turning the
lights off won't help
the connects can even map out your
living room and infrared hidden inside
the Trojan horse of Dance Central and
potential Skype conversations with
relatives you really don't want to see
on a 55 inch screen we're outfitting our
living rooms with Internet connected
ever-present video cameras and we really
don't know who's on the other side of
them I mean if the government required
you to have a camera in your living room
we'd all riot but if Microsoft says that
you get to hold an imaginary lightsaber
you'll go out and buy the camera
yourself
way to go America if you're not scared
yet
how about number two the always-on
smartphone microphone an effort to make
interactive virtual assistants like
Google now and Siri more seamless the
next evolution of this technology will
have them listening constantly for your
commands and you won't have to wait long
the upcoming Motorola X smartphone is
rumoured to be the first with this
always listening mode now in theory
these phones are tuning out everything
that's not a command but how the hell is
the NSA going to keep their hands off
this I mean a constantly activated
microphone that you keep in your pocket
all day did the Dark Knight teach us
nothing you think Morgan Freeman is
gonna stand by and let this happen
I don't think so but you know what Big
Brother would love even more than a
microphone in your pocket how about a
camera on your face our number one tech
trend that the NSA must be salivating
over wearable tech we're talking
smartwatches Google glass even things
like the Nike FuelBand or Fitbit
as we are meant our bodies with gadgets
that collect data about all that's
constantly and the world around us we're
basically doing espionage on ourselves
it's cute now but when you get fired
from your job because Google Auto tagged
you in some unsavory Google glass photo
or maybe you've got brought in for
questioning because your GPS Smart Watch
places you at the scene of a crime the
novelty of this whole wearable tech
thing is gonna wear pretty thin so there
you have it five reasons to put foil up
in your windows stripped down naked
delete your Facebook profile flush your
phone and start planning your new life
as an Australian
rancher but if that's not enough to turn
you off the technology altogether you
can see more from me over at top five
