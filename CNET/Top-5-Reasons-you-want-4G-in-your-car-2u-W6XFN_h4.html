in cars from the factory it's a major
new trend for 2014 but what's the point
I'm Brian Cooley with my top five
reasons you will want built-in 4G in
your next car this is a taste of the
future of driving number five
heydo gathering I put this last because
let's face it it could range anywhere
from car makers doing things that are
kind of dumb to massively inappropriate
or kind of like magic you see the data
from a built-in 4G connection will let
your car throw off all kinds of
information about it and how you use it
it could make it far better to own and
operate or it could just be totally
invasive number four better in car
hotspots I rank this fairly low because
I believe the need for a hot spot in
your car is overblown at best and bait
to push you into an overage fee at worst
need a hotspot pull over and get a cup
of coffee but if you do have one powered
by 4G at least it'll work better number
three over-the-air updates I love the
idea of these having your car's software
updated once or twice a year like when
you get a new version of iOS or Android
but what keeps it mid-pack at number
three is that we've never seen a car
maker do this other than Tesla which is
done already a long enough list of these
to make up for the rest of the industry
on its own as for the other car makers
will they offer a new OS a couple of
times or three times during car
ownership or just prefer to get you to
buy a new car and if they do give you an
update what if it bricks number two
connection speed everything's better
went faster but even more so in a car
we're having information and services
resolved quickly on the screen is
essential to the task of driving with
minimal distraction this is very
important whether it's connected nav
search off-board voice recognition or
streaming media I can't think of a place
a fast connection could be more
rewarding than in your car the number
one reason that 4G is a must-have in the
near future is a persistent connection
this is a big game-changer folks and
even if it sounds a little nebulous you
see a built-in
always on connection in your car will
fundamentally change your expectations
of the in-car experience our online
habits services and preferences will
finally follow us into the car
seamlessly as opposed to the way it is
now where you kind of have to change
gears adapt to your car's media sources
your car's interface its navigation
platform and it's utter ignorance of
your life's context it's time for the
car to really be another of our mobile
devices and have that not just be a car
maker tagline and built-in 4G can get us
there high-tech cars and modern driving
