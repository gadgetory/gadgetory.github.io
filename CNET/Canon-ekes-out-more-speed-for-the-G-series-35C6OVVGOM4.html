powershot g16 the g15 was a good
enthusiast compact in the g 16 is a
respectable follow-up to that model
though he uses the same sensor lens and
pretty much everything else it's
generally a lot faster with the tweaked
body and roughly the same photo quality
new features include pretty man Wi-Fi
support and a bump to 1080 30p video
plus some long exposure night shooting
modes it's large with a shallow grip but
it feels solid and substantial I still
miss the articulated LCD that Canon
dropped two generations ago but the
optical viewfinder is surprisingly quite
usable the controls remain pretty easy
to access and operate though I still
think the placement of the front dial is
awkward and the record button is too
hard to feel impress and the more I use
it the more annoyed I get by the
function menu operation you have to
press the button again to dismiss it it
really should automatically go away when
you press another control like the menu
button well JPEG photos don't really
stand up to a pixel peeping level of
scrutiny beyond ISO 200 you can get more
mileage out of RAW files as high as ISO
800 even for prints I think Canon has
pushed the one over one point 7 inch
sensor as far as it can go even at 12
megapixels the G 16 is a lot speedier in
most respects than the g15 they're using
raw still noticeably slower than JPEG
the continuous shooting is significantly
better up to five point eight frames per
second with autofocus the low-light
focus still feels a bit sluggish though
well it doesn't offer best-in-class
photo quality like the more expensive
Sony rx100 it does have the viewfinder
and hotshoe that the sony lacks it
remains a good all-around option for
advanced photographers who like unibody
pocket ability I'm Laurie grinning and
this is the canon powershot g 16</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
