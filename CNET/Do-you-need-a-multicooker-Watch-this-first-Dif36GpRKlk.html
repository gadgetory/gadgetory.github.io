that does more than one job now these
can be really useful but you have to
know what kind of product you're looking
for so that in its best to ask yourself
a few questions like number one what
kind of foods do I want to use with my
multicooker now some multi cookers are
better than others at cooking certain
foods for example this black &amp;amp; decker
multi cooker is designed for roasting or
baking so it has a nice long pot that
will easily fit a five and a half pound
chicken which is what I have inside
right now or if you really like risotto
you might go for this Black &amp;amp; Decker
stirring pot now this multi cooker has
an arm at the bottom that automatically
stirs when the pot is in risotto cooking
mode when you're picking a multi cooker
you also want to think about how much
space you have to store it it's not just
about how much counter tops your
appliance is going to take up but what
are you going to do with it when you're
finished now this core mia cooker if ik
for an example doesn't break down very
easily so even though it's really cool
to look at you can't easily take the
pieces apart like this lid which doesn't
come off now some multi cookers don't do
much this Black &amp;amp; Decker only has three
or four core jobs but these two over
here have arms that will stir food for
you like the cooker if ik which is right
now stir frying some vegetables and we
can't forget about cost either depending
on what you're looking for in the
quality of the appliance the price could
range from $70 for this stirring pot to
as much as two hundred and ninety nine
dollars which is what the gore mia
cooker if ik originally retailed for now
in my reviews none of these multi
cookers were really perfect in fact some
of them were just okay so really do your
research and decide what your needs are
before you decide to buy a countertop
appliance like these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
