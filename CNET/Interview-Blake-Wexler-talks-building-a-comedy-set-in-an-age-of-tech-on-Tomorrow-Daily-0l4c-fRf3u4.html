celebrating the release of his very
first comedy album which debuted at
number six on iTunes it's called the
Blake album Blake Wexler thanks for
being here my god thank you for having
me thank you so much thank you there's
no studio audience so I have to do it
it's like a maybe someday we'll get a
like audience of robot clappers like I
think we've been two men on metal
doesn't even sound like a closet just
like finding somebody beating pots and
pans and other sound weird why admitting
the symbols that's where we got a bunch
of monkeys with symbols welcome to the
show clang clang that makes everyone
feel comfortable that sound I like that
I suggest that as opposed to just a
sound bed of people clapping like that's
the simpler answer but no I need a robot
studio audience that's exactly what we
need you are accustomed to audiences
clapping it's the goal yes yeah you have
a goal for sure yeah you've been doing a
stand-up for a long time I did I started
when I was real young I started when I
was 15 and yeah I did it through college
and I'm still doing it well at 15 what
made you say I want to be on stage in
front of people potentially heckling me
yeah um I didn't know about the heckling
hahahahaha don't tell under 15 year old
no my job is great comedy specials in
every joke is amazing and everybody's
laughing and you're like oh george
carlin is just getting all these laughs
like I want to be a stand-up comedian
too meanwhile he bombed all the time not
kidding hazing of but yeah I just kept
doing it and my mom drove me to shows
like when i first started and they
weren't good shows like they were in you
know terrible dive bars with a bunch of
animals from philadelphia at one o'clock
in the morning but i guess i'm cool
animals yeah yeah yeah that was heading
zoo there was a far apart you were
drinking and a petting zoo did you what
was it what were your guys barn yes yeah
well that could be the next hit bar I
like at the dive bar I bet you're
welcome we gotta haul interested by
Barnes yeah the dive bar welcome Jon
Taffer hey where you are exotic animals
like while you're wasted I pull off and
even like pactual well drinks actually
yeah like it I'll build it yes don't be
what is that
I'm not to dwell on your beginnings but
what a fifteen-year-old set feel like
what are you right about to start with
it was really bizarre cuz like I mean
the subject matter you only have so much
life experience so like it was the SATs
like it was a very serious like quite
like math class but my delivery of my
favorite comedian was Lewis Black and I
had this weird angry delivery it's like
why is he angry he's a white kid from
the suburbs he's 15 he's talking about
like tests I like no one cares like but
it was very bizarre I think people
weren't laughing for the right reasons
there is like why is this kid so angry
it's more confusing than not funny i
think that's what a wine's could never
compute right I think that a lot of
people who start mm-hmm start by
emulating the people that they like and
then sort of have that process of
finding their own voice right we're not
for sure yeah yeah it's interesting to
see your brand of comedy sort of now is
I like that sort of your your persona on
stages that you're just sort of goes by
default like kind of annoyed at people
like you're just like oh look at these
dumb things people are doing yeah it's
funny like I don't even think like I'm a
very happy person but they're like I'll
try to talk about like annoying things
in a silly like way we're just like it
doesn't I mean none of the things are
like huge issues it's like oh I just saw
a person who in a very specific way
bothered me but doesn't affect anyone
else it's very relatable I like that
idea that sort of snowball effect where
it's like this one tiny thing is
annoying man then you can just build it
into this really kind of interesting
thing that collectively grabs everybody
like it's sort of a really good way to
sort of like describe what you do like
your jokes like how you build them I
like the sound of it yeah you represent
me thank you know is sending your
clients I'm sorry new clients I'm sorry
it's someone dropped out I could be
possible maybe you fire them why just
ready to stop representing Jeff because
it's ago mr. first time hearing oh my
god aventuras for some things I go weird
yes I don't know yeah um so tell us a
little bit about me ASAT jokes tonight
okay oh my god oh so you took them yeah
if somebody's getting use out of them
i'm not i get i got to get more out of
it so tell us a little bit about
creating your first comedy album because
this is something that i think a lot of
people when they hear a comedy album
they don't
realize how many years of work can go
into crafting a set like a specific hour
of comedy right yeah it was um I
actually did do a chunk on the album of
like old jokes like when I was a kid
that I wrote so that was like a fun
little like three minute part of it um
but yeah it is like years where you just
gotta be in the right place for it I
think like I mean I think I don't know
when I started like recording an album
seemed like oh this is the pinnacle of
like white like nothing can get better
than then it happens in like it's hard
to be like like now I'm like oh now I
like need to sell it as a special you
know what i mean but um it was such a
cool like accomplishment where the
reason why i did it was almost to add
like um have like a benchmark like for
my career where like all right so I did
this I did this I have an album you know
what I mean and then if I make my money
back then great you know like the goal
was kind of to break even and just have
that it's like a sentimental thing and
then anything else was a bonus but then
ended up selling really well and it came
out great like it you know like so many
things in this business don't go the way
you want it to but then like from
getting the right like audio guy to work
with and then you know the comedy club
selling out with the right people you
know like an audience that was there to
see me and then um yeah and then like
just the way the cuts came together and
there was a weird like any curveball was
kind of handled where I stayed with cats
that weekend like I mean human beings
who owned cats but yeah cast of cash
y'all stay with it yeah they're always
in Causton but they not that what if
that was my way of name-dropping I say
that's bad I don't know if that's cool
but that's odd these are the two leads
and that's fine that's no big deal what
cross section in your lives I good to
you staying with them but I decide my
best friends in philly um have cats that
I'm like I'm allergic to them but not
like you know heart shutdown allergic so
I didn't think it was that big of a deal
and then when I listened to the first
cut of the album you wouldn't be able to
hear it as an audience member but
because of like the high quality audio
equipment you when I would take a deep
breath there was like a wheezing noise
and I call
like Alex Dingley he was the amazing
sound mixer I called him I'm like if
this stays in here we can't release like
this is a horrific noise for Pete like
it sounds like laughs laughs laughs
funny funny yeah and then like you would
hear like a long drawn-out beef he's
dying like this was not good this is not
your buddy we're worried i feel really
worried about it's a papers medical
problems probably why he released it oh
no it was quite yet I don't like and
thank God we were able to get rid of
that noise but it's the thing you would
never ever think of thanks cats I know
thank you so much yeah almost blew it
for us blue girl's friend Blake care
destroyed my career but uh ya know like
it's like seven personal life vendetta
against can write the whole every cat
I've ever experienced cross that's a
parallel universe that's happening right
now by the way guys having ruined your
career like in some weird parallel
alternate universe they have to
completely destroyed your life never
been dead against me for sure yeah and
vice versa I mean you're really out to
get them now well now I am yeah yeah I
mean I like to be the bigger be she's
but almost life of course no never but
in that other parallel universe it's
time for them to go oh it's over yeah
I'm quitting comedy I'm a cat revenger
yeah kind of no danger perfect yeah
great another one of those did you so
did you feel the pressure than value did
that album to like put all that material
away and have to craft new yeah um I do
I mean the pressure is all put on myself
you know like I'm the one putting the
pressure on because like it's not like I
mean people will come to see me but I'm
not famous enough where like oh I'm
going back to this theater where people
paid sixty dollars a ticket we're like
you know they'll want their money back
ok so like I'm trying like when I do
sets now like only maybe ten or fifteen
percent old stuff and in the rest
brand-new so um and it's also kind of
taken a pressure off where it's like you
know I've been doing this for a while
I've been doing well enough at it for a
while to have a career but it's also
like oh now there's definitive proof
that I'm good at this you know what I
mean where it's out there yeah and it's
like a tangible thing cassell and you
can right right yeah to it like if you
can't see me live like you can now buy
this wreck right it's like I promised
I'm good you know and it's just like
okay he's you know good so
yeah it's an interesting thing so it's
also like kind of freed me up you know
like unless there's less anxiety trying
out new not just material but like ways
of doing stand-up and stuff so it's yeah
it's a cool it's been agreed by the ways
of doing we're like if I want to like
improvise more or like talked about like
just throw a character in the middle of
it joke you know like or something like
that or you know like go out the caddy
Kendrick yes the cat revenger is yeah I
mean you can write that down that's fine
you can have everyone rushes has to sign
an NDA not to decide yeah well speaking
of NDA's I'd like I'm curious we've
we've asked this question of comedians
before on the show and writers how do
you find workshopping things in a world
of technology like where people are able
to snapchat your sets as your work
shopping things people are able to sort
of get that information out there before
it's really kind of baked like how do
you how do you deal with that or how
what's like your response to that does
that annoy you is that something that
you've learned to work around how is
that affected you as a comedian that's a
great question i think it's like um I
mean when people videotape me there's
tues like you know thoughts where I'm
like could you please stop doing that
would be a thing and then but also like
if they put it online like if I'm not
good enough to write a better joke after
that like if that for some reason like
puts a roadblock of my career then I
need to be a better writer you know what
i mean so it's like okay please don't do
that but like also i have a
responsibility to be good enough to keep
you know writing and coming up with a
new things so but yeah there's a cool
thing where a Hannibal Burres who's a
great comedian he tried out this
technology I have no idea how it works
but it kills like it doesn't kill your
phone but like your phone won't work
when you have that guy know what it's
called yonder and you put your phone in
a little magnetic pouch and it locks
when you're in the venue and you can't
take your phone out until I want that
yeah I think that's really girl for that
I'm all for that also like to enjoy an
art you know like sure might be present
yeah and it really does like I don't
know just being present i think it's so
underrated it's just like no just enjoy
what you're doing right now it's okay
yeah like um might need a second screen
experience for life yeah yeah sometimes
there's time sore but other times like
just put it over there like my friend
Todd when he has people over you put
your phone in the bowl like when you
walk
you leave it there Owen what evers you
get out of the ball they have yeah I
like that yeah yeah absolutely just down
our account that's basically not
anything else you just get to use their
uber it's pretty good I like that a lot
of person I do like the one where it's
like you get together with your friends
everybody puts their phone on a stack on
the table then whoever touches their
phone first pays for dinner I like that
too that's a good rule yeah unless you
have really you don't friends that you
just don't get it you don't get a
guarantee they have a rotary phone in
the middle just like we know it's it's
Chuck so did you get your friend to call
somebody else's phone and then it's
ringing right there and they have to get
a good then you win because you did a
subterfuge or like change their like one
of the names and their phone of the
friends like the name of their child
that is Syria now do you sit down and
write jokes or do you kind of you know
craft them while you're on stage what's
your process of making comedy um I'll do
both like I like putting in the work of
actually writing it out but then kind of
bullet point it and then like when I
bring it on stage like just almost like
improvised the things so like I'll have
both the where if in the moment I come
up with something funnier it's like okay
cool and like I'll record it on my
iPhone and then listen back and going
right i can plug in that thing that I
thought of on stage are there but i also
like having like the pre-written thing
i'm not as a safety net but it's like
you know a foundation sure I guess you
know the skeleton of your joke and then
you sort of see what happens when you
take it off right and I just throw Jenna
let's do it oh that's a skeleton plus
genitals you teams equals comedy tragedy
plus time that's all about that soul
