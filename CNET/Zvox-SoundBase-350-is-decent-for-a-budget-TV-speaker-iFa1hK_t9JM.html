tough as there are so many options out
there but when it comes to building
speakers that you can put your TV on top
of there's one brand that was their
first Z box the Z Box sound bass 350 is
the company's newest budget model and
for only a little over $200 it gives you
a few useful features and decent sound
quality this is a pretty small bass at
only 2 feet across but it's well built
and should be able to hold TVs up to 50
inches in screen size it may not be much
to look at but it has some touches that
competitors do miss such as an
alphanumeric display and controls on the
unit itself this speaker is designed to
be hooked up via an optical cable to
your TV and can decode Dolby soundtracks
it also has Bluetooth connectivity so
you can stream music from your phone but
if you want more features than that you
should definitely pay a lot more for the
price so this is a decent performer with
the voice enhancing functions
particularly helpful for the
hearing-impaired and it's able to put
out a good amount of bass for such a
small size sure it's not that great at
music so if you want that investigate
the sps bo3 from Pioneer instead while
you still can but if you just want to
hear your TV better there's not much
else to compete with this at the price
