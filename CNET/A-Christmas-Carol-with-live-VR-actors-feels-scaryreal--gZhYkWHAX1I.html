immersive experience that combines
virtual reality motion capture
technology with set design and just
regular acting as a guest in this
experience you're wearing a virtual
reality headset so everything that you
see is completely fabricated but there's
a live actor in front of you wearing a
motion capture suit so when the actor
moves and talks to you and reaches out
to you you can reach out and touch him
whether or not you believe in them you
must heed their warning this opportunity
may not come again do you understand
I wish you luck this projects actually
not possible without having a live actor
in the space with you it's it's at the
core of how we wrote it and how we
workshop it with the actors so the
technology of having that motion
captured there is the reason why we can
adapt to you as the guest and make it
unique every time change is really
trying to take immersive theater marry
it with the art to create an experience
that's a little bit darker and has a
more of a personal feel as you go
through it than most virtual reality
experiences would have and is also
trying to kind of give you a sense of
what life would have been like if you
lived inside of the world of A Christmas
Carol the creator's didn't want to share
the footage of what I actually saw
inside my headset as I went through the
20 minute experience but they did let me
try out one of the actors motion capture
suits and go behind the scenes this is
where the performance actually happens
but as a guest I never saw any of this
and my headset I would see a Victorian
room or I'd be flying above a village
but that's because the actor in a motion
capture suit like this is the one that I
see in the experience itself
you're still creating a really intimate
connection with the audience member
you're with them and your pain you know
such close attention to the person who's
going through while at the same time
what's different about it is like you're
missing their eyes you're missing their
some of the more particulars and you're
not as your existing in two spaces at
the same time right I'm in the virtual
space that I'm also right here right now
this is the room that you come to after
the experience it's where you get
acclimated to actual reality after being
in virtual reality the experience itself
was really interesting in my headset I
was in a Victorian bedroom but having
that live actor embody the character in
front of me really made it feel real if
you're interested in checking out
chained it's in LA
through the beginning of 2019 but
they're hoping to expand it beyond LA to
other places as well I do want people to
walk away having felt like they came
closer to meeting intense spirits and
ghosts than they ever would have thought
possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
