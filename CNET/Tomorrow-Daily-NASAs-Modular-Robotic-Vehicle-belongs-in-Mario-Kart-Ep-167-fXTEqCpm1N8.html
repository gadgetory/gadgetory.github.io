tracking is gonna change the way you do
hand gestures google finally unveils its
wireless service and we're to tell you
all about it and NASA's got a crazy
little car that looks like it's driving
on ice all the time tomorrow daily
greetings citizen to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva joining me as always the
man the myth the legend oh hey so you
almost did the Benny Hill song I know I
can hear it in your head when you listen
playing here the benefits I don't want
it I don't even want to speak bitch
they'll strike this video down right
this video down like obi-wan's and loved
ones will just die yes not cool come on
get the horse head in my bed just like
in The Godfather oh I didn't think we're
going that dark I don't know people are
really serious about copyright it is
Thursday hillsong Thursdays when we we
unravel yeah Thursday's an unraveling
day but alright we got to talk about
these headlines because they're pretty
awesome so let's hit it okay so NASA did
you know that nASA has a car like
they're working on a car it's like a
space car uh kind of yeah okay let's not
let that I'm very very interested it's
roaming around Earth it's a vehicle
roaming around Earth this is from and I
swear this is not a joke as the actual
name of the department NASA's game
changing development program office I
like that that's modest listen
game-changing that's what you have on
your business card all right so this is
called it's called an mr v all right and
it is a fully electric vehicle that nASA
says would be very capable in an urban
environment here's why they each one of
the wheels is independently operated so
it looks like a normal little car but
then here you go so now all of the
independent wheels means you have zero
degree turn radius so in essence this is
like kind of the coolest thing ever if
you needed a parallel park you would
just pull up right next to the space
turn your wheels 90 degrees and just
drive sideways that's amazing I know I
know I love it so much hey it looks like
you're driving on ice a little bit
because of it because the wheels can all
ship they can drift this thing like look
at how cool this is so it's a
fly-by-wire driving system it's a like I
said for independently capable wheels
and they have a top speed of about 43
miles an hour look at him drifting and
rise your mario kart yes like just
sliding around in circles it's amazing
but yeah this was developed with a John
in Space Center and there is even a
joystick for more advanced control like
if you feel like you need more advanced
controls you don't need the steering
wheel look at least the impossible to
play a lot of GTA like well how do I
gotcha and there is also force feedback
so if you for the steering wheel is
equation and stuff so if you want it to
feel more like a traditional car as
you're driving it'll like send you know
like more traditional feelings and your
steering wheel as if you're driving a
real car which is kind of cool but
unfortunately here's the thing not in
development for a commercial sale
however they are working on this for
future Rovers that go out into space oh
good for that technology for future
Rovers but also they said they wouldn't
mind if like this type of technology was
used in cars ago in the future so we
might see this technology show up in
cars in the future but it wouldn't be
like hey NASA's releasing a car you can
go buy at a dealership oh yeah that
would be a thing but yeah so I thought
that was just really fun and cool and um
because I've been on a mario kart the
new DLC pack is out today um which by
make correction everybody i said friday
it's today it's thursday uh but um so
there they don't really they don't
really have a goal for this car other
than to improve and throw the other
Rovers Rovers yeah things like that so
things that end up getting sent out to
like like curiosity stuff like that way
this is a really good way to sort of do
I hate it yes sir yeah so that brings us
to our hashtag of the day TDM RV is our
hashtags to the name of the car um and
murph tamer um and the question is I
think you guys could think of some
really fun ways to sort of use this
vehicle or maybe upgrade it like okay so
how to use it or upgrade it you can
upgrade okay grade or how would you
where would you want to drive it would
you want to do with it so I would so
personally I would want to improve tires
because we're still using the like
rubber and air technology and I've seen
people to do like spokes like plastic
circles but like with like spokes and
it's not it's not like an air base
system I thought for sure NASA would be
on top of that cover so their lunar
Rovers didn't have to like get flat tire
yeah get flat tire
and what not but I mean maybe I'm not
fully researched on this but I've seen a
lot of like demos and stuff like that
and I mean well that doesn't make a
pretty standard tire i went to i did a
tour at JPL and they had some stuff on
the they have like a whole field that's
like the mars kind of area where they
kind of simulate rocks and stuff like
that and they have these like really
cool sort of experimental tires and
things like that that they're like
basically if this breaks like it this
one can take over and like all right so
they've some stuff like that but it
wasn't it wasn't the same as what we saw
in the video so I think you're right in
saying like we need some better tire
tech yeah TDM RV okay mr v is the
hashtag what's yours um i would say i
would want to take this too i would want
to take this too I want to speed it up
I'm gonna put in we put in turbo yeah we
do some nitrous yes and I want to see
this in the next fast and furious family
all about family oh that's what I want
to see a heist scene or chasing done
with this car just like seven of them
like or eight of them and then just all
and then they jump it from one building
to the night yeah yeah well we're and
over again that's I want Fast and
Furious 8 to happen in space they'll on
like Europa and I want like Vin Diesel
to drive this thing like a maniac
through the canyons of Europa that's
what i want to see it's about family
listened hey that's really the only next
place i could go in fat and Fast &amp;amp;
Furious 8 NASA cars space Oh Spacey I
didn't feel like space I feel like
they've done everything on earth they
can't really there's not much left well
they're going to New York in the next
one that's not as good as Europa I mean
to me I guess fair enough better food in
the yard better food in New York better
pizza but not necessarily better driving
more exciting so that's your hashtag TDM
RV okay so what do you know about
particle swarm optimization nothing noob
all right well let's talk about what
Microsoft is doing to improve the hand
gesture game ok ok so we've seen
technology like leap motion show how the
in virtual reality in a space we can
have that sort of motion gestures well
Microsoft Research has decided that they
want to improve the hand pose technology
now try to keep up with this one because
it's even tricky to kind of explain so
basically they're using a connect to
scan and create a 3d model the user's
hand which take
about like one second with this
technology wow that's fast yeah there
was new technology hand pose technology
it's more accurate it can work from much
further distance and it can work on
existing hardware or even smartphones
which is cool so now usually motion
tracking is really slow it has to read
like 30 different points on your hands
and and its really slow to calculate it
well they've engraved it ten times
faster with their product their
processor called particle swarm
optimization so now you know what though
it'll be SSO so this makes a trillion so
usually it takes trillions of potential
hand gesture combinations yeah you've
gotta like calculate like all of the
different ways you might move your hands
yeah maybe so they've got that down to
200 logical guesses which wow look at
that yeah there's it down to its closest
man it's really responsive and it's
really impressive detailed yeah and the
guy in the video keeps talking about
like a minority report yeah and how
that's kind of what they're going for
you want to be able to like quick I need
to see ya so that's basically what
they're aiming for there's no retail yet
no bummer which is a bummer um but uh
they said that it's gonna be about five
years before they'll feel safe there's
gonna be public use I bet you they'll
figure it out hopefully yeah let's say
lets it yeah maybe two let's say two and
a half split in and say yeah well that's
that's that's your tomorrow daily guess
two and a half years um but yeah so
they're hoping that's what they're
hoping that it will improve motion judge
so hand pose that's what it's called
that's pretty close uses awesome uses
particle swarm optimization so it's just
fast it's it's not brand new technology
per se but it's greatly improving okay
something that was already there and
they're using Kinect which is old ish
technology but yeah it was technology
that was beyond its time so there you go
cool yeah well that's an awesome stuff
from Microsoft Research so going from a
one big company Microsoft to Google
they're doing some pretty interesting
stuff lots of people have been dying for
this to happen google finally announced
that they're going to get into the
wireless game yeah they're gonna be kind
of a cell phone carrier for you which is
pretty cool love you
easy it says uh this is an interesting
move by Google it's called google Phi F
I google fight um and this is a move
into wireless service here in the US no
word on any international any
international you know launches or
anything like that but here's how it's
going to work so it's going to use
t-mobile and Sprint's towers okay and as
you're driving and stuff is going to
it's going to optimize which towers to
use or open Wi-Fi so for example if you
are in an area where there is an open
Wi-Fi connection that's safe then it'll
it'll connect to that and it'll switch
back and forth so your phone which I'll
get to in a second which phone you could
use um will seamlessly handoff between
cell towers and Wi-Fi signals so making
it a little bit easier for you to not
use as much data mmm and so what they
want to do is they want to charge you
twenty dollars a month that's the base
plan and then that's unlimited talk and
text for twenty bucks a month but for
data they want to charge you ten dollars
for every gig so if you're using five
gigs that's about like 70 bucks a month
I think you might come with one gig so
it might be 60 um but you get a refund
if you don't you prepay for it so you
say like okay like i usually use three
let's say three gigs of data for gigs of
data whatever so you pay your twenty
dollars plus let's say it's either i
think i want to say if it includes that
one gig you would pay an extra thirty
bucks and then let's say you only use
two well they would refund you so they
would refund you twenty bucks and they'd
say hey you only used two gigs instead
of four like you paid for so we're gonna
give you that money back how is this
better than a normal cell phone plan so
I think the big thing is is that they
want to kind of they want to kind of
free people from being locked into
there's no contracts at all and but
there are a couple catches to this you
must use a nexus 6 for this first like
testing portion of google phi just to
even be able to sign up to try the
service you have to have a nexus 6 and
Eve
then like you may not get into sort of
the testing yeah I know my brother
signed up for this he was like I already
signed up because I was like hey like
you should sign up for google I'd try it
out and he was just like I'm already
signed up i'm dying to get in so that so
yeah it's that they're saying that it's
not for now they're saying it's not
directly competitive with these large
carriers because this is really kind of
a small scale project that they're right
I mean they're just start they're
testing it they're seeing if it works
how it works yeah if it's accessible to
do on a larger scale like I would
imagine in a lot of rural areas this
would be kind of difficult because one
you're not going to run into a lot of
towers and two you're not going to run
into a lot of Wi-Fi like open Wi-Fi so
it seems like maybe it'll work the best
in urban areas um and the one thing I
did like about this is it'll it will
store your phone number on google
servers so you can use your phone tablet
or laptop to make calls like you can
just open up your laptop and make a call
because it's like it's story google
servers i think any of these things are
really different than any other like pay
service for data there are two other
companies doing this it's like republic
let me see I me make sure I get these
right republic Wireless and scratch
wireless are two companies are doing
something very similar to this and we've
seen carriers like um but they're kind
of small regional carriers like cricket
things like that or they have this sort
of regional and they use the towers of
another company a bigger company sort of
piggyback off them so it's similar in
that way but it's not quite that so it's
slightly different it's just an
interesting move by Google to even get
into this like I don't think a lot of
people works not expecting them to but
they were hoping and then now they're
kind of like okay well we're gonna do
this officially so I don't know I don't
know that I would use it I mean looking
there was a really good infographic and
I'm so sorry whatever website posted it
this morning I'm not I can't remember
what it was really good info graphic
showing like exactly what the rates were
for certain amounts of data and t-mobile
and google Phi were pretty close and
then it was like some some carriers
we're a little cheaper like regional
carriers and then like the big to AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon were like more expensive so it
definitely is not like a groundbreaking
change and it's not going to cut your
bill in like according to twenty-five
percent of what it was like you're not
gonna be
ten dollars a month for your cell
service so maybe it's not the Savior
everybody's hoping for but it's
definitely at least more competition
which is always a good thing it's really
bold to be one of the first users of
this though yeah really pop in there
that's I mean if you're jumping in with
both feet good on you that's Google Phi
so that's what they're doing with that
and an interesting itself let's see
where this goes I think that's what work
I will be very curious to see how this
kind of expands or if it does my not
very skeptical mr. google call me by the
way call me mr. i think that's a gift
that needs to happen guys um if you want
to make that a gift please do and send
it to me via Twitter and ashley's gather
all right guys we're gonna take a quick
break we'll be right back with into it
we have some good ones this week and
then of course your user feedback and
our phone talker for the day so I'll
click weights tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show kills get in a
groove it's got a good it's got a good
base on there Scott give base line yeah
we get to hear the drop you guys never
get to hear that part no it's good it's
really good every week we like to tell
you on Thursdays the stuff that is
draining our wallet so this is into it
is it always training our wallet no I
didn't pay for this yeah that's great
for mine I didn't pay for mine either
but I'm really ah this week so i guess a
good maybe not maybe we're just obsessed
okay i'm gonna go first okay cuz i have
a show and tell this is the Samsung gear
VR this is something I've been screwing
around with for the past two weeks I've
been working on a special project but I
had a lot of time to put some put some
time into this and this is the first
time I've ever used it cuz i've used the
oculus and if you used google cardboard
but this the first time i've used what
is considered portable vr okay and also
consumer portable vr so you basically as
you're gonna see on the screen you pop
in your note for your note 3 into the
into the gear VR and it automatically
boots up as if it was an oculus oculus
headset at so it uses all the oculus
programs and you can play pretty much
pretty much anything that oculus
themselves put out into their into their
app store um I like it I think I think
it's pretty cool I don't own a note so
that would be an extra purchase this
cost about like I think like two hundred
dollars ya its jus night it's like three
hundred dollars and then you have to buy
it no which is you know exorbitant so
it's it's not a cheap VR set considering
the oculus is is cheaper but if you or
it's just not a cheap VR set now but the
big Pro here is that it's it's portable
I'm not trying to sell you on it's just
I'm telling you what I liked about it is
that it was portable yeah you can take
it places no I was fun I'd take it show
it to somebody what's up what's some of
the stuff that you got to like do or or
play or like what were some of your
favorite things that you did wit using
this the did I did a cooking simulator
which was pretty cool I I was a little
toy in like a little kids room tell me
like go around and then I also was a
space pilot that one
that was my favorite one I was in a
movie theater watching a movie which was
that's weird and awesome yeah that was a
very expensive movie three hundred
dollars and then a note to go see that
movie but I yet it's pretty cool I mean
I I wouldn't own got him with my way to
get one but it's ten it was a blast I
would just put the headset on and sit
sit next to my girlfriend on the couch
and she'd be like and I'm just like in
space like she's just trying to watch
pretty little liars or whatever so yeah
but so that's what I'm into the Samsung
gear VR well don't look so cool and I
like that it they worked with oculus I
like that they worked with oculus on
this yeah it looks good looks good it
don't like it belongs there don't let
second belongs there really um what are
you into uh this week I am into what
people are online are calling the sushi
bazooka oh I got to see this sushi and
something else I referring it to as
oddly enough not from Japan you think it
would be yep it had all the qualifiers
all the qualifiers I'm even a really rad
like Asian host i was at this has to be
from japan no it's not no it's from New
Zealand how weird is that so yeah here's
how it works you're watching the video
right now this guy by the way is sort of
like the Asian kale and I love him like
he's really energetic and fun i love you
Asian kale and so you put the rice in
you put your sticky rice you line it up
on both sides do all something you put
your feelings in gonna put your sushi
and put your cucumber he's gonna put
whatever else you don't put avocado may
be whatever you want put in there like
you do with the roll so then once you do
all that junk you smash it all together
so yeah okay so watch this so that's
sort of loading the the push out that's
like the sort of thing that's gonna push
out the roll so here you go they like
lock it down yep you snap it in place
and then you put on the end this reminds
me of using play-doh as a kid like are
you have a play-doh factory yeah okay
it's like that so you twist the edge
here and then you very slowly squeeze
out this role because it tightens the
titans the tube and then now so there he
goes that's your little roll and then
you squeeze it out we'll all be it
pushes out your little roll and then so
he puts it on a bed of a bed of seaweed
so we had some nori their sheet of nori
so yeah
put that down and then he just rolls it
up and then you know you cut all your
slices so it doesn't the sukkah is not
the right term I would have you know
it's not it's not a bazooka it's not a
bit I wish it fired out of that thing
like a cannon that would be the funniest
thing in the universe but unfortunately
it doesn't it's a much slower process um
but look it out like it's very clean
yeah not everyone's capable of making
sushi myself included so it's it's a
nice little work around how much does it
cost like 26 bucks amazon not bad and
they said like they also give other
examples too it's not just a sushi thing
you could also use it for like anything
where you have a role so like um you
know this is old cake like pumpkin rolls
and stuff for the holidays and jelly
rolls and things you yeah you could use
you could use this to make that looks
good so nice when you've got six bucks
it's so silly but like I saw it and I
was just like mad so what do you think
consumer which product would you vote
she bazooka Samsung VR for three hundred
dollars then you have to have a note or
the 26 dollar sushi not really a bazooka
for twenty-six dollars that's so street
please walk around like that today at
the grove that would be amazing okay
guys we talked about what we like now
it's time talk about you like it's not
freezer feedback finally a good
transition I wouldn't say good I just I
just said it wasn't bad not bad okay dad
I'll take not bad okay so yesterday we
asked you guys use the hashtag TD cons
to tell us what conferences that you
guys want to throw and where you guys
came up with some really good ones us
there's some really bad puns in here
which make my whole day a better place
Rick wrote in and said TD cons
presenting hipster con bye-bye new style
nerd glasses yeah that's like what you
have today yep you learn how to use a
typewriter know how to groom your
hipster beard and much more I think
where would you hold hipster kanpur and
I were so as a hipster Moreland yeah
Portland sips Turkana I think or where
is uh where's not cool where's a place
that's not cool but like we could
pretend like it's cool oh I bet you
could do like somewhere in Wisconsin
yeah like the oh man everyone's like oh
yeah
I wish over the hips of a rash there
being a hipster be very easy yeah you
just know what kind of music you should
be into you know what you like don't you
hate know what kind of clothes you wear
yeah all right good uh Frank wrote and
said TD cons we should start the San
Francisco villains con wha hahaha and
then he made a little graphic which I
really liked and had like people like
Catwoman and the Joker there's like a
home Lex Luthor yes yeah I like that I
like that at the actual managers showing
up yeah so there's a really good dogs
gone um v2 prime wrote in and said TD
cons give me Swan con seven species of
Swan in the world black black necked
Husker oba mute trumpeter tundra and
Hooper hashtag Swan hype guys it's real
Swan hype is real people are still
enjoying that by the way nice job it
nice job of it um our next okay ours our
necks pc user feedback bring that up on
the screen here Gail says the thing
about cons is if you can think of it
they've done it a magic trick con call
it Decepticon hashtag puns you know who
would be the guest of honor at the first
Decepticon don't say a transformer no
okay what Joe Bluth that'd be great it's
an illusion though it's not a true usual
ten illusion and then lastly schoolboy
NYC schoolboy wise schoolboy see I can't
read said I don't know if this exists
but I would like for an 80s pop culture
convention to exist in California that'd
be amazing I would totally go JD's Khan
there'll be a lot of fun I would be all
about 80 s con that would be amazing um
so that's a that's what you guys wrote
in don't forget hashtag of the day date
ed m the mrv it's like Merv but without
the e in it TDM RV is really hard one to
remember about the NASA vm I'd be
impressed of people I put it in the
description of the YouTube video now
like I started adding the hashtag of the
day into the description so people don't
have to scrub through to remember you go
so look at the description that's all
I'm saying alright guys it's a user
feedback is over except for our very
last piece which is our phone tire for
the day
I like yeah yeah had the transitions and
you lost the transitions all of a sudden
no it's okay Anna this is over it's over
this is all over except oh definitely a
Thursday is Adam rode into US Senate
send in this picture that he took with
his iphone 5 and he said I would like my
rainbow photo that I tweeted out to be
considered for phone talker for the day
the content of the tweet and the link to
the photo are given below this
serendipitously appeared as I was
getting out of my car in a grocery store
parking lot I was surprised that the
relatively small size of the Rainbows
arc I used the panorama feature of my
iphone 5s oh it's a 5s I'm sorry to get
the full rainbow from where I was
standing that's a really good shot
there's actually a double rainbow do you
see it on the side on the left there is
a double rainbow there's a double
rainbow there what does it mean what
does incredible that's a fantastic shot
yeah so as our cover photo status it is
it's really good you caught two rainbows
not just one that ya know that that's
why you have to send in your photos to
us also where is this parking lot that
is so empty I've never did notice
there's not one single car in that
parking lot yeah I don't know maybe on
the other side there's like tons of
Christ tons of cars there's a gas
station anyway let's not let's not dwell
on that rainbow pretty rainbow I've de
pretty double rainbow so faint but it's
there but Adam that was a really good
picture nice job if you guys want to
send in your phone geography you want to
send in story ideas you want to send you
your user feedback you can email us
tomorrow at cnet com we're also on
social media we're on tumblr Twitter
Instagram Facebook and Google+ wear
tomorrow daily and all those things
except what about snapchat no more
snapchat guys no more snapchat but on
google+ for tomorrow daily TV which you
know that could be the next to go we
never know I don't know that you're rid
of your Google+ like American Idol I
just have people vote really with their
phone vote what to get rid of instead
they just call yeah they call in and
they vote for the worst oh and also if
you're watching on YouTube don't forget
to like favorite and subscribe if you're
listening the itunes podcast i forget to
rate my view and don't fallacious when I
swear yeah I'm that's that's a
