makeover and though it may look nicer
than last year's not all changes are
good let's see how the g6 stacks up
against the old g5 the g6 has ditched
the modular look for a more polished
unibody design of metal and glass it's
slightly thicker than other high-end
competitors but it has a comfortable
grip and feels like an improvement over
its clunky predecessor the cost of
beauty though that removable battery
more on that later
even the screen has gotten a bit of a
facelift on the g6 the shrunken bezels
allow it to tack on about half an inch
more of screen real estate without
adding bulk to the phone the resolution
itself though didn't change much but the
g6 is packin more pixels per inch in a
higher quality HDR display the camera on
the other hand has lost a few mega
pixels in the g6 both on the main and
front camera it kept that dual lens
setup on the back with a wide-angle
option but made both 13 megapixel
sensors the g5 had a 16 and 8 megapixel
setup for the main and wide-angle lenses
respectively the wide angle on the g6 is
still slightly inferior to the main with
a lower aperture and no optical image
stabilization but you're more likely to
use it interchangeably the interface
inside the app has changed a bit too
with a new camera roll strip right on
the viewfinder and a square format to
create cool Instagram shots and
compositions ok google' outside the
camera app you'll also notice a few
interface and software changes aside
from running the latest version of
Android it's the first non Google phone
with Google assistant baked in and new
setting options like comfort view that
warms the blueish hues of the screen for
better nighttime viewing the g6 has a
bigger battery but since we weren't able
to conduct any formal testing on this
pre-production unit you'll have to check
back on that later what we can tell you
is that you won't be able to swap it out
for a fresh one once it's out the
consolation prize wireless charging if
you're a US customer and a
water-resistant shell you can submerge
the g6 in about a meter and a half of
water for up to 30 minutes removable
battery aside the g6 combines the best
features of the g5 and the V 20 with a
few new ones that make it rise up to the
top of the LG lines
