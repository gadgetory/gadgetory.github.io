appliances here with the review of the
FLIR FX at 200 bucks FLIR FX is priced
to compete with models like Dropcam pro
the new nuts cam
Samsung Smart cam HD Pro and other
top-of-the-line DIY security cameras
while it doesn't have any third-party
integrations or an if Channel it has
some really interesting features for
starters it has an included power
adapter but it can also run on battery
power with the stand attached it's
supposed to last for up to four hours
and I found that to be pretty accurate
if you remove the stand it lasts for two
hours before needing to be recharged
additionally this thing has cloud
storage and the first pricing tier is
free so you get two days of free
recorded security events it also has a
built-in micro SD slot so if you want to
record locally you can do that there's
also one other advanced feature that I
really love
it's called Rapid Recap which is
basically a time-lapse of all the
activity that has happened within a
certain time frame you can specify 6
hours 2 hours however much time you want
and it'll give you a time-stamped video
of everything that happened that said I
ran into some issues with this camera
the app itself is a little glitchy if I
want to enable or disable motion or
sound alerts it gives me an error even
though it actually does successfully
complete that command I can't figure out
why it does that I have checked the
firmware I've rebooted the app but it
happens every single time it's also a
little laggy in terms of being able to
view the recorded clips so while it does
let me know right away that a motion or
audio event has taken place the actual
recorded clip that shows the activity
doesn't always appear right away and
occasionally it doesn't appear at all
overall I like the FLIR FX it streams in
crisp 720p and records in 1080p so the
footage you can review back
clearer than the footage that you saw on
the livestream although I did see some
graininess and pixelation that I wasn't
expecting if you're looking for the
ultimate in adaptability with the
security-camera FLIR FX is a solid
option but it does have some limitations
that hold it back we did just complete
an extensive buying guide of security
cameras so if you're not quite sold on
FLIR FX you might want to check that out
thanks for watching I'm Megan Willerton
