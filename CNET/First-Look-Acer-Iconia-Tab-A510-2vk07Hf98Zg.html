transformer prime launched in december
2011 with the adoption rate of quad-core
on tablets since then has been slow the
new acer iconia tab a510 marks only the
third tablet to use a quad-core cpu and
is actually the first made by someone
other than a sous but with the assuage
transformer pad tf300 currently priced
fifty dollars cheaper than the acer is
the a510 even worth considering hi i'm
eric franklin and today i'll take a
first look at the acer iconia tab a510
the acer is a fairly typical looking
10.1 inch tablet with a 1280 x 800
resolution screen it has connections
like micro HDMI micro SD which allows
you to expand its built-in 32 gigabytes
of storage by another 32 gigabytes a
rotation lock and a volume rocker
there's a micro USB port on the bottom
used as a power input as well as a way
to transfer files acer also gives you a
female USB dongle instead of a full USB
port which i guess is better than not
having one at all but you probably
wouldn't want to carry one of these
around anyway it just kind of silly
there's a 1 megapixel camera on the
front and a 5 megapixel camera on the
back with no LED light don't expect
great things from these cameras they
take the same typical washed out footage
and pictures that at this point with a
couple of exceptions I've kind of gotten
used to with tablet cameras the tablet
feels solid when held and the gritty
texture on the back really makes it feel
comfortable it's a bit heavier than the
tf300 but i actually prefer holding the
acer the acer screen is a normal LCD and
has pretty washed out colors compared to
the tf300 especially when viewed from
off angles you can kind of see the color
drop out as your perspective changes the
screen is responsive but not quite as
sensitive to the touch as a tf300 the
acer ships with ice cream sandwich and
when navigating the OS you get that
great 60 frames per second smoothness
apps load quickly in Wi-Fi performance
is as fast as a fastest android tablet
acer ring returns after we last saw it
on the a200 the feature is a shortcut to
bookmarks and apps it feels a bit faster
here but I honestly turned it off after
only a few moments of using it I really
don't think is that useful and I felt
like it kind of gotten away sometimes
games like ripped I perform as fast as
what I've seen on the transformer prime
with high frame rates and that awesome
splashy screen effect however I'm still
disappointed about a lack of games that
take advantage of Tiger threes true
power 1080p movies played smoothly and
look appropriately whoa hi def well the
a 510 you're paying 450 dollars for a 32
gigabyte quad-core tablet and while that
would have been impressive even a couple
of weeks back now with the tf300 out
there you can get pretty much the same
features with better screen performance
and better camera for fifty dollars less
the 8510 isn't a bad tablet by any means
and it's actually one of the most
comfortable tablets have ever held it's
just kind of difficult to recommend when
they're better performing and cheaper
options out there once again i'm eric
franklin this has been the first look at
the acer iconia tab a510</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
