you have to like sacrifice a chicken
every time you make a cup of coffee if
that's good for you man I'm not gonna
get in the way here are three coffee
makers they range from $45 to $600 but
it can't really be worth spending that
much on a cup of coffee there are many
factors beyond just the coffee maker
that add up to a great cup of coffee
choosing freshly roasted beans grinding
those beans to the right level infusing
the grounds with water before you brew
hitting the right water temperature and
equally important choosing clean good
tasting water your morning cup is
actually one big science project I know
I'm like Brian made fun of those who
might sacrifice the chicken to get the
perfect cup but he might actually be one
of those people he spends his days
reviewing coffee makers and brewing and
drinking a lot of coffee something
that's so addictive about it and so
comforting and it helps you get through
your day and just makes you know life
just a little bit easier no matter what
kind of coffee you have there's a
correct way to make it there's so many
complex organic compounds in there if
you brew too much or brew too long or if
your coffee's been roasted really dark
and you let it eat too much out then
you're gonna get something bitter and
it's like a balancing act you want to
get just enough to get complex flavor
and not too much otherwise you will just
get extremely just you know nastiness
really so if you spend a ton on an
expensive coffee machine can it help you
get those things right or make your
coffee even better now let's take a look
at those three coffee makers which are
all at very different price points
you'll find Chemex is $45 coffee maker
in a lot of coffee shops people love
this thing thanks to its simple design
its bamboo waistline and its brewing
method it makes a clean tasting clear
cup of coffee also just look at it it's
freakin gorgeous but here's the rub
you can't just press a button and go
it's all manual so you'll have to work
on getting the water temperature
infusion and timing just right then you
have the Bonavita it's what's the word
I'm looking for utilitarian it doesn't
have a fancy design or scheduling
features it's just a drip coffee machine
that makes a really good cup of coffee
without a lot of hands-on work and it
can even pre infuse the grounds for some
people coffee makers have to make good
tasting coffee and make a statement on
the kitchen counter so here's the ratio
8 it's forged from hardwood aluminum and
it looks like something out of a
Scandinavian design magazine it's like
the Chemex but it takes care of the
water temperature infusion and timing
for you that's about half of the
equation I tried the three cups of
coffee from each of these machines in a
blind taste test if I had to give my
best guess even though it's going to be
completely wrong I would say that that's
from the Chemex that's from the ratio 8
and that kitty cat is from the Bonavita
and that my favorite flavor wise is that
one
so my favorite coffee came from the
cheapest method but maybe that's because
spending more on a coffee maker doesn't
guarantee better flavor it's the steps
you take before the brewing process
begins that distinguishes a good cup of
coffee spending $600 for automation
features and a gorgeous design are just
added perks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
