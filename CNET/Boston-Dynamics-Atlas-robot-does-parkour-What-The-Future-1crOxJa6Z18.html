but you can't take the party out of this
animal the spot mini robot has learned
to do a pretty damn good running man but
that's not the most impressive recent
revelation from Boston Dynamics welcome
to what the future
on today's show humanoid robots take a
giant literal leap forward a new
technique to 3d print human body parts
and one of the most disturbing phone
attachments I've ever seen if previous
videos of Atlas's workout regimen have
made you uneasy you may want to look
away yes the humanoid robot by Boston
Dynamics has graduated from jogging to
full-blown parkour now to be fair the
video posted on the company's YouTube
channel is only 29 seconds we don't know
how many attempts this took Boston
Dynamics didn't say much about it only
that those steps are about 16 inches
high and that Atlas uses its whole body
to generate enough energy and strength
to jump without breaking its pace we've
already seen Atlas out for a jog and
this awesome backflip but this latest
demonstration is definitely the most
impressive yet of the robots agility so
you can cue the YouTube comments warning
of a dystopian future ruled by our robot
overlords moving on from building
humanoids to printing them engineers of
the University of Utah have developed a
technique to 3d print human tissue that
means doctors could print replacement
tissue for a patient with a damaged
ligament or tendon without harvesting
tissue from other parts of the body and
needing additional surgeries the process
involves taking stem cells from the
patient's own body fat and printing them
on a layer of hydrogel the tendon or
ligament would then grow in vitro before
being implanted in the patient's body
the team genetically modified these
printed cells to glow fluorescence so we
could actually see what they look like
right now this is designed for ligaments
tendons
and spinal disks but scientists say it
could be applied to any type of tissue
even printing entire organs here's a
body part I wish didn't exist this is
mobile in the phone attachment of your
nightmares it comes to us by French
engineering school telecom Paris Tech
because apparently your phone needs a
finger it connects by USB from there how
you finger your phone is up to you among
other functions like drawing out texts
and acting as a kickstand it's really
designed to be an extension of the
things your phone already does
so imagine bei text you a smiling emoji
the finger can let you know by gently
stroking your wrist or if you just can't
be bothered to walk across the room to
get your phone Moby Lim has you covered
now if that's not creepy enough for you
look at these skins so you can pretend
it's an actual human finger or a fuzzy
cattail now if your own fingers are
already reaching for your wallet this is
just a research project you can't buy it
but do we really want to live in a world
where our phones can give us the finger
I'm guessing some of you do ok James so
Dec asked us on Facebook if atlas can
clean his yard fair question James
coincidentally on the same day Boston
Dynamics showed us parkour Atlas it
posted this video of its spot robot
surveying construction sites in Japan
now this is not to be confused with spot
mini which we saw shaking it earlier in
the show well it's not cleaning a yard
this is a great example of how robots
like spot and Atlas are starting to
perform meaningful tasks in the real
world
by the way Boston Dynamics says its spot
line will go on sale next year
all right what made you say WTF let us
know in the comments that's going to do
it for this week
I'm Mandy Altman thanks for watching
what the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
