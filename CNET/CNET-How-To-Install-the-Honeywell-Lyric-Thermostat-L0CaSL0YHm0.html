intimidating at first but it doesn't
have to be that way I'm Megan Malloy -
for CNET and here's how to install the
Honeywell lyric thermostat so safety
first go to your circuit breaker and
turn off your heating and cooling system
now you're ready to pull the faceplate
off of your old thermostat most of them
really just pop off it looks like it
would be really difficult but it's
pretty simple and then the next thing to
do is to take note of the wires that you
see the confusing part is that every
wiring setup is different but certain
wires will be compatible and certain
wires won't be compatible so it's really
important to take a picture of the ones
you have and if they aren't labeled go
ahead and add labels so as you can see
some of my wires aren't labeled I'm just
going to take some tape and a sharpie
and label them after your wires are
labeled you're ready to remove the rest
of the thermostat unscrew it you may
have to fill in some holes or cover up
any weird mismatched paint areas but
that's it the next step is to actually
install the new thermostat in this case
the honeywell lyric next feed the wires
through the base plate and attach the
base plate to the wall now you're ready
to attach your wires since you labeled
them before this should be really
straightforward but I would also
recommend downloading the Honeywell
lyric app at this point and it'll show
you a diagram of the setup that you need
unlike the Honeywell Wi-Fi smart
thermostat the lyric doesn't require a/c
wire so it's installation is a lot more
similar to the nest than previous
Honeywell thermostats and now you're
basically done just make sure the wires
aren't going to fall out and snap the
faceplate on and you're done so while an
installation like this may seem
unapproachable at first if you have the
correct wiring already it can be a
really really simple install thanks for
watching I'm Megan Willerton Christina
