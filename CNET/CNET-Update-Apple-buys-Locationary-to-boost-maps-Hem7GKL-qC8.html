I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update remember how Apple Maps launched
with a number of problems while Apple is
still working to improve its maps and
has bought the location data company
location Airy this startup pulls in data
from multiple sources to make sure that
local business listings are up to date
and it collects info like store hours
and details on products and services so
it looks like it won't be long before
Apple's Maps get a little smarter and
speaking of Apple if you need to buy a
macbook best buy just cut $200 off the
price of the older pro models as a
back-to-school promotion and if you're a
student you get an extra hundred dollars
off on top of that discount so that's
pretty helpful the promotion ends July
27th but students can get discounts on
other types of macs directly from Apple
these days every smartphone maker uses
one brand name for their top phones
samsung has the galaxy's Motorola has
the Droid razors HTC one's Nokia Lumia
and LG well LG used to give its top
phones the name Optimus but it's
dropping that name for the letter G the
latest flagship phone from LG will be
the LG g2 but what's funny is that LG
already used that name the lg g2 was a
brand for its Google televisions but it
seems the world forgot about those lousy
TVs so the name is being recycled for
Android phones this has been a scorching
summer for many Americans living in the
Midwest and the East Coast with the
National Weather Service issuing heat
advisories in New York it can be
sweltering in some old buildings without
central air so I tried to see if a
little gadget like this could offer any
relief from the heat this is this a
touchy USB portable humidifier
although humidifiers are much more
useful in dry environments this can also
be used as a cold water mister here's
what makes it neat you just stick it on
top of a water bottle you'll want to use
an Evian water bottle it screws in
perfectly with the Evian opening so you
get a tight seal other bottles like
Dasani are too small so it'll be loose
and it could spill if you tilted you
have to plug it into a USB port
power and there you go instant mist at
home or in your car now you could get
creative and connect it to a portable
battery and mist yourself while walking
around the street but that's a bit
ridiculous maybe a future version will
come with a built-in battery for now
you'll probably get more use out of this
when dry winter comes or on those sick
days just put it on your bedside table
for a better night's sleep and it
automatically turns off after eight
hours
not bad for 30 bucks that your tech news
