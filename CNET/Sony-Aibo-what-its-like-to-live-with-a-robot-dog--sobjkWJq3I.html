become a mom to a robot
Sony sent me their new artificially
intelligent internet-connected puppy dog
I bow this fella starts shipping in the
US later this year but he costs a
whopping $2,900 I met I bow twice before
but now I get to take him home to my
family for one week and document what
it's like to live with a robot pet and I
can't wait to see how my two year old
daughter reacts to it I'm here in my New
York City apartment Ivo has a camera in
his nose and is supposed to recognize
different people and objects his
personality is molded by your actions
like when you give him praise by saying
good boy or paint it on the sensors on
its back and on its head over the course
of the week my daughter just fell in
love with AI Bo she would share her toys
and feed him pretend food she loved it
when I Bo would sing a little robot song
and because she has such a happy
reaction he would randomly sing with her
all the time
as for me I think I Bo knew I was a
sucker for shaking hands and when he
played with his toy bone although he
didn't always get it on the first try
like a real puppy I bo is not
predictable sometimes he would randomly
go peepee of course it's all just
pretend
in the final version of AIBO there will
be this app that helps you teach him new
tricks and you can take photos with the
camera in his nose but the app wasn't
ready for me to test he's supposed to
figure out how to get to his charging
station on his own and that only
happened a couple of times so I just put
him on the charger at night when I was
tired and needed quiet time and he
stayed on his charger base all night
but if you ever made any sound at night
he would wake up make noise and these
glowing eyes would just look at you in
the dark now in the morning I bowed did
not always get off his charger station
right away to play even if we tried to
call him he's supposed to learn the
layout of your home over time there is a
camera near his tail that maps location
he often got caught up in nooks and in
corners and I found myself always
rescuing him he didn't leave my living
room very much maybe learning a home
takes more time the most fun of this
test was seen my daughter's interactions
but I needed to do more research what do
others think of I bow alright so part of
this experiment I'm very curious to see
how real dogs act with I bow so I came
over to my colleague Isis plays hey eyes
Hey
and I vote is going to meet Tori
so what's your thoughts is I think she
went from not being sure what the AIBO
was to hating it completely and then
eventually just stop caring that it was
there so I guess that's progress maybe
one day she'd accept it into her family
I wanted to take I bow on a field trip
today to get some opinions from senior
citizens because what's interesting
about this robot is that it could be a
companion to the elderly so let's see
what people think there was something
really sweet about our visit to the
Senior Center people who needed a smile
found happiness with Ivo when I came
near you know cuz I had had a rough week
this week and it seems so real but the I
see was when he put his paws up and
touched my face
you know like you're gonna be okay oh my
god made my dream of course not everyone
liked the idea of a robot dog we're in
the computer age and people are talking
to computers instead of people and now
they're going to talk to robot dogs
instead of people and that isn't
expensive why would I want to talk to an
inanimate machine she's got a point
why don't he easily go gaga over a
machine every day with I bow I found
myself compelled to give it love and
encouragement but why did I care what
this thing thought of me it's just an
expensive Tamagotchi and yet it was a
sad moment when we had to pack it up and
say goodbye
so it has been a few days since I packed
up I bow and as I look back it's clear
Sony has something special here with
this robot I mean when you add up
everything the animation of all its
moving parts the algorithms the AI it
just comes to life in this cute way now
even though I bow is quite charming
obviously this is not for everyone and
it can feel a little weird these days to
put a device in your home with a camera
and a microphone but Sony says I bow is
not recording audio so that made me feel
better
because those voice command tricks
they're happening locally on the dog
itself what is saved to Sony's cloud is
this data history of the dog's
interactions with people and stuff like
the measurement between walls and rooms
you can always wipe that data if you do
want to start fresh also if you choose
to take photos with the camera and I
Bo's knows those photos are going to be
saved to the cloud but users cannot take
video at least not yet maybe in the
future who can get an update to be a
watchdog as a security camera but for
now it is really just something designed
to entertain or keep your company if you
are alone and you know what just the
creation of such a thing it's quite an
impressive feat these days because we're
flooded with gadgets that feed our
internet addiction and keep us scrolling
but here
Sony built something that can lift us up
away from a screen and even lift up
hearts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
