streaming box the company's latest
streaming box is bigger than the others
and more expensive in a hundred
twenty-nine bucks what you get for the
extra money is the ability to screen 4k
videos TV shows and movies as well as
one of the coolest features we've seen
on any living room device a remote
finder if you misplace your remote on
the couch cushions on a regular basis
this is the feature for you just tap the
button on the top of the Roku 4 and the
remote emits a loud sound until you find
it it hit any button you can even choose
from a few different sounds including
the whistle and submarine style sonar
like a couple of other devices including
the Nvidia shield and Amazon fire TV and
unlike the new Apple TV the Roku 4 can
stream 4k videos to take advantage and
lead a 4k TV and a relatively robust
internet connection but the payoff will
be better quality than 1080p high def
screaming video the catch is lack of
content only a few apps currently
support 4k including Netflix Amazon Vudu
and YouTube and only a handful of TV
shows and movies are currently available
via those apps the Roku 4 does make
finding that content easier than other
streamers however with a dedicated 4k
showcase app and a category in its app
store devoted to 4k providers the box
has mostly the same connectivity as
other Roku's including an Ethernet port
and an HDMI output that it also adds an
optical digital audio output for older
AV systems Roku also says it has a
better processor and faster Wi-Fi aside
from its little built-in alarm the
remote is the same as that on the Roku 3
including a headphone jack for private
listening and the ability to search by
talking into its microphone unlike the
Apple TV and some other devices Roku's
voice support doesn't extend to commands
or general questions just search terms
Roku makes our favorite streaming device
software with its content agnostic
approach and excellent cross apps search
and the company is also rolling out a
new software update for all late-model
Roku boxes and Roku TVs with it you can
receive notifications for current TV
shows movies and even actors and
directors become available to stream
complete with pricing information the
software update also allows connection
to certain hotel and dorm Wi-Fi networks
that require a webpage to sign in Roku
is also improving its mobile app for iOS
and Android devices
adding better notifications and improved
casting of photos from your phone to the
TV I'm David Katz brand that's a quick
look at the new real coup for stay tuned
for the full review coming
