alphabet extra crunchy podcast with your
host mr. Brian Tom bump it to the beat
from an undisclosed location huh is the
Alawite extra crunchy episode 84
everybody thanks so much for hanging out
with us and for all of our loyal Apple
bye nation thanks for sticking around
because this show is all about you all
again if you want to be a part of the
show call us at 1-800-669-9133 or about
that recover at all we cover at all we
do we do all right let's jump in the
show and this is this is kind of a weird
week this week I think this is a week
where anything is possible and we kick
it off with Microsoft had their build
conference it's their Developers
Conference over in Seattle today and one
of the announcements that it was really
funny they were announcing new key
partners for Windows 10 and they showed
off Spotify and the crowd was like okay
that's cool and then all of a sudden
they said and they had a slide in an
image to verify it that iTunes is coming
to the Windows Store by the end of this
year like you can even check out that's
that there's a tweet that they put out
there from Microsoft
coming out iTunes on the Windows Store
and so when I first read that my first
reaction was like hell froze over for a
second time because this is in reference
a long time ago for some of the Apple
heads and people are like why are you
even saying that but people that know
I'm gonna give you a little history
lesson here
Steve Jobs long ago when they had
introduced iTunes itunes had been out I
believe for about a year and a half or
so and earlier he had said you know he'd
kind of joke that you'll never see it on
Windows until hell freezes over so then
finally he did announce that iTunes was
coming to the Windows platform this is
because the success of the iPod and he
had a graphic that said hell froze over
so this is kind of like the second time
it's happened where iTunes has now been
on a Windows platform I'm gonna tell you
right now Beach uh you know me I love my
iPad pro I am a religious iPad pro users
but man it kind of makes me think if
they have iTunes directly on that device
like the surface pro 5 let's say oh yeah
it becomes compelling because my
ecosystem hooks are pretty much almost
all their other than iMessage I get all
you know all the media's there and it's
native to the Windows 10 platfor I'm
just I don't know it's it's kind of
exciting in a weird way that I might
give it a chance because I love the iPad
but man the iOS for the iPad is it needs
to do more yeah I got excited about this
too but then a lot of the apps that come
in the Windows Store they're kind of
like I don't want to
they're half-baked a little bit or
they're like really they don't look as
great as like a regular app on Windows
you know what I mean like they're I know
generic they look a little generic so I
mean I yeah at first I was excited then
I was like but it's probably going to be
plugging a look kind of weird and I
don't know if it's gonna function
properly because I have I use iTunes on
Windows all the time and it has issues
you know it has a lot of bugs like mine
makes that noise all the time goes
dududu like like I'm done
syncing or something it just randomly is
that all the time for some reason I'm
waiting for an update to fix that so I'm
excited but you know at the same time it
depends on what it's going to look like
and how well it's going to function for
me yeah and people are saying hey they
have iTunes has already been on Windows
we know that but I'm talking about like
natively - kind of like that - the
Windows Store like the tablet like
basically a tablet type version totally
you know I get I don't want to say
seamlessly integrated because it's not
but it has that really true native look
and feel
to the modern Windows 10 so I it's let
me just at least say I probably won't
jump over but it gave me that pause
right for that for that moment I just
pause I'm like man maybe I would
consider this and that's what they're
trying to do right they're trying to
turn people like me to be like moon if
the surface pro is truly that much
better than there will be people beyond
me that might just jump over so anyways
iTunes coming to the Windows Store by
the end of the year and then another
announcement this time with Amazon like
this has been going on for at least I
swear two three years
AI wars the a I'm in the middle the AI
wars well before we get to yeah we are
but like this this announcement
according to BuzzFeed says and there
were rumors about this earlier this week
Apple will announce that Amazon Prime
the video app Amazon Prime video will be
coming to the Apple TV sometime in the
summer will be announced at WWDC this is
the first report that outright says we
will see the Amazon Prime video app on
the Apple TV sorry I spoke too quickly I
thought you're gonna talk about the echo
show or something you know I don't but
I'm getting ahead of us but uh Amazon
Prime video on Apple TV that's awesome
and they've been keeping those things
apart for a long time and uh it's about
time that they get together well there's
always been this weird thing like is
there beef between the companies because
right Apple is very sensitive about
putting competing multimedia store
fronts that have apps on their platforms
and according to sources a report had
earlier said that both sorry Steve Tim
Cook and Jeff Bezos had actually met to
just kind of grind it out and say like
let's just do this thing you got to put
the top Birds in the room right and they
just said let's just do it okay it's
gonna happen so I think this is exciting
cuz that's one of those kind of missing
pieces that's on every platform when you
talk about video streaming services it
just wasn't on Apple TV so I'm glad they
got their heads out of their butts and
did the damn thing yeah totally um I
would love to be a fly on the wall
during that meeting with Tim Cook who's
tape Jeff Bezos you know it's gotta be
up some crazy conversation
that they were having they're like how's
your spaceship going oh cool yeah you
know how's your billion-dollar
trillion-dollar fund uh you know rich
guy knock hey you want you want to do a
Amazon Prime video or not so let's do
that yeah how's your primary owns going
oh it's doing awesome yeah we'll be able
to deliver your phones by via drone in
the next year so oh yeah that's cool hey
you want to talk about Amazon Prime or
what yeah yeah what's what's up with the
Apple car is that happening oh no it's
not oh I'm sorry my bad another big
thing that Amazon dropped and Steve's
talking just write directly to it the
Amazon echo show is their new really
it's their new echo product but with a
video screen it's basically kind of like
what we imagine video phones from like
the 80s and 90s to be but what makes it
special or what makes it smarter is the
echo platform is completely integrated
into it it's a widescreen touchscreen it
has a big rectangular speaker on the
bottom and you can use it for calls so
let's say grandma grandpa mom and dad
cross country you can make video phone
calls directly through it has a video
camera as well I polled people on
Twitter just to see how excited they
were because quite honestly I wasn't
super juiced about this because I'm not
the type that's gonna have like I don't
I already have FaceTime on my phone and
I feel like if you have just the sitting
video screen that could you could get
called any time it's kind of like yeah
and I already have an echo right yeah I
wasn't excited about either seems like a
you know I don't know it's like another
we have so many ways to call right now
it's a nice again why and I think trust
me I'm not knocking a video phone by any
means I think this product will do
pretty well
the thing is it's gonna retail at 230
dollars I if I could recall right I
think the because I haven't bought in a
while I think the standard Amazon echo
is around 150 160 is that right am I
totally enough you guys gals can click
me yeah I think it's probably a little
less now like to keep lowering the price
on everything the echo dot is like going
down in price - yeah that one's like 50
bucks yeah yeah um but yeah I was I had
the same reaction as you like I was not
excite
I'm like oh you know another thing
another screen uh it's it's not that
great it would be cool if you could
connect it to your television maybe and
then say Amazon Prime and play this
movie or something and it just starts
playing a movie for you and then it just
becomes like it replaces your echo dot
dot in your you know and and the other
echo products um that would be cool but
I didn't really I haven't looked that
much into it to be honest it did it it
was one of those things where I love I'm
that goes I'm Amazon's biggest fan when
it comes to the whole echo platform but
it was one of those things where I'm
like do do I really need this right now
and the answer for me right now is no um
I even let me see if I can put up this
pole you won't be able to see it but I'm
just hoping that the results will load
up but I asked people on my Twitter you
know the Amazon echo show I like to do
instead of a yes or no I like to do yes
or pass what you think about yeah like
that or pass way more fun yeah
22 percent said yes 63 percent said pass
15 percent said Google home users that
was out of 350 votes so you know mode
the tooth more about two-thirds of
people are like and I'm good I'll pass
on it but I think if you know I was
wanted to get my if I wanted to get my
mom and dad and I had kids and be able
to really easily just do something like
that I could see how it does fit Annie
but it's not gonna be I don't think is
gonna sell nearly as much as a regular
echo it's just not no well actually last
night
you know it's just lying in bed going
through my phone and I saw that that
Amazon echo app had updated a completely
changed like the artwork and everything
changed and I went through and it
started like almost like it was taking
me through setting up my echo dot all
over again sort of you know it's kind of
taking me through this thing and then
asked for my phone number so I can make
phone calls and I quickly was like no no
way I do not want that I don't want
people calling me on my echo you know so
you know it's immediately I was not
happy or didn't want to do it you know
so quick thing we are going to talk
about how this connects to Apple but
there were reports that basically Amazon
had invested in this start
called nucleus that has a video type
phone product that can be stuck on walls
and whatnot and then essentially kind of
cloned its product for the new echo and
I get it like again Amazon invested
money in nucleus and some people are
little noise people most people have any
I didn't even know what
quite honestly right I'll be the first
day I even know what nucleus was until I
read about the story but a lot of times
in the tech world
it's like saying the Samsung Galaxy
copied the iPhone copied the samsung
galaxy which copied the iPhone which you
know it gets the point where look the
reason why this is different is has the
echo guts and brains inside of it and
that's gonna always make a lot of these
products that might be the same you put
in a different platform in it or a
different ecosystem like apples
ecosystem that's what can makes a
product that might be normal more
special because of those hooks yeah true
true so here's here's what here's the
fun meet about this so the echo show was
announced I believe in Tuesday of this
past week but right before that over the
weekend Phil Schiller did an interview
with a website called gadgets 360 now in
this interview he was basically asked oh
you know how is what do you think about
voice assistance like the Amazon echo
like the Google home and here's here's
what he had to say now he basically let
me just get to his first thing the first
thing he said in response to that is
that my mother told me my mother used to
have a saying this is his quotes I want
to asked about the Google home and
Amazon's echo my mother used to have a
saying that if you don't have something
nice to say say nothing at all what that
hockey jerks respite come on dude
someone's asking you about voice
assistance and you can't even comment
like right off the bat on the state of
voices ins you just go you just go in on
them like yeah I'm gonna its first of
all if you're the VP of Marketing for
one of the top tech companies of the
world you've got to do better than that
you can't be a d-bag
when he chose to be a d-bag sounds like
he's a little defensive like it's almost
like borderline worried you know cuz
Siri a lot of people or not series not
as hot you know so that's interesting so
then they went on to ask him to
elaborate about voice assistance and he
did make an interesting point now
he talked this is what he says there's
many moments where a voice assistant is
really beneficial but that doesn't mean
you'd never want a screen so the idea of
not having a screen I don't think suits
many situations and what he's basically
saying is if you have these voice
assistants out there you should have a
screen on them and so guess who dropped
like literally three days later after he
said this a voice assistant with a
screen Amazon okay and I know and I know
he's also relating like hey our phones
which have screens have a voice
assistant but I'm like Phil you're just
jealous like you can't talk you know
what about another company when they've
had something that is probably the most
in this most exciting space of consumer
tech we've seen in a while you have
nothing to show for two years and you're
talking junk about Amazon and Google
home that's that's so petty it's so
petty well I completely disagree with
him because he's saying you need a
screen I mean like I use my echo dot a
lot I talked to it a lot it does a lot
of things for me and I'm all like way
far away from it I'm across the room
sometimes even upstairs or you just on
my phone or something you know but a lot
99% of the time I'm not looking at a
screen I'm just yelling I'm just yelling
uh you know things at the echo so I
think he's he's wrong I disagree with
him on that the only thing I wish that
the echo had on it was actually just
some sort of visual clock so I don't
sometimes I'm not in in view of a clock
yeah I know you got your phone on you
but not but it's I wish you just had
like oh I can see the time on it or
something so anyways this is all
building up because Apple is rumored to
be doing a series speaker of their own
that could potentially have a video
screen on it that would be a Serie B
speaker and look we don't know if it's
want to happen at all right now Echo's
have grabbed 70% of the US market
invoice assisted speakers okay that is
beast okay Google accounts for the rest
all right so Apple again we've talked
about this a while ago Apple's going to
be the third player in the market
I typically there's really only room for
two and then the third one is always
kind of like their um Google's getting
more device support Google's actually
smarter but it's just not as practical
right now Google's home is the smarter
of the two based on the algorithm but I
mean come on
for applet talk junk like that it's that
this is this is the stuff that drives me
crazy like they are still acting like
the cocky we do everything the best when
they don't yeah yeah I mean he's the man
he's saying it wouldn't be cool without
a screen and then also their laptops
don't need to have touch screens so
there's just a lot of disconnect there
you know can I die so we'll see how it
plays out I am actually though really
curious about WWDC because look Apple
hasn't really released too many new
products this year yet it's like
everything is starting to stack up
towards the second half of the year
we're talking about we haven't seen
iPads we haven't seen MacBook Pros we
haven't seen max we haven't seen Apple
watch we haven't seen iPhone we won't we
won't most likely see Mac Pro Apple TV
mean I mean there's so many things like
this could just be a bang bang bang
summer release all the way through the
fall if you get pretty wild so but I'm
just waiting for Apple to drop something
us instead of complain about other
companies for doing something that they
haven't done yeah we're like almost half
half the years almost over it's almost
six months in and that's what I'm
talking about so they're just gonna like
you know they're gonna drop a bunch of
stuff on us and just try to dominate the
conversation for the second half of the
year that's probably what's gonna happen
we'll see we'll see I mean we'll see
Microsoft build had a lot of cool stuff
today that works with everything to it
like you know timeline you can be on
your phone and Cortana it'll work on
iPhone Android everywhere you can pick
up where you left off so there's a lot
of there's a lot of cool competition
happening we're curious to see what's
going to
lots shakin alright let's transition
over a little bit to the Apple watch
this is a really cool report coming out
from TechCrunch and basically a study a
research study conducted by the
University of California San Francisco
and the team behind the cardiogram app
has found that Apple's the Apple watch's
built-in heart monitor is 97 percent
accurate when detecting the most common
form of an abnormal heart rhythm when
paired with an algorithm to sort through
the data so they're basically saying
that the tech on the Apple watch is good
enough to be able to detect abnormal
heart rhythms heart arrhythmia as we've
heard the term there were 6158
participants in the study they all use
the cardiogram app on the Apple watch
them onto their heart rate most are
known have normal EKG readings but 200
them suffer from a regular heart beat so
I just found this fascinating because we
talked about the accuracy of some of
these fitness devices I still personally
based on my experience feel like the
Fitbit is a better fitness like actual
step tracker than the Apple watch I've
used them both on multiple hikes
compared the final result of distance
cover to the official distance of trails
but when it comes to and they both have
heart rate sensors on it but I just
found this really compelling from a
standpoint of apples trying to continue
to push these health and wellness
initiatives and this is just another
thing you know they quiver right that
they have that they can just say it look
we have the best of XYZ and everyone is
wearing this stuff so I like that we're
starting to see not the sexiest stuff
but when it comes to this real medical
science proof of not only proof of
concept but proof that it works it's
starting to make these devices across
the board whether it's Apple or other
companies make them more useful and
quite honestly potentially life-saving
more you know something like that that's
important yeah they're getting close to
just being in all hospitals you know
like being in it you're a Cajun you're
not going to have those bunch of wires
connected to you're just gonna have an
Apple watch on they're getting closer to
that and that's really cool you mean
yeah
even with apples health out there
they're basically taking all this data
pulled from your devices and from your
apps and trying to throw it all into one
single app that you can maybe use
whether it's medical history or what
your current situation or your past
readings over the past two weeks when
you go to a physician and show them this
stuff that they can actually just look
at right away and be like okay this is
the data that I need it's kind of its
kind of crazy where this could
potentially go so I'm on board with it
it's just not sexy but it's cool I'm in
another health wellness story Apple has
acquired beddit it's the iPhone
connected sleep monitoring system and so
what this is this is like this long
strip that you put on your bed between
your mattress and then like the top
blankets and it basically measures like
your respiration heart rate movement
snoring room temperature room hooome
humidity all those things like that and
then gives you that data to the iPhone
it's being sold in Apple stores right
now oh wow
but yeah for $150 but Apple acquired the
company oh wow cool so I just feel like
this is another thing as you're trying
to build out this whole health well so
we know this is going to be in hospitals
too man you're gonna be wearing your
Apple watch with this beddit thing I
mean they're gonna be in every hospital
in America I'm I'm predicting right now
that's my prediction well I'll tell you
I could tell you my bed at readings for
you right now oh please vigorous
activity oh did you break the bed it
no no not honestly I'm completely lying
right now that's just not true it's just
not true it's not true
it's like the Bennets activities like oh
little wussy goes to sleep at 9:00 to
10:00 p.m. I don't go to sleep that
early I don't go to you might go to
think that early because you're a kid oh
yeah I'm by 10 a.m. I'm fried you can't
even get me up out of it anywhere so
anyways that's really cool yeah Apple
Apple acquires this company called
beddit so we'll be interesting to see
that that's something that'll you know
be put together with them down the line
but they're starting to build a lot of
stuff let's jump over to iPhone 7 in a
fun little report just in case you guys
are all wondering what's
what's going on with on with Apple is
the word is the sky falling we aren't
selling as many units according to
strategy analytics the Apple iPhone 7
was the top smelling smelling top
selling smells smells it also the smells
the top selling smartphone during the
first quarter of 2017 despite a
year-over-year drop in sales they
estimated that the iPhone 7 accounted
for 6.1 percent of total smartphones
while the iPhone 7 plus captured four
point nine percent that would be for the
q1 of 2017 so that's January through
March what's interesting is that in
third place was a phone from Asia called
the Oppo r9 and if you look up what the
Oppo RNA and looks like it looks like a
complete knockoff of the iPhone 7 is
that pig fat in here and this is not the
article but you know what is it a good
art but what Oh Q P o r9 but this cracks
me up cuz it's like oh maybe people that
are dumb and thought it was the iPhone
bought it because it's also cheaper
don't get me wrong but it's it's it's
from an Asian company the Galaxy s8 did
not come out until April so that's not
included in these numbers but there you
go
cuz you sledder watching it looks like
an iphone looks exactly like an iPhone
but kind of like with an Android button
on the bottom yeah
oh we do we do want to finish up at
least with our stories before we get to
our calls with the iPhone 8 stuff um
beach' model if you can I want you to
cube the video instead of the article
because this is this is the latest this
is a video rendering of the new what is
believed to be the new iPhone 8 based on
the most current leaked CAD images this
is brought to us from on leaks and gear
India but what it is is it's there you
go it looks like a single slate of glass
but what's interesting is if you look at
the top where the camera senses are it
looks different um you have the rear
protruding camera on the back that I'm
like do Apple can't you just not make
the camera protrude anymore can you just
do something about that that's not the
case but um there's an article that I
put in here that
basically shows off that the camera
sensors are going to be on the top of
the of the of the phone but they kind of
jut out and if you look at some of the
images that are out there you'll see
what I mean it looks different where
it's not a clean black line until you
actually use the phone so if you like
have your wallpaper you're gonna have
this kind of like little trapezoid
coming out from the top of your phone
and then when you unlock it you'll kind
of have a steady black bar with all you
know the Wi-Fi and your cell signal and
your battery life on that top bar you
you'll see you'll see just just go look
it up but I don't know I'm curious how
this whole I'm curious how this iPhone 8
really shapes up
we know everything we've seen and we'll
just have to wait for to be confirmed
because it feels like we really know a
lot about this already I still kind of
wish that they put the you know the
little button there's one button on the
side that'll like turn off your iPhone I
wish they would move that back to the
top because every time I try to turn it
off I end up like hitting the volume and
I turn my in and you know I can't turn
my screen off because I'm yeah
accidentally hitting the volume and it's
very annoying so I wish it would put
that bun back on the top that's that's
my wish Apple thank you the head wishes
by Steven B Jim dheere dheere dheere
Apple um and then just a couple two
quick bullet points a report from
JPMorgan says that Apple is expected to
bring an enhanced receiver so that and
what audio receiver what that will help
is with better stereo sound and
potentially even better waterproofing
but it's kind of a no-brainer right now
this next phone has to have ip68
plenty of phones have that including
phones with headphone jacks
I actually have an IP 68 rating but
Apple doesn't and they don't have a
headphone jack so they've got to do that
and then the last rumor who knows if
this is true or not a lot of reports are
saying that because of supply shortages
and problems in the production line that
has slowed down this because of the new
design the new screens even sensor
related issues of getting that
technology lock down it could
potentially see the iPhone eight ship
out in october/november instead of
the September timeframe so that's God's
throne out there well that's kind of
very close to the holiday season so
we'll see we'll see how it all shakes
out but again those are just iPhone 8
rumors I want to talk about no more cuz
like we're probably sick of them by now
right
no way man I can't get enough give me
more who wants more who wants mo mo fo
meemers okay should we get to the phone
calls yes let's do it alright that's you
guys
thank everybody who called in we got a
lot of good voicemails and here's the
first one
hey Guillermo hi Oh again and my
question is what is what's up with Apple
and their new design of ethyl 8 is not
really impressive I don't really like
the design of the camera with yeah so
that's basically my only question and
also Apple hasn't really been oppressing
me lately I don't know I'm not too
impressed that's just my thoughts how
can I say hi she's not impressed oh man
just reminds me of that picture of the
Olympian from the Team USA on the
gymnastics quad from do you remember
that yeah yeah yeah not impressed Jerry
the thing is that I think no matter what
if you're an i if you're an apple lover
and you're in the ecosystem I think
people get giddy about new phones Jerry
cook good pole beat yeah so not
impressed
yeah not impressed I think people are
gonna like this phone either way I'd I
think they might poopoo on the 7s and 7s
plus but I'm I'm just more bored because
you know this is all rumor and
speculation but a lot of it's probably
pretty close to what it's going to be
like and we just hear it every we will
continue to hear through September and
possibly October November it's like
there's got to be more to life than that
yeah yeah there's gotta be it will sell
more than the iPhone 7 though right yeah
they always do okay
next call hey PJ Brian it's me John from
southern Minnesota
I was just wondering about like the new
Apple
AirPlay speaker series speaker whatever
you think they're gonna call it do you
think it'll be branded under apple or
beets since like you know beets makes
speakers like the beats pill in the pill
XL and what that so do you think you'll
be branded under Beats or under Apple
thanks have a good one - good thanks for
the call yeah I you know I think no
matter what they if it's a Serie B
speaker it's gonna be an Apple product
uh I think it'll tilt out that there's
Beats technology right you know they
might have their beep yeah
equalizer settings in an app you know
some of their you know hardware stuff in
there fine that that's fine that that
can be beats whatever but it's gonna be
an Apple branded speaker uh you know if
it looks like kind of what the what is
it called it the UE boom um that's just
kind of like a cylinder with a mesh
speaker around it okay we've seen that
before
I just again a 70% of smart speakers
Amazon owns right now I wonder how much
that number would change because I think
the general consensus at least in the
tech space is that Siri is not that
great but to the general consumer that
doesn't pay attention to that I think
they might think that Oh
series great you know a lot of people
are gonna be buying this thing that
haven't experienced these AI products
and they're Apple is going to be their
first introduction to it that's what's
always kind of crazy when you when you
take a step back and think about Oh what
about my mom or my grandparents like
they're gonna be like oh you know the
headline Apple makes a smart speaker and
there's a majority people who feel this
is the first smart hear they have ever
heard of and Apple made it true true but
you could it happen he makes a good
prediction though because you could bet
like down the line maybe even next year
beats will have one and it'll be like
Apple hunt with Apple home you know with
Apple home inside and Siri inside
everything so they probably won't make
one in the future just I don't think
it's going to be Apple's flagship AI
speaker you know I mean someone in our
periscope just said my parents are still
confused by the echo so there's room for
innovation and I think it's just some
people trust the idea that app
made something so I'm gonna learn about
it and it's my phone's an apple so yeah
I'll learn about this where's you tell
someone like hey Amazon made a smart
speaker outside of the tech world
they're gonna be like huh like how do I
use it I don't want to learn those
commands I don't I don't get it I don't
but then also you put the Apple name on
it they're like oh yeah I'll figure this
out right there there's a cycle
psychology and mentality that works that
way yeah my dad is like afraid of the
echo he's like I got things recording me
right now
I was like oh no one will be around it
you know he's like fraid of it it's
funny and this is right Alice yeah I
don't know I don't know what he would do
I don't think you would have any kind of
speaker and it is you know that's
listening to him uh it would really be
funny though Beach if like Apple
releases ones like hey Steve did you
hear about the Apple Smart speaker ha ha
Greg yeah dad now he doesn't even like
having this picture on online anywhere
like if I put something on Facebook he's
like no no no I never do so you know
that's how he is okay next call let's
see here we go hey Apple byte um this is
Wes in Atlanta I'm actually just had a
question I'm happen to be looking
through nine to five Mac and it talked
about iOS eleven uh do you think they're
finally going to do split screen on the
plus when are we going to get that I
love to just watch youtube videos or
watch the Apple byte as I'm also looking
on nine to five max calm anyway I love
you guys love the show Thanks you mean
you mean as you're reading cnet.com yes
please which gets a lot of its Apple
scoops from nine to five you know what
uh if they do split screen on the iPhone
obviously we'd hope it at least be on
the plus but to Beechum's point in
multiple shows they still haven't given
us horizontal freaking landscape iTunes
I know come on please so pathetic dude
it's easy to do it's so bad it's like
seriously I and why can I use the I the
iPhone in landscape mode on the home
screen on just
Plus and not the frickin regular iPhone
I hate that I think that is so lame
that's one of the lamest things just
make it the same so yeah you can do it
on the iPad split-screen that's one of
the exclusive features to iOS on the
iPad but I would like that very much too
I agree I've actually never tried split
screen on an iPad I'd be curious to see
how that works but it works nice it's
really it's really easy straightforward
okay cool
okay next call hey guys it's Ryan from
Sacramento I wanted to get your opinion
on the touch ID sensor which currently
on iPhone 7 and past iPhones can work
kind of sketchy sometimes it works
sometimes it does and I'd say it has
about a 75% success rate it depends
whether your hands are sweaty wet dirty
anyways wanted to know with the if they
end up putting it underneath the glass
on the new iPhone 8 or the iPhone future
do you think the reliability will be a
little bit better or do you think it'll
still be sketchy because it's a new
technology maybe have a few issues with
it since maybe one of the first phones
but it puts it underneath the glass love
the show guys look forward to your
opinion thanks I think that I just think
that the touch ID sensor it's gonna be
the same sensor there's gonna pop it on
the rear so I really think that accuracy
wise it's most likely going to be the
same and I'm sorry if you have sweaty
fingers maybe maybe maybe our Apple
biter maybe got the sweaty thing he's
right like right after you get out the
shower or you wash the dishes or
something you can't unlock your phone
unless you tie down the number it's a
holy trick it's totally true so um but I
think that underneath the glass the
reason why we aren't seeing any true
confirmations of it is because like to
your point the accuracy is gonna have to
be a lot better when it's through glass
right this is using optics too and even
there you know some of the patent
reports talked about how there's audio
signals that are sending vibrations to
kind of read the base of your finger and
the different imperfections that
identify you like this is not easy stuff
right and I would never be like oh app
well you couldn't get on the front
screen Samsung had over a year to do it
they couldn't do it in the Galaxy s8
product we'll see if they even get it
into the note 8
time Apple is kind of facing the same
issue that this is just not as easy as
people thought and you know this is some
of the challenges that technology has I
hope I hope they can do it because it's
they really need something to tout that
we have actual hardware technological
features that are more advanced than
what is right now the best phone on the
market at the Galaxy s8 from a
technology standpoint and for Apple to
really claim and make you know have
bragging rights that we're the best and
be able to back it up because that's
what they always say they need to do
something like that so if they don't I'm
not gonna not buy the next iPhone I
still think the fingerprint sensor on
the back I have a Google pixel it works
perfectly fine I like it there it's not
that big of a deal but I know yes
ideally get it on the front get on the
home screen we'll have to see if they do
it or not yeah that that sensories
talking about and you were talking about
with the audio signals the very I feel
like we don't know how well that's going
to do but it seems like it would be a
little more accurate than the optical
way that it's working now if it's using
like a you know like a frequency to
measure your finger I don't know we just
it we'd have to test it out to see but
if to me I feel like it could be more
accurate than what we have now so oh
okay I need I need to address a comment
someone wrote I'm in the periscope I
think his name was Ken there talk like
Oh sweaty fingers from watching the
Warriors lose three one of the Cavs come
on man oh why people burning us still on
that so it so petty who's your team for
reals who's your team you don't got a
team your team sucks is it looking like
the Warriors are gonna meet the Cavs
again it's kind of looking that well
right sure oh well I'm not one to jump
ahead but uh it looks pretty strong
rematch that'll be fun to watch it'll be
fun it'll be fun okay we have one more
call here we go
hello I'm Nelson from Westchester Ohio a
quick question is the pixel xB pixel XL
they're the bigger one is it still
relevant at this time or should I wait
until Google comes out with its next
Thanks take care then love your videos
all right bye-bye cool bro
is this an Apple bite or the Google bite
I know Google issues it's the Apple
licious what does happen no it was funny
we put this call in because we're like
people are calling our apple the Apple
bites show about Google phones now that
mean that's how far
Apple has drifted from their audience so
I just thought it was interesting maybe
we should do a show that covers all
things in this older space we could good
oh now look quick because we show love
and look I'm not just an Apple freak the
timing you got oh don't get a new pixel
now wait for the next one it should be
getting announced in the next three or
four months just don't we already saw
their first entry in the market which
quite honestly to me was an amazing
first entry because they came up with
two things that no one had the best
voice assistant on planet earth and
still to this day based on the rankings
the best camera in a smartphone Oh on
that on that phone on the Google pics so
just wait for the next gen your you
shouldn't need to buy one now and call
back with an Apple question next week I
do you have to point out though that
Vanessa hand Arianna did a video pixel
versus iPhone in the iPhone camera or
the video video camera was better on the
iPhone plus than the pixel correct so
based on out base on how they shot it
I'm gonna based on yeah they stated they
do at nighttime and a boat and some like
really difficult settings you know so
yeah it's you know if you want the
camera its camera video there's a it's
kind of a toss-up there it's like most
people Colette's be real no matter what
you tell people about a camera it's not
like everyone bought a Google pixel
because it had the best rated camera
based on both results and actual metrics
like visual results and actual metrics
it had the best camera but it didn't
look did everyone buy a Google pixel no
but a good amount but it was a great
start for Google I mean I'm like I
wasn't
pressed their first in-house phone uh we
should I think will in the show because
we're not time on Apple cool yeah
all right everybody excellent thanks so
much again you guys and gals can call us
I love all the calls that were sent in
thanks so much again that number is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
