under an overpass in athens in Athens in
the port so there's like tourists come
through right back over there it's like
obvious juxtaposition of like an
operational port and like an unofficial
refugee camp the bulk of the people were
now had moved from the island of lesbos
to Athens and so the camps that we saw
they're much more urban many more people
you know in many different locations
throughout the city I would say almost
everybody if not everybody that wasn't a
child had a smartphone usually when they
arrived in Greece they will get local
SIM cards my phones to buying chargers
most of the time it wasn't an official
like charging station it was just kind
of here's an outlet and the refugees
have hooked up you know five power
strips to it we're in a cab today it's
Friday we're on our way to Lenny phone
which is the old International Airport
this shutdown that's now turned into
we understand an official unofficial
site for Refugees this one is controlled
by the Greek government but it was very
strange very surreal there's you know
arrival and departure signs and there's
you know baggage claim their day-to-day
life I mean as far as the technology and
the way they they kind of they do a lot
of what everybody what we do what
everyone around the world does is kind
of you know the women when you're bored
you sit around and your ear on your
phone they're on Facebook they're
they're exchanging information via
Facebook and whatsapp and kind of
keeping in touch with with other
people's other friends movements which
sometimes can happen very quickly is
that like Facebook page to check where
is it online like how would you how
would you know the word love i hope i
have a big one of the various amendment
news it's just these refugees knew that
if they broke it would be very difficult
to replace them and they were such an
important element in their lives to make
sure that they had some sort of
connection to other people and you know
the world around them
there are a lot of people in the
official camps but there's also a lot of
people who are just kind of squatting at
different places in the city we found
networks of squats all over Athens there
were more than a dozen different squats
that were basically unused and abandoned
buildings that had been taken over by
different groups that then were able to
house refugees and a lot of them
actually had facebook groups or Twitter
handles partly because those squats are
illegal and so they needed to use those
different types of social media networks
to get out the message we went to this
hotel for for Refugees it's an abandoned
hotel called City Plaza they cook
everything they they have you know clean
sheets in their rooms and they they're
in hotel rooms that look similar to this
one I think this the most striking thing
was that these people were probably the
nicest people that I've met ever we did
end up being able to talk a lot to the
actual refugees who were all extremely
kind and friendly and open and willing
to talk to us they were just kind of
left in limbo living in tents with
minimal resources and no way to kind of
change their own situation so we came to
Greece to report on technology and its
role in all of this but after this trip
it's clear to me that tech is really
only a means to an end but really it's
it's all about people
