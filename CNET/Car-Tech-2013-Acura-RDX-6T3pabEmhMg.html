if you've seen the recent Avengers movie
this is an Acura now this is acura
smallest SUV the RDX up for the 2013
model year it's gotten bigger just a
little bit bigger prominent on this car
the 2013 model they made this more
subtle it used to be pointy stick out it
was really noticeable and you don't
really see a bumper here either
everything is molded neatly in place it
just kind of comes out from the side and
goes smoothly across the front a cure
changed the styling on the quarter panel
here it used to be much more vertical
now we have this nice contour in the
side graphic now we come back here
behind the car and where are the exhaust
pipes what happened to them well they're
actually hidden underneath here it's a
nice subtle premium element but now
let's go inside and check the tech from
all these buttons on the steering wheel
and on the center here not much has
changed with Acura with this technology
the maps are only in 2d but they look
good and if you really scroll down you
can actually see the outlines of
buildings in an area and I like this
interface - it's not bad we've got this
big knob here and it's easy to zoom out
or in now as you can see we've got the
Zagat listings the Zagat listings are
pretty detailed you actually get the
scores for the restaurant and you can
even go deeper and get into actually
comments about the restaurant so you can
really do a little digging here if you
don't want to pull out your phone and
look up Yelp Acura Honda's always had
great voice command and here it's taken
to a really good level so I've got an
iPhone hooked up to the car via the
white iPhone cable down here so if I
push the talk button iPod search play
album Fleetwood Mac but now here's the
thing that I don't like about this cabin
tech is you go back to the navigation
system you can see it shows traffic
information on here and that's really
useful but if I were to program a route
that went through that
EPIK it would have no problem just
sending me into the worst traffic
possible we also have the EOS audio
system in this car or space treble the
usual stuff and Acura puts this nice
little pattern that shows the speakers
around the car unless you tune the fader
the balance even the center channel and
the subwoofer there's 10 speakers it's a
really good sound accurate tries to make
the RDX look pretty sporty for example
we have this red engine start button
here we also have these sport paddles
here for manually shifting the six-speed
Automatic doesn't shift very fast so
you're not going to be really powering
down through the corners and down
shifting really fast because once you
try to hit one of these paddles of the
downshift you have to wait a little bit
for that ship to actually occur
under the hood we have a very different
engine than they used to find in the RDX
there used to be a 2.3 liter
four-cylinder with a turbocharger now we
have a 3.5 liter v6 the reason they went
to this bigger engine is because the
older one really wasn't a good
application to the car it never got
really good fuel economy even though
this is a bigger engine than the old
four-cylinder it actually gets decent
fuel economy the EPA ratings are 19
miles per gallon city 27 miles per
gallon highway
this v6 makes 273 horsepower and power
comes on pretty evenly - there's much
remarkable about the way the RDX drives
it's it's pretty easy to drive in fact
it works a lot like you'd expect of a
premium SUV you can jump in and just go
without really fuss or worry the ride
quality could be a little smoother
actually in decent roads it feels ok you
don't really notice much but then when
you're on when you get into some little
slight rough stuff some imperfections in
the road you really start to feel it a
little more than I would expect in a
premium level vehicle when I get into
the turns with this car it's actually
fairly stable the suspension is really
built and you know maybe that's one of
the trade-offs with getting feeling some
more of the the rough pavement it's not
a super fantastic handler though because
the all-wheel-drive system it has is
just Acuras really standard all-wheel
drive it's not they're super handling
all-wheel drive system and the
suspension is also it's just a fixed
suspension it's not a dynamic suspension
like they have in the MDX and RDX is
just not that vehicle you'll see a base
price for the 2013 acura RDX of about
$35,000 but now that's not the car you
want Acura puts all their technology in
a trim package so that's the Acura RDX
with tech that goes for about thirty
nine thousand dollars but it brings in
the navigation system Bluetooth phone
system the stereo that Els stereo system
you'll want all that and then you can
also bump up to all-wheel drive for
about forty thousand total now that's
hit or miss I mean
if you take the car out into the snow
and stuff like that you might want
thought wheel drive but if it's going to
be kind of a suburban runabout let's get
the front-wheel drive and you'll get
better gas mileage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
