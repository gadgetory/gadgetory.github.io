a look at the asuste ux32vd Savior
snickering about the name until later
this is part of these his zenbook line
which is there ultrabook line of laptops
the original zenbook was one of the
first generation of ultrabooks and was
really designed to compete with those
other early models and also the apple
macbook air probably the most popular
ultra-thin 13-inch laptop it was
perfectly fine but this latest version
the UX 32 is really advanced compared to
a lot of the other ultrabooks we've seen
it includes a lot of the features that
usually see stripped out I would go so
far as to call it very close to being an
ultrabook without compromise what does
that mean that means it's got an intel
core i7 cpu it's got a full 1080p screen
that's 1920 x 1080 that's a resolution
you very rarely see on a 13-inch laptop
and perhaps most importantly it has a
discrete NVIDIA GPU now it's only a 620
m GPU it's a pretty entry-level part but
I tried playing a whole bunch of games
on including recent ones like Skyrim and
I got reasonably playable results which
is not something you're likely to get on
most other ultrabooks you also get
backlit keyboard very important in a
slim travel laptop these days big click
pad similar to the ones we've seen on
earlier zenbook laptops from a sous but
it's really not a strong point here they
actually sent over last-minute driver
update to the touchpad made it a little
bit better more usable but you're still
not going to get anything really like
the responsiveness and then snappy feel
that you get from Apple and their
macbook touchpads I think that's an area
where really all of the ultrabooks need
to put in some extra effort in order to
catch shot now you do get multiple USB
3.0 ports which is great and even
multiple video ports this mini
DisplayPort and HDMI built in and you
get a external dongle for vga so
anything you want to connect this to you
pretty much can even the battery life
was pretty decent north and five hours
then here's the catch you're going to
pay a little bit more for all these
features this guy is 12 99 which is
maybe not a lot compared to a macbook
air but it is a lot more expensive
than most other ultrabooks but if you
need all those extra features and you
still want something that's relatively
slim and light and portable then I think
you're going to find this as a fairly
compromise free example of an ultrabook
i'm dan ackerman and that is the sous
