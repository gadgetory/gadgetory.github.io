Phoenix comm and today we've got a very
special first look at the Motorola Droid
for Verizon Wireless we just got the
thin and I'm just as excited as you are
to check out Verizon's first Android
phone so let's jump right to it let's
talk about the design first for what it
offers I'm really amazed at how thin the
smartphone is it's about the same size
as the iPhone 3GS a little bit blockier
and a little thicker but it's also got a
slide-out QWERTY keyboard so you really
have to appreciate it's only about a
couple hundreds of an inch thicker than
the iPhone the keyboard is pretty decent
it's got a d-pad here on the right side
so you can navigate around pages and
select items the buttons are a little
flat and small but it works for me since
I have smaller hands but I think uses
with larger thumbs might have some
issues but like anything else with time
you get used to it I think plus it's a
physical keyboard I'm one of those
people that have to have a physical
keyboard and can't go all touchscreen so
this is great
you do get virtual keyboards though in
both portrait and landscape mode so if
you're just punching out some quick
replies or text messages you couldn't
easily use those without having to open
the phone I think the real attention
grabber of the Droid is the display
though it measures 3.7 inches which is
bigger than the iPhones and even the HTC
Touch pro2 z-- and it's absolutely
vibrant and gorgeous with a 480 by 854
pixel resolution it's a capacitive touch
screen with a built-in accelerometer so
it'll change orientation when you rotate
the phone you can double tap on the
screen now to zoom in and out of
webpages but it's not like the iPhone or
pre where you can use the pinch gesture
to zoom it's still very sharp and
responsive and like other Android phones
you can customize three home panes with
different widgets and shortcuts for easy
access to your favorite apps some other
highlights of the design included 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on the top on
the right there's a dedicated camera
capture Kia while the 5 megapixel camera
is located on the back with a dual LED
flash last but not least there's a micro
SD card slot behind the battery cover
door and Verizon and Motorola are being
very generous by including a 16 gigabyte
card with the phone that's just a quick
overview of the
let's look at some of the featuresnow
motorola droid is the first smartphone
running android 2.0 this is the latest
version of Google's Android operating
system bring some great features for
example you now get native Microsoft
Exchange support for Outlook email and
calendar in addition to your Gmail and
pop3 and IMAP accounts the Droid also
now has a dedicated Facebook app and I
will put pull in all your contacts from
there as well as Gmail in exchange and
combine them in your address book so if
you've pull up a friend's contact card
you'll be able to see his or her
facebook status different email
addresses I am handles photos etc the
droids web browser also has some
improvements there support for visual
bookmarks as well as the multi tap to
mean that I mentioned earlier doesn't
have flashlight support but it does have
a plugin that will support Adobe Flash
10 player whenever that's available you
can connect via Wi-Fi / verizon EVDO Rev
a network and you can open multiple
windows which is always great another
new feature is Google Maps Navigation
this app is still in beta but it will
provide voice guided directions for free
as well as satellite views so you don't
have to pay a monthly subscription fee
for a location-based service like
Verizon's VZ Navigator
and in fact VZ Navigator isn't even
offered as an option on the Jordan since
I just got this phone I haven't been
able to test out the app but I'll
definitely cover it in my review so you
can check it for that
Topol of that you get the usual Android
functions that we've seen on previous
devices such as Google Marketplace which
has about 12,000 apps now support for an
Amazon mp3 store and a dedicated YouTube
app in the time that I've had it and
seen demos of the device has been really
impressed by the speed of the device and
the design of the phone is really
remarkable the only thing I would have
liked seeing is maybe some changes to
the music player maybe world roaming
capabilities but can't and I'll be doing
more in-depth coverage and analysis of
the Motorola Droid which you can check
out in our full review but I do have to
say that the Droid definitely looks very
promising and I think it'll do well for
Verizon
the Motorola Droid will be available
November 6th for one $99.99 with a
two-year contract I'm Bonnie time this
has been your first look at the motor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
