cnet.com and I'm going to give you a
quick video tour of the CAF m200 in-ear
headphone in case you've never heard of
kept it's a British company that makes
premium speakers that generally sound
really good those speakers tend to be a
bit pricey and some are very pricey but
now the company has made a foray into
the headphone market with two new models
the $200 M 200 I have here and the $300
M 500 and on-ear model frankly I had a
little bit of a hard time reviewing
these headphones as you can see they
have a pretty unique design they're
large for an in-ear model and that's
because they have two drivers jammed
into their aluminum housings the larger
10 millimeter driver is dedicated to low
frequencies and the smaller five point
five millimeter driver is dedicated to
highs and mids that's all great and the
headphones sound really good with
well-balanced rich detailed sound they
really are an audiophile headphone and
sound wise they can hold their own
against most in your headphones in this
price class but the fit was a problem
for me I have somewhat smaller ears and
the housing just wouldn't get past
certain parts of my ear so I couldn't
get the ear tubes jammed far enough into
my ears to get a tight seal while the
bendable arm keeps the headphones on and
in your ears it doesn't really help you
with that tight seal and when you don't
get a tight seal you end up losing a lot
of bass and the headphones quickly go
from sounding great to sounding not so
great I had a few other quibbles I
thought that buttons on the inline
remote were a little small and when I
use the headphones outside the wind
seemed to reverberate through the
aluminum housings more than your typical
smallish in-ear headphones which tend to
hide inside your ear more and perhaps
find a little more shelter from the wind
but the fit was my real gripe and I'm
not sure why company spent all this time
designing special drivers and housings
and then neglect to get the ear tips
right sure some people will be able to
get a good fit with the included tips
but I tried these earphones out with a
few other people and they all had a hard
time getting a tight seal my solution
was to try out a few sets of longer tips
that came with other earphones I've
tested and I did find a set that allowed
me to get a tight sea
the sound was night and day as I said
these can really sound great and they're
a pleasure to listen to if you get that
proper fit they might not have quite
enough bass for some folks who like a
ton of bass but I really like their
clean well-balanced sound I suspect that
in time kept will provide a wider
selection of ear tips with these
headphones will help more people get a
better and more count will fit when the
designers get that ear tip equation
right these have the potential to be a
four-star product but as it stands
they're fit and comfort level holds them
back a bit that's a shame because they
really do sound excellent if you can get
a tight seal I'm David Carr noise and
those are the kept em 200 in your
headphones thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
