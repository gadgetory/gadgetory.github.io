look at the asuste transformer book this
looks like a fairly standard ultrabook
style 13-inch laptop but because it has
the word transform in the name you're
not going to be surprised when I grab
the screen like this and just lift the
entire thing off because it's one of
these laptops that becomes a tablet we
usually call it as a hybrid now this is
a little bit different than a lot of the
other hybrids that we've seen because a
lot of the other hybrids are very low
power systems this is actually a intel
core i7 system so it's a fairly powerful
laptop and it has a 128 gig SSD hard
drive in the screen where most of the
components are but then a second 500 gig
standard hard drive in the base where
the keyboard is so that lets you store
lots of movie files maybe video game
install files all kinds of big stuff
here in the face but just have the
smaller tablet to take with you you know
when you're on the go and you'll have to
access all that other information I
think it's a brilliant idea and I'm
surprised that more of these hybrids
have not done that although a few other
models like that are coming out pretty
soon you also get a secondary battery in
the base although it may not really
increase your battery life that much
because you're driving the extra hard
drive the keyboard and the ports and
everything from it you've also got a
screen here that's different than what
we've seen a lot of the other hybrids it
fits sort of the high-end price they're
asking for this transformer book here
it's a 1920 x 1080 screen which is
fantastic and of course it's got that
core i7 to drive it and then when you're
using Windows 8 it's really great to
have that HD screen especially if you're
streaming HD movies that I may be
playing games although this machine
doesn't have a discrete graphics card so
it's not a super gaming machine but you
can do some casual gaming on it now of
course you put all that together and
they're asking about fourteen hundred
dollars for this which is a lot more
than something like the HP Envy x2 or
some of the other less expensive hybrids
that we've seen but it does add a lot of
the high-end features I'd like to see in
one of these if they can get the
touchpad a little bit better maybe get
the keyboard to be a little bit less
flexi and just maybe make Windows 8 a
little bit better at switching between
orientations when you move the screen
vertically and horizontally then they
really could be
something I've been a commit and that is
the asuste transformer book</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
