I like about it is it doesn't look too
concept they're telling us here this is
kind of where production is going to go
for real now what you can't see here
until we look in the cabin is some new
technologies for autonomy what this car
will have an advanced technology for
self parking beyond today today you have
to work the pedals while the car works
the wheel and does all the sensing in
the future not too long from now they
think this carl park itself including
operating accelerator brakes steering
and sensing you might not even be in the
car you might just push a button on your
phone and say go park yourself the next
thing is collision avoidance and
innovation there where the car will do
more than just break to avoid an impact
ahead it may also steer to veer around
it one more thing if you look at the
steering wheel there when that's in
production this may be a high variable
ratio gearbox where the ratio is so high
that even a u-turn or parking requires
only a partial turn of the wheel no more
spinning it round and round like in the
old days aka today now Ford's
envisioning nuts there's lots of screens
but big screens you see some tablets
here in the back and also a center
tablet hooked up there in the center
console up front sizes will be getting
larger pushing around 10 inches or so
and you can bet that myford touch will
be heavily revised by then as well it's
been a bit of a thorn on the side now
with all this cabin tech and all this
new styling tells you is that they're
pushing a premium message in this sector
it's not the only car company doing that
but they also want this to be a global
cars but a big deal during Alan
Mulally's Ford is to build one car for
the world the idea here is this guy
would roll out with minimal changes to
the u.s. to China maybe to the Russian
market everywhere so they're not
building so many versions and therefore
can focus on putting more innovation in
there and getting a return on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
