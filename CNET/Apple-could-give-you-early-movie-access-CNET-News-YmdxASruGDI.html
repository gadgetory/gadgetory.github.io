may soon be watching the latest
box-office hits from the comfort of your
own couch while they're still in
theaters according to a Bloomberg report
Apple is currently in negotiations with
Hollywood's big hitters like 21st
Century Fox Warner Brothers and
universal pictures to make movies
available to stream within weeks of
their theatrical release studios have
been hesitant to release movies in these
platforms while they're still in
theaters for fear of bootlegging which
could seriously hurt sales but if
they're able to work out a deal with
Apple this could mean a major win for
the Cupertino company and a needed boost
for iTunes sales they'd have a huge head
start on the competition including
services like on demand cable amazon
video or HBO which can take anywhere
from three to eight months to make new
movies available to stream the cost for
early access between 25 and fifty
dollars according to Bloomberg's report
that's about five times the cost of a
new release rental on itunes now
considering you currently only get 24
hours of stream this is a pretty hefty
price tag but don't give up your movie
theater tickets quite yet Apple has
declined to comment on the Bloomberg
report and has yet to negotiate a
similar deal for access to TV and movie
content for Apple TV which it's been
working on for months so this could
still be a long wait and for more of the
