way into all sorts of gadgets and you
can build some smart gadgets yourself
with new google aiy kits google's aiy
vision kit lets you build a camera that
can detect faces and emotions so it
knows when you're smiling the camera
also has a face tracker to lock on to a
subject it can also be programmed to
recognize certain objects it processes
this info on its own without talking to
the cloud and it comes with a Raspberry
Pi zero WH microcomputer and other
accessories to start programming right
away this is a follow up to Google's
voice kit that came out last year it
lets you experiment with voice
recognition you program what words you
want it to recognize and connect it to
something that you want to control
motors lights even a train both kits are
sold at Target the vision kit is roughly
$90 and the voice kit is about 50 bucks
these kids arrive just as chip makers
are starting to talk more about putting
AI processors into more mid-range phones
and laptops so it's not just the
high-end stuff that's getting new tricks
you're gonna see more security cameras
that can be smart enough to only act
when it notices something strange
instead of recording a constant stream
of video and smart speakers with AI
chips will be able to do a better job of
understanding your commands faster
drones can be better at avoiding
obstacles or following a moving subject
processors themselves are not getting
that much faster but AI is giving
processors new quick thinking smarts
that may give you a reason to upgrade
