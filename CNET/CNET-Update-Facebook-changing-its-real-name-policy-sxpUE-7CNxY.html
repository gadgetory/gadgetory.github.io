game and Siri can now be installed in
your car stereo I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update facebook is
updating its real name policy to allow
people to go by stage names or
pseudonyms rather than their legal birth
names facebook always had a policy that
required people to use their real names
on the network the reason being using a
real name cuts down on acts of violence
harassment and scams to other members
but that policy drew fire recently from
the LGBT community drag queen performer
accounts for warned that they'd be
suspended from facebook if they kept
using stage names instead of real names
this all started when an individual
targeted several hundred performer
accounts and reported them as fake names
so then Facebook follows up on the
reports and starts cracking down on
hundreds of performers requiring that
they submit a form of government issued
ID well after several days of public
outcry Facebook apologized and said it
would work on a new way for accounts
that don't use birth names to prove that
they are still authentic users this is
an issue that goes beyond performers
some people don't feel safe using their
real names such as domestic violence
survivors or refugees from other
countries and sometimes people just
don't want to be found easily like a
school teacher that doesn't want their
account to befriended by students
obviously not everyone with a pseudonym
is out to scam somebody but of course
there is plenty of fraud online which
takes us to the next story Apple has a
new online tool to help you avoid buying
a stolen iPhone you can check the
activation lock status of an iPhone iPad
or iPod Touch you just type in the
serial number on the website and in
return Apple tells you if the activation
lock is turned on or off and if it's on
that means the password from the
original owner is still required and you
won't be able to use that phone so
before buying a used device on
Craigslist or Ebay the seller should
give you the serial number you can find
it in settings make sure the lock is off
before you hand over the cash also in
the world of Apple if you want to
experience carplay you don't need to
wait to buy a new car Pioneer has the
first car stereos that work with carp
so you can install the dashboard system
in existing cars a new model called the
app radio for cost six hundred dollars
and features a 6.2 inch touchscreen but
there are several other existing models
that can get carplay by installing a
firmware update carplay gives drivers
hands-free Siri voice command controls
for music and other apps it works with
iOS 7.1 running on an iPhone 5 or newer
model that's your tech news update you
