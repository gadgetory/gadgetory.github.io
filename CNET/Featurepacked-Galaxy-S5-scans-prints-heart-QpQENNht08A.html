the Samsung Galaxy s5 to really make a
statement but with this phone samsung
plays it safe I'm Jessica dual-core from
cnet here at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona I'm going to give you a very
quick tour now this phone has a 5.1 inch
Super AMOLED display that's 1080p
full-hd not the 2k plus display that
some people were hoping for the design
does come in four different colors this
is the electric blue color that I've got
right now it will also come in charcoal
black shimmery white and a copper gold
color now not every market is going to
get every color but it is nice to see
this bright vibrant shade there's a bit
of a different design element on the
back it kind of looks like small little
depressions or dimples in the coding but
it pretty much looks the same as the
galaxy s4 with the steep sort of silvery
sides and just about the same shape now
there is a fingerprint scanner in here
it is integrated into this oblong home
button here there is also a heart rate
monitor on the back that is integrated
into this flash module paypal has an
agreement with Samsung so that in
addition to taking your heart rate you
can also use this as a way to make
secure mobile payments Samsung does bump
up the camera to 16 megapixels on the
back there's front-facing camera as well
inside you've got a 2.5 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor that's
quad-core so it's going to be pretty
speedy the phone will also come in 16
gigabyte and 32 gigabyte capacities
depending on the market we don't have
pricing availability or markets yet that
you can guess that it is going to be
worldwide it will probably cost about
the same as last year's model so those
looking for a really big splash with the
Samsung Galaxy s5 you're not really
going to get it apart from the
fingerprint scanner in the front and the
heart rate monitor in the back overall
though it does look like a nice phone
just not a lot of surprises I'm tussock

the samsung galaxy s5 read our full
impressions as soon
