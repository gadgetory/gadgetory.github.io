internet and television services I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the next evolution of television
is here with sling TV the twenty dollar
a month internet television service
streams 11 networks including ESPN CNN
TNT and Disney to watch you'll need a
hearty broadband internet connection you
can view it on your television using a
Roku or Amazon fire TV device or watch
on your Android or iOS phone and tablet
as well as a mac or pc computer it'll be
available soon on the Xbox one the
chromecast and other smart TVs we got
the chance to test it out and there are
some perks and drawback to this new
television service from dish most
channels won't let you rewind or pause
live TV there are some shows you can
watch on demand but there's no recording
shows you also can only watch it on one
device at a time so you can't share
accounts with other people there's no
contract so you can try it out and
cancel anytime if you want a few more
channels there will be these add-on
packs that cost five bucks such as a
sports extra pack but there are no
details about that yet the first batch
of sling invites come out Tuesday for
people who pre-register and it will be
available to everyone in the US by
februari 9th if you've been thinking
about cutting your cable subscription
bill this may work for you since you
still get some news and sports that's
not the only big change in television
the National Football League launched a
YouTube channel that includes game
previews highlights and postgame recaps
along with other clips from the NFL
network also when you do a Google search
for a game you'll be seeing video
highlights pop right up on the google
search page you won't be able to stream
the Super Bowl on YouTube but you can
stream the game and the halftime show
from the NBC website and mobile app it's
free you don't even need to prove that
you pay for cable or satellite TV as we
get new ways to watch cable TV cable
vision is offering a new type of cell
phone service you may have seen
commercials that tease the service
called free wheel it's a Wi-Fi only
mobile phone service that costs thirty
dollars a month and you get unlimited
calling text
data its launching next month if you
already have Cablevision's optimum for
your home internet this additional
mobile service costs ten dollars a month
cablevision is stitching together more
than 1 million optimum customer Wi-Fi
home routers and using them as hot spots
to create this network but it's only
working with one smartphone you have to
buy Motorola's Moto G from freewheel for
a hundred dollars and it comes
programmed to connect to the hot spots
but if there's no Wi-Fi you have no
service that's your tech news update you
can stay updated at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
