the known universe until next Thursday
I'm Ashley Scott
I'm Jeff kanata don't be worried about
the universe it's us that's going away
but we have something cool coming we do
but right now what's coming is headlines
I thought that was what the cool thing
was but if you're addicted to getting
tattoos maybe just maybe you could
consider getting a tattoo from a robot
to French designers are currently in
residence at Pier 9 in San Francisco and
this is one of their creations teaching
an industrial robot arm to tattoo human
skin isn't exactly easy you'd have to
make a model of the area of the skin to
be tattooed designed the actual tattoo
art on that model and then let the robot
get to work did we mention the recipient
needs to be restrained to keep their
body still obviously this would be huge
for tattoo shops who want robots to
complete simple designs for clientele
but we aren't sure whether we are ready
to strap ourselves down for some fresh
ink from a robot or not well I guess if
robots are doing surgery I might as well
let them do this here those little
mustaches on hipsters their fingers
that's oh man sees all right all that
robots do the simple stuff and the stuff
that tattoo artists hate doing right
there
listen there's some tattoo artists out
there that watch the show you know
exactly what I'm talking about
the little arrows on people's fears and
like the the semicolons like don't do
that some Joker is gonna have a robot
tattoo a barcode on him and it'll be
like a heartbeat it'll be carrying that
out exactly I'm a big fan of electric
cars but this electric car it's got some
pizzazz meet the Nissan blade glider
this was unveiled as a concept a few
years ago and now Nissan is showing off
a working prototype it seats three
people with reverse butterfly doors that
spread open like flapping wings the
seating is designed like a triangle with
the driver in the center front while two
passengers can sit side by side in the
back based on battery size and motor
ability it looks like the range could be
around over a hundred mile
miles making it a unique looking option
for electric car enthusiasts in the
future no release date or pricing yet
but we're curious to see how the blade
glider evolves as it nears commercial
release I just want to be able to say
they're like what kind of car is that
it's a blade glider yeah fine it's no
big deal it just sounds so cool
it does sound super cool if if I'm the
fourth guy who can't fit in the car
and I have to juggle aside it I'm the
Blade Runner Oh played runners the thing
that is the most perfect joke I've ever
heard my life like I love I'm not proud
of it much you should I was really
entertained um what do you think we
should talk about on Thursday there's
kind of both really good choices I kind
of I kind of feel like the audience is
gonna have more to say about rowboat ads
okay I I think you guys should use the
hashtag hey TD on Twitter and tell us
what tattoo you would get if a robot was
giving it yeah what is the perfect robot
tattoo and we'll think about it - and
will - all talk about it on Thursday
we'll reconvene during our deep dive
episode well um so that being said it is
now time for our phone talker for the
day today's phone talker for the day is

galaxy s7 edge yeah Jay wrote to us and
