weightless thanks for quality 95.7 the
party station Congrats you just won two
free tickets to see dope running out of
battery sucks but carrying a charger
around means you have to find a nearby
plug which option wedges you between two
trash cans and forces other people to
literally look down on you and sure
there are portable battery packs but
that can be like carrying a brick around
in your pocket another option is a phone
case which has a battery built-in so you
can protect and charge your phone at the
same time while they definitely add more
heft consolidating these two devices is
still convenient when you're on the go
if you're thinking about buying one
there are a few things to keep in mind
first the extra bulk I mentioned often
means that your phone's buttons and
ports are harder to access your earbuds
might not reach the headphone jack
either and a lot of companies include
headphone extenders for this very reason
the extenders aren't the best looking
things around but it's unfortunately
necessary if you want to listen to your
music and phone calls second if you have
an iPhone which uses a proprietary 8 pin
lightning port to charge you'll have to
carry two cords most iPhone charging
cases use micro USB so unless you get
Apple's own smart battery case which
also has the a pin connection you're
going to have to deal with this minor
inconvenience third look for a case that
has an on/off switch and a battery
indicator most have this and they're
very practical a power button lets you
control exactly when you want to juice
up your device and it prevents
overcharging an indicator lets you know
if your case has enough reserves to
power up your phone throughout the day
lastly know that there are a variety of
battery cases to choose from depending
on your needs Mophie was one of the
earliest companies to jump on this
market and while it's Juice Pack plus is
a bit pricey it's solidly designed and
includes a big 3.3 ampere-hour battery
if you have an active lifestyle or
you're just kind of a klutz
something like OtterBox is durable
resurgence power case might work for you
and if you're on the lookout for
something slimming affordable in scipios
off-grid Express is a good value and
gives your iPhone a full charge
whatever you choose a case that protects
and charges your phone is undoubtedly
useful and who knows the next time
you're in a pinch it could save you from
having another complete meltdown in your
car color 95
oh no folks looks like color 95 is
missing out on the opportunity of a
lifetime let's go to color 96</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
