all like headphones but if you listen to
loud for too long they can cause hearing
loss but you still gotta block out the
world around you so you wear these
heroes sound labs BTW 5200 headphones
there on ear bluetooth headphones with
soft padding to help block out
environment noise but they're also tuned
for better sound at lower volume with a
nice warm sound quality and satisfying
base and if you do decide to crack them
up an LED on the ear cup tips you off if
you start listening at unsafe levels
green when you're at 85 decibels or less
yellow one year between 85 and 95 and
red when you're over 95 decibels and on
your way to hearing damage you have to
take them off to know for sure but at
least you can find out and you can
choose to be healthy or live on the edge
assuming you consider listening to loud
music edgy anyway the bt 52 hundreds can
be used wired or wireless for up to
about 24 hours and are pretty
comfortable but if you wear them for a
few hours straight you might find the
pressure on your ears a bit much they're
otherwise very good for the price of
around a hundred dollars and you can
also get a version for kids the $80 BTW
22 hundreds that are limited to 85
decibels or less so you can protect the
hearing of your whole family for when
they're not wearing headphones
