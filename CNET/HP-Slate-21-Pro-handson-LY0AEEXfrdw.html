of the more interesting PC products and
HP is putting out here is the HP Slate
21 pro now we're seeing Android and
Windows combined in some products asus
getting into it now this is not a
Windows computer but it is a 21.5 inch
Android all in one that does happen to
act as a pc monitor all you have to do
is double tap here and click again and
now it's going to mirror and show it's
on your Windows PC now it's got HDMI
input and USB throughput as well now
it's also since it's an Android all in
one it's got a quad-core Tegra 4
processor it's got 16 gigs of flash
storage it's also got Ethernet it's got
Wi-Fi it's got bluetooth it's got a
webcam and there's an optical touch
display here that's 1080
that's 1080p so you're getting that for
399 and remember this also comes with a
keyboard and mouse
pretty good package if you're interested
in Android all in one and there are some
business features of software as well
including Kingsoft free office and the
ability to connect with Citrix so that's
a look at the way that maybe Android is
being targeted to kiosks and small
businesses but still function as a
monitor
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at an
HP Slate 21 pro at CES 2014
