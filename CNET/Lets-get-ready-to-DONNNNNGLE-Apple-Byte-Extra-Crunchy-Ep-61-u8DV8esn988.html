San Francisco California it's the apple
byte extra crunchy podcast with your
host mr. Bryant on the top guy type top
guy you hear me you hear me plane that
actual introduction on my keyboard my
Erick Aybar air keyboard a betta betta
Peppa I like this gestures oh that's the
classic one that's the classic what's up
everybody welcome the album white extra
crunchy its episode 61 we're gonna jump
right into it we know what you're all
here for we want to break down and talk
a little bit more about apple's new
macbook pros we saw the keynote and I've
got one thing to say before we start the
show you know what it is beat him no
let's get ready to dongle
oh I got it from the mound I could have
got I could have gone longer but I
wanted to spare the people that are
actually listening this with headphones
it's free i could have gone honestly
maybe another i might do it you know
i'll do it at the very end of the show
we'll see maybe you could tie me to see
how long i can actually hold that das
impressive it's a pretty pretty big
dongle a pretty long dong so long that's
a lot that's a long dong tanggal all
right so look we have the new macbook
pros yes they've got some great at least
power improvements from the previous one
more time about fifty percent roughly
depending on the configuration about a
fifty percent speed increase twice as
fast graphics increased flash
performance but the big thing there's
there's a couple Bugaboos here
especially in the pro side I think that
again before I go off on this I do want
to say that the macbook pro if you're in
the market for an actual new macbook pro
and you're looking for a speed upgrade
and you've owned previous macbook pros
this is going to be a really nice update
it's gonna be a great upgrade for you
from a processor standpoint but i think
also though if you're super professional
looking for more you might be a little
frustrated with this machine and the
reason why I say that is one of the
biggest complaints is that it's it tops
out at 16 gigs of RAM you can't put more
ram inside the machine I than that I
mean do you know how much RAM are you
running on some of your machines for
audio production Beach I'd a lot the
more than 16 yes way more than 16 most I
can't remember this is like years and
years ago yeah I'm I know it's a lot so
that that's a big frustration in the you
know from the pro side and I think that
when you look at this machine it tells
you a few things about what Apple has
now been thinking we've always talked
about making machines thinner and
slimmer it feels like to me that they're
starting to say you know we're gonna
make everything thinner and smaller and
yes that's sexy but i don't think that
serves their pro audience no no no
actually yesterday I saw a lot of people
saying you know apples making putting
the word pro on the end of everything
but it's not a pro is that it ain't pro
that ain't right they prolly ain't pro
so yeah I mean like it's just a moniker
now it's like let's put pro and
everything I totally agree with that the
thing about this is great design right
but again an obsession of making things
them winner when is a pro machine just
because you have for us bc ports doesn't
mean it's a pro machine now let's talk
about these ports let's talk about what
you lose basically when you get this new
macbook pro compared to previous macbook
pros all right fine we have these for us
bc 3 sorry us bc / thunderbolt three
ports but they got rid of the magsafe
adapter we knew that but it doesn't mean
that makes anyone feel any better
there's no hdmi there's no SD card slot
if you wanted to I did the math a little
earlier we feature this in the actual
video podcast show that's coming out
later today if you add up all the
dongles that you're going to need okay
you'll need most likely a USB see the
current on the macbook pro to a regular
standard rectangular USB you'll probably
need at least one of those if you're a
pro person you probably have some sort
of Thunderbolt 2 hard drive you're going
to need a thunderbolt adapter a lot of
times guess what ethernet still Jeter
net drops are still going to be faster
than Wi-Fi so you'll probably need an
ethernet one this is the work this is
one of the most offensive ones to me how
do you connect your iphone or ipad
hardwired to your new macbook pro you
have to get a USB see the lightning
adapter cable you can't even change
thirty dollars you can't even plug it
into the computer directly and I know
there's Wi-Fi sinking I know this but
when when I actually want to back up my
my iphone and ipad i just plug it
directly in i'm i'm having a hard time
wrapping that around my head right now
because i haven't heard that yet yeah
you didn't look like you know that that
it blows my mind it it's my it's my
boggling it boggles my mind to the the
good thing is they kept the headphone
jack but you're taking away so much and
guess what was the motivation to make
this a better performing machine to a
certain extent right these Thunderbolt
three ports are a lot faster but really
you know why they put the four USBC port
center to make this thing thinner yeah
also also I feel like that you have to
buy all of apple's dongles and there you
know there are other displays and stuff
like that
so I again that there there's there are
going I'm gonna talk about a few the
benefits but that but that is a little
bunk to me I added up all those dongles
and if you wanted to there's a company
called griffin technology that makes
this really cool thing called the break
safe it's basically bre AK safe it's
basically their USBC magsafe adapter so
they've created their own magsafe
adapter because guess what Apple got rid
of it on the super ultra thin macbook
12-inch I think another issue that
people are gonna face and I'm gonna I
think you're going to hear about this a
lot more is people aren't going to like
the new keyboard feel ya keyboard is so
important like I mean you have to be
comfortable and be able to type fast and
have a place to rest your hands yeah and
I'm gonna be honest when we were here
doing the live show someone's like oh I
like the new keyboard of new I'm like
trust me use it for more than five
minutes and then tell me if you really
like it like sure it's super thin they
have the whole butterfly mechanism but
there's a certain feel of the depth of
hitting keys and actually feeling that
basically feeling that they're going
down more I like the current feel I'm
not a fan personally and I still haven't
been able to get used to it of that 12
inch macbook keyboard it's it's just
really shell it just feels different and
for those of you that don't know we'll
know I actually would love to hear from
people that on that either enjoy the new
keyboard or dislike it if you guys can
call us i forgot to give us the number
at the top of show so you don't binge do
that what is that number just kidding 1
800 61 62 63 8 will make sure to say
anything on the show for you guys to
call guys and gals to call and give us
your thoughts so it's there's a lot of I
think if you if the pro pro users were
happy with the specs across the board
they would be okay with it being thinner
but by being thinner it really took away
it also battery life it's the same it's
basically the same battery life as a
previous generation that's sure yeah so
um it went when I first saw the image of
the keyboard during the event yesterday
it looks like it's like sunk in you know
like it's it's almost like lower profile
yeah it's like lowered down inside the
laptop and that looks kind of funny to
me i was looking at
9 and my keyboards are or my keys are
raised up on my laptop so yeah it's
gonna definitely take some getting used
to the funny thing about is we still
haven't even some some people will lead
with the touch bar but I didn't want to
lead with the touch bar because i think
the touch bar is TBD like it's really
still to be determined how useful that
thing is going to be and I'm not going
to poo poo on it I'm gonna keep an open
mind about it I'm not going to use it
I'm not going to be someone who uses it
for five minutes says this is amazing I
think it's great eye candy I think the
touch bar looks immediately what I
thought you liked it this is eye candy
it's like a bell and whistle kind of
thing you know and Apple has their own
thoughts of why they put the touch part
there so we were able to actually talk
to Craig federighi on-site with our
reporters and really apple doesn't have
a touch screen product so what we want
to do is really kind of set up okay well
are you got why aren't you making
anything with like for example like a
touch screen mac or anything like that
so um do you have a cute up right now
yep okay so let's hear what we owe it
what Craig federighi had to say in
response to just the touch bar as a
whole we all do a lot of powerful work
all day on our macs and our hands can be
super productive right there with the
trackpad with the keyboard and so that's
where when we look at providing more
controls that's where we want them right
where you're right where your hands are
right at your fingertips if you're on
the keyboard you tend to want to stay on
the keyboard if you're on the trackpad
or using a mouse you tend to want to
stay on that mouse and so having your
hands on the keyboard and having just
without even lifting your hand to be
able to reach a control just right in
front of you we saw the opportunity with
the function key strip being really
something that's a throwback to the past
and the legacy to instead create an area
that was so useful and so powerful and
that really provided the controls
contextually that were most relevant to
what you were doing at any given time
and so when the technology came together
with a multi-touch display that we could
actually engineer into that space and
into this expression exposure you know
our eyes really got got very wide as to
what we can make what we can make happen
there the touch bar yeah also looks so
that's the thing you know when I look so
here's the thing when i look at the
touch barn i look at the function keys
I'm like oh I move my hand up higher to
get to some of these functions
weird way I wonder if it would have
actually been easier to put it on the
row below the spacebar yeah you know
like because it would still be flush
with like look at the space yeah your
trackpad yeah total keyboard yes I mean
when I look at it now I'm like man would
it just be easier to put it there and if
it had some sort of at least ability if
there was palm rejection on it or to
know that you're not doing deliberate a
finger touches maybe that's probably one
of the issues like any time you swipe at
it or brush it it'll do something but it
almost would be more accessible to be
right in that space I totally agree and
you know like thinking about it more and
more I'm like why don't they have a
touchscreen on a Mac you know and like
the trackpad is almost a touchscreen in
itself yeah so that makes a lot more
sense to me and having that thing up
there you are going to move your hand up
there to do stuff I think you will it
will become natural you know because
having a touchscreen laptop like it is
naturally kind of like there's lots of
big buttons on their arm there are and
occasional just one instead of like
navigating your trackpad with your mouse
to find that button and then push it you
just reach up and go boom yeah you know
I mean yeah it's a lot faster so I
understand them putting the thing there
but I'm still kind of like put a
touchscreen on there you guys make the
ipad and it's like the best best touch
screen in the world and i think the
elephant in the room is the fact that
apple has not created any kind of hybrid
OS that is works universally whether
you're a tablet or a laptop and i know
that they have their philosophies in
their way of thinking like we don't want
these to be the same in a weird way I
think also they put a touchscreen on max
that would cannibalize their actual ipad
sales instead where instead of but then
you look at other companies like and
we'll talk about them a little bit like
Microsoft who just blew us away with
their keynote just a day or two before
app a day before apples and I've used
plenty of those products and I haven't
been able to jump over yet because guess
what apples ecosystem has me locked in
mm-hmm but damn those are amazing
products and they that's so cool when
you use them and you come from it the
Apple side you're just like Apple why
don't you just do this the invaders or
they could do it the other thing about
the touch bar that during the demo of
the keynote they had a few examples of
pro apps and they showed a final cup
Pro they showed off a DJ using up the
first thing that we saw and we felt is
like no one's going there like look at
your timeline and scrub through it the
person who demoed it was staring
directly at their keyboard pressing
their finger and glided they won't even
look into the screen no one edits a
video like that yeah no one else video
so I'm trying to find the part of the
minutes it's hard it's hard i mean it's
deep in there like if you there's the DJ
that doesn't look at all like that
doesn't look that you're on this like
tiny little strip like nah come on yes
you're you're gonna use your you're
gonna still bring your turntables to do
all that definitely definitely so when
it comes to kinda morbid I think
Photoshop has some great uses you know
just changing the colors and sizes that
makes sense to me that's cool yeah and
it's going to come it's going to be very
contextual what apps you use it for what
apps you don't we will it's I think the
jury is still out on the touch bar and
again it's interesting to hear Apple
talk about it like they are the first to
do it because a couple years ago lenovo
had that prop this product called the x1
carbon they did at first it the tech it
was just basically like the keys on this
bar that replaced the function bar could
change but is very basic it wasn't like
you had anything to do with senior photo
collection or colors or palette it was
basically you know specific buttons
within apps and it would change apples
basically putting this on steroids right
now with the touch bar but again it's
gonna be interesting to see cuz its high
carbon right here I think yeah but
because i feel like when i watch this
thing and then when i also look I mean
we're jumping all over the place when I
look at the price of the macbook pros
when you compare them to last year's
birthday they didn't stay the same price
overall the price points jumped
basically two hundred dollars higher and
so to me that kind of tells me that OLED
bar that touch bar is roughly around
maybe a two-hundred-dollar difference to
put in the hardware so then what was
interesting as Apple offered multiple
versions of this macbook pro they
offered to 13 inch versions one without
a touch bar one with a touch bar and
then they offered the 15-inch macbook
pro with a touch bar it's it would I
know they would not have done this but I
would have been really cure
race if they offered a macbook pro
15-inch without a touch bar as an option
for two hundred dollars less I us why
I'm curious how many people would
actually be like you know what I I think
I'll just get the one without the touch
bar like I'm really curious about that
you know yeah so is is it there's more
to this I'm just cool though it doesn't
clip it is like super eye candy it's
super cool thing about Apple too as they
make stuff it looks cool and you're like
I gotta have that even though it's like
might not have the best specs whatever I
will it looks cool and also like
watching people use it it's very it
looks fast yeah it looks super lots of
it looks like basically playing on like
your iPhone or your iPad so again the
jury's out the touch bar I think it's
really cool but I just don't know if I'm
gonna end up using it that much uh I'm
not in the market for a laptop right now
and a lot of times i like i love it when
Apple shows me something and I say to
myself dude I gotta have that even
though I'm not in the market but I
actually didn't feel that way about this
laptop yeah me neither i'm just hoping
that we get to do a work upgrade with
her laptop spells I talked to I think I
talked to RIT too far IT department on
our work computers i will tell you the
sad fact is that if you have your
computer like somewhere on three or four
years you're eligible for an upgrade but
the only computers available will not be
the new ones ah and if you want to get
one the new ones they'll charge your
department which they will not they went
oh man so if you really want one you got
to get one yourself but okay starting at
I think what 1799 for the 13-inch good
luck oh and that's a villa 5chip not an
i7 good luck we good good luck with that
good luck just one more thing also we're
talking about a lot of some of the
things that can't do and I know we're
jumping around so we might miss some
topic points please we want to hear what
you all think about the macbook pros
call us at one eight hundred 61 62 63
leave your name where you're from and
just don't just jump into it with us the
thing though that the macbook pro
15-inch does do that is new is that
because of its prowess to be able to
push out better graphics possibility you
know better graphics capabilities
through the Thunderbolt 3 the new
15-inch MacBook Pro supports for 4k
displays or
25 k displays simultaneously that's
intense that's that's pretty beasty yeah
now Apple did make the announcement uh
that they were releasing if they were
making displays in partnership with LG
and if you go to the actual apple store
on their website they calm like the LG
ultra fine display you can look it up
the thing about it is therefore K
display I believe they're selling it for
699 but I will tell you right now you
can get pretty darn good 4k displays for
four hundred dollars on the market Wow
now I even type in like 5k display I'm a
sure it'll show up as what there you go
there's there's there's some of them the
5k display I believe is it to all 99
okay and I'm gonna tell you right now
what size is that doesn't say I can't
remember is it a 27 I can't click on it
it's got it'll say 27 is it 27 you can
get like a 40 inch 4k TV for like four
hundred dollars not that look but the
funny thing about these displays which I
always enjoyed is people that may not
know I used to work in apple retail way
back in the day when they first opened
there you know is one of Steve Jobs
stores we've talked about in past shows
but I can't tell you how many customers
were just rich ask people didn't even
look at like what else is available is
like oh you guys got a 5k display how
much is that 1299 I'll take two does it
have an apple logo on it well I'll take
two can we grow up through thanks is it
pretty good yeah I'll take two sweet
kill thanks wait is it Oh sir but it's
not Christmas i know it's april i just
wanted to get I'm just guys just guys so
uh that that's going on there Alex it
has some powerful capabilities there's
also been some other reports I won't get
into it in too much depth but basically
look the apple 15-inch MacBook Pro has a
discrete graphics card so for those of
you that are wondering okay what's the
advantage of discrete graphics card it's
basically you can have an integrated
graphics card that's part of basically
your whole kind of package deal with
built in the machine a discrete graphics
card is a dedicated one that will handle
more of the high-end graphics whether
it's gaming whether it's video stuff but
according to reports based on the power
of the am
the car that is an option for these it's
not you don't expect to do any really
major gaming on the macbook pro yeah
that's I heard Danny a camera and saying
that you're not gonna be able to play
like any hi res gain or anything like
that even if you customize the macbook
pro with the highest a AMD card it's
based on the reports it could
comfortably push out a 1080p 60 frames
per second image you know when it comes
to gaming but nothing beyond that and
there's so much more stuff out there so
it'll be interesting again to see like
when this is these are called use the
word pro like it you got to bring more
to the table than that yeah just have to
so um that'll be very interesting just
overall to see as time goes on how these
are received I don't think these are
lemons but I think that these MacBook
Pros have flaws for being called a
macbook pro definitely and then and we
have this this video right here and he's
like in like what looks to be like a
professional studio there's like a pro
camera you know pro speakers and stuff
but i don't think anyone you know we
might use it to like cut some little
like short video or something they'll be
interesting to see ya yeah i mean you a
fake it until you make it yeah I'm pro I
got it I got a cannon I got a can of 5d
oh yeah yeah I'm pro I'm so pro alright

I appreciate it yeah they're big around
here man they're huge they're everywhere
everywhere so I wanted to touch upon a
few other things when we talk about the
macbook pros look we brushed aside kind
of the fact that Microsoft went ham hard
as ammo you know what nice hard ham ham
ham and it it just I was my mind was
genuinely blown by that Microsoft studio
product that desktop that pushes down
that can become like a drafting board a
table board and this is something I
tweeted out right I said look look how
things have changed these days Microsoft
is now targeting creatives and Apple is
targeting the consumers and I think this
video where I think that's might be the
surface or the studio I'm sorry yeah
it's all wrong but the surface studio uh
is one of those products that it's not
going to shift the market yet all right
there's gonna be certain industries that
are going to be able to use that look
the fact is that all the creatives for
the most part are on the mac platform
it's a platform that they've trusted for
a long time when it comes to photoshop
and photoshop it pretty much does the
same thing depending on platform you're
on exactly the function it really is
like the tools and everything is is
there but when you create hardware
experiences and that match with software
like that surf that crazy surface dial
ok this is that was made for creatives
an apple used to target that used to be
like that those those creatives are the
buzz in that creative world those are
influencers those are like the cool kids
yeah that trickles down and guess what
Microsoft will be able to kind of maybe
consumer eyes I know that's not an
actual word it might have been I just
made it up but be able to take this and
scale it down but when you when you want
to have a flagship product that is for
creatives
microsoft just knocked it out of the
park it looks amazing this look at means
that screen what makes it special is its
a one-to-one ratio in the real world so
an inch on a piece of paper is exactly
an inch on that on that screen it's
incredible so kudos them I and the dial
works doesn't you don't need that thing
you don't need I don't need that big
screen to use that dial you can use it
on your laptop and use on your surface
anything anything you know transfers on
and let's be real if you're talking
about like the dial versus the touch bar
I know which one is just a more
comfortable analog experience like could
you man if they if they were able to
plug that surface dial into it one of
the video editing suites like premiere
oh yeah oh my gosh just turn things I
remember back in the day when Final Cut
Pro I used to use like a shuttle wheel
and it had some functions that you could
assign that would that was that was the
sweetness right there shuttle wheel I'd
use that for pro tools right right right
right right just knobs trouble turn up
volume hell yeah so I I just where we're
like brain dead because we've been
talking about this so much but yes
Microsoft keynote was genuinely amazing
if you don't even care about Microsoft
if you really care about innovation you
should see what they dropped on
Wednesday Microsoft's been killing it
hololens hollow lens of studio that's
the hollow lens can we talk about that
holy cow okay we wanted to touch upon
another topic that was kind of reported
basically like sometime around last week
i think it was basically before or right
after we record our last show but i
don't know about you all but have you
heard of this whole iphone issue where
there are two different modems inside
iphone 7s but one of them is
significantly inferior compared to the
other have you heard about this at the
only time i've heard about it was the
phone call of a guy complaining about it
then we got today yeah voicemail and so
i wanted to talk about just to educate
you of what is happening okay now tests
for LTE connectivity by this group
called cellular insights showed that
there was a huge performance gap between
the iphone 7 equipped with an intel
modem versus a qualcomm modem
and guess what I'll tell you how you can
find out but I have an intel modem and
it it didn't surprise me when I read all
of this stuff of what had happened so
Qualcomm we know basically has been in
the industry for communication chips
they they there's there an institution
that Intel getting more into it they're
newer to this market that's just a fact
okay so this is what happens for
consumers the downside of owning and
Intel version Intel modem in your iphone
7 tests revealed that the Qualcomm
powered iphone 7s were consistently able
to establish stronger connections to LTE
networks an intel-powered iphone 7s
Qualcomm modems outran Intel modems by
thirty percent in overall performance
and seventy-five percent when the signal
was its weakest wow that's big no I'm
five percent and I'll tell you right now
when my phone goes down to one dot on
AT&amp;amp;T yes my phone doesn't work doesn't
work a night in in the past on my other
phones I'd still get some data there are
points where nothing happens okay so let
me 4g doesn't exist anymore pretty much
it feels like yeah it's it's brutal so
let me tell you that are listening how
you can identify this now on the back of
your phones there are different model
numbers okay models a 1660 a model a 1
661 those have the qualcomm modem if you
have a 7 basically a 1778 and a 1784 and
you have an iphone 7 those are equipped
with the Intel modem ooh I'm lucky so I
have an a 1 well you have but this is
iphone 7 3 okay gotcha you're safe
because you have an iphone 7 no i mean
you have an iphone 6s yeah I I have the
778 modem the model number so this is
also how you can break down what carrier
this is probably the easier way to to
break this down verizon and sprint sell
the Qualcomm equipped iphone AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile sell the Intel equipped modem
guess what I'm on I'm on AT&amp;amp;T now why
why is there a distinction there between
carriers well they view you know what it
is is also the compatibility with the
Intel modems don't support the CDMA
networks which is what
sprint and verizon are based on mm-hmm
right where gsm networks like AT&amp;amp;T and
t-mobile that they are more common and
so that's why the Intel chip was most
likely strategically placed in there now
what can you do to resolve this Apple
themselves also sells unlocked versions
of the iphone 7 and 7 plus and those
unlocked versions of phones come with
the Qualcomm modem nice so that's what
you have to do now those are more
expensive now because they're unlocked
they're unlocked I mean you basically
pay a pimp you know you pay for the
price up front instead of going through
a plan but see now that I know this I'm
gonna have to go through this process
and figure out all right I'm gonna talk
to Apple I'm gonna basically trying
because we all know this issue get it
swapped out and if I have to wait for a
qualcomm unlocked phone and it takes for
some people I've read like it takes a
few weeks for them to get that they're
just kind of waiting for their next
phone it's worth the wait so if you have
any five percent faster I'm telling you
when I have one wrong way when I have
one dot out of five dots of signal I get
no reception at all I first thought it
was when I was in LA and then I was like
man I don't think my phones working and
then also an eye I started reading this
something like damn this is me like I am
getting affected by this that's crazy i
get to the bottom of that that's what
think it's but it's it's that I'm I mean
I feel like what I day like any layman
which you know they were just like
accept it but not not BTW yo find out
yobt btz don't go easy alright so this
is the thing you got it find out which
phone you have remember if you have a
seven in that model number anyways
that's gonna be an intel modem I'm not
trying to create any type of hysteria
these are all based on quite honestly
tested facts and this is going to I
think I hope that this story is gonna
bubble up cuz you don't hear about in
the mainstream media you aren't hearing
about it really too much I mean internet
media is talking about it but again this
is something you've got to be aware of I
think it's horrible yeah I mean I'll
yell bad apple but I'm so I'm so
disgusted by like I'm just like this is
this is pathetic so get your ish
together man
it's funny that the small its 22 that
the smaller care carriers have the
faster modem you know yeah yeah and
again gsm networks are more Universal
across the world vs cdma network so
that's why until made the more common
antenna and Qualcomm's like BAM so I
gotta get I gotta figure this out I got
issues now I got real issues I couldn't
even talk about in the apple byte show
because there's so much stuff to do so
that's this that's why it's here I just
also want to touch upon two other quick
topics during the keynote apple TV is
going to get this new TV app it's better
discovery really more based around shows
instead of networks I've kind of gone
off over and over about how we don't
care about TV networks we really care
about shows make shows easy to find kind
of like the netflix interface so Apple
at the keynote showcased this new app
called TV that will work on the Apple TV
and iOS devices I think it's nice the
big Bugaboos it does not include Netflix
or Amazon it does include hulu but
really most people that are streaming
content are watching Netflix and on the
and if you want to watch all these other
TV networks and there's some cool voice
search things in there you have to still
pay for your cable oh you still have to
pay for a cable bill to use this app
properly yeah so it just aggregates your
cable into all those times you sign in
and putting your Xfinity credentials
that's a pin to unlock every channel
that that will be resolved with this
single sign-on feature that is a still
yet to officially come out for the Apple
TV but I think it's nice I just again we
talked about it it's and we've ripped on
them enough about the fact that they
couldn't get their heads together and
get over themselves and just come up
with a TV streaming service like sling
TV and PlayStation yeah so Roku needs to
get this single Roku single sign it
would be nice please would be really
nice and I love Roku I like got nothing
but love for roku but they needed they
need to get that they need to get that
together and then can you tell my voice
is kind of can i was my psyche defeated
right now I feel like I think I think
the audience could tell we're both a
little tired is weird
about racket on yesterday true issues in
long 24 hours I know like way away I
don't try work in retail try work in
retail on black friday I have that
actually is probably do that that's been
little we've been there homies and home
at work in a restaurant Thanksgiving oh
oh oh my gosh it's the worst that's
that's rough that's hard work man but
you know what you made it you're here
we're here we're here we're here in the
Giant Bomb studio we're here we're here
the other thing that I want to touch
upon is Apple's air pods Apple right the
day before the keynote announced that
the air pods we're going to be delayed I
kind of chuckle because you know how I
feel about the air pods but I think what
makes this worse is that Apple took the
headphone jack away from the iphone 7 in
order to feature the air pods yes the
air pods are not available they did not
give us a date of when to expect them
but I will tell you the main flaw or the
biggest problem with the air pods
reviewers that got early test versions
have said they work fine they sound fine
but from a functionality standpoint you
have two options that you can do to add
functionality to the earpods i love the
w1 chip i think the tech of how smart it
is hearing one here versus the other
batt optimization for batteries syncing
with bluetooth great killer stuff but on
the air pods itself you can only choose
to have it either activate Siri with the
tap okay or pause and play your your
track your music so you can't track you
can't do you and you cannot do Siri and
pause and play in the settings you have
to choose one or the other and the other
thing that we talked about right no
skipping of tracks and no volume control
none whatsoever no gestures it's a
single tap tam pod that's in your ear
it's i skipped rascal all the time pause
Oh skip when you're working out all that
walking to the bus sing all the time so
what you're now gonna have to say hey
hey Siri x phone next track or yeah go
to your phone in this but that this they
made that they made another product
harder to use they will update that
though they will fix that I'm sure
they're already hearing every gesture
ain't give me something give me a little
swirly swirly or something just like an
up-and-down motion just give me
something but that this is to product to
products in a row now to products in a
row where they decided to make it
slimmer and made our lives more actually
made things more difficult we got
courage Brian they have the courage
courage to throw up throw up right now
it's garbage all right let's go this
shows all about you all so let's go hear
your calls we love you and so let's see
what you got cooking for us and again
please call us to follow up your
thoughts about apple's keynote and just
some of the latest up that's happening
alright first call hi brian this is matt
from simi valley california i have an
imac early two thousand nine and i went
to do the upgrade to sierra and found
out I couldn't do it is their big
difference between El Capitan and Sierra
thank you i would say this right for the
most part i use mac OS sierra or Makos
yeah basically the same i I don't know
about everyone else but I don't really
use the Siri voice search in it I think
it's just because I was never used to
talking to my computer but I think it
can be super useful right to get like
you're serious you know to locate
files I don't do that I think the iCloud
Drive is really cool but I use Dropbox
so I don't really use that the feature
that I haven't gotten used to that I
should probably use the copy and paste
where you copy from your phone and if
you press paste on your lab your
computer that works so that that that's
a nice one unlocking my computer with my
Apple watch it's like nice but do you
really need that no I mean it's not not
the end of the world so I think overall
Apple pay on your computer through your
phone and like these are all nice bells
and whistles but I think fundamentally
it works very st. a lot of the same I
think the Vegas the biggest benefit that
I felt like I got was when I put Sierra
on my machine at work I only had like
six gigs of storage space left when i
installed it and let it do its thing I
ended
up I kid you not with 30 gigs of storage
available and one of the reasons why it
does that ciara doesn't take as much
space also it stores some of the files
that you don't use very often in to
iCloud and then makes them excel for you
when you need it so it kind of knows
what what you're using the most and
obviously when you work in media you
have all these images and video files
and stuff you don't access them all the
time so the iCloud Drive is probably if
you've never used dropbox it'll probably
change your life if you've never used
dropbox but but i use dropbox so i think
it's a i think it's a nice upgrade even
just from a performance optimization
standpoint but look if you're ok right
now Apple still hasn't released new Mac
imax they haven't released new mac pros
they haven't released new mac mini so if
you're on the fence i would just wait
till they do those more
consumer-friendly upgrades and then go
and then get a new computer with ciara
and if you want to get the new macbook
pro you could do that as well so thank
that's my two cents on it cool yeah I
think it's good i think it's good i
don't i'm not like floored by it but i
think it's a solid upgrade i think it's
nice you haven't got to play with sheer
marcos Sierra yeah you haven't played
with Michaels have El Capitan ah yes see
my friend my friend yes my friend I've
copied on Michaels so okay next call
sorry I'm stalling here it's okay my
brains parting too we're gonna cut this
one off halfway cuz its pretty long
cities good evening all morning
gentlemen my ass i'm coming from
australia again let's make you guys a
few weeks ago and left a message about
deciding on whether or not to wait for
the new macbook audit downgrade to a
macbook air and I know the Brian you
replied to me but I have to say that
Apple guys like I just saw the keynote
for a new macbook and guys I wasn't
impressed I meant great tech love the
touch bar love the touch ID fantastic
technically I have to say the macbook
pro even at 13 inch I think their price
point is just way out of reach of most
consumers I mean you buy one of those
units here in australia i think when i
was reading it on the apple store page
it was something like two thousand seven
hundred dollars australian just early
learning in the touch
goes on and that's a lie I think the
prices even just the two-hundred-dollar
bump people were like wait oh they
increase the price of the macbook pros
like what what is that still happens it
doesn't stay the same at least when you
thought they reached the ceiling know
that that kid that can be frustrating so
we feel your pain man I'd I feel it all
the way so yeah okay let's go hey what's
up Brian and the apple pie crew my name
is will i'm from dallas i wanted to make
a quick comment a feedback actually on
3d touch I had heard many of your
comments in the past about how 3d touch
is just under utilized and didn't seem
like you had a lot of confidence that it
will be around much in the future but I
actually beg to differ on and I think
it's not only super super useful but it
is growing and the support specifically
from third-party developers just give
you a few examples google has a lot of
their apps now use 3d touch in the
native most of the native apps are now
on board with it as well both from the
home screen as far as quickly accessing
features and also inside the app for the
pecan pops and things of that nature so
me personally I actually use these
features every day and I don't kid when
I say that and I think it's really
really cool so I just want to get your
thoughts on the possibility of this
really being a platform as more and more
third-party support and native put a
native support or adding moving on in
the future anyway thank you for your
time every day love the call that was a
legitimate call even the duration of the
call was on you know I thought it was
appropriate because you can't make it
point I actually I agree with you I just
feel like I don't use it enough but I
think there's life there quite honestly
with 3d touch in iOS 10 the number one
feature i use it the most for is when
before i used to i watch slingbox so i'm
watching like NBA games when i'm
traveling all the time and what used to
happen is when someone would send me a
text message if i wanted to respond to
that crap it would take me out of the
app stop my slingbox stream and then I'd
have to restart it all over
reconnect blah blah blah that's dumb now
thanks to the magic of iOS 10 and 3d
touch I push really hard on that little
alert yeah and then the window pops up
the stream is still playing underneath
and I don't have to leave the app yes
it's that that that pushin pot hey pika
pop it's a push and pop you know 3d
touch I was talking a couple weeks ago
as I do it's in my way you know
sometimes but I'm starting to realize
there's the pressure sensitivity I'm
starting to figure that out a little bit
more so figure out oh if i push a little
less hard than i can get to this and
what you know so it's there's definitely
a learning curve and i see its potential
but i don't use it actually I wound up
turning it off eventually yeah I i think
as again my biggest gripe about is that
it it works different ways depending on
how you use it and i understand you know
you're saying oh well you know you can
the google app shows you a contextual
menu of some of the things that does but
again like every app is different i use
it mostly for Shazam and now for when
I'm watching slingbox and the fact that
it exists is great but I honestly do
think that you could have accomplished
the same thing without actually a with
just a long long press yeah you could
you could if they wanted to even Google
in their latest version of nougat has
that but I don't at first I said is it
dying I mean it's just kind of a
question to pose and I'm glad I think
there's a you're not the only one that
uses every day I have plenty of cats my
friends like dude why are you so down
and I'm like I'm not down and I just
don't use it as much as I thought I
would and I was one of the most excited
people about it when it first was
announced I was like if I was like dude
this game changer yeah it's a game
changer like is the interface changer
and I just think it hasn't reached its
full potential yet and if it's something
that takes a few you know more years to
and all of a sudden everyone is using it
then then it will be that game changer
bite thought it would just move a little
faster that's all but so thanks for the
call doubt that was great stuff cool we
got two calls left hi my name is ricky
williams i have an iphone i'm blind and
i want to know is there a better iphone
voice assistance then series that i
could put on my phone can you find that
out for me hm i'ma let you take soon as
you did the research baby oh yeah yeah
just use google just talk to
the google app but you say launch the
google i'm peering launched it yeah you
just say hey Siri launch my google app
google app thank you just touch it or
whatever say and then hey what's the
best app to use for blind people if
it'll help me to give me a whole bunch
gave you a list give me a whole bunch of
them yeah but Ricky me Ricky Williams
you can again use Siri as the prompt to
then launch the google app and then use
the google i will tell you right now the
google app for search and voice
recognition is significantly better yes
big-time that's why go to so i know it's
an extra step but because you're
visually impaired that is the way to get
around with it and we want to show you
some love so there you go thanks for
calling cool cool alright last call
what's up guys this is 1 t 2 from
orlando florida ah a few shows bags you
guys talked about deleted maps from your
iphones i wanted to know why I being
using map since I got my first iphone
and ever have any issues with it and new
version I've been blown away and how
accurate the traffic updates are and it
also recommends different routes to say
some time on the go on the spot what am
I missing out from google maps hoping my
other question of the show guys please
please well like you said it a lot of
those features were on Google Maps away
before they were not able like wait like
you're like a year to two years more
yeah so we're already used to using them
and we're already like you know we're
trained to use those already so why
would we go try out another app that has
a bad reputation for sucking yeah i
would say i would say this also just to
be fair and nice the reason why I I
wanted to give Apple maps a really good
try and when they first plugged in
transit into the app it was great but
then they took it away because it didn't
it didn't work and so I was like me just
okay recently yeah and then they put it
back recently I'm when it first launched
it just wasn't as accurate for routes so
what it is it's more of a cumulative
effect of when you start not necessarily
trusting a nap as much and you know that
another app just does the job for you
and does it well you stop use
that app that just could potentially
guide you in the wrong place I I haven't
I haven't made a decision to commit to
like Oh use Apple maps for a month and
nothing else maybe I should try that but
I kind of don't want to maybe do it yeah
you can make a video out of it into like
you know I tried Apple maps for a month
and here's what happened yeah but yeah I
mean Google Maps was talking to you
before Apple maps was it was also
showing you different routes to go you
know to get multiple routes yeah turtle
routes it had transit yes I also has you
could just click a button and go to
google street view so you can see
exactly where you're going also true
they're I mean they're all these are all
great there's so many thing but again
this it wasn't like it happened six
months before Apple where time a year to
year three years some of this stuff so
so that's why I'm not gonna hate on
Apple maps but I just I prefer google
maps just historically true true and
that's all our calls man that's it we're
done we dunzo we finished I've got a
good topic for next week's show cool it
kind of branches off of what we talked
about during the live show during
apple's keynote when i went off of like

plenty to talk about that so again thank
