show about do-it-yourself tech and how
to's I'm Donald Bell and i'm eric
franklin and the holidays are almost
here and there's no easier way to get
into that holiday spirit than to listen
to the handful of holiday songs that
don't drive you crazy yeah it's kind of
a fine line between catchy and insanity
when it comes to holiday music for sure
so if you're looking for a way to
separate your normal music from your
holiday music we're gonna show you how
to do just that nothing gets you in the
holiday spirit faster than holiday music
but once New Year's rolls around you
don't want to listen to jingle bell rock
for another 11 months but in this air of
the mp3 how do you keep your holiday
tunes handy while at the same time
keeping them out of your workout mix I'm
gonna show you how first step we're
gonna open up itunes it doesn't matter
if you're on the iphone or android or if
you haven't touched itunes and years
it's still one of the easiest ways to
import your music and get it on a
playlist and that's what you're gonna do
you're gonna make a playlist for holiday
music and then you're gonna dump
whatever you have in there next select
all in that playlist and then select get
info on the options tab check the box
that says skip win shuffling in the off
chance that one of these tunes still
make their way to your phone this will
ensure that they don't pop up during a
shuffle finally with your songs still
selected hit copy and then create a new
folder on your desktop called holiday
music and paste the songs in the folder
next we're going to upload these to a
freak loud music player now the two that
most people already signed up for
whether they know it or not our Amazon
music and Google Music both are free and
both work with mac or pc or android or
iOS and because you're probably not
taking advantage of either one they make
a great place to stash music that you
only listen to occasionally in my case
i'll go with amazon music yet over to
amazon.com / cloud player and then you
log in with your amazon ID click the
button for import your library find the
holiday music folder you created select
it and then hit import all
once uploaded you'll find all of your
holiday music included on the recently
added playlist on your amazon cloud
player to turn it into a permanent
playlist check the select all box at the
top of the list then click add the
playlist and create a new playlist
called holiday music finally to take
your holiday music on the go you're
going to want to download the amazon
music app or the google music app if
that's the way you went then sign in and
find your playlist from here you can
shuffle the songs in your playlist and
you can delete them on the fly and let's
not forget the best part once the
holidays are over instead of deleting
your holiday songs one at a time you can
just delete the whole app or ignore the
app until the holidays roll around next
year so there you go that's how to get
your holiday tunes up and running
without a contaminating the rest of the
music on your phone have a happy holiday
and a great jingle bell free all right I
am in a festive mood right now calm it
down alright I will thank you that
you're welcome alright time for a quick
break and when we come back we've got a
DIY how to create your own photo booth
using gadgets and technology you
probably already have
you
welcome back all right so photo booth
yes they're great to have around
weddings yes birthday party totally
special events like the holidays yeah
for sure and Lexi savita shows us how to
make our own using a DSLR camera or a
tablet and its really really cool
festive celebrations are a great time to
capture all those holiday memories on
camera and to make it even more fun i'm
going to show you two ways on how to
make your own DIY photo booth the first
method is using a tablet as your camera
and the second method is for better
quality photos using a DSLR and then
sending those photos wirelessly to a
tablet make sure that there's a good
Christmassy backdrop you have some fun
props and your scene has plenty of
lights first let's set up the tablet
option you'll need a tablet tripod and
photo booth apps that your tablet to a
tripod or a secure surface facing the
backdrop for ipad i'm using the studio
proper tripod mount which attaches
easily to the back of the dedicated case
depending on your operating system
choose an app to run your photo booth
i'm going to use pocket brief for this
demo and it runs on both iOS and Android
like a real photo booth it takes four
photos in a row and it ranges them in a
strip after they've been taken this
method is quick and fun but using the
front-facing camera doesn't always
produce the best quality shots so for
the best photos you can get I'm going to
show you a DSLR method grab your camera
and an eye-fi mobi card it's got
built-in Wi-Fi so it can transfer images
to a tablet or smartphone automatically
it's also compatible with the majority
of cameras on the market even older
models insert the card into your camera
and then download the iphone mobi app
for iOS or android on your tablet launch
the app and enter the 10 digit
activation code on the I Phi case now
all the photos you take on your camera
will automatically transfer to your
tablet on your camera we're going to
shoot JPEG images only for speed and
disable the auto power off options so we
don't lose our Wi-Fi connection if your
camera has a knife I setting in the
menus make sure to enable the card like
this start taking photos by getting your
subjects
press a remote shutter release or set up
your camera's self timer option you can
either have your tablet near the camera
so people can see their photos
immediately or have it a short distance
away so passers-by can see those photos
too once you've taken all your photos
it's really easy to send them to a
printer straight from the app or save
them to your gallery and then send to a
printer using air print or Google Cloud
Print so there you have it a DIY photo
booth two ways happy holidays I'm Alexis
avedis and i'll catch you next time you
know as cynical as I can be sometimes I
really do like the photo booth thing we
had at the holiday party last year and
it's really really fun hey have you ever
tried using a touchscreen with the glove
yeah of course it doesn't always work
we're going to show you a DIY on making
your own touchscreen glove and it is
quick and easy there are many
touchscreen friendly gloves available
for purchase but if you don't want your
options to be limited or you already own
a pair of gloves that you love there are
a couple of easy ways to make any gloves
work with your smartphone or tablet the
reason that gloves don't work with your
screen is because the fabric blocks a
static electricity from your finger so
we need a way to channel that
electricity through the glove the way to
do that is with conductive thread you
can find the stuff online for about 10
bucks I have my thread a needle and my
gloves the plan is to sew a few stitches
into the fingertips I want to be able to
use with the phone in this case it's my
index finger and my thumb
for the thumb I'll put stitches closer
to the edge of my finger which is where
I would touch the screen for a pinch to
zoom gesture now if I do this correctly
it should work with my screen it won't
work with my fingerprint scanner of
course but I should still be able to
unlock my phone and enter my password oh
yeah it works perfectly let's try that
pinch-to-zoom if it's not working for
you or the connection is inconsistent go
back and add a few stitches to make sure
there's a good connection between your
finger and the conductive thread another
way to make your gloves touchscreen
friendly is by using a product called
nano tips it's a conductive liquid
specifically designed to make any gloves
touchscreen friendly and according to
the company this will even work on those
thicker leather gloves my case I have
another pair of regular knit gloves that
I'm going to try this on but this time
I'm going to make sure that there's a
buffer between two sides of the fabric
for that I'll use a spoon so just put
the spoon up through here and the way
nano tips works is you just use the
brush to completely saturate the fabric
whatever part is covered by nano tips
should work with your touch screen if
you let nano tips air dry it'll take a
couple of hours but if you want to speed
up the process you can use a hairdryer
and that should only take a couple of
minutes
feels dry so I'll take the spoon out and
give this a shot okay so if you're
finding that it's not responsive you
might want to go back and add a few more
layers of the solution to make sure that
there's a really good connection but
once you're there you should be able to
use the gloves with your touchscreen
with no problem and what's great about
nano tips and even the conductive thread
is that you should have enough material
to take care of more than one pair of
gloves that's it for this week's show we
hope you enjoyed it yeah you guys should
