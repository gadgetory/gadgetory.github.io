I'm Jason Parker and this is the show
where we check out the hottest apps in
the mobile space so plenty of photo
effects apps to choose from on high OS
devices when I found recently minutes
classic Polaroid cameras and really
gives you a heavy dose of nostalgia it's
called polo Matic and what it does
differently from other photo editing
apps is it gives you that classic
Polaroid border to your images along
with several retro effects to get
started you can take a fresh photo or
choose an image from your iPhone photo
library the first category is Polaroid
frames here you'll be able to select
from several styles of photo paper that
all have that telltale Polaroid look
there are plenty of unique and funny
styles here like crushed pen marks and
even ones that feature a strip of
masking tape now touch the next tab on
the bottom to add your effects pola
Matic comes with twelve different photo
filters to give your image that retro
look to fit with the Polaroid frame you
won't get any fine-tuning adjustments in
this app but the featured filters are
easy to browse and are made for that
nostalgic look next touch the pencil
icon here's where you'll be able to add
a title to your photo start by swiping
through the available fonts to find one
you like choose a color and simply type
out the title for your photo those who
remember Polaroid cameras know how
writing in the space at the bottom was
the common way to call out what's in the
photo when you're finished you can touch
the cloud icon to bring up social
networking and photo sharing sites so
you can send your creation out to the
world you may have noticed earlier that
I have many more than twelve effects to
choose from
that's because polo Matic offers three
in-app purchase packages you can buy for
99 cents each you can buy one that adds
several more classic Polaroid photo
frames with designs one that gives you
several solid colored frames and the one
I bought which gives you twelve more
effects to add some variety to my photos
polo Matic goes for $0.99 in the iTunes
App Store and is worth the price for
creating a unique style of photos you
can share if you're looking for a new
way to save and share your images I
recommend you to tap this app today
