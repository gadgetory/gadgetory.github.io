Google alysha's for everything google
that we can pack inside of a show and
you might be looking at a samsung galaxy
s6 right now but what about an s7 well
according to a report from The Wall
Street Journal Samsung will be adding a
pressure-sensitive display similar to
Apple's 3d touch and a new high-speed
charging port to its flagship smartphone
line with a launch in March now they
also say Samsung is considering adding a
retina scanner to some versions of the
phone but that could change with about
three months left to go now it's also
expected there will be a minimum of two
versions with one being the standard
version s7 and the second being a curved
screen version called guess what the
galaxy s7 edge there's been plenty of
reports of the current s6 edge
spontaneously cracking so they'll need
to make sure they fix that issue also
Sam mobile reports on rumors that there
may be as many as four different models
for the galaxy s7 Mobile World Congress
in February has typically been the time
Samsung has made new smartphone
announcements so we expect the same
thing this time around and that matches
up with an expected March release now
the rumor that we've heard the upcoming
Galaxy s7 will have some type of
pressure sensitive screen is true but
you can already interact with an app
like Instagram for Android in a similar
way to the iphones 3d touch in the
latest update to the app if you long
press on a picture in Instagram it will
zoom in on it and moving your finger
over one of the buttons under it lets
you like it or share it it's all done in
the software and it's one of the best
examples of an app to take advantage of
this feature all right Google's Project
sunroof is getting a little boost for
consumers it released earlier this year
as a tool to let people see how much
sunlight the roof gets in factors in
your house orientation shade from nearby
trees and buildings and local weather
patterns and it creates a score to help
decide if going solar makes sense now
the service has now expanded to cover
more areas including Arizona New York
Nevada Connecticut Colorado in North
Carolina California and Massachusetts
were the original two and there's still
plenty of time to do a little bit of
shopping for the holidays but check out
this sweet deal from the Google store in
the US the chromecast and chromecast
Audio have each been dropped down to
thirty dollars for the time being but
if you purchase one right now you'll get
a twenty-dollar google play store credit
so that's basically like spending ten
bucks and you can even be greedy and
keep the twenty dollar credit to
yourself not that I would do anything
like that now if you buy both of them
together you'll also get the pair for
fifty dollars and if you're lucky you
might be able to grab a free star
wars-themed cardboard VR viewer directly
from the google store as well the last
time I checked they were sold out and
then they made more available and then
they were sold out again so keep
checking if you really want to try out
their cool jacooz fire VR experience
it's really just one of the many
mind-numbing star wars tie ends before
the movie this week that I expect all of
you to go see before we post the
spoilers you know on next week's show
alright that's going to do it for this
week you can email us at Google licious
at cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
thanks watching it will see you guys
next time for some more of that Google
