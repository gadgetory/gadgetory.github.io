Paris it might as well be a camera and
the Samsung Galaxy Wi-Fi camera better
perform because i left my DSLR at home
now this camera runs jelly bean and has
built in Wi-Fi but I'm also going to go
right in there and get it a sim card so
that I can have data everywhere
Instagram heaven wish me luck
and I got my orange sim card and put it
in soon Wow restart to access the mobile
network and this is definitely already
more complicated than a regular camera
for sure but I guess we knew that going
in it's giving me a signal alright i
don't know i cannot get the sim card to
work it says I'm registered on the
network but I don't have any access I
don't know I'm just gonna go take some
photos and if I find an orange store on
the way we'll stop and ask them what's
up meanwhile look for Wi-Fi one big
drawback that I noticed immediately is
that this camera takes forever to start
up and when it starts up it doesn't
default to camera mode it's a little
time consuming to operate but let's get
to the photos
I handed the camera off to my pro
photographer friend to play with some of
the expert mode's we found that in
bright light or if you adjust exposure
setting you can produce some pretty nice
images a little video myself and
all the pictures that I take in Paris
are basically me like looking up at
stuff but once again the nice big view
screen definitely a bonus as is the 20x
zoom kind of digging that idiot
just don't plan to shoot all day long
battery life is barely a day also if
you're not a pro you will be
disappointed in your snapshots so this
is like the picture you can't really see
this there we go oh that we just took of
cell so with his five-thousand-dollar
cannon and I mean it's one thing to go
around taking pictures of my phone and
expecting that it's kind of phone
quality pictures but this now just
having this just making me mad I'm angry
on my DSLR kit believe I left it on my
better not screw up my Paris trip
Samsung and as for low-light shots
forget about it okay in the end as much
as I wanted to love this camera and I
was delighted at being able to get my
email on it it's just not a good enough
camera to justify carrying this instead
of a phone plus the battery life is not
good and all of this Android goodness
just kind of gets in the way sorry I
tried if you want a second opinion read
