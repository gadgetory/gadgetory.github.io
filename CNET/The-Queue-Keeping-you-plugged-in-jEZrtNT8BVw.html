ipod to whiten your teeth and inside new
york's high-tech cabs drop that flag The
Meters running Hugh starts right now
hey there what's going on hope you
having a great day I'm rich demuro with
CNN TV reporting to you from our studios
in New York City let's get you started
with your must click moment the mall has
it all so maybe that's why one guy
decided to build an apartment inside
according to his blog the idea started
in 2003 the 750 square foot apartment
previously a construction storage space
the mall partment was livable but didn't
have how do you say facilities
unfortunately the Builder was eventually
apprehended before completing his
project you know there are a lot of ipod
accessories out there but only one can
help you whiten your teeth a product
called rock my teeth consists of a
custom cable with earphones and a
whitening tray plug it into your iPod
stick the tray in your mouth and turn up
the volume according to the site the
louder the music to your teeth the more
whitening energy your release the
product comes from the Institute for the
Advancement of music science and
professor Bocelli hmm haven't heard of
him here in New York City there's a lot
of talk about the resistance of cabbies
to new GPS systems and credit card
readers well all I have to say is one
ride in these new high-tech cabs and
suddenly nothing else is good enough the
system even better than you'd expect it
consists of a back seat mounted touch
video screen that shows local news clips
there's also a GPS map that shows where
you are in real time in case your cabbie
goes all Bone Collector on you then
there's instant access to various news
and information the credit card reader
is quick and definitely makes for bigger
tips cabbies are opposed to the system
because they think it's tracking them of
course not all our post moving through
the queue if you know someone who owns a
room but chances are they're really
attached a little sucker according to a
study by a Georgia Tech professor Roomba
owners pretty much treat the robotic
devices like pets they give them names
and even rearrange their furniture to
accommodate their tracks rumba sold two
million of the box the studies suggest
the public is ready to welcome even more
robots into the home and also men get
excited about vacuuming because of the
Roomba how many times have you tripped
over a cable I know I'm always catching
one in my chair like but now there's no
need to worry about killing your
equipment for the consumer that demands
protection for their connection there's
the new breakaway cable from replug it
connects you
headphones to an audio device
transforming any Jack into a breakaway
connection a quick tug on the replug and
the cable automatically detaches saving
you and your device from a world of pain
look for the replug in store soon it
only needs to save your butt once to be
well worth it I'm rich Tamara would seen
a TV don't say it in tell you so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
