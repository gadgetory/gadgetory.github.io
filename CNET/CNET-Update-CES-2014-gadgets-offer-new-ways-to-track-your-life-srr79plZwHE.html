instance the sense mother she comes with
several of these cookies that you can
program around the house to do different
things maybe you'll put one on your kids
backpack to get alerts of when they came
home from school or maybe you'll put one
on a toothbrush to make sure your kid
brushed before bed mother and for cookie
sensors cost about two hundred and
twenty dollars and we'll ship in the
spring and that's not the only tooth
brush tracking gadget the colbry
electric toothbrush has an accelerometer
a gyroscope and a magnetic to record how
long you brush your teeth and how well
you're brushing and it sends all that
data to a smartphone app via bluetooth

cost one hundred dollars and is expected
to come out in the third quarter of this
year if you're prone to losing your keys

to check out the sticker tracker these
little sensors communicate with your
phone using bluetooth and you can set an
alarm to go off if it gets too far away
from your phone it also has a two-way
alarm to beep the phone or the sensor so

jewelry but it's a UV monitor to track
your sun exposure and it costs $100 also

watch that monitors heartrate and steps
and has a little bit of style thrown in
with a metallic design and scratch
resistant curved screen but it
