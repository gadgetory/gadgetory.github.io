decision for advanced compaq sony adds a
third entry in its excellent consumer RX
series the cyber-shot rx100 3 has a lot
going for it including great video and
photo quality a cleverly designed
retractable electronic viewfinder and a
much faster lens + generally excellent
performance and it's all still wrapped
in the same slippery but small body with
a higher price tag I'm Laurie grinning
and this is the sony cyber-shot rx100 3
where the rx100 to give it the hot shoe
the rx100 3 taketh away in exchange gets
this nifty and nice EVF which are tracks
back into the body it's small but it's
bright and quite usable unfortunately
when you push the evf back in it turns
off the power which is insanely
frustrating because you have to push it
in to shoot close to your body without
blanking out the LCD and speaking of the
LCD you can now flip it up for selfies
as you can with Sony's other mirrorless
interchangeable lens cameras that's a
nice implementation Sony hasn't changed
the fundamental design of the camera so
my big complaint about the lack of a
grip stands combined with the slippery
metal body I'm constantly in fear of
dropping it as with other cameras that
have one I like the control ring which
you can program to operate for one
default setting now it includes step
zoom plus there are plenty of other
customization options including another
extra button you can also tilt the flash
back for better results overall the
photos look is good and occasionally
better than the rx100 2s it uses the
same one inch 20 megapixel BSI sensor
though it upgrades to the newer beyonds
X image processing engine which delivers
slightly better results you can safely
shoot JPEGs up to about iso 1600 ISO
3200 if you're not real picky it's got a
decent tonal range though like it's
sibling it Clips highlights the color
reproduction seems a little better
though and it now has a neutral color
preset option the video is excellent
thanks to the addition of a higher
bitrate xav
CS mode it's bright saturated and
reasonably sharp with no notable
artifacts in bright light and relatively
noise free and dim with the exception of
startup time the camera performs quite
well though I still find the autofocus
system a bit too inconsistent that makes
it not really effective Geoffrey
shooting action despite its ability to
maintain a 3.3 frame per second birth
straight and the battery life is
miserable carry a spare overall the m3
is a great camera but it's a little more
nichy than the m2 and lots of folks are
fine without an evf and the m2 has
better battery life and a longer zoom
range if the lens EVF or better video
are important to you though this is the
camera to be I'm Lori groanin and this
is the sony cyber-shot rx100 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
