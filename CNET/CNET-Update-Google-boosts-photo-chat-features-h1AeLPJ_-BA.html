photos I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update google added new
features for chatting and editing photos
on the google plus social network the
hangouts chat service now has location
sharing which shares a little map of
where you are and it's a great way to
tell someone how to meet you from your
smartphone it's something already being
done on a few other messaging apps also
a hangout chat can support sharing
animated gifts when you want to be
light-hearted and it can work with SMS
text messages as for video calling
hangouts offers high def calls and the
service can auto enhance lighting from
your webcam it throws in a few artsy
tools that let you blur the background
or chat in black and white but the bulk
of the changes center around new photo
sharing tools because Google is really
pushing for you to use the network as a
photo back up and sharing service and
update to the Google+ app on iOS will
upload all photos at full resolution and
it'll have the option to automatically
backup and sync your iphone or ipad
photos in the background Google can
actually recognize over a thousand types
of objects in your photos so if you type
in sunset or snowman in to search it can
pull up photos that you took of those
objects the auto enhanced improves the
look of the photos uploaded to Google
Plus and there's more control to dial
the changes up or down there's also new
auto awesome features like merging
several action sequences into one shot
it creates this strobe effect the eraser
tool that you remove someone or
something that got in the way of your
shot assuming you took a series of
photos and movie is self explanatory it
builds a highlight-reel mashup of your
photos and videos with effects
transitions and a soundtrack and it can
be customized the movie effect only
works with certain Android 4.3 devices
but the other app features are more
widely supported and roll out this week
if you've ever bought print books from
Amazon you can now buy digital versions
of those books at a low price amazon
launched the kindle matchbook program
and it lets customers buy a discounted
kindle version of certain print books
that were purchased new from amazon even
if it was bought back when the website
launched in 1995 the digital copies cost
as much as three dollars and some are
free more than 70,000 books are part of
the program and even if you don't own a
Kindle you can access these digital
copies from a kindle app on a smartphone
or tablet amazon also has a program for
discounted audiobooks when you buy a
kindle ebook that your tech news update
