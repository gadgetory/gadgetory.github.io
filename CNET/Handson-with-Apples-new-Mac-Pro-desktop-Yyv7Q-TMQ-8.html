new Mac Pro desktop from Apple this is a
radical redesign of the concept of a
professional desktop it's meant to
replace that big boxy Mac Pro that
you've probably seen in your office's
seen other people with few years that
design has not changed in a long time
what Apple has done here is take
essentially the same high-powered
professional components and boil them
down into this small cylinder that is
about 1/10 of the size also much lighter
and part of the way they do that is by
fitting everything inside around kind of
a three-sided triangular heatsink slash
motherboard you have RAM over here and
over here that's very easily accessible
your video cards are over here and here
this is the solid state hard drive you
know it is user accessible there's not
really any reason to go in and replace
that right now but at least that's
something else you can get to this is
not nearly as expandable as a full tower
desktop but at least there are some user
accessible parts inside and they combine
that with a single fan that's also very
quiet and it kind of sucks hot air up
and you can feel a little bit of it
coming out of the top of the system here
and the end effect is you have something
that is as powerful or more so than the
big gigantic Mac Pro's but it's very
small very portable can really sit next
you on your desk rather than like under
it or in a closet somewhere even though
there's a very high design product it's
been described as looking like anything
from a small beer keg to a part of a jet
engine
all Clan is sort of like Darth Vader
black this is not really intended for
the same consumers who would go out and
buy let's say a MacBook Air or even an
iMac it's intended for people who edit
video and do a lot of facial graphic
design or 3d graphics and things like
that that said you could use this as
your home computer but it's a pretty
hefty investment starts at $3,000 and
goes up from there I'm almost afraid to
tell you that this particular
configuration has to the higher-end MD
FirePro graphics cards it's got 64 gigs
of RAM it's got a 1 terabyte solid-state
hard drive all that adds up to about 8
thousand dollars but the $29.99
configuration is also plenty powerful
the big conceit here is that a lot of
your accessories and new stuff is going
to be added externally through the 6
Thunderbolt 2 ports that are in the back
of this
uh so you have gigantic harddrive arrays
and other things that use they're going
to be external rather than internal
whereas an old Mac Pro you might have
just opened up the side and put in you
know a card the system is being very
heavily pitched as being for 4k video
use and you can connect up to three 4k
monitors at once using either the
Thunderbolt 2 or the single HDMI port
that's in the back it's got some of the
new upgrades we're starting to see from
a lot of PC makers it's got the faster
802 dot 11ac Wi-Fi
it's got PCIe connection for the SSD
drive so that should make that a little
bit faster as well it's still very early
days for the new Mac Pro which is a
fairly radical reimagining of what it
means to be a high-powered professional
desktop computer so we're going to have
to take some more time run a lot of
tests run Final Cut 10 on it out put all
kinds of 4k video to different displays
but at least in our very initial
hands-on testing that certainly feels
like a very fast very powerful very sexy
a high-powered pro-grade desktop
computer I'm Dan Ackerman and that is
the Apple Mac Pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
