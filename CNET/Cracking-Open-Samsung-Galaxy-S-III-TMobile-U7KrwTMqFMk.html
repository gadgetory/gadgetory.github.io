design the galaxy s3 looks great on the
outside but what about on the inside
let's find out I'm Bill Detweiler and
this is cracking open from a teardown
and repair standpoint the s3 has both
positives and negatives on the plus side
it's polycarbonate case is ridiculously
easy to open thanks to its user
replaceable NFC capable battery the back
cover just pops off and after removing a
few Phillips screws I detach the
motherboard cover using just my fingers
the headphone jack and speaker assembly
came out just as easily another positive
is the motherboards connector placement
unlike the HTC One X most of the s3s
connectors are located on the side of
the motherboard that faces the phone's
back cover now this makes the board easy
to remove and reinstall unfortunately
while getting to most of the internal
components is a snap replacing them may
be a bit more complicated some
components such as the volume buttons
earpiece and service light appear to be
joined together with a single ribbon
cable if you replace one you'll probably
need to replace them all
also most of the internal ribbon cables
are glued to the internal frame if you
ever need to replace the frame it would
be very difficult to remove all the
attached components without damaging
them now if you're wondering why you'd
ever need to replace the frame that
brings me to my biggest complaint about
the phone's construction the front panel
display and frame are all sandwiched
together and held in place with
extremely strong adhesive if you crack
the display or the front panel which
happens a lot you'll likely have to
replace the whole assembly or just get a
new phone now that we've discussed the
pros and cons of the s3s construction
let's take a tour around the phone's
internal hardware unlike the
international s3 which has a quad-core
Samsung Exynos processor the US version
like this t-mobile unit have a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm s4 chip
shown here mounted under the 2gig
Jim they also have either 16 or 32 gigs
of on-board storage a micro SD card slot
an 8 megapixel rear-facing camera 1.9
megapixel front facing camera and a 4.8
inch HD Super AMOLED display as of this
taping t-mobile's version of the samsung
galaxy s3 is available for $1.99 with a
two-year contract and despite my
complaints about its repair ability it's
a solid Android phone with top-shelf
hardware and a highly competitive price
