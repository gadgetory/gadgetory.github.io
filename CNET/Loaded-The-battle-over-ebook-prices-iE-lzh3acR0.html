Carey on cnet com and it's time to get
loaded the United States Department of
Justice has filed a lawsuit against
apple and several book publishers /
fixing the price of e-books the lawsuit
filed in New York District Court Sue's
publishers hatchet HarperCollins
macmillan simon &amp;amp; schuster and penguin
for colluding with Apple to raise the
price of e-books the core of the issue
comes down to the rules Apple set for
being in its bookstore before Apple got
into the e-book game Amazon was selling
ebooks for cheap at around ten dollars
and was on figured cheap ebooks would
entice folks to buy a kindle and
publishers weren't too happy because
that just made it harder to sell
hardbacks Apple changed the game though
with the iPad to get on the iPad
publishers had to follow a new rule they
could set their own book price but no
other online ebook store could sell it
for less so if Amazon wanted to sell a
book they couldn't discount it to stay
competitive the Nokia Lumia 900 Windows
Phone just launched this week but some
models have been found with a software
glitch where the phone cannot get a data
connection Nokia says a fix will be out
by Monday but Nokia is also giving one
hundred dollars to new and existing
customers to make up for the problem the
phone costs a hundred dollars so you're
basically getting the Lumia 900 for free
but the offer is only good until April
21st there's a lot riding on the launch
of the Lumia 900 this is Nokia's big
comeback into the u.s. Spotify is making
it easy for website owners to embed
songs albums or playlists on a site the
streaming music service launched the
Spotify play button it lets website
owners embed the player for free and

of paying the artists but in order to
use the play button you have to be a
spot of our user we're used to seeing

million dollars now Gaffigan special mr.
