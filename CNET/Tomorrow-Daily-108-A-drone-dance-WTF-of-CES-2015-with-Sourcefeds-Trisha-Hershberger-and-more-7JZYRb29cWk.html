stuff at day two of CES 2015 also a
magic mirror that can make you look like
anyone you want and a very special live
report from the show floor it does not
involve spiders oh thank you God sera
daily
Oh citizens of the internet welcome to
tomorrow Dale I know you got really into
clapping yeah great really in a clapping
club welcome to tomorrow daily the best
geek talk show in the known universe you
are here at CES 2015 day two we're here
we're still alive I feel like that's
that's a win we just chalk that right
under the win column right away this I'm
just actually a 3d printed version of
myself I couldn't even like we just
pretty one point I was gone so rent a
quest they're doing some amazing things
with 3d printing you guys malfunction uh
so we are sponsored this week is LG and
we have a G flex 2 that they were kind
enough to loan us and kill took it last
night to these see the cnet party who
knows if I was supposed to do that but I
got some really great photos like I
spent a lot of time doing they live like
this unique selfie thing where you do
this and you do that and then the photo
it would take was of people shocked that
that's how you take the photo they're
just like oh yeah it was weird did slow
mo Snoop Dogg down dancing around so I
think snoop actually just moves
permanently slow motion like I think
that's just a thing so i don't know i
don't know how effective it would be but
it's a really cool fun when we can check
it out head over to cnet.com for all of
our coverage of the G flex 2 and thanks
again to LG for loaning us that
delightful little device i also have a
g3 that's pretty cool as well you might
get it back you might get it back so
we've got some great things and we want
to jump right into it so let's hit the
headlines
okay so we want to talk about a couple
of our favorite things that we've seen
around the show floor we're all about
the weird wacky wonderful of CES 2015
and and today is no different than
yesterday kale you have really kind of
seen some crazy stuff you've been over
at tech West oh man I love tech West
that's where that's where all the wackos
come out to play so I skipped lunch so I
decided to go with a throat a 3d food
printing that's kind of like a new thing
that's that's coming around one of my
favorite 3d printing things just like
feel like I've seen everybody 3d print
everything more specifically candy and
chocolate so they have a yeah okay over
there they have a something called chef
jet that makes candy pastries and candy
and pastries and yeah look at that
geometric you can shade you want sugar
frost yeah really interesting stuff and
really precise yeah very really like
very precise and then they have the
cocoa jet printer which can print
chocolate which it was yeah very light
on the space station yet uh and they're
actually partnered with her she's on so
like it's actually a serious thing and
for the for the chef jet the candy one
that's gonna be available this year well
you're gonna get your check out some
candy your candy printing on yeah and
then and then of course they also have a
whole bunch more over there they have a
3d printer that can that uses recycled
plastic which I thought was amazing and
then also a haptic 3d like pen that used
with oculus but I focused on the food
because I'm excited about that are you
guys okay I always focused on no pizza
3d printer yet but we're waiting for
that so yes 2016 yeah I see how so I
success so gonna wait here so for me I
really liked we saw this a couple nights
ago pet cube oh yeah I'm all about pet
cube guys I just got a new puppy I'm
gonna brag a little he's adorable and we
saw pet cube yeah I role of the puppy I
think well not of the puppy okay if you
want to see it after the show I'll show
you pictures of my dog but pet cube is
really really cool it's a it's a little
cube and it allows you to keep an eye
it's like a home little camera you can
connect you with an app you can see here
it is right here it's not very big but
the best part about it and this is the
thing
and I really liked is that it has this
app attached to it and what they showed
us was you're able to actually play with
your pets with a laser pointer that's
built in so you can see they're doing it
right now they're dragging a finger
around everything and that's a that's an
animal shelter yeah in Oakland I was
playing with cats in Oakland yeah we're
the dream is real people the dream is
alive alive and well my friends but yes
for owners that can't be home and if
they are gone for prolonging times they
can play with their cat so you can get
fat you know you're at work and you want
to just like check in on your pet you
want to play with them a little bit for
you know on your break take a little
five-minute break play with your pet now
you know like Oh guys good it was about
200 bucks and this was actually a
successful Kickstarter too so so
Kickstarter so I really like seeing
these kickstarter and crowdfund success
stories always really nice to see here
at the show yeah um but yeah it's a work
on me too by the way you put one of
those up and you put the laser pointer
like hold on back of the state backstage
all the time if I ever need to keep kale
busy I just put a laser pointer on the
ground it's great um so tell me a little
bit about this magic mirror because we
saw some of it we've covered it and wear
it this is hilarious okay so Panasonic's
AR makeup mirror it's one of those
exhibits where everybody is like
gathered around it because it's like one
of those like wow things on a crowd you
sit down and then they put any number of
makeup it tracks your face and it puts
the oh yeah here we go we have Sarah
here and and they put any you know
eyeshadow and they put eyelashes
lipstick and blush and whatever you
whatever you can think of another
important thing that it does is it can
actually check your skin out and see
like if you know if it's dry if you need
to be drinking more water yeah if you've
got too many wrinkles you can get a
mustache like Sarah boost ash so you can
see what you look like with facial hair
or something about getting the Walter
White oh yeah it's more commander yeah
the Heisenberg but but yeah and then
also another cool feature that you went
woo at when you when you heard it was
you can change the light so it can be
like fluorescent or like blue or
whatever you after you put the makeup on
you can see you know what it looks like
how terribly look and I was thrilled by
that and I never wear makeup except for
like right now I'm wearing makeup right
now wearing a pound of makeup right now
a lot of lipstick but so that was pretty
cool there they're hoping a it's
actually available now this isn't like
the salons
yes so aren't throwing to get that upper
right now but it's it's really cool to
be able to just see it without having to
put it on especially if you're terrible
at makeup awesome okay so one of the
other things that I saw it there's a lot
of interesting things going with
connected cars oh wait hold on no wait I
FB is on this side oh we're getting word
that we actually have some breaking news
some dancers wearing no clothing on the
floor and we're gonna go straight to
that in southall yes Jeff Bakalar on the
scene you guys we have Jeff Bakalar on
the seat I can't wait to see this we
have dancers with no look he's surprised
too he is shocked he looks a little
scared all right Hey so excited 10 he's
really excited jeff says yeah Jeff's a
happy man Jeff is a very happy man we're
uh we're hoping hey everybody guess it's
happening we're about ready for the
five-minute ritual of the dancing drones
I'm told with the complex routine and
you know this is really this is really
what every like every baby drone dreams
of when they're a kid to make it to the
big stage Las Vegas the big show that's
how you know you've made it and we're
just patiently waiting for the drugs
there there there little prima donna ish
they have their riders they have to fit
apparently one of them stormed off in a
big huff but it's ok they've composed
themselves and they're apparently are we
almost ready the clock has hit zero
we're patiently waiting for the drone
show um you know it's it's a complex
routine this is something these guys
study for a very long time do we have
curtains raising no little
anti-climactic here but not a problem
I'm told this uh this netting here is
reinforced uh because God forbid let me
tell you guys god forbid a hole where to
somehow erupt within these nets oh here
we go they pull which are somehow erupt
in these nets the scent of freedom would
just be too much for these guys and out
they go through the net luckily I'm told
the parrot employees here are armed with
shotguns and they'll just shoot one of
these little bastards out of the sky if
they uh they act out what I'm told Gary
safety first here it's a complex routine
nerves are running wild clearly holding
nothing back it's a big crowd pleaser
here a big crowd pleaser here at CES the
attending audience or as they like to be
referred to as drone purse I'm told
that's what they're called drone pervs a
big crowd pleaser here at the Big Show
in Las Vegas when you want to compete
when you want to make a difference in
your a drone you come to Las Vegas you
come to see us so that's what we have
for you today now look is a complex
complex thing right here these are high
complexity moves difficulty level second
to none cackling oh that's impressive
work right now my God look at that look
at the grace look at the majestic
behavior like the Olympics here you know
lots can go wrong lots can go wrong you
can clip a wing I don't know like a
giraffe maybe like a big giraffe from a
window could knock these these things
out of orbit I don't know it's just it's
for the next hour holding nothing back
and God forbid the one thing you want to
you want to avoid hitting nice Scott did
you run out of battery you're sent home
packing you're just sent home packing
they show you the door and that's it I
put you out of your misery
this isn't in my favor you have it
varying degrees of difficulty excellent
stuff here there's a lot more tomorrow
daily coming right after this break
please stay with us
this audience is way better than
yesterdays hottie hey you guys are you
guys I know great and fortunately Jeff
no Jeff Bakalar were harmed in the
making of that last segment we don't
know that yet well I'm not sure what I
haven't seen him back in the booth yet
but fortunately I'm I've got my fingers
crossed as you can see we have a guest
yeah she just appeared if we also 3d
printed not you might know her from
SourceFed nerd this is the one and only
trisha hershberger such a delight this
girl she's delightful and one of the
things that I always like that we talk
about every single year at CES
regardless of whether it's on this stage
or not it's all the WTF of CES and there
is a lot of it at the show so we picked
three of our favorites and were going to
talk about them Tricia give us give us a
little tour a little taste of what it's
like to see the weirdest like most I
just don't understand but that okay
alright cool i love so much it's my
favorite thing about ces every year
because i feel like it's those WTF
products and those ideas that lead to
the next generation of major consumer
products like I mean there was someone
back in the day who was like a carriage
that doesn't need horses to like you
know it's the first car and they're like
fab we don't need horses for that that's
pointless nobody needs that my horse is
just fine like there was that person
gonna do ya do ya that's poppycock
that's probably different for every
product there's gonna be the people that
say you don't need that or that's too
expensive or whatever so I think that
the weird stuff is the future of
technology i mean everyone at CES always
talks about you know the big stuff the
tvs the wearables the auto tech but the
little startups are where it's at yeah
the scene it's as a foundation so yeah
and you found no shortage of them this
year right there's never a shortage of
WTF products here I mean when you walk
around especially like if you're at
eureka park when you walk around you
look at stuff and you're like that's a
little strange I don't know what that is
and I even saw some of it in central
hall this year too okay yeah well the
spider dress is over there we had
Iran's game yesterday amazing we had it
here on stage and it almost poked out
kills I several times several songs
because I told him over and over again
not to touch the model and he wanted to
just get a little closer touch the yeah
yes your dress sure the dress yeah
you've got a little invasive that can
happen it was approxn to that yeah
doesn't like that but very cool 3d
printed and it reacts to the user so
very cool yeah and she was looking in
the future like you said it's yeah that
could be the future I mean it reminds me
of in school we used to get these like I
went to an all-girls schools we used to
got leaves like self protection and date
rape assemblies and stuff and I'm like
who needs that information now you could
just wear spider dress to bring out your
dress pretty good um so the other so one
of the other things that you mentioned
was that you saw that you thought was
super weird was the 10s fork and knife
oh yeah previously known as the happy
for a fork yeah now it's got a little
matching knife friend so tell okay so
you have to explain this a little bit to
me because I know before it was like
when you it would it wants you i believe
it's like it wants you to lift your food
and eat it every 10 seconds yeah well it
wants you to be at least 10 seconds or
slower okay so the idea is that you're
not shoveling lettuce in your face like
we were talking about during the brig
fun conversations that happen when the
cameras are off no it wants you to wait
10 seconds between every bite but the
first generation of it would actually
register as a bite when you stabbed food
too if you're like a violent you don't
really get I was doing it I was doing it
one alligator two I like that yeah we
have to mouse the number it's really
it's rough that's a long time if I
Darvey again it vibrates and lights up
and the idea is that before you eat
every meal you press the button and
activate it and and then you do your 10
second bites and now it's paired with
the fork so now you can get the 10s for
or I'm sorry the knife so now you can
get the 10s fork and knife set does it
make it but what why the knife though
because you're not raising that to your
mouth so is it like you saw your food in
half for 10 seconds looks like this way
if you stab and the knife is down there
it doesn't recognize the stab as a bike
so it's more accurate now a little bit
more fancy it's
it's been on sale in Europe but they're
planning on bringing it to the states
and it's just hilarious to me it makes
the weird product list for me because
who brings the same utensils around with
them all day like our is it in your
purse what is it in your pocket are
there are their sanitation wipes for
after every meal so you can put it back
and save it for later guys I've got a
fork so when I use this you would you
find yourself sorry I mean I guess if I
really was concerned with my nutrition
intake um I'm somebody you know so go
with no yeah not carrying that around or
fork and knife I mean I might just go
old fashioned and one alligator two
alligator three alligator it but like I
said there's the people that were like
I'm old-fashioned I'm gonna go with the
horse and buggy and you know jack the
car you know what I'm in for the happy
spork oh that gonna happen I need that
next year um okay so do it right on your
welcome Internet you're welcome startups
so last thing that you wanted to talk
about is the log bar ring which I
haven't even heard of really I know that
are I believe seen a notice when you'll
got to go see it okay but you please
explain to me what the log bar ring is
ok so the log wearing was a very
successful crowdfunding project raised
over 800 thousand dollars and it's a
ring you put on that enables you to
control your surroundings via gesture
really neat idea so we think of the idea
and we're like I'm going to turn off all
these studio lights and they just turn
off good very very cool idea you know um
but in practice at least right now and
this is the product second generation
that's being shown at CES this year it's
still very big and bulky and so I don't
know how many people can legitimately
rock that unless you have like right now
and that is a pool key ring sorry ok so
it's like that wouldn't really work for
it looks like almost like a broke three
of them right there they're very fragile
my she hulk strength what are some of
the things that they showed off that
they bragged about it being able to do
specifically specifically they talk
about turning off and on lights with
gesture and it's it's linked to an app
so that you can plan what Chester's you
like so you can make up whatever gesture
you want to do whatever thing in your
house that you want you could turn off
and on appliances off and on lights just
interact with your surroundings and now
they have a
hub that they sell as well so you don't
need to buy special lights or Pasha
appliances it sends it out via infrared
do you think that I would be able to at
some point the future be able to shut
off with a way of kales bad puns may be
unstoppable maybe runs on nuclear power
I think I'd shut it off right yeah it's
not gonna hear but yes so the ring
itself you press a button you make a
gesture and it's oh well you'll see a
little crystal on the side of the ring
press press a button make a gesture and
it does its thing um but to me I think
how hard of a gesture is it to walk over
to the wall and just flip the light
switch I think that's my heart thing
about what my agent it's Wally we're
going back to the wall e generator just
all sit in the chair just a cop guys
it's gonna happen but if I was playing
xbox and I could like restart my dryer
load by you know playing my game and
just doing like BAM and it did it that
means dryer wave your hand it has all my
dishes to be like this yeah this one
doesn't let everything so like do wrong
stuff going off it ulta xbox turn off no
amazing but yeah that the product is
actually better now than it was before
before it was made out of zinc so it's
actually interfering with its own
communication no longer okay no longer
all right well so okay so that's the WTF
stuff that we've seen at the show that
especially Trisha she she is you want to
ask anybody about it trisha hershberger
