Frigidaire dishwasher has a few good
things going for it it's got a spiffy
stainless finish with hidden controls
and this is smudge proof stainless which
resists fingerprints well plus nice
touch the door stays in place where you
put it which is nice when you want to
leave it cracked it has these cool lines
some holders that do a great job of
securing you nice glasses
it has orbit washed those blue arms at
the bottom which reaches all the dishes
pretty well and scrapes away tough dirt
it has plenty of cycles and plenty of
options and upper rack that raises and
lowers easily this $850 Frigidaire
dishwasher even has the company's new
even drive feature which uses a fan to
circulate heat and get the drops off of
your plates and bolts even Drive worked
pretty well unlike a lot of other extra
dry cycles when we turned on Heat dry
the dishes still came out cool to the
touch and they only had a few droplets
here and there and a relatively low
number of water marks but ready for the
other shoe to drop nothing about this
mid-range model helps it stand out from
the crowd and it's cleaning scores are
just okay and I like the even drive
feature but it's still not the best
power dry cycle we've seen it has fold
down times but no creative extras are
options no third rack so this eight
hundred and fifty dollar Frigidaire is
competent it's worth putting on your
list of possibilities especially if you
can find it at a discount but it's more
of a fine model that you settle on
rather than an exceptional model you
should seek out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
