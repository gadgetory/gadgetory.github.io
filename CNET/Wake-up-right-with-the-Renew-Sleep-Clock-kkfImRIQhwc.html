showstoppers a side event to CES in Las
Vegas we're looking here at the renew
sleep clock now health-related gadgets
and monitors are a big theme this year
you've heard of gadgets that you'll wear
to monitor your sleep overnight but this
one you don't have to wear anything it
sends out high frequency radio waves
we're about a 40-degree distance and
about a meter deep to detect your
movement during sleep to see when you're
awake when you have light sleep or when
you're in deep sleep it's not only
detecting the slight movement in your
body but it can detect how you're
breathing so that's how it knows if
you're in deep sleep or lights it works
with iOS devices and also serves as an
alarm clock it's alarm functions are
pretty much like a typical alarm clock
you can step what kind of music you want
to wake up to or sleep snooze what kind
of owed you want to have it on so
because it can detect when you're a
light sleep and in deep sleep you can
tell it here's a range of what I want to
wake up and only wake me up when I'm in
my light cycle so that way you can avoid
being woken up when you're in a really
deep sleep which is really kind of
grumpy they say that is the same
technology used by hospitals when
they're doing sleep studies now you
might be wondering what am I going to do
with this data so what if I Mindy sleep
or light sleep the whole point is to be
more health conscious and when you wake
up and you can see your sleep patterns
you might say you know what let me
adjust my habits so it's all about being
more health conscious it's going to come
out in February for one
9 and there you have it at the first
glimpse at the renew sleep clock I'm
