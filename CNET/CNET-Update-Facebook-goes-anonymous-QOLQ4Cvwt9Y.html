wearable tech might just be on your
finger I'm Jeff Bakalar in for Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update facebook
is introducing anonymous login a mode
that will not allow any information to
be sent during a session it's an effort
to help users control what different
apps see and share it should allow for
users to have an easier time testing out
other apps that use Facebook to log in
without having to worry about spamming
your friends there's a new android
smartphone from China that's getting a
lot of buzz for its powerful performance
and impressively low price unfortunately
it's got an awful name it's called the
oneplus one I know I know it runs a
nearly pure version of Android but right
now only people with an invite can buy
it it will be rolling out to 16
countries by June and that actually
includes the US and the UK it has a 5.5
inch display a quad-core processor and
it starts at only three hundred dollars
and best of all that's the full price
there's no contract required if you'd
like to learn more about this amazing
phone you can head on over to cnet.com
we have an early review of it so that
new phone might have a lot of hype from
eager mobile fans but there's a
well-known brand that's struggling for
attention in the smartphone world today
LG announced the g3 its new
top-of-the-line smartphone and it will
be unveiled on May 27th but with the HTC
One m8 and Samsung's Galaxy s5 already
in stores most experts are thinking LG
is a little late to this party that
could potentially hurt sales office iPad
users can now print right off the app
some other new features include smart
guides for PowerPoint and auto fit for
excel microsoft said millions of people
have downloaded the ipad app since it
was released back in march but even
though it's free to download and open
and view files you still have to pay ten
dollars a month to create and edit
documents everyone seems obsessed with
wearable tech there's a new gadget that
takes all that technology and puts it
into a ring
the nod is a smart ring that turns your
pointer finger into a mouse so imagine
pointing your finger at the TV to move a
cursor on screen or using your finger to
play games like fruit ninja there's a
small touchpad on a flat surface so you
can use your thumb to make selections
and to click the nod is still in
prototype mode but the company has
opened up the platform to developers to
see what other applications they can
create that's going to do it for your
news update please head over to cnet.com
