storage you want to remove as much of
the surrounding air as possible we've
all tried the age-old squeeze every last
bit of air out before sealing the zip
top lightning-fast trick but that method
is flawed it's nearly impossible to get
all the air out fortunately there's a
trick which has been used for several
years in the sous-vide community it
replaces your writhing and squeezing
with a bucket of water here's how it
works
place your food in the zip top bag and
zip the seal leaving about one inch open
find a large container such as a large
storage bin large pot or even a one
gallon pitcher and fill it with water
slowly lower the bag of food into the
water until only the corner you left
open is above the water seal the
remaining corner of the zip top and
remove the bag from the water allow the
bag to dry off completely before placing
it in the freezer
this hack uses the natural pressure of a
body of water to squeeze out a lot more
air than you are normally capable of by
hand without crushing your food
however some air will remain in the bag
especially if you're freezing a more
solid food such as cooked chicken or
steak giving the bag a shake while
underwater can help squeeze out more air
still while not quite as effective as an
actual vacuum sealer this can prolong
the shelf life of frozen foods in your
freezer better than the manual squeeze
under your arm method can you can help
fight freezer burn and it doesn't crush
your food to boot just keep in mind that
since you're filling a large container
with water it makes more sense to seal
and freeze all your foods in one large
batch rather than wasting several
gallons of water each time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
