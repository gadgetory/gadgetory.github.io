sax person from Microsoft Studios and
we're excited to be able to show a new
version of Minecraft built specifically
for microsoft hololens Thank You Lydia
to show a demo today we're using a
special camera this display technique is
like putting a hololens right on the
camera itself allowing the entire
audience to see the holograms
now this is a live demo with real
working code let's show what it can do
you can play the Minecraft you know
today on hololens sax grabbed his xbox
controller to play through a giant
holographic portal into a 3d Minecraft
world right on the wall even though I
don't have a hololens I'm able to play
together with sax from my surface are
you gonna come join my game Lydia I've
been now I see you jumping around one of
the cool things about hololens is that
it lets you display Minecraft virtually
anywhere you can get different
perspectives on your Minecraft world
it's awesome to play with the controller
but could we show them something new sax
sure let's take my experience off the
wall and then put it on the table over
here create world
I see Lydia way up there as I run around
and play sax can easily navigate and
manipulate the world using his voice and
his hands he can walk around the
hologram pan around four different
viewpoints and even look inside
let's follow Lydia around puppet follow
player I can zoom in and out for a
better perspective closer all the way in
close-up what are you up to Lydia I'm
hopping in a minecart let's take a ride
down to the village we're gonna pick a
different perspective overview
it's incredibly cool down minecraft on
your table imagine seeing your own world
like this
isn't it crazy that I see Sachs just
standing at the table but through the
hololens he can see a whole Minecraft
universe at his fingertips you can even
raise the entire world and see things
that are normally hidden way underneath
the ground could you give us a sneak
peek of what's under that village stacks
sure
grab the world lift it up let's see
what's hiding underneath Lydia loo huge
stronghold right underneath I'm gonna
mark that for you Mac that are you gonna
have to find a way to break in I see it
I'm on my way there now I'm placing some
TNT so I can blow my way into this
stronghold I could use a light though
Sachs your strategy using hololens I
have access to all console commands and
minecraft just using my boys but I can
just focus my gaze on the TNT and say
lightning strike step back whoa there's
a lot of materials down there I wouldn't
have seen without you one more thing I
want to do with lightning you pigpen
over here
I think the pigs need an upgrade
lightning strikes
there you have it zombie pigmen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
