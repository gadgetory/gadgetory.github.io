that's linked to your bank account that
people use to pay each other bag and my
friends use it so much it's now a verb
they say I'll venmo you or you've end me
the money and I've been joined because
you know I just like to have some time
for a company to establish itself before
I hand over my bank account information
and you know last time I checked when we
all pretty much okay with paypal we're
all pretty happy with that I'm kind of
wondering if the moment i joined venmo
everyone's going to move on to something
else and you know venmo basically gives
people permission to act like rude loan
sharks they want their money within one
minute of a transaction like if I bought
some one coffee and turn around and said
well you know if we walk to an ATM right
now you can pay me back right now when I
tell someone I don't have venmo and I'll
get them back in cash they also get
really annoyed like it's a major
inconvenience for them to have money
handed to them that's the very
definition of a first-world problem why
are you so upset physical currency is an
acceptable form of currency am I paying
you back in goats am I paying you back
in a gold bullion that you have to break
change for it no so take my money and
don't you roll your eyes at me mister</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
