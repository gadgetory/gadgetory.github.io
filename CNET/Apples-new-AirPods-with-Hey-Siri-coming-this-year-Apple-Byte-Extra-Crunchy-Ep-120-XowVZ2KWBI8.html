my name is Steven Beecher producer of
the Apple byte extra crunchy podcast
with your host mr. Brian Tom what's up
everybody welcome to the show it is
episode 120 Apple byte extra crunchy
keeping it extra money this is the show
where we talk about all things Apple it
is our complimentary piece I can't even
talk right now
complementary supplementary
complimentary piece of the Apple byte a
weekly show that we just put out a
little earlier on Wednesday again this
show is all about you all we talk about
the stuff we love this stuff but also
it's a chance for you guys and gals to
call in and be a part of our show so the
number to call us at
seriously I'm like they've changed a lot
of things for me like just freeing me up
when I'm eating lunch on the bus I do
have like a fear of losing them but they
are awesome man that that is that is a
great gift so everyone's like why are
they giggling like little schoolgirls
all right so these new 2018 air pods
remember the air pods came out in 2016
they were pretty much sold out online
through like July in August so people
were always like one year later I'm like
are they gonna they asked me are they
gonna come out with new everyone's I'm
like no they don't need to the demand is
so high quite honestly they could even
push this out even further if they
wanted to but at least what we know
according to Bloomberg is the 2018 air
pods are going to are expected to come
with an upgraded wireless chip that now
lets users summon Siri I'm not gonna say
the magic word combination but instead
of you having to physically tap they the
air pods you'll be able to just use your
voice to prompt that which is a nice
kind of subtle thing I think by doing
that also it opens up the fact that
we'll be able to do at least more
control on the actual air pods
themselves the first thing that I saw
when I had them is look I wanted more
touch control I wanted volume control up
and down I want to just be able to like
swipe it I don't think they're gonna go
that far yet but right right now if you
you tap it or you hold it down that's
how that's kind of how to prompt Siri
the double tap is like the player pause
and you can do that on different ears
like so this actually opens up the door
if voice control is done by Syria that
maybe you can actually do single tap
holds to do volume up or down on one
side of the year or not it allows you to
get more control and I think that's the
best part about getting this upgraded
Wireless chip built in the internally
the air pods are known as B 288 so
that's cool I think the other thing that
many of you I don't know maybe it's just
me when I use air pods Beach when you
tap on them don't you feel like you have
to kind of tap pretty hard that you like
almost push them into your ear hole yeah
sometimes I am concerned I'm gonna tap
my ear to hard but yeah I do like it
takes me sometimes four taps but coming
back to what you said before are you
saying that I can
to tap to stop on one side and then on
the other side tap for Siri now yeah
awesome play yeah oh yeah show called
the Apple bite you can watch it if you
want start like really tuning into that
one in my in my it might be a good idea
so here's the other thing that is also
interesting about the air pods not only
are the air pods expected to release in
2018 bloomberg says Apple is also
working on a third iteration of the air
pods that are expected to be coming in
2019 this new version will have some
level of water resistance yes so you're
you're happy about this swimming with my
ear pods are you sure are you sweaty
ears no I'm not sweaty ears but it'd be
nice if you like jump in the pool and
still have some jams or like you know
maybe go wakeboarding or something or
like be on a on a raft in the lake
chillin with your ear pods and not have
to worry about him I'm not gonna go
wakeboarding with freaking air pods in
my ears what are you talking about go
snowboarding with air pods it's awesome
I said yeah well now I haven't done with
my air pods but I have snowboarded like
listening to music and I love that you
know that's that's a false statement
that's a full stick your bud earbuds bro
I've gone snowboarding with ear pods I'm
like you know no no no no no I mean I I
misspoke said ear but I should have said
it earbuds but you're gonna reel
snowboard next weekend with my air pods
and I will I will let you know how it
goes that's fair enough now the this
will have at least two thousand nine
teams version again this would be
generation three would have some level
of water resistant to survive like
splashes and maybe even rain even every
everything Apple Pro when the iPad air
pods guy there's so many things in your
head now home pod air pod iPod okay
everything Apple Pro did a test with the
air pods right when they came out he
actually submerge them in water like one
foot deep for five minutes in the case
and everything and they survived it even
put it through a washing machine oh wow
and they survived as well to still be
working functional ear pieces so Apple
never advertised that the air pods are
100% water isn't there probably water
resistant to a certain degree but to
actually make the claim that these are
officially you know whether it's an ip67
rating or whatnot they actually have to
make sure they really are and build them
to be water resistant so maybe they're
gonna call them the air pods sport who
knows water pods just didn't work that
would be awesome
that would be cool cuz I you know they
do have to make them so I'm sure people
walk in the rain and then their ears get
wet and stuff like that so if to make
one you know hey Apple by nation what do
you think water pods or air pods sport
what are you gonna go beach house water
pods I kind of like about air pod sport
that's BT Z's you need to let us know
you need to call us let us know anyways
air pods in development the other thing
that was cool and talking about the
water resistant level of air pods is
that apples also had patents that
they've been working on we don't know if
these are actually gonna come out but
the actual air pod case themselves back
in April of 2017 patently Apple revealed
patent filings from apples specifically
detailing air pods case technology and
there were kind of two things that stuck
out one of them was the ability to use
the actual air pod case to wire sleet
charged an exterior device like an Apple
watch so you could lay your Apple watch
on top of the air pods case they have
some diagrams and images of that in the
article and then the other aspect
they're talking about is actually making
again a waterproof actual connector that
the receptacle kind of connector that
could connect onto the case that was
waterproof as well so these are apples
looking at this but again this is Apple
putting their spin
I know that for sure the air pods are
not going to change how they look
yeah and I think the hook is here to
stay the look is here to stay
III ranted and raved about it for
probably a year I'm gonna go out and
tell you right now moving forward one of
my new year's resolutions 2018 I will
not complain about how the air pods look
did you look silly man cuz when I first
put them on dear I walked I like walked
home I got home after work whatever and
my kids saw me and they're like what are
those in your ears like the first thing
they're like what are you doing what is
that that was a dumbest thing they've
ever seen it was funny anyways air pods
new air pollen - coming out sometime
this year based on reports but again I
think this is a proc that Apple can take
their married time on because the demand
is still there but the hype is I mean
people people are still loving it and
I'm you know you're someone who just
recently got them a few months ago so
I'm glad to hear that you enjoy them
thoroughly yeah they're awesome man all
right next up story that broke this week
as well new iPad refresh expected
possibly in the next few weeks this
comes to us from our friends the French
website console mock what they had found
is Apple has registered new tablets with
the Eurasian Economic Commission that
happened this week suggesting that an
iPad refresh is likely coming very soon
it could even be a few away why do we
know this so first of all the filings
are required for any devices with any
type of encryption that are sold in
Armenia Belarus Kazakhstan Fritz Gaston
and Russia donations thanks bro if I
mispronounce them you know someone's the
trolls coming out don't even worry about
it
always I apologize if I butchered to any
of those I'm pretty sure I did alright
so what's interesting about this filing
is there's this chart it's like a lot of
numbers and whatnot there are two tablet
model numbers that we have never seen a
one eight nine three and a one nine five
four that are described as running iOS
11 with no actual description of what
type of
tablet they are so there's other sample
tablets and smartphones products listed
on this list as well with model numbers
that we have never seen starting with a
a and C C that's not normal
but at the very least it looks like
we're expecting to see some type of
tablet coming in the next few weeks
arguably March and the reason why I say
this is every time Apple is filed with
the Eurasian Economic Commission the
products that have been filed have ended
up coming out the next few weeks
everything from the air pods to the
Apple watch series to the 10.5 inch iPad
pro twelve point nine inch iPad pro it's
a really strong indication even the
MacBook Pro with touch bar it's a strong
indication that we are going to see
these really soon so we don't know
exactly which tablet it is there's been
a lot of rumblings obviously we know
that an iPad pro with some sort of face
ID and limit and skinny bezel is
expected to come sometime soon that may
be held out until WWDC but what
indications are leaning towards more
possibly is a cheaper 9.7 iPad a new
nine point seven inch iPad but we can
also a lot of people keep on asking me
what's going on with the iPad Mini I
don't think I really feel like the nine
point seven inch is now kind of like
apples Mini and then they have their 10
inch er and they're twelve point nine
inch or I think that's how Apple is kind
of breaking this down sorry ten point
five inch iPad pro I really think the
nine point seven is really kind of more
like they're mini and I used my parents
mini I mean sorry there are nine point
seven inch and I was like dude this
thing's small yeah does feel really
small yeah I kind of like the smaller
ones though I mean the big one yeah it's
just big and I'm afraid a little break
but I guess the smaller ones I feel like
they're gonna break too cuz he they're
like just you know flimsy they're not
flimsy but they just feel like you could
drop them easier I don't know I think
I'm just desensitized because I love my
twelve point nine inch iPad pro one of
my favorite Apple products I'm gonna
argue really say all time this is I'm
just being real with you but everyone
freaks out when they see my iPad they're
like dude that's huge I'm like so's the
iPad I feel like my iPad third
generation is big but I
so I have like a massive case on it so
my sons don't crack the screen or
something yeah but uh that is my
favorite Apple product by far we use it
constantly airplanes everywhere awesome
ultimate travel companion it emit
babysitter - I don't yes
that's like the ultimate like bribe my
children into doing things I like oh if
you go do this I'll give you the iPad
for 30 minutes you know and they're like
okay I'm doing it right now
I mean depending on what side of the
coin art you're on that's either good
parenting or bad parent but I'm not
gonna I'm not one to judge I'm not
wanting to limit them man they only get
like Fridays and uh you know maybe one
time if they do something really great
that's good I honestly you know what
I've see your I stalk you on Instagram
and stuff and I really notice your kids
are always doing something not they're
not on tablets oh yeah yeah yeah
you know I don't wanna they already one
of them broke my PC a little bit so I
don't really let him mess with my PC
well they won't even mess with my
MacBook they don't want my MacBook they
want my touchscreen you want to talk
about broken do you think that the Apple
spaceship design is flawed I saw this
article and the story's amazing honey
the headline Apple's new this is
Bloomberg who reported this as well but
basically Apple employees are walking
into the glass walls or glass doors of
their new spaceship campus this is an
actual story it is real what's basically
happening right
Apple has these huge 45 foot tall glass
doors glass surfaces around there it's
seamless it's beautiful but just like in
real life they're saying that people who
are walking around the Apple Park per se
looking down at their phones are
literally walking into the glass doors
in the walls and it's not like one
person it's many people it's enough
where some staffers according to this
Bloomberg report we're sticking post-it
notes on the glass door so people would
know like they're actually there but
come on you know who is that we're gonna
let a post-it note fly or just
multi-billion dollar facility or
milt no so they did post-it notes that
they were putting up to like look out
for their common common man were taken
down because they distracted from the
building's design oh wow oh yeah oh yeah
it's great so the people that told
Bloomberg about this were not asked to
be identified because they don't want it
they want Apple to be coming back at
them but um it isn't architectural just
amazing marvel design it's beautiful but
people are walking into the glass that's
funny that they that they live in fear
of birth of Apple and they don't want to
speak publicly about accidentally
walking in through a glass wall that's I
can't that's crazy
but isn't it how how how hilarious is it
that it's cuz they're looking at the
phones their company made its prax them
and then they walk into this freakin
glass door that's made thanks to the
iPhone finance this building that
they're walking into that is funny man
that that hurts - you run into a glass
window that hurts I'm gonna break a nose
or something break your phone the other
thing is though a while back I don't
know if you remember this but when Apple
kind of changed some of the designs of
their stores people when they started
going with this like well at least when
they're rolling out their new stores
they're going this is like kind of full
open glass concept where they wanted it
to feel like the street was directly
would walk you lead you right into the
store people were walking into the glass
facades of Apple stores as well and if
you notice now on Apple stores they have
these like kind of little frosted glass
rectangles or frosted kind of you know
yeah a line or a row of them in hopes
that people see them so they don't walk
into the windows yeah they got to put up
some sort of decal or some warning or
even just like a light that like
reflects off the glass so people can see
cuz that's funny man that's a fun
category and I mean an old lady I think
she was like 80 something years old she
actually broke her nose walking in the
glass window or pane of the store and
sued Apple oh wow
they have to put an end to that right
away nip down one in the bud that's
crazy yeah so just heads up Apple
employees if any all lists in the show

gonna keep rolling through the show all
right this story dropped this week as
well a fast company puts out their list
of the most innovative companies for the
year we got a couple callin phone calls
about this specifically
we're doing the Apple by decra crunchy
what what position do you think Apple
was in fortune are sorry fast companies
top 50 most innovative companies of 2018
I'm looking at it right now number one
for delivering the future today which is
kind of cool
who is that that's what that's what the
headline says I didn't say the company
Oh Apple I'm sorry did I did I not say
Apple Apple is number one again with
that tagline let's look at some of the
others on this list before we get into
this number two Netflix for mastering
the smaller screen number three Square
for extending the benefits of banking
and $0.10 that's overseas company for
honoring content is king I'm gonna keep
on scrolling through this number five
was an Amazon this is one that stuck out
to me that was really weird to me number
12 Instagram now it's there their
reasoning or their tagline is saying for
making people drool what fine but come
on dude Instagram Instagram literally
hijacked and deliberately carbon copied
snapchats functionality and features and
then took all it's still happening got
all those users now to jump back on
Instagram where there was already kind
of a developed following people aren't
using snapchat nearly as much they're on
Instagram Instagram wasn't innovated
they straight-up just hijacked and stole
features and I'm not saying that Apple
is the king of originality as well we we
know we all know how the tech role but
it was one of the most deliberate
ripoffs I've ever seen and you're
putting them at 12 for innovative right
yeah that's that blows my mind and for
making people drool I don't get this I
because of all the Instagram like models
or something I don't I don't know and
that so here's the other thing so I'm
not gonna I'm not here to poop on Apple
I'm just here to again keep it real cuz
people honestly I've just learned that
if people don't hear what they want to
hear then they think you hate something
it's people are dumb about this stuff
okay so you
fast companies reasoning for why they
gave Apple the top spot for most
innovative company of 2018 best company
says that their ear pods the Apple watch
Series 3 AR kit and iPhone 10 were the
reasons they were praised for their
quote unquote ambitious software and
hardware products they also said that
Apple's artificial intelligence is a
point of advantage for Apple where they
have made major inroads despite
competition from Google and Amazon all
right I'm sorry but are we timeout the
same company here like air pods Wireless
hit earbuds ok yeah make sense what
Apple watch Series 3 was the third year
of the product so that's an evolution
yes AR kit is more just rolling out the
AR tip platform 2 phones but we quite
honestly we still haven't seen it take
off yet
iPhone 10 was another evolution of a
product ok that's more evolutionary than
innovative if you ask me I'm just saying
like evolutionary our innovative would
have been creating the Amazon echo yeah
the Animas on echo was innovative it was
a new product had never been done before
and look what it is today
that's innovative 7x launching a car in
a space I know it's kind of PR II and
sounds crazy but everything at Elon Musk
is doing is innovative yeah but but not
just not the flamethrower I don't think
that's innovative but yeah you can
totally the SpaceX was down at 14 which
blows my mind because I mean the last
launch that we watched the Falcon Heavy
I watched two rocket boosters land
simultaneously together in concert with
each other like that was like that was
incredible like you know that's
something we never seen happen before
it should be about least in the top 10
but what's innovative dude I love the
Apple watch seriously but that's a
third-generation product that took three
years to get to that point yeah I mean I
don't have much experience with the
Apple watch Sirius 3 but the only reason
why they got
into the Apple watches cuz pebble made
the SmartWatch on Kickstarter that blew
up that's true like that's where the
real innovation started quite honestly
the other thing that I find a little
funny is when they say ambitious
software like dude Apple had the worst
software year in 2017 yeah iOS 11 was a
disaster Barbie alright so and do we
still use these products yeah oh yeah so
we totally still use these products when
they when they were timeout artificial
intelligence as a point of advantage I
think there were more referencing some
of the privacy that Apple has done to
build everything natively with a you
know with the secure chip on device but
beyond that I mean the actual
fundamentals of artificial intelligence
an apple is a well behind in that they
aren't you can say they're innovating in
security for AI but don't say artificial
intelligence is a point of advantage for
them it's not it's not but it's totally
not they're thinking for this year right
this is this is for this year well even
if their project like see the thing is
they're saying for 2018 based on what
they've seen from 2017 right they don't
know exactly what's coming you can't
just guess and say yeah they're the most
innovative in 2018 you don't know this
this is based on their track record of
2017 are they selling noodles and oodles
and tens of millions of products
absolutely but that doesn't that doesn't
validate to me that a company is
innovative yeah a Microsoft Surface
studio
that thing was freaking innovative
Microsoft has although ends going down
hololens is pretty awesome like dude
come on like but those are the products
that we can have that we have now in her
hands that's fine though that's
innovation of me I mean I guess it
depends on how you define innovation and
that's that's what they didn't really
define and the thing that I joked about
in the show is that I said guess who's
gonna have the next big exclusive with
Apple it's probably gonna be Fast
Company and I was totally joking because
you're like oh yeah of course there's
the guess who on their website the next
day put up and I quote in this exclusive
interview with Apple CEO Tim Cook
explains the culture that an approach
that led to iPhone 10 air pods Apple
watching home pod Fast Company posted
that the next day come on that's funny
man this is the press and it whole pod
innovative come on guys it's cool I
can't argue that I can't say that the
home pods innovative because we've seen
them many of them before but in terms of
just sound quality it is great it sounds
awesome can't think of anything else
really this is this is the this is
depressing me like I like fast company
to this is this is the this is like
sucking the teat man this is totally
sucking off the tee I'm not even I could
argue iPhone X because of the face ID
and some other things air pods the first
two that they mentioned are like yeah I
get it but then the last two was like
yeah I don't know I don't know I just I
think a phone that has a fingerprint
sensor under the screen built in is more
innovative recycle that's that's what's
up okay anyways we'll get off on this
just want to let you know though that
Apple was called the most innovative
company I know people that look even if
you're the ultimate fanboy you have to
look in the mirror and be honest with
yourself and you can't tell me that
they're really you really think they're
the most innovative company like really
it's hard to say
not even trying to be a hater I'm just
saying do you really think that like
when someone says who's the most
innovative company do you really think
Apple right off the bat now I don't yeah
I think a lot of people would agree with
you on that like it's hard like I can't
even like think of who is the most
innovative I would I would say Elon Musk
is the most innovative person yeah I
would say SpaceX and Tesla like what
they're doing now you know they're
building all kinds of weird stuff
batteries like battery powered homes and
things like that so it's it's hard to
say right now yeah
Elon Musk is definitely the most
innovative dude out there he's deaf
right he's definitely our current Steve
Jobs our generation Steve Jobs yeah and
like let that dude make whatever he
wants and we'll just go along for the
ride that's how it used to be everybody
I'm just telling you all these young
bucks out there that's how it used to be
all right
um I owe s 11.3 beta 3 recently released
the developers as well as the public
beta users one big omission this time
around though airplay to once part of
the second beta airplay to functionality
no longer in this third beta it's been
completely removed why is that a big
deal well we obviously know airplay 2 is
gonna be a key component to the home pod
to finally bring stereo sound which
would allow you to take to home pods and
use them in concert with each other as
well as have them be your primary
speakers for your Apple TV if you want
that the other thing is that multi room
speaker support will not be there as
well in the beta 2 you could actually
even at least at the very least add an
Apple TV as multiple Apple TVs so you
could play amuse to two different Apple
TVs in two different rooms if you wanted
to that was actually capable in the beta
2 yeah it was a little buggy and whatnot
and the full functionality wasn't there
but they've completely removed it from
iOS 11.3 beta 3 which also makes me
wonder will we see in the fourth beta or
is it gonna get pushed out even further
if it's not even primetime ready to roll
in a beta that that remains to be seen
and we don't know the timeline of when
airplay 2 is officially going to roll
out but uh we'll just have to wait and
see I think was just
to bring up that I thought was a little
interesting all right I'm gonna try and
pronounce this correctly because people
said I didn't really pronounce it
correctly but we also saw how Apple
released the 11 I Oh s eleven point two
point six update which is their eleventh
iOS 11 update to date just want to put
that out there seriously yeah seriously
so it um if you remember this was had to
do with an Indian character from the
Indian language telugu Telugu I called
it first Telugu but it's Telugu from all
indications you can correct me again cuz
we're not we aren't the pronunciation
experts here even English I have trouble
with that apology but there was this
character bug that caused iOS devices to
crash if it was used in messaging app so
some jerks would sometimes like send it
from an Android phone to him heigh-ho
ass bone and cause the apps to crash
anyways that has been fixed with the
latest update to eleven point two point
six with some other bug updates
speaking of software WWDC 2018 possibly
targeting June the 4th through the 8th
MacRumors reports from their own sources
that they have heard it will return to
San Jose
McHenry Convention Center and basically
the entire month is booked out except
for that first week of June which would
be a prime candidate for Apple and WWDC
to drop so we know that the actual way
to get into WWDC is through a lottery so
you have to sign up online and cost
somewhere around fifteen hundred dollars
it's not a guarantee to get in but a
that is expected to be June 4th through
June 8th so a beach you cannot take a
vacation during that week okay to let
you know who Nadine that will be here
I'm sorry June 8 did you need I mean
shoot I've got I've been on vacation
sometimes during those announcements
it's the way it is yeah I did that on
accident one time I think summer oh yeah
I think you did one time they were all
right in this sketch rumor for the week
possible chinese website QQ calm says
the and this is very really
unsubstantiated but i'm just gonna throw
it out there the iphone s
to so many of you asked about this
according this report very keep it this
takes to a grain of salt
it will debut at WWDC with the same kind
of classic metal frame design but with a
larger 4.2 inch display instead of it's
four inch display cool sure it'll have a
faster processor again the thing about
this is all other reports and
indications say that Apple isn't
actively working on a new iPhone se at
least from the manufacturing standpoint
which would make it hard for them to see
it come out in or even be announced at
WWDC even a Ming Chi quote from KGI
security said Apple just doesn't even
have the bandwidth to build a new phone
and there's no indications that they are
like a new form factor period really
with the launch of the iPhone 10 and
everything like that so with what is
already on their plate so we'll see what
happens there
well there's Samet they're slowing down
the iPhone 10 oh yeah Billy so maybe
they're trying to make room for the SE 2
because the first se was so popular oh
yeah and just two quick stories Apple TV
content we'd like to make fun of it
carpool karaoke season 2 is is coming oh
so I gotta tell you this so I got a home
pod right the test and everything and
obviously I signed up for Apple music
and I get it like if you're in the Apple
ecosystem Apple music is nice because
you can just like talk to directly at
pull songs but what I found really
frustrating they're gonna really need to
clean this up is watching video content
through the Apple music service is
absolutely stupid like it's in its own
random section it's they just throw up
all these different videos there's no
organization to it it's just it's just
really messy I would have no idea where
to find that if I went on Apple music
right now just I would be so lost I mean
using iTunes I jumped into first I had
to go into the music area and then it's
not in for you because that's where all
your music is so then you have to go in
to browse and then under browse there's
five different selections new music
playlist TV and movies top charts and
genres it's
if there'd have to clean it's buried and
they're gonna have to clean this up a
lot like I thought it would be really
easy and right in your face to find it
wasn't and so they're gonna really have
to do something about it they're gonna
if Apple is building their content I'm
sure they're gonna launch something else
but when I kept on hearing that they
were hoping to bundle their new shows
and put it within Apple music a it just
doesn't make sense B as it stands right
now it's super messy and not even clean
to get into it's gonna have to be its
own app or its own section on the iTunes
you know in iTunes but they can't this
can't live in Apple music at least the
way it is right now it's really bad it's
bad yeah you you'd figure it would be an
Apple TV I know I don't get it I still
don't get why that what they're OK you
know what the reasoning is behind that
put it in a section in the watch app
that they have it just put it somewhere
an Apple TVs watch app that makes that
obviously makes more sense so we'll see
how they how they navigate that but two
new shows a Apple is working with my boy
not really NBA star Kevin Durant KD KD
KD j5 on a new show called swagger based
on cadiz youth and growing up through
the AAU system playing basketball and
all those kind of struggles and trials
in competition and all the stuff that
happens in that so it's kind of like
growing up to be a basketball star it's
like hoop dreams but based more on Kevin
Durant's life and experiences but also
probably more fictional characters I
don't know I think it sounds kind of
that's one show that I would watch but
see it's funny I say oh I would watch
that everyone listens like I would not
watch that this is interesting it's kind
of neat yeah but like we're not gonna
find it I don't know where honestly I'm
not gonna pay 10 bucks to watch that I
just not gonna pay 10 bucks a month for
that umm and then yeah carpool karaoke
season two is coming so there you have
it those are big stories for the week we
have our voice mail so I say let's jump
into it and get it rolling let's do it
thank you guys all for calling we had a
bunch of good calls this morning couple
that I had to bump them because the the
sound quality was just not up to par
come on oh yeah okay so let's start
number one here we go
I have an idea body contact I mean this
is what the teacher is going to be able
to comfort them I would say that is
really nice yeah I think there will
become public at some point will become
like more than ample if you some more
Thomas and what people have to buy it
more than one device maybe like four
times for them all over the house and
then if they have like any recuerdo they
won't have to worry about like where the
comfort will be located at you will just
fuckin say history I need to say that
yeah that's my kind of like hopes for
the future comfort it absolutely wanted
to be pretty cool anyway sighs you like
have fun make control and thanks so much
I mean nobody think about thanks for
calling man um I will let you know what
I think about I mean it's exactly what
Amazon and Google are already doing with
their echo dots and Google home minis oh
yeah you know having multiple devices
spread around the house
so it's a ubiquitous thing look there's
gonna be a point in time down the road
where these things will like be built
into our light fixtures and we'll just
talk and we won't even have something
plugged into like a little corner that's
like so awesome you just
your home will have it built into the
home in some way shape or form it's not
gonna actually even be a speaker device
per se so yeah you are right but at the
same time Apple won't be the first to
come up with it's already literally
being done we've got plenty of people
that call that own multiple dots or
multiple home minis and it's pretty
sweet so yeah I got a couple dots and
they're like so small to like I can
imagine them to get even smaller but
they're so small they're not in my way
and they're not like intrusive I mean
they are listening to my my whole family
all the time that's a risk I'm willing
to take I guess right now we all are all
right here's another call
but this is a call from Everton grants
in England London basically this is a
call for the HomePath pod basically I
was wondering if they were able to
connect it to the Apple TV because / - I
would like to be able to have it on my
Apple TV fourth generation and if they
can do it that way I can play my music
through through through it that way yeah
do they do that now yeah you bald they
don't do that now but the plan is for
you to be able to take to home pods and
play them in stereo and connect them to
your Apple TV and play those play those
songs the functionality is not there yet
but Apple teased it when they first
announced the home pods it'll be a
software update and it will happen so if
that's your dream I think it was Elton
your dream is coming true
whenever Apple decides to release it you
also in the when he before he said home
party said home pad I thought that was
kind of cool home pad Apple needs to
come up with a new product called the
home pad man it's my crib man it's my
home pad that's just like a whole whole
house Apple house the home pad all right
here we go here's another one this is
short hey this is a mr. peacock here
brought your podcast all the time maybe
you could do some checking out do you
have any plans I'm making a new version
of the iPod touch I know nothing's being
said about that maybe you can do some
checking that out and I'll look forward
for that in your next extra crunchy
podcast thank you know what I really
think so first of all right we know
Apple has basically gotten out of the
iPod Touch business I mean starting at
the iPod business but I think what's
really happening more and more is that
people are ending up using their old
phones and turning them into iPod
Touches like apples not using them
anymore and these products are still
more than good enough to do games surf
the
web and so more than anything I think
our old phones are becoming ipod touches
that are hand down to like kids or
whatnot and that's what's happening out
and quite honestly people there's like a
really like there's a group of people
that really want these but I think you
know what just hand down your phone and
give it to your kids or significant
others that want an iPod touch and and
that's really what it is these days yeah
totally and there you can get them for
super cheap now to go on eBay and stuff
like yeah they're also becoming a lot of
people are just turning them into
security cameras as you can it's easy
okay here we got one one last call very
short one speech and song Tom and
Ocracoke Island North Carolina hey Brian
you wouldn't have to worry about scammer
at home let's just like to work
bye use that mark look I'm working it's
just that I come in to I bounce between
two cities now so I can't always be
there okay
I know people like it when we're
actually in the same room which I do too
but the show is still still rolling just
fine yeah we still have a conversation I
think they're just the audio quality of
all is a little different so I think
that's what people don't don't you think
we could ever do one with a FaceTime
audio let's try it cuz FaceTime audio is
is superior definitely pipe sleep we
should give it a shot one time yeah
let's try to I'll figure out how to make
that happen
okay okay I'm gonna need another Mac
book to make that happen
