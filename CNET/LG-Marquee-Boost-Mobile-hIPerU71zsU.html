here to show you guys the LG Marquee on
boost mobile now you guys might have
already seen this phone on the sprint
network but if you're a prepaid no
contract kind of person you could get it
on boost mobile's 3g network it's two
hundred and eighty dollars it's the most
expensive phone on boost mobile site but
you get a lot of features now the phone
runs on android 2.3 Gingerbread and has
a 1 gigahertz processor inside the phone
has a 4-inch nova display so it's very
very bright the videos and graphics that
I saw looked very vibrant in both indoor
and outdoor lighting on the back there's
a 5-megapixel camera and an LED flash
that could stay on even while you record
in the front there's a 2 megapixel
camera that's perfect for video chatting
now you get all these features in a very
slim design the phone weighs just under
4 ounces on the back there's a matte
coating which is really nice because it
doesn't trap any fingerprints however it
makes the phone really slippery and it
does feel cheap in a plastic kind of way
on the side there's a quick launch key
that you could assign to open any
application what I like here on top is a
little door you can toggle to protect
the microUSB port some things I did
notice was that the display can be a
little sluggish sometimes especially
when browsing the web and when
transitioning back to the home screen
lastly because of the Nova display the
phone eats up battery like crazy so
that's something to keep in mind and
that's pretty much it again this is the
LG Marquee by boost mobile I'm Lynn LA
and you're watching CNN</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
