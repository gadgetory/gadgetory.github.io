iOS 9 public preview and are now
regretting it there is a way to go back
to iOS 8.4 first you'll need the
following things a computer running
itunes version 12.2 or hire a lightning
cable to connect your iDevice to the
computer and internet connection and
some free time because it could take up
to an hour to get the job done now
assuming you followed apples and cnet's
advice to create it iTunes backup before
you install the iOS 9 you'll want to use
the same exact computer to downgrade to
iOS 8.4 it's also important to note that
you won't be able to restore an iCloud
or iTunes backup created when you were
using iOS 9 to a downgrade device
running iOS 8 with that in mind make
sure you have anything you don't want to
lose such as pictures or messages off
the device before you downgrade now
let's get started you will first need to
disable the Find My iPhone feature on
your iOS device head to settings tap
iCloud followed by Find My iPhone and
click off next open itunes on your
computer and connect your iOS device
using the lightning cable once connected
press the power and the home button at
the same time for roughly 10 seconds as
soon as you see the apple logo appear on
the screen let go of the power button
but keep pressing the home button a few
seconds later iTunes will alert you that
has detected an iOS device in recovery
mode click on restore device followed by
restore and update to confirm then tap
next on the iOS 8.4 update window and
agree to the terms of use the file is
just shy of 2 gigabytes so it may take
some time to download your device will
also reboot a few times so just be
patient once it's done you will have a
clean copy of iOS 8.4 installed on your
device as long as you made a backup
before you went to iOS 9 you can restore
all of your old data when given the
option to set up the device as brand new
or restore from a backup select restore
and choose your iOS 8 point for backup
when the restore process is finished you
will find the settings messages photos
and apps just where you left them before
you update it for more tips and tricks
like this one be sure to check out how
to tune it back
