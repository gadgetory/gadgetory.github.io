6100 Wi-Fi range extender from Netgear
now the idea is that you put this one
within the coverage of a existing Wi-Fi
network and it will extend the range of
that network further is always tricky to
find the right spot to put a Wi-Fi rain
extender because if you put it too close
to the existing router where it's
useless because the range remains the
same too far though the signal is too
weak for it to extend now things better
with this one here because come with
this light right here let's show if you
actually put it too far from the
existing router show how you might ask
well I have to go and put it into a one
socket
before I can show you how it is so I'll
be right back just kidding you bring the
camera with me here we go let me plug it
in right here and you can see the light
changing as you can see here the green
here means we are in a good spot if the
light is red when you cut too far away
from the router and if there's no light
well we're completely out of range but
the point is that you still need to be
lucky to use this one effectively what's
the chance of having a one socket
exactly at the sweet spot and one more
thing though this one here take quite a
long time to boot up so it'd have to be
quite patient when testing it around the
house Oh even one more thing this one
here is actually basically a huge power
adapter so when you plug it in be
prepared to lose at least one adjacent
world socket now the e X 6100 here is a
true dual band AC 750 Wi-Fi device that
sounds all good but just few things even
know about it
number one it can extend only one
existing Wi-Fi network at a time for
example if you have a two doing band
Wi-Fi router at home it only work with
either the 2.5 gigahertz frequency band
network or the 5 gigahertz band network
after that is when we park a signal in
two separate bands of it Oh in other
words this one here extend a single
Wi-Fi networking to
- extension Wi-Fi networks and second
why support the latest 802 playing alone
a C Wi-Fi standard it only supports the
single stream setup and that means a top
speed is only 433 megabit per second not
that fast now if all of those how
complicated since we remember one thing
this device here is a lot less cool than
what you can see on its packaging now
the fastest way to connect this extender
here to an existing Wi-Fi network is to
use this WPS button right here that only
works though if you rather support the
Wi-Fi Protected setup otherwise have to
use either the Netgear journey mobile
app or the browser to setup in this case
I find the setup process a little bit
convoluted but still quite easy thanks
to this very clear instruction booklet
now this one he can also work as a Wi-Fi
access point and come with a one gigabit
network port right here to connect it to
an existing router using a cable when
working as an extender the port can also
be used to connect a white device such
as a game console to a Wi-Fi network now
in my testing the exe going hard here
indeed extend the range quite
significantly but the speed of the
extension network is much slower with
much higher latency or delay compared to
the existing Wi-Fi network and that
means is only good for casual internet
surfing and not for RI gaming or media
streaming that's that if you just want
to share the internet for facebooking
emailing I want to see full bars on your
Wi-Fi clients all the time this is a
good device to have for more serious
networking however is not really worth
the $90 price tag especially considering
the fact that it runs quite hard in my
testing and for more on this navigate
here check out my full review at c-calm
basically it makes you happy about the
range extension and not much else
and you do need much else to watch me
in this video right here uninterrupted
and for a moment we truly happen and
that's because I'm dumb no and this has
been the first look at the e egg 6100
Wi-Fi range extender for Netgear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
