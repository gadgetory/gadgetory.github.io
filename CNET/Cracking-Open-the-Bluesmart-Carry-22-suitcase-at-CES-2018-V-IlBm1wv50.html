Jason Heiner and he's bill Detweiler
who's about to crack open a smart
suitcase now bill we've cracked open a
lot of things over the years on the CNET
stage why are we doing a suitcase this
year well you know suitcases are really
interesting you know is we have smart
technology it's being put into more and
more gadgets so you wouldn't necessarily
think that they're gonna be computer
chips and batteries and everything like
that putting into a suitcase but there
are so we've got a smart suitcase here
this is a blue smart one of their
brand-new series two smart suitcases
that does really cool things right so
it'll tell you how much the suitcase
weighs it has a Bluetooth device in a
Bluetooth chip in it that lets you
unlock the suitcase remotely it has
cellular connectivity through 3G it'll
actually tell you where the suitcase is
GPS connectivity right so you lose your
suitcase on a flight you can find out
where it went before the airline knows
rise up in Pittsburgh that's right and
so but all of those cool features take
tech and we're gonna crack this open I'm
going to show you the tech inside that
enables all those great features also
yeah to power all those all that great
tech it requires a battery and so
there's been a little bit of controversy
lately some of the airlines have started
to ban smart suitcases yes on some
flights especially checking them because
they're afraid of the lithium-ion
batteries inside and so I thought it
would be a good idea to show everybody
where those batteries are excellent so
in the past we've done some things with
batteries here on the stage and the
problem with batteries is well they can
catch fire if the batteries are damaged
they can overheat they can catch fire if
they're punctured and so you definitely
don't want fire on an airplane yes all
right so where do we find the batteries
in this guy okay so in the blue smart
bag right here the batteries out
actually all the electronics where most
electronics are all right up here at the
top so if we zip unzip here the inside
lining now normally you would never
really do this at home what you can see
if we can get it over the camera shot is
this piece of plastic and I've already
pre removed to speed things along a few
of the screw
yeah using a little Phillips screwdriver
here I'm gonna put it in here we're
going to take move off some of the
screws
it's got like a cooking show right where
they pre make everything we're going to
pull the screws off here and we're going
to remove one more left to do we're
going to remove the cover and with that
if you'll hold that Jason yep we'll get
to see some of the tech inside now all
right there we go so we can make mother
board right we can see the circuit
boards we can see the cellular modules
we can see the SIM card for the cellular
modules we can see all the connectors a
lot of the contacts for the weight bear
to determine the weight are in the
handle here and then behind all this we
can see the power module right here so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna adjust to
detach some of these cables you're from
the motherboard great like this you can
see some of the chip makers when you
crack these things open on TechRepublic
lots of different tech that you crack
open a lot of times you make note of who
the chip makers are because those are
things that we learn and you know
there's sometimes things that we know
about those chip makers as well as the
fact that it has an impact on those
companies as well right and you know if
you watched a little earlier I was here
with iFixit and they showed us how to
replace the battery in an iPhone 6s yeah
so that's one of the reasons we take
these things apart because we want to
know how they work but also we want to
know how to repair them if they break
and so it's important to see how these
things are put together all right so
here is the module that contains the
battery and the circuit board and all
the chips I'm gonna use a screwdriver
here I'm gonna remove the circuit board
so we can get to the battery that's
underneath right and this is the part
that some of the airlines are concerned
about being dangerous now blue smart
says that their bags conform to all the
FAA standards for safety so they're
trying to work with the airlines and
it's not all airlines it's not something
the government said is a mandatory to
ban these bags yet and there are other
manufacturers of smart bags and that
some of them do have removable batteries
okay actually come out and those are the
bags that the airlines are sort of
allowing through they just don't like
the bags some of the airlines don't our
concern about the batteries that can't
because the FAA hasn't banned all smart
bags
oh and they have AI hasn't done really
anything it's the airlines that are
doing this right now oh he's out of an
abundance of caution okay they don't
want to have the risk of that battery
catching on fire in the cargo hold of
their plane right and so what we're also
going to do is we're going to remove the
two little connectors here from the
power switch that's area we can see the
circuit board right here we've got a lot
of the like I said we've got the
cellular modem here we've got the SIM
card we've got some of the other chips
are here protected by these little metal
cages those are to protect from
electromagnetic interference RF
interference on the other side I'll flip
this over real quick on the other side
there's not much to say sure it's just
the underside of a circuit board so kind
of like the backside of water oh all
right
so Disney that's my my Disney gamer all
right so we're gonna remove these screws
here and if we do that we'll be able to
take the battery pack out and now this
this version of the bag actually has a
longer lasting battery than the previous
version and it's not just to power the
device itself one of the really cool
features about these bags that you can
recharge your cell phone so you know how
when you go on a trip and you don't have
you know you run out of juice you can't
find a plug just plug your uh
smartphone directly into the bag and
boom you've got power again so yes
there's a really handy feature it's a
big this this bag is a big step up from
the first generation bag I tested the
first generation bag blue smart bag for
tech Republic and I found it was not
super useful because it was just
bluetooth it would alert you if you're
getting far away away from your bag but
typically if you have a carry-on you're
not getting that far away but this one
like you said it added the GPS to
cellular technology and the the
ergonomics that the layout of the bag is
a little more practical that one took up
a lot of space for all of the
electronics and and that so this bag
this one's bigger right so you have more
space to put stuff into like the things
you want to take with you your clothes
and whatnot and but it is still
compliant with Rhian standards on all
the US airlines and most international
ones as well
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do one
thing again if you watched the iFixit
segment with me Chris was very careful
in removing the battery and I'm gonna do
the same thing I don't want to damage
this lithium-ion battery so all right
that's where the prop too much right
that's right it's right here it's this
battery pack it's made up of several
different lithium-ion cells and you're
all put together and so you don't want
to puncture this bin this and you know I
don't know about you but airlines don't
seem to be the most delicate with your
luggage right they tend to throw it
around and so not at all even though
this is protected by pretty strong
plastic and again meets FAA standards
they're just worried a little bit about
this could get damaged this could get
punctured this could get bent and that
could cause problems right could start a
fire so we definitely don't want that
okay but that's the smart technology
inside these smart bags so it definitely
I hope it shows people kind of the tech
that it actually takes to make these
devices smart very good so this is a
fairly small set of wires motherboard
battery that that are in this bag how
much does this bag cost and how much
does that add I want it I believe we're
talking four to five hundred dollars
typically for it's a bag four to five
hundred dollars on a bag like this but
then again what would you spend for a
really good quality regular bag right
you'd probably use 300 two or $300
hundred dollars so having a bag that's
about four or five maybe $100 extra so
150 extras if you're a frequent traveler
you like all those features that's
pretty cool especially for business
travels like you and I yeah so it's
gonna in addition to being a nice
high-quality bag it's going to you know
if we recap it's gonna let you charge
your phone from it it's with the battery
it's gonna let you track it in GPS and
cellular and then it's going to also
alert you if you get if it gets too far
far away if somebody thinks walking off
with your bag yeah so that's pretty cool
now you know it's not just bags that all
this smart stuff goes into it's toasters
it's ovens it's refrigerators you know
CNET shows all this stuff off at the
smart home and we've got another really
kind of cool little device that you may
not think that a lot of smart technology
would go into a coffee mug excellent
let's see it so we've got
little bit of time left in the segment
and we've got a this is an ember a
ceramic coffee mug now ember came out a
couple years ago they showed it off kind
of at last CES with a travel mug just
late last year they came out with a
ceramic version of that for people that
don't want a travel mug all the time and
this is really cool it keeps your coffee
warm there's a smartphone app that goes
along with it that determines the
temperature lets you set the perfect
temperature
it's coffee warm for about an hour it'll
let you set it for different people for
different users if you want that I
really like this hot coffee tastes a
little better you can see the coils on
the bottom are our viewers can that's
right so so how does that all work and
yeah is it gonna communicate with your
smartphone it's gonna have power well
it's got similar kind of technology in
the plastic base and I'm gonna show you
why blue smart says don't put this in a
microwave
don't push it put this in the dishwasher
right this this or I'm sorry amber says
Cobras in the microwave don't put this
in the dishwasher we're going to call
her hand-washing all hand washing so
we're gonna cut this open as quickly as
I can without trying to hit the batter
right this is gonna require a dremel
here and some safety goggles we've got
some safety for Jason if we're gonna
throw these on real quick if you hit the
battery keep in mind if you hit the
battery it will start smoking so we're
gonna try to avoid that I've cracked one
of these open before you you'll actually
able to see this in the upcoming issue
of CNET magazine and I know where the
battery is so we're gonna do our best
not to do that and I should mention you
know Bill's been doing this for a long
time since 2006 and so I like to say
that you know Bill has the patience of a
saint in the hands of a surgeon to do
these kinds of things we've had other
people do some cracking opens for
technical public at different times and
when we did it didn't go well
usually we can it came back in a pile of
parts so this one gives us an
opportunity to show you
the deafness that you know bill has in
doing these things this is the most
challenging part when we have to crack
something open when we actually have to
cut it open with something like a dremel
I'm gonna put my glasses back on because
there's some stuff lying around as you
can see so if you're doing these at home
one of the reasons that we do them on
TechRepublic
is so that you can get a guide to what
to do if you want to you know open up
some technology that you have if you
want to repair something like your your
suitcase or you want to either
experiment with opening something up
that you've got or repair a product that
you have that has malfunction so you can
find lots of cracking open galleries and
articles that bill is done on
TechRepublic
you can also find cracking open videos
that we do on CNET of many of the same
products so again right bill we crack it
open so that you don't have to or that
if you so that if you are you've got a
guide you know what to do so we're
getting through this a little bit can
see the crack in here what the problem
is it's a battery I go slow because I
know that the lithium ion battery is
right behind this okay
the smoke that's coming out isn't from
the battery it's just from the plastics
it's nothing here yeah and it does take
a little bit of time I don't know what
will the weather will get through the
whole thing during this segment we're
gonna give it the old college try
okay so we've cracked open all kinds of
things over here we've cracked open
every iPhone all the big Android phones
in many cases we've cracked open Xboxes
robots all kinds of things so again you
can find those some of them we do for a
little bit of entertainment but mostly
we're also trying to learn about the
technology every time we do one of these
cracking opens so you can also find some
of bills cracking opens in CNET
magazines where we'll take the photos
and lay them out and tell the story of
cracking these open as well
glasses off since I'm a little further
away now but you see things flying off
of there and so you know this can be a
little bit of a dangerous gig with that
you can see bill taking all the safety
precautions that he does all right we're
almost real quick I don't know if we'll
be able to do it I'm rushing okay
but with safety in mind you know we
always want to be careful now obviously
you know one of the things we've always
done Jason is you and I have always
taken things apart because we do we
don't believe in wasting these things we
try not to damage them - yep but we've
always tried to put them back together
again sometimes you just can't do this
obviously you know if you were here on
the stage couple years ago you saw me
take off take apart the bb-8 yeah and
there's just no way to put this back
together again
kinda like Humpty Dumpty right once we
use the Dremel that's not going back
together but you know every iPhone that
you've taken apart has gone back
together and we've used it for for app
testing and product testing afterwards
you take it apart a lot of laptops
tablets many other technologies and I
can count when it when you didn't have
to take out the Dremel you know I can
count on one hand the number of things
that didn't go back together because we
are trying to learn from the technology
and they don't just destroy it not just
destroy it we can hear all right all
right show you guys we just got a few
minutes left I was able to cut through
it all all right here we go there we are
so it's gonna crack here normally I'd be
a little bit more delicate with this but
I'm gonna show you the battery inside of
it see this big protective case right
there this is the battery that actually
powers all the smarts inside and so you
don't want to put this obviously in your
microwave it's filled with metal and
circuit boards if you were to heat that
up in the microwave that's a bad idea
same thing with water you don't want to
get water inside of this in the wash
dishwasher so all hand washing only yes
so where's the motherboard and that is
that in the piece right actually no it's
actually right underneath the battery is
it a circular circuit board found
underneath the battery there's
interesting these cables right here they
connect to temperature sensors inside
the mug and there's also a heating
element under here
obviously you would have to keep the
liquid warm right your coffee your tea
whatever it is you have and so there's a
heating element under there there's a
little bit of insulation as well and if
you kind of want to see everything
that's in here definitely check out next
month's issue or the next issue of CNET
magazine there's a full photo spread of
me taking this apart in there nice so
how much does this cost Val so the this
mug is about 80 bucks now you say that's
a lot for a coffee mug but you know I'll
tell you what I like my coffee I drink
it every day I like my hot you're gonna
keep it at 80 dollars is just fine for
me yeah what else does it do other
sensors what does it tell does it tell
you does it know you know what your
preference is to drink it does you set
the PERT you set the temperature it'll
keep the liquid at that temperature
it'll also detect whether or not there's
liquid in it or not so the commode is
always on it's only gonna heat when
you've got liquid in it very good
all right thanks so much bill
interesting to see what's inside the
smart suitcase and the smart mug okay we
got to take a break next we've got Brian
Tong and the TV team to talk about the
best TVs of CES 2018 stay with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
