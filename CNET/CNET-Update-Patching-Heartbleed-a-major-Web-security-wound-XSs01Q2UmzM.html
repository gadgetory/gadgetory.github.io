secure as they seem I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update folks we
have to have a talk about heartbleed
it's a cool sounding name given to a
serious security flaw that many major
websites are scrambling to fix including
Amazon Yahoo and google and it means we
will have to refresh our passwords for
many websites explaining heartbleed can
get pretty technical but here's a simple
way to think about it when you're on a
web site entering in your secure
information like a password or credit
card info there's a little padlock icon
near the URL to let you know the website
is encrypted and your data is private
well there's this open source system
that many sites have been using for
encryption it's called open SSL and it
had a leak someone could trick a server
into sharing the encrypted data and even
share the keys to unlock the encryption
it's believed that about two-thirds of
websites were vulnerable to this flawed
security system and what's worse is that
the problem has existed for the past two
years and security experts had no idea
if someone has been taking advantage of
this bug to steal info it leaves no
trace there are no fingerprints left
behind so websites don't even know if
they were compromised that's comforting
so what can you do I mean besides get
angry at the Internet well the smart
thing to do is to wait for websites to
announce that they have patched the
problem then you can change your
password big sites like yahoo and google
have fixed the issue but not all smaller
sites may have plugged the leak just yet
also keep a close eye on your banking
statements for any fraudulent activity
which you should always do anyway let's
move on to a different kind of privacy
facebook privacy the social network has
admitted that sometimes it's privacy
settings can be confusing so it's making
some changes if you haven't touched your
privacy settings in a while you'll get a
pop up with a little dinosaur asking you
to double check your settings in case
you didn't realize you've been making
all your post public and on the facebook
iOS app you may have noticed that the
audience selector which was on the lower
right corner is now clearly visible on
the top of your status forum
Facebook will also add more descriptions
to what public means on the desktop
drop-down menu and as more of us watched
video online and cut the cable
subscription there's another streaming
video option making its debut Sesame
Street go offers on-demand access to
hundreds of full-length episodes of the
classic children's program and it can be
accessed on any device at Sesame go calm
Sesame Street go is brought to you by
the number four because it'll cost you
four dollars a month that's your tech
