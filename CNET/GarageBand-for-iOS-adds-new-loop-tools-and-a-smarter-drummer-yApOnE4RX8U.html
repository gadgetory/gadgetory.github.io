music recording app it combines a lot of
the features you see in your
professional digital audio workstation
the big new feature in this latest
version of GarageBand is actually an
entirely new interface called live loops
and that lets you stack up all sorts of
about samples and loops you can either
use imported ones ones that apple
provides you can record your own or just
play entire stacks with them just kind
of like this where you can just play a
whole row of them that you've set up
beforehand and that lets you do a lot of
on-the-fly arranging and music creation
and let's say you're doing some sort of
DJ performance thing and you want to
actually play samples like an instrument
that's a cool way to do this or if you
just have a bunch of samples you've been
working on but also of course the
traditional recording interface that
they still have an advantage some new
features to that this looks a lot more
like traditional music recording you see
all the tracks I've recorded here and I
can control the volume with the tracks
and you can do you know virtual
keyboards and guitars or you can
actually use the built-in mic or plug in
a mic and record your own the big new
addition here is something called
drummer and that is an AI drummer that
is found in Logic Pro that is now made
its way to GarageBand and what that lets
you do is open up a drum track and then
you can pick the drummer there are
several styles of drummer and then once
you pick one you can then decide if you
want the drum beat they play to be more
complex or simple louder quieter there's
a lot of variation there and if you do
it right it really sounds like a live
drummer that sort of adapts as you
record the rest of your song kind of
gets rid of that robotic loop feeling
there's a lot more you can do in
GarageBand that we can go into here
there are cool effects you can apply the
tracks is like you do a timely go in and
edit the individual MIDI notes and even
do all sorts of automation it's a super
powerful tool that still has a very
casual
were friendly edge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
