concept cars on the International Auto
Show circuit and to be honest a lot of
them bore me nowhere
are there more pipe dreams and BS that's
never heard of again but a few standout
as important fascinating and actually
going to change the market
I'm Brian Cooley with my top five
favorite concept cars from recent
international auto shows number five the
new concept Subaru WRX now the WRX is
Subarus hero car without it they really
wouldn't have less street cred
they'd have none at least not until the
BRZ earns its legendary stripes so the
WRX concept that came out of the 2013
New York Auto Show has a distinctive and
appropriate new style that's important
to notice in other words it looks badass
and not in that sort of hotly homely way
that the current WRX does sorry owners
no details have been confirmed about its
future powertrain but they're not gonna
stray far from the boxer turbo all-wheel
drive combo of the current car number
for the Lexus LF c see the lf-cc makes
my list because it could redefine a big
piece of what you think when I say Lexus
without being utterly unlikely for that
company to get its head around it was
lost at the 2012 Paris Show it's got
this high-strung two and a half liter
turbo four-cylinder engine plugged into
the most popular hybrid system in the
world Toyotas LED headlights nestled
behind the best iteration yet of that
Lexus spindle grille and a center
console with a huge vertical main LCD
screen really anchors the inside you
would laugh at that feature if it
weren't for the Tesla Model S already
doing it so this is a car to watch
number three Porsches Panamera sport
Turismo concept now if Porsche calls
this Panamera concept the sports car of
tomorrow where does that leave the 911
let's not think about that instead let's
focus on this Panamera concepts but the
most hideous part of the current car
Porsche did what they should have done
in the first place and made it
this is also envisioned as a lithium-ion
plug-in hybrid lashed to a three liter
supercharged v6 which is sort of what
they do now in their hybrids LED
headlights up front and the taillights
are ripped off from the latest 911
Outback finally it's not a pain to look
at the number two car on my list is not
a car at all it's a truck
the Ford Atlas concept it's clearly an
accurate weather vane of where the next
f-series is gonna land when it arrived
at the Detroit Auto Show the 2013 in
January we noted how Ford plans to keep
moving v8 out of the spotlight that was
once considered the third rail of pickup
truck design but now Ford's turbo v6
trucks handily outsell their v8 the
Atlas envisions that kind of efficient
power with active body aerodynamics like
this cool louvered grill the power
ladder brace in the back probably not
going to production but in a round view
camera system very likely will theirs
trailer backup assist to help you kind
of make sense of that backward world of
backing a trailer up and turning the
opposite way that you think you should
that always throws me and there's also
tech to coordinate the hitch with the
actual pickup on the back on the screen
display so you can line things up when
you're hitching up by yourself keeps you
from looking like a fool
my number-one concept car in recent
times is the Nissan Terra the Terra SUV
is way out there it's a real concept car
in case you didn't notice suicide doors
and fuel cell power and that face give
it away but what made a lasting
impression on me at the 2012 Paris show
was how the Terra envisions some bold
but believable trends like the idea that
a tablet docked inside becomes the
instrument panel the navigation and the
entertainment system it's even the way
you unlock and start the car putting
electric motors at each of the four
wheels is also an idea whose time has
likely come offering this highly
addressable powertrain and a reduction
of weight and mechanical complexity now
they just gotta throw out that sheet
metal and start again if you want to
stay on top of all the new concept cars
coming out of the big world auto shows
