worth the upgrade if you have a newer
iPhone or iPad model chances are you
probably won't regret it so here's a
look at ten of my favorite features the
first one it's pretty hard to miss just
raise your phone for a quick time check
or to glance at your notifications
without having to press any more buttons
catching a candid shot is now just a
swipe away raced away and slide left
from the lock screen to launch the
camera and shave a few seconds off the
set-up time finding photos on your phone
just got easier click the albums tab to
see your camera roll sorted by people
and places or just use the search bar to
narrow down by date location or even
name now to put a name to a face just
click on the image hit details people
and add name at the top
this one has been on our wish list since
the beginning of i/os time and that
folder of useless apps will finally quit
cluttering your home screen press and
hold as you would with any other app and
exit out once and for all
you still can't choose what settings you
can access into your control center but
at least now you have more options
thanks to 3d touch press down on any of
the four icons on the bottom row to
access more settings options without
leaving the home screen don't feel like
listening to yet another telemarketer
pitch tap on the unknown number on your
voicemail page to see a full
transcription of the message it's not
perfect and it's only available in
English for now but it's gonna get
better this one is a lifesaver if you've
ever had to write in more than one
language now you won't have to switch
keyboards or risk an autocorrect
nightmare once you've installed the
second language on your phone the
keyboard will automatically detect which
one you're typing in forget the bells
and whistles the best feature of the
updated messaging app is the ability to
preview the link inside your own chat
window Siri will be able to control more
than just Apple's own apps in iOS 10
Siri send out whatsapp message to mom
you can use her to Hale a car send a
message send money or even order pizza
and if you're a sucker for sing-alongs
Apple music now lets you belt out your
favorite Adele song right from the app
start playing the song click to maximize
the tab and scroll down just be warned
that not all songs have this option tape
me up with some of your favorite
features and for more tips and tricks on
iOS 10 make sure to check out see Netcom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
