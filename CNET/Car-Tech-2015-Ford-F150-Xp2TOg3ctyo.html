afford to screw up its the f-150 not the
Mustang not the fusion this guy this is
the sales champ and it's a critical high
profit product as well but they've
pushed it forward into a lot of
high-tech dimensions that are going to
require a little bit of accommodation if
you will by the truck buyer but I like
it because they're all going high-tech
let's take a look the biggest story is
the technology of materials they pulled
some 700 pounds out of the weight of the
f-150 much of it by having an aluminum
body just about everything you see on
the outside of the vehicle is now
aluminum that's a big change for the
truck market the other third or so comes
out of high-strength steel being used in
the latter frame which is tougher
lighter but less sort of bulky as the
steel goes but there's still steel
underneath this guy this is gonna make
for a very different animal when you go
to the body shop as well body shops are
still trying to get their heads wrapped
around with the idea of aluminum repair
now when you take 700 pounds out of your
vehicle you get to do some interesting
things with how you power it including
this headline grabber a 2.7 liter v6
ecoboost that means direct injection and
turbo charging this is seen as heresy by
some in the truck world where anything
below a v8 is seen as just not enough to
move a proper truck but this is a small
displacement v6 on top of just having
too fewer cylinders than tradition what
we're seeing here is an engine that is
yet to have its horsepower or economy
specified that will come later as Ford
gets closer to late 2014 release but
notice this guy's got standard auto
start/stop technology that's also
interesting in a full-size pickup
although it's defeatable readily in
all-wheel-drive mode or at any time
because truck demands can be so
different than regular car and also
carrying on over three and a half liter
v6 that's actually the base engine the
current engine and a five liter v8 the
6.2 liter v8 bye-bye inside lots of
chunky controls it's still very truck
like in here for the first time ever
they'll offer 360 around view cameras
front back there's one of the tailgate
there and one underneath each mirror
that's really nice in a truck when you
are often trying to get very near things
for loading going between tight spaces
and a big V
things like that you can get LED
headlights optionally I think that's
unique in this category
lots of LED lighting around the vehicle
in general and if you want it there's a
panoramic sunroof option which is a
little odd in a cabin that is not all
that huge compared to a car but it's
there now of course as usual the f-150
will come in lots of trim levels and
many of what I've shown you are actually
optional technologies so if you feel
like a truck needs to be simple dumb and
rugged that'll be available as well but
it's clear the American truck market is
not just about being all-american high
horsepower and having big payload and
towing capacity
it's about being smarter as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
