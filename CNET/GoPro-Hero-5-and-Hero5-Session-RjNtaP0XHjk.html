GoPro the brand new action camera and if
you're familiar with any of the previous
cameras from GoPro you'll notice that
the sky looks a bit different first up
there is no physical button at the front
to control instead you just have a
screen here one physical button up top
and everything else is controlled
through this two inch touchscreen at the
back the camera feels a little bit
different - and that's because it's now
waterproof without the casing so
normally you're familiar with a camera
like this with the casing that is
totally waterproof however now without
you can dunk it up to 33 feet or 10
meters underwater and you don't need to
be concerned whatsoever it is fully
sealed and fully waterproof
now there's also GPS onboard - so it can
keep track of your location and the big
thing about menu GoPros is the voice
controls people say things like GoPro
start recording though so stop recording
and more you can take a burst series of
images just there using your voice you
don't have to rely on physical buttons
and that's the same
4005 session which is the smaller
edition of the groper that has pretty
much most of the same features as the
girl or 5:05 however it's much smaller
it doesn't have GPS and it doesn't have
raw video capture so this one is going
to be 299 dollars and the fury flat
black is going to be a three hundred and
ninety-nine dollars stay tuned to CNN as
we'll have plenty more hands-on
impressions and we're just going to go
and take this mountain biking ziplining
and more and higher in California so
stay tuned we'll have lots more footage
and lots more impressions were you
really see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
