Ben Fox ribbon hearing aids are getting
much much smarter our latest tech
enables story looks at how hearing aids
are starting to connect to smart homes
incorporate fitness trackers and AI and
eventually even read your glucose levels
the point here is to make these hearing
aids more appealing more affordable
because there's actually a ton of people
who deal with hearing loss don't even
know it from it's the numbers pretty
stagnant 48 million Americans or a fifth
of the country deal with some degree of
hearing loss right where they don't like
hearing aids and so don't use it
there's absolutely negative stigma with
hearing aids they're bulky you know
they're they don't last long battery
wise smartwatches I guess but know that
there is definitely negative stigma here
and we talked to companies like Otakon
and Starkey who have all kinds of crazy
plans for for their hearing aids okay
let me ask you something why would you
need to connect a hearing aid to smart
home devices so this is it's a great
question there's the the sort of an
opening anecdote for my story
this this woman who uses this Otakon
open hearing aid which is an
internet-connected one basically she
says she as soon as she puts it on and
turns it on she has the coffee maker
making brewing coffee she has the lights
in her bathroom turn on she basically
has like a morning routine that's
triggered by her turning on her hearing
aid well and because she had deals with
hearing loss when someone rang the
doorbell that doorbell chimes streams
right to her ear all right that actually
makes a lot of sense that's pretty cool
one of the examples her daughter also
has the same condition she places her
iPhone right next to a professor near
the lectern so that she can understand
hear the lecture has its dream stranger
here Wow no kidding is a lot of this
stuff already like available on the
market what's the pricing the Otakon
hearing aid is available to market there
isn't pricing because and they need to
kind of talk about it because it's kind
of different depending on your situation
your insurance so they were kind of
hesitant to talk about it some of the
stuff from Starkey is really interesting
that they're thinking about one coming
out this year will incorporate a motion
sensor which allows you to one mate
use it as a fitness tracker but also
it'll be able to detect if if you've
fallen and actually contact 9-1-1 or at
least alert a loved one that something
might be wrong
later features will incorporate AI well
corporate like I said that a glucose
sensor non-invasive glucose sensor they
really try to make these things that
like a Swiss Army knife of utility mmm
interesting all right next up face book
came out yesterday with some new tools
and ways to restrict third-party apps
from using your data oh and they also
snuck in a revelation at the end that
that Cambridge aleca data breach didn't
just affect 50 million people in fact 87
million do you feel like this happens
all the time wasn't that that happened
with the was at the Equifax for each
channel so there was like three million
people were affected no wait is 300
billion that's pretty much it they
didn't really say why they it was after
this long blog post it's also a sentence
at the end oh by the way yeah 87 million
people think surprised CEO Mark
Zuckerberg on a call with journalists
and he said all the right things he took
responsibility for this but plenty of
plenty questions left for this this
whole saga from rich nieves story from
yesterday Zuckerberg made clear he
doesn't plan to step down as CEO big
surprise there and so far he hasn't
fired anyone in connection to the
scandal wait to see if that actually
happens quote from Zuckerberg which I'd
like to throw out there it's not enough
to give people a voice we have to make
sure that people are not using that
voice to spread disinformation
all right so Amazon key is out or Amazon
is out with some new features for key
Ben break down forest Amazon key is
essentially this in home delivery
service from Amazon today they expanded
part of Amazon key nationwide not the
delivery service but certain elements
like keyless entry remote lock and
unlock and guest access and that could
you know potentially Chum the water to
get them to do in a home delivery at
some point later down the line
nationwide all right for more of those
stories check us out seen it I'm Roger
Cheng I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks for
listening
all right it's time for me to go ahead
and jump back into the chat and I'll see
you all there with all your riveting
comments and questions I think this
hearing aid thing is very fascinating I
have a lot of relatives who have
suffered from hearing loss and some of
these activations and inclusions that
come with it I think are pretty darn
cool but you don't think about them like
the revelation that you had with oh it
starts your daily routine or the the
student can hear the lecture that those
are just incredible innovations that you
wouldn't think of and you know necessity
is the mother of invention is that the
tert what's the phrase yes yeah but I at
the same time and I don't want to make
too light of this all I could picture in
my head with that routine one which is
the one that interested me because like
I'd love to have that but I could just
picture the scene from Honey I Shrunk
the Kids
when Rick Moranis gets up and all of the
other just start making him breakfast
it's like I want my life wait doesn't
doc do that also and back to the future
at the very beginning right with the
yeah it does it's like a whole like it's
like all the mad scientist yes or the
science geeks in the 80s that's what
they did actually made breakfast
writers toast and eggs yeah they all
made like uh what it what are they
called forbidden Goldberg machines yes
yeah no Rube Goldberg Rube Goldberg
machines like let's let's try to give
the Rubin Goldberg machines guy who
shows up late for the podcast shots
fired
continued on guys please cuz I'm still
I'm still diggin for some comments all
right one other thing that I wanted to
mention about Amazon ki we didn't get to
is that and we mentioned this a little
bit pre-show is that it's still unclear
whether anybody's really using this from
the CNET reviews on the cloud cam which
is their own security camera it seems
that that is a really capable security
camera and I would assume that that's
selling pretty well I have no reason to
believe that it isn't but Amazon ki and
Gen like the whole service yeah the
whole service which is the in home
delivery stuff eventually
supposed to include home services like
you would allow a dog walker to come in
walk your dog bring the drive back lock
the door that still appears to me to be
maybe a little bit ahead of its time
maybe a little Google glass it is
definitely there's a psychological wall
that they have to break through to get
people to really be comfortable with
that right and Amazon is like a very
trusted company that's what I generally
like a lot of the polls say about it and
folks still really pay well it's that
weird dynamic where like you probably
trust Amazon more than you trust like
the local dog walker I guess that's
that's kind of the issue the dog walker
that they wouldn't burn or a plumbing
service right right if you don't know
the plumber exactly were you know the
house cleaner that kind of thing yeah so
but it's it's I haven't met people that
use Amazon key I'd certainly I don't
know maybe I'll try it at some point
right I know they're doing a sale right
now we'll say I wanted to jump back at
the conversation with hearing aids
because beyond the hearing aid makers
the sort the other aspect of the story I
didn't really get into during the taping
was the fact that big-name companies
like Bose Harman Kardon which is owned
by Samsung are also working on these
things there was a law passed last year
that basically made it a lot easier for
folks that get hearing aids there was
sort of a sort of step-down
non-prescription version of hearing aids
for basically care of this trend that's
called augmented hearing as interesting
and fascinating seeing what these
companies are doing bose is talking
about by using some of their noise
cancellation technology to filter out
background noise and like yeah direct
the mics towards the person in front of
you from what I understand from some
some folks that I know in my life from
what I understand that is a very
critical element to actually getting
people to use a hearing aid because I
don't need a hearing aid I haven't used
to hearing aid but from what I
understand from folks that have tried it
it'll just raise the volume on
everything and it may be right which is
not gold yeah not helpful at all right
that's the thing like if you if you hear
all the background noise everything like
it's still just noise so I'll be able to
kind of isolate and find the right
source
or you know actually what you want to
hear is really critical and sort of
taking it to that next step like the
idea that these headphones might for
hearing aids might eventually be able to
block out people that you don't want
hear oh my god how many times are we
going to go back to black beer just
block their faces too while you're at it
unfriend no I mean look I the folks I
talked to said like it's the technology
is possible I don't think you'd actually
want to do this but it's it's definitely
possible down the line I don't like it
at all
Alex Alex Mitchell confers with some of
your comments about the filtration he
says his dad uses hearing aids that then
you can change the different settings
and pair it to your phone listen to
music and override noisy restaurants
that kind of stuff
Danny Green says we need one that my
mother cannot lose and syringe or
expands on size and how long until we
see these turn into implants there so
there are other parents there's cochlear
implants that that basically can replace
think it's the ear drum or something
that basically can stream in just like a
regular hearing aid so the implants are
definitely out there already right and
those are generally for people that are
very hard of hearing or were born
without the ability to hear at all um so
the cochlear implants are they're not
considered hearing aids they're yeah
good their surgical operation that you
need - yes absolutely they they like
many hearing aids in the market they're
there they also follow this made for
iPhone program that basically they're
they're kind of synced up so like the
example I gave of the daughter
putting her iPhone near the lectern so
she could hear the the professor voice
streaming in tahrir that works with
cochlear implants as well so there there
are a number of hearing aids and devices
that have that made for iPhone I believe
there's a there's also a version for
Android as well but there was a bass ya
know if the mobile is actually gone
they've been pretty good about making
accessibility part of the smartphone
experience sure so how long until we see
Alexa or Siri
paired into these devices fantastic
question we actually addressed that
Starkie particular had talked about
incorporating digital systems wouldn't
say specifically which but definitely
talked about the idea of having visual
assistant where you would just say Alexa
I think you'd probably tap your hearing
aid that's pretty century I mean if I
think if you the problem with saying it
is that would require a Harriet to
always be on listening for that wake
word I guess and that might drain the
battery yeah I've talked to those folks
at Qualcomm is that they've trying to
address this with like smaller more
power efficient processors but for a
hearing aid Syrians are the ones I've
seen are tiny so for that to be able to
handle a digital assistant and be able
to listen for one I think it's gonna
take a little bit longer I think what
they would need is that Star Trek
technology where you just have the paper
badge
yeah the badge I didn't like the badge
because it was like basically
speakerphone like you he's spoken and
like everyone heard what the other
person was saying I guess that's true so
expand on that expand on that Josh boy
does says do smart hearing aids have
longer or shorter battery life than the
traditional hearing aid and how are we
looking for the future prospects for
longevity that that's fantastic question
to do so the Otakon product I saw I mean
they they produce several days of
battery life and this is an
internet-connected Bluetooth connected
device you know they told me that they
had to do a lot of work to kind of make
it work last as long as it does and it's
also it's really just about sound
processing right it doesn't have
anything else which is why it's able to
kind of run as long as it can hmm I
think battery life has definitely give
me a challenge though for hearing
especially as you add more capabilities
into these things you have to be mindful
of how long they last and how big they
are they still are all pretty tiny so so
uh space the back of the battery right
it would be interesting to see where
they could go with that CPR tech Dillon
says do you so to go from music or a
phone call to a TV you have to go
through different pairing sequences or
is it all fairly seamless I haven't
tried it myself but so I can't really
say for sure
how seamless the processes of like
streaming in one thing versus another I
would imagine it's a lot of that it's
probably run by the app like Oh buddy
Kahn has an app for it it's hearing aid
so imagine you've managed your
preferences just like I imagined my
preferences for the Bose headphones that
I have I have an app for that streams in
which which devices are like the
priority devices sure let's move on to
Amazon real quick because everybody's
sick of talking about Facebook I Huey
let YAG seems like Amazon is trying to
lock people into an ecosystem is that
likely we will see other companies I eat
alphabet try something similar I think
we're ready past that point who doesn't
have an eco Google already totally locks
into an ecosystem Apple lock system
Amazon has it it's like a it's an
ecosystem but society is skewed one
because it's not really devices base is
more you know it's more devices baby
it's more purchase based right it's more
like I guess you get out make the
argument that it's also more it's become
more media based as well with you know
prime video but really the core is
shopping and these devices are more
answering whereas like Apple Google
you're like you're tied to their devices
and services mm-hmm yeah and with Google
it's like search based it's always like
you get you back to the Google search
because that's where they make all their
money but yeah it's a really competitive
space and that's why Amazon keeps
rolling out new stuff because it wants
to make sure that it's one step ahead of
the competition and smart home is
definitely moving its tie I don't know
how many echo speakers or Google home
speakers some of the listeners have but
I have way too many in my house I mean
how long until they're literally locked
in an ecosystem because the smart locks
are now sensitive and you betrayed
Amazon's trust and you are not allowed
to leave your home and pray because by a
guy on your prime member says that's
like that's next week yeah yeah no
that's I mean that would be that would
be kind of a safe like you've missed
your payments like the doors for but
sorry yeah like all of a sudden like
they can't do that yeah so let me out
let me out yeah but like I don't know a
lot of people that use smart door locks
but the security camera stuff going back
to what I said before Smart Security
came
as internet-connected security cameras
whether their baby cams or just regular
security cameras those have existed for
years there are a lot of companies that
provide them you know I like buying one
from Amazon to me it doesn't seem that
much of a stretch than anybody else by
its some of that stuff like the door
locks might be a little bit harder for
people to jump on to it's like we
watched 2001 a Space Odyssey and
everyone went yeah that let's do that
that was not the point guys it was
supposed to be a warning I mean that
being said and I think I've mentioned
this on the podcast before to me it
really is it is an innovation for sure
and the potential for it to
significantly change the way people live
yeah how they experience services not
having to wait around for the cable guy
all day all that potential is there
whether people want the trade-off is
another question entirely and but but I
think people should recognize why Amazon
wants to do this because there is a lot
of potential there sure it's not it's
not just like a punching bag of like oh
this is this is ridiculous they just
want to you know control your front door
they just want to control more things
yeah we are almost out of time we have
to cut it short a little bit today but
do you guys have any closing thoughts
about where these I just I always love
hearing about these tech enabled stories
yeah it's the most uplifting thing and a
sea of I know exploded till I moved
those stories good points our program
yes definitely served a nice bit of nice
bright point in tech I missed all the
terribleness of the rest of the week so
yeah yeah the series continues we'll
have another story coming out tomorrow
as well as next week any any leads on
what might be coming down the line you
can leak out it was curious we won't be
on the podcast tomorrow but Maggie rune
has great piece on sort of the the
various apps are being created there
they're sort of like to fill the hole
for accessibility information venues
like basically being able to find out
whether or not this restaurant how
accessible this restaurant is you see
ratings for almost like a Yelp for
accessibility say they should just
integrate that right into Yelp or Google
Maps
there there and there are almost like
these accessibility parties these
gatherings where people go from place to
place checking out various venues and
sort of as a group kind of crowdsourcing
and sharing the information to the wider
public of how accessible this particular
restaurant is or this bar so we've got
that and we've got a couple we've got
another one on diabetes tech early next
week
we've got at least one more store coming
out I don't want to tease that because
it's not quite finished yet but stay
tuned for attitude yeah these are these
are all fasting stories I definitely
encourage you guys to check out the tech
enabled collection on our site as well
as the various stories fantastic and
before we go I want to wish everybody a
happy annual CSS naked day celebrated
every year since 2006 this is a day that
challenges websites to remove links to
CSS files and show the nitty-gritty
realities of HTML that was not what I
thought it was yeah okay yeah all right
I was worried about the worst right all
right all right yeah if you liked
anything you saw or heard here check us
