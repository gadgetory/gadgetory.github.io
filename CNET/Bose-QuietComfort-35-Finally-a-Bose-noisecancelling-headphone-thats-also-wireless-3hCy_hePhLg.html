have been waiting for it the
QuietComfort 35 and active
noise-cancelling headphone that's also
wireless at $350 it costs more than the
wired quiet comfort 25 but at least it's
only a $50 price bump which puts this
right around what beats competing
headphone costs like this
similar-looking qc25 this is a
lightweight very comfortable headphone
and you get the same quality of noise
cancellation that you get from the qc25
with microphones inside and outside the
air cups Bose says the QC 35 senses
measures and sends unwanted sounds to
two proprietary digital electronic chips
one for each year that respond with a
precise equal and opposite signal in
less than a fraction of a millisecond
the headphones also equipped with the
new digital equalizing system that
balances the sound whether you're
listening at lower or higher volumes
battery life is rated at 20 hours which
is quite good and there's an integrated
remote on the right ear cup with buttons
for adjusting the volume and answering
an ending calls as well as controlling
playback you can also use this as a
wired headphone available in silver or
black the QC 35 is designed to be used
as a wireless headset and it's a good
one
it muffles ambient sounds like wind in
the crowd noise so colors can hear you
better and you can hear callers better
there's also a side tone feature that
allows you to hear your own voice in the
headphone as you speak so you don't
raise your voice while talking this
isn't the only new wireless Bluetooth
noise cancelling headphone in boses
lineup in September the quiet control 30
arrives for $300
that's a neck band cell in your
headphone that offers variable levels of
noise cancellation and is essentially
the wireless version of the QC 20 my
personal preference leans toward the
quiet control 30 but if you're looking
for a full size wireless bluetooth
headphone with best-in-class noise
cancellation the ultra-comfortable
QC 35 is awfully tempting I'm David Carr
noise thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
