injection-molded stainless steel in your
headphone that retails for $200 hi I'm
David Carr noise and welcome to another
CNET first look video in case you've
never heard of RHA it's a scottish
headphone company and it's clearly taken
great care in designing the t10 eye both
on the outside and inside you'll find a
handmade dynamic driver that the company
says it's engineered to reproduce all
genres of music with high levels of
accuracy and detail the headphones also
include a tuning filter system that
allows for a frequency response
customization it's a feature we've seen
on a few high-end in ears in the past
but you don't usually see it in a $200
headphone everything about the t10 eye
seems well crafted from the housings to
the thick cables to the plug and the
sound is excellent to factor in the
build quality and all the included
accessories and you really feel like
you're getting a lot of headphone for
your money the only potential problem
for some people will be the fit of the
headphones there's somewhat waiting for
in ears and the over the ear cable
system won't appeal to everyone I
personally don't like having the cable
wrapped around my ears but headphone
companies like sure have similar systems
for their in ears and people do like
them bass mid-range treble dynamics and
stereo imaging all are top-notch and the
t-ten ice clarity makes you feel closer
to the music we played around with the
filters and like what the treble
enhancing filter did with well recorded
tracks but some people may not like it
the beauty of course is that you can
make that decision for yourself and swap
filters in and out as you please all in
all the t10 eye is a very impressive
in-ear headphone my only reservation
about it is it's fit and comfort level
my gut says it'll be a good fit for most
people
but not everyone so you can try before
you buy I'm David Carr noise thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
