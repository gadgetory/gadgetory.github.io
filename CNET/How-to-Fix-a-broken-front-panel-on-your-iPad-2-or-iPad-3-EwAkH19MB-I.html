this ones is you can either live with it
buy a new one
or as I'm going to show you today fix it
just remember that this isn't something
you should do if you have an Apple Care
Plus or other warranty that covers
accidental damage also I encourage you
to watch my video on what to know before
trying to fix a smartphone or tablet it
will help you decide if you should
tackle the repair yourself or just take
your iPad to a shop and lastly
understand that by following the
instructions in this video you do so at
your own risk before you begin you'll
need to get the necessary replacement
parts and tools on this iPad we're
replacing just the front panel not the
LCD and we'll be reusing the home button
and metal camera bracket from the old
panel and you can buy replacement panels
online between 50 and 150 dollars just
be sure you buy the right one for your
iPad and depending on where you buy the
panel it may come with pre-cut adhesive
strips if it doesn't you'll need to buy
them or cut your own strips from
double-sided tape as for tools you'll
need a hairdryer or heat gun a few thin
metal blades several plastic spudger x'g
ATAR picks or plastic case opening tools
and a phillips double zero screwdriver
again you can pick these up online if
you don't have them
lastly I'll be replacing the panel on an
iPad 2 but the same basic steps can be
used on the iPad 3 the first step is the
back of all the iPads data using iCloud
or iTunes just in case something goes
wrong
with that done you can begin removing
the cracked panel by heating its edges
with a hairdryer or heat gun this
loosens the adhesive that holds the
panel to the case heat a small area of
the panel until you can easily insert a
thin tool between the panel and the case
and gently pry them apart if the panel
doesn't easily come away from the case
keep heating the area also take care not
to insert the tool too far into the iPad
doing so can damage the LCD and other
internal components
once you've created a small gap in one
area work your way around the edge
heating and prying as you go you'll need
to leave placeholders like this spudger
in the separated sections to prevent the
panel and case from sticking back
together
you'll also need to be very careful when
working to the right of the home button
the Wi-Fi antenna is attached to the
panel here and you'll need to gently pry
it loose without damaging it and
although we're not really worried about
breaking the panel anymore
take care around the bottom left corner
the panels digitizer cable is located
here and you don't want to damage any
other internal components by carelessly
yanking it loose with the panel
separated from the case we need to
disconnect it from the main circuit
board
unfortunately the connector is located
under the LCD so remove the displays
four Phillips screws and lift it away
from the case holding it along the right
edge and folding it over along the left
then disconnect the LCD connector from
the mainboard
and set the display somewhere safe we
can now disconnect the broken panel
first carefully flip up the two locking
levers on the digitizer cable connector
as you remove the cable from the
connector you'll need to gently peel it
away from the main boards metal
shielding with the broken panel
completely detached we can now remove
the home button contact using our
phillips screwdriver then using our
hairdryer again heat and remove the
bracket and button the camera plate
comes off in a similar manner you'll
also want to remove any pieces of
adhesive that are still stuck to the
metal case we're now ready to assemble
and install the new front panel first
attach the old home button and camera
plate using your pre-cut
adhesive strips next reconnect the
digitizer cable and flip down the
locking levers reconnect the LCD and
secure it to the frame with its screws
now fold the front cover over into place
being extremely careful not to damage
its cable at this point we're just
testing the panel's fit and
functionality so we haven't applied any
of the adhesive strips turn the iPad on
and verify that everything works if it
does turn the unit off lift open the
panel
apply the adhesive strips now before
closing the panel for hopefully the last
time carefully inspect the LCD and
inside of the panel for dust if you see
any gently remove it using a microfiber
cloth or puff of air avoid touching the
inside of the panels viewing area or the
LCD with your fingers or anything else
that might damage these surfaces once
you're sure both surfaces are clean fold
the front panel back onto the metal case
and press firmly but gently along the
edges
after removing the front panels
protective film the fix is complete now
I'm not going to lie this is a tough fix
but if done right it can breathe new
life into a broken iPad now if you have
questions about this fix or any of my
cracking open videos you can contact me
