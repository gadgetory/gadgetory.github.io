in-depth look at one of our top picks in
wearable tech for this year the Fitbit
force with the price of one twenty nine
ninety five the four stands at the top
of fitbit's current line of high-tech
health and wellness products and as you
might expect this gadget goes well
beyond your average pedometer looking at
the force you might assume it's fitbit's
previous fitness tracker the Fitbit flex
that's because it could be a splitting
image of the earlier product both use an
angular wrist strap design and have a
dark glossy strip bisecting its front
face the big difference here though is
the forces larger size part of the
reason for its more sizable footprint is
that the force boasts a real
alphanumeric OLED screen with this
display the force can show detailed
activity data such as steps distance
traveled calories burned and stairs
climbed the force can also highlight how
many active minutes you have currently
under your belt I think the nicest
feature of the forces screen other than
it's bright and easy to read is it
displays the time it's a huge
development in a small wrist style
fitness device and helps both the force
and Fitbit branch out into SmartWatch
territory another SmartWatch likability
the force brings to the table and
uncharted country for Fitbit is phone
notifications the company promises that
the force will soon be able to receive
alerts for incoming calls the catch
though is this ability is only planned
for iPhones running iOS 7 or higher
similarly if you own an iPhone or
Samsung Galaxy s3 galaxy s4 or no 2
handset you will be able to use the iOS
and Android Fitbit apps to sync the
force over a wireless Bluetooth
connection additionally the app lets you
log meals to count calories compare food
intake against energy burned through
exercise and even sync with fitbit's
area Wi-Fi scale to see if your weight
has gone up or down add to this the
Fitbit forces sleep tracking and silent
alarm clock abilities and you have one
powerful Fitness product on your hands
this is Brian Bennett with your product
spotlight on the Fitbit force
