charge of my food I'm Bridget Carey this
is your CNET update this news may be
hard for some of you to swallow but
Domino's Pizza is not a pizza company it
is a technology company you may have not
realized it but for years now Domino's
has experimented with high-tech ways to
give cheese lovers their fix instead of
inventing new types of pizza related
food or putting other foods inside of
pizzas Domino's is a pioneer in another
area getting that food to our home in
high-tech ways most recently it allows
us to tweet out our order with an emoji
or just speak the order to Amazon's
Alexa voice assistant and like all tech
companies Domino's also got into the car
business
it made its own special delivery vehicle
the 2016 DXP with a built-in warming
oven and it's not a joke these cars are
on the streets in some major metro areas
but now the company may have gone too
far the Domino's team in Australia has
unveiled the first pizza delivery robot
named drew for Domino's robotic unit
this prototype was based off military
technology and it will roll down your
neighborhood keeping your Pizza warm
inside until it gets to your door years
ago the only real Pizza crisis our world
faced was a creature called the noid and
we were all instructed to do what we
could to avoid it but now there will be
pizza robots roaming the streets and
maybe even pizza bots in the skies
Domino's also experimented with drone
delivery
I guess humanoid delivery robots are the
next step Boston Dynamics creator of the
two legged Atlas robot has shown that
its Terminator Eska machine can maintain
balance walking in all sorts of
environments and it can lift boxes
Google's parent company alphabet
oversees Boston Dynamics and there are
reports it wants to sell the robot
division to a new owner bloomberg
reports that Toyota or Amazon may be
interested but don't be surprised if it
goes to a company like Domino's or maybe
even another food establishment the head
executive of fast food burger chains
Carl's jr. and Hardees told Business
Insider
that he wants to
look into having robots run everything
so you can order pay and pick up the
food without ever seeing a person if we
put machines in charge of our food it'll
make their uprising against humanity
that much easier that's it for this tech
