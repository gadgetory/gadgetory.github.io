on the show today
Chris Gilmore the winner of 1 million
dollars in the MLB 2k12 challenge how
you doing man and first off
congratulations a unbelievable job
yesterday we got to check you out doing
it at the MLB Fan Cave which is not the
man cave I learned that the hard way
yesterday there's not the man cave but
it's pretty sweet
in front of a live audience and there's
gonna be a show on Spike in a couple
weeks that basically shows your path to
success how did I mean what does it feel
like straight off the bat I mean and
what went through your mind when it was
all said and done I mean was like it was
awesome yeah I knew I had to contain the
emotions though because I mean I had
respect for all the other contestants
were all friends right on so uh I just
wanted to be gracious and shake
Charlie's hand tell him a good job right
on yeah I mean that was you know the
game was uh it was sort of a blowout but
at the end of the day I mean just to get
there I mean these guys and we said
before like dude you're basically the
best MLB 2k12 player on the planet right
I mean there was somebody better they'd
have million bucks right now but no it's
you you you've probably heard this
question what are you doing with the
money man what what what's the first
thing you're gonna take care of um well
Mother's Day is coming up so I'm gonna
have to get my mom something special
yeah like what a car I'm gonna that's
that's a pretty sweet Mother's Day gift
I'm sure she's got coming um I don't
want to say what that's very nice you
see that he buys his mom a kick-ass made
person I wanted to hear a little bit
more about your training regimen because
when I came in here Jeff had told me
about your appearance today and I
thought that I was gonna come in here
and see this like sickly kid that has
been outside for the last year you know
from practicing so much I come in here
and Jeff tells me that you've only
practiced about half an hour a day for
this game yeah oh and some time you're
really upsetting for the other players I
mean yeah cuz during the interviews for
like Spike and stuff like that we had
say how much we were playing
Gaming say and I just like roughly said
like an hour a day lie was a lie like
some of the guys were just like yeah
like I stopped I went I took off work
for a week and just to strictly qualify
that's so what is it what what do you
understand about this game better than
anyone else in the world that allows it
was I really think it was just a hitting
cuz yeah watching everybody else they
really couldn't hit I guess I was just
putting up runs left and right and that
was the thing I mean you know the this
game I started off close it was one one
for a little bit yeah and then you sort
of broke it open yeah top of the fourth
at score two then he didn't score and
then I scored five more to eight one and
it's amazing it's all about the hitting
I can barely make I can barely foul a
ball in that game it's tough hitting
stuff we've been able to master yeah
well you should go to get the title if
you can time the pitches down right read
the pitch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
