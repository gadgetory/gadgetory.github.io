secrets they filed a complaint about a
year ago last February saying that a
former Google employee stole 14,000
trade secret files and that uber then
hired this employee to develop its
self-driving car program well we're in
federal court and federal judges don't
like things to go on too long so right
now on the calendar it's slated for
three weeks there's some talk that it
may go longer but right now we're
looking at three weeks there are a lot
of heavy-hitting witnesses that might
come forward we have the former CEO of
uber Travis kalanick we have the CEO of
alphabet Larry Page there's a whole
bunch of employees from both Google and
uber along with the person who allegedly
stole the self-driving car file to add
to the 11 donkey way Moe wants Hoover
ideally to shut down a self-driving car
program they see Hoover as a big
competitor in the space and this is a
space that is growing and potentially
could be worth a lot of money in a few
years
so the judge is putting the burden of
proof on way low it once way mo to prove
that not only did ever get these 14,000
files but they use them to develop their
self-driving car program so it's a
hybrid and a proof on way mo there's
always a potential for settlement which
can happen in cases like this and
there's the - you know if way mo wins or
if uber wins it's over wins that means
they get to continue developing their
self-driving car program as planned
if way mo ends there may be some limits
on what uber can do in it self-driving
car program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
