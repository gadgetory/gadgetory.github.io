the show about DIY tech and how to i'm
eric franklin and i'm donna bell and
this week we take a look at how to do
more with the apple products you may
soon beginning were the ones you already
have that's right from iphone camera
controls to maybe even switch it from
android to an apple device but first we
start with how to share content on more
than one device for all of you out there
who are lucky enough to live in a home
with multiple people using multiple
Apple devices your iphones and ipads and
macbooks and ipod touches Apple has made
it really easy to sync these all up to a
common iTunes account called family
sharing I'm going to show you how to set
it up first for this to work you have to
make sure all of your Apple devices that
you want to share with are running the
latest software that means iOS 84 mobile
and OS 10 mountain lion for your max
next take the mobile device that's
associated with the Apple ID and credit
card that will serve as the master
account for the family then go to
settings iCloud and tap the button for
setup family sharing you're going to go
through a few screens here that explain
family sharing verify your credit card
information and make sure that you
understand that as the family organizer
all purchases made on these other
devices are going to go through your
account that's an important detail so
don't go adding friends or deadbeat
uncles to your family sharing list
eventually you'll find yourself on this
family page where you can add up to five
additional family members to share with
to invite someone click Add family
member and then type in their name or
email address to pull them up from your
contacts once they accept the invitation
they'll gain immediate access to any
music movies TV shows books or apps that
you downloaded and the same goes for you
if you click on the app store or the
iTunes Store and you click on purchase
you can see a new list of all the things
that they've bought before that you can
download onto any of your devices but
what happens if a family member of yours
turns out to be a real jerk who's
running up your credit card with all
kinds of itunes and app purchases that
you don't approve of well you can delete
them from your list by going into iCloud
tapping their name and removing them
so there you go that's how to set up
apples family sharing feature with your
family it's a great way to make the best
use of itunes content you already have
and just so you know in case there's
anything embarrassing in your iTunes
collection you can go in and manually
hide that content so that it's not
shared with other people very useful tip
yeah alright it's time for a quick break
and when we come back we've got some
great iPhone photography tips that will
help you take better photos tips for
beginners and for those with more
advanced shooting experience
you
welcome back for many of us taking a
picture with our smartphone is
incredibly convenient but at the same
time if you're trying to take a picture
of something spontaneous that seemingly
perfect picture can just be a hazy blur
that can easily happen and right now
lexi savita shows us how to better use
your iphone camera and shows us how to
enhance photos already on your device so
you just bought yourself a brand new
iphone 6 or 6 plus and love taking
photos I'm going to show you a few ways
on how to get the most out of the camera
plus some apps for better looking photos
and the best part is that most of these
tips will even work on older iPhones as
long as you've upgraded to iOS H let's
start with some basics if this is your
first iPhone then there are three ways
to launch the camera one from the lock
screen swipe up on the camera icon to
tap on the app icon and three swipe up
from the bottom of the screen in any app
and hit the button take a burst of
images by pressing and holding the
shutter button down in photo mode or you
can press and hold the volume button
instead this is also going to help you
keep shots stable when shooting in
landscape orientation change the
direction of panoramas by tapping the
arrow like so you can also take them
vertically or horizontally shooting in
bright outdoor situations use your hand
to cup around the lens like so in order
to reduce lens flare and the amount of
light entering the camera for the video
lovers out there you can switch the
camera to shoot at 60 frames per second
rather than the default 30 head to
settings and then photo and camera and
turn the toggle on on the main camera
screen you can adjust exposure
compensation by simply tapping anywhere
to bring up this box and
sliding up and down the sunshine icon to
adjust the brightness as you like you
could already taken some photos you can
fine-tune thanks to some new editing
options find your image and open it up
and then press edit in the top
right-hand corner here three icons
across you'll see a controlled I'll tap
this and then you'll be presented with a
whole bunch of different options such as
highlights shadows brightness and
contrast and then you can adjust these
as you're lacking and save it to a new
image there's also heaps of other apps
available that let you have more serious
exposure control two of my favorites of
the esco can and manual can both give
you control over aspects like focused
white balance and exposure remember that
because the iphone has a fixed aperture
lens you can only adjust the white
balance and the shutter speed not your
s-stop finally if you've got to iOS
devices you can use one to trigger the
camera in the other download the camera
plus up and install it on both devices
turn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on both and
then choose the air snap option on one
phone select the name of the other
device on the screen and then you'll get
a live view of what the other camera is
seeing quick question all right have you
ever switched from using an android
phone to an iphone don't tell anybody
but yes I totally have all right it
wasn't as simple as it could have been
but thankfully we've got Dan Graziano
here are some simple but important tips
on making the transition smooth features
like Apple pay and the larger screens
have a lot of people interested in
upgrade to the iphone 6 and iphone 6
plus even some Android users have taken
notice if you're one of those people who
are ready to take the plunge to apple
from android you're in luck it used to
be a huge pain to switch from one mobile
platform to the other but it's now
easier than ever to transfer all of your
old data from android to your new iphone
syncing your mail contacts and calendar
with your new device is simple Google
will automatically backup all of your
information to your gmail account from
your new iPhone head to settings scroll
down to mail contacts calendar tap Add
Account and select Google enter your
Gmail credentials and click Next make
sure everything you would like to sync
over to your new iPhone is checked off
and then click Save
leave your contacts calendar and email
will now be synced up but one thing is
still missing and that's your photos the
easiest way to get your photos over to
your new iPhone would be to you the
cross-platform cloud service such as
Google+ photos Amazon Cloud Drive
Dropbox or a similar app that's
available on both Android and iOS you
can also upload your photos to your
computer and manually transfer them to
your iPhone to do this start by
connecting your Android device to your
computer if you're on Windows you can
simply drag and drop files on a map you
must download a free program from google
called android file transfer once it has
been installed open it click on the DCIM
folder followed by camera you can then
drag and drop all of your photos or
specific ones to your computer I
recommend creating a new folder and
placing the photos in it this will make
it easier to sync with them with your
iPhone later on to get those photos over
to your new device simply connect your
iPhone to your computer open iTunes and
choose to sync photos from that same
folder for everything else google has a
ton of apps available for free on
Apple's App Store is google play books
movies music and newsstand for all of
your content the must-haves for any
Android user has to be Google Maps and
the Google Search app which will show
you all those cool predictive Google
Mail cards and that's all it takes to
bring the world of google to your iphone
