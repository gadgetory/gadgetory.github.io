roundtable I am Rafe Needleman in San
Francisco hey listen this is an
important show that Jobs Act is about to
rewrite the rules of Silicon Valley
notoriously small businesses have always
had challenges getting access to capital
and even more so in this economy but
raising money is going to get a lot
easier if the jumpstart our business
startups or Jobs Act becomes law there
are two main fundamentals of the JOBS
Act first of all it will let small
businesses raise money from individuals
that previously couldn't invest in
companies because they didn't make
enough money they work and credited
investors and secondly it will let these
businesses advertise to raise money
which has been illegal so far and
although the bill hasn't been signed by
the president yet entrepreneurs are
cheering this Act would fundamentally
change access to capital for small small
startups in the United States I guess
the biggest probably the biggest deal in
decades but there are still a lot of
concerns about the bill if you're
somebody who is not too familiar with
investing and you see an opportunity to
invest in the small company that's doing
this cool thing you think that sounds
pretty cool and you read some article
somewhere and says this is a great
investment sale I'll put my money and it
sounds like a short thing well it's not
a sure thing most small businesses fail
the SEC along with other investor
protection groups have added to the
criticism the North American securities
administrators Association released this
statement the JOBS Act sacrifices
essential investor protections without
offering any prospects for meaningful
sustainable job growth but experts say
ultimately the JOBS Act may not change
the way most tech startups get funding
most of them will continue to raise
money through angel investors through
venture funds or self-fund to raise
money this way means to deal with a
large number of investors you don't know
and who you may not trust for cnet news
com I'm Sumi das
alright we recorded that a few days ago
since that we recorded that intro video
a lot has happened of course we recorded
that after the JOBS Act sailed through
the house of representatives have passed
with flying colors and then went to the
Senate where was debated for a few days
but ultimately passed with a couple of
interesting and important modifications
so just to reiterate what the JOBS Act
is about is again it stands for
jumpstart our business startups although
it has very little to do with actual
jobs and the way the president talks
about it will go back to the house for
approval and probably be approved and
then certainly be signed by the
president and it will mean that
crowdfunding becomes the law of the land
that you and I can invest in startups a
very small amount of money it also means
that these startups can advertise to you
and me for investing which right now
they're prohibited from doing there's
another big part of it which is how
companies go public IPOs companies that
want to go public will be able to do so
with reduced regulations they're rolling
back some of the sarbanes-oxley
restrictions that make it expensive for
companies to go public or if they want
to delay going public and acquire more
private investors they will also be able
to do that so it becomes much companies
have much more flexibility in how they
decide to go public to talk about these
issues today which are unbelievably
important for technology
entrepreneurship and startups in the
whole Silicon Valley economy we've got
three great guests first George Zachary
who's a venture capitalist for charles
river ventures I've got a short
pre-recorded interview with him we
recorded that yesterday and then here in
the studio I've got chance Barnett of
the crowdfunding portal crowdfunder
chance thank you and via Skype from
Boston timro who's a CEO of the
cambridge innovation center Tim thanks
for joining us we will be right back
with you guys but first let's hear what
George had to say from the heart of
Silicon Valley his office down a mental
park
alright so first up on reporters
roundtable today we're going to talk
with George Zachary who is a partner at
the venture capital firm charles river
ventures which is a fairly large
influential firm in boston and san
francisco George has made some
interesting and investments and small
little companies who may have heard of
like Twitter and Yammer and also he was
the co-founder of shutterfly which is
now a public company George thanks for
making the time thank you thank you very
much so we've talked a bit about the
JOBS Act which is shortly to become law
we all believe and I need to ask you
just a couple of questions from your
perspective as a venture capitalist as
somebody who is in the business of
investing money in startups is the JOBS
Act a good thing or a bad thing for
technology entrepreneurship for the
valley I think it's a great thing for
technology founders and technology
entrepreneurship it's another source of
capital and having multiple options as a
founder is a great thing to do now how
about for you though because doesn't
this increase competition for deals and
drive up the amount of funds that you
will need to put into a company to get
in yeah it does it does increase the
competition for every one increases
competition for angel investors seed
investors micro vc's early stage venture
capitalist like myself late stage
investors it sure does it's another form
of competition but if we're all about
making the world better an increasing
change it's the right thing to do and we
might as well get on with it and adapt
to change sooner versus later with
regards to the crowdfunding provision
what would you advise the entrepreneurs
that you talk to or the ones that you
don't know about how to use it so far I
have had very few questions from
founders about it there you know most
founders are just really focused on one
end to build business and product and so
they try to get as much capital in as
few meetings as possible the only issue
with the JOBS Act is that you know
collecting 10 and 20 and 50 K from
individuals it could be hundreds of
meetings for a founder to raise that
from an individual so my take is I don't
think it's
plant angel investing seed and testing
an early stage venture I think it's
going to be an additional pool of
capital to fill out rounds so it I
actually it's going to be more
complementary than competitive or early
on it might be more competitive or angel
investors but usually when founders are
showing up at my door I want to talk to
me yeah they usually are trying to
basically raised two to six million
dollars and having one person to deal
with to get the capital from makes it
easier and we've seen this before about
ten years ago bill hambrick who is the
founder Pam Birkin quest tried to
democratize IPOs by offering kind of
reverse auctions and increasing the
amount that went to retail investors but
the business never really changed
started the startups going public still
went to mutual funds first because they
cuz through a few meetings you could
raise a big volume of cash so I think
that's going to remain true so I see it
much more as complimentary okay sorry i
rambled on there too long no it's great
and fro great info now what about for
investors who want to get in on this I
mean there's got to be a lot of
individuals a lot of people on smaller
incomes who finally feel they can take
part in the technology rocketship of our
the financial rocketship of technology
what is your advice to all these people
think they can now play in and get in on
the next Facebook well it's a fantastic
opportunity but they should realize that
8 out of 4,000 angel and venture funded
companies drive around eighty percent of
the game this comes to us from one of
our limited partners historically named
hoarsely bridge which is a big limited
partner and we've heard that data from
other people so people that need to
realize that every company can't be the
Facebook and that this is much higher
risk than investing in the public stock
market it's so in risk it somewhere
between investing the public market and
the lottery where I mean that's a pretty
broad swath here yeah it is which which
side do you think it's on more lottery
more
a general motor runs almost as bad
example a bad battery bank america is a
bad example to wait a minute we come up
with a good example oh dear oh mills
okay go ahead it matters how you build
the portfolio so I would advise
individuals to build a portfolio not of
one or two five or ten k investments but
probably of 50 and you want to basically
invest more thematically along a sector
this is what mutual funds do is they
they look for companies that are going
that are going to go public and do they
fit into a theme or a sector and then
they try to basically diversify the risk
they try to decrease the risk by
diversifying their investments into lots
of different companies so I think there
will be you'll need to develop good
sources as to which startups are the
right ones to invest in you'll have to
think through do I want to buy a bundle
of these do I want to come in through
some aggregator there's there are lots
of issues what then they'll be the whole
issue about newsletters right now if
you're an individual you can subscribe
to any one of thousands of financial
newsletters which tell you how to invest
in the best way for the public market so
my guess is we'll see the rise of of
that kind of reporting if we'll put it
that way I struggle to call it
journalism because it's not it probably
won't be be slightly propagating
propaganda Sh you'll want to get these
research reports on what on the hot
private company ISM and you're going to
have to be armed with information and
knowledge they'll probably be people
trying to commit fraud and raise money
for completely dubious things so it's
going to require more work on the part
of individuals on that part so the
probably new service providers to help
individuals figure this out sounds like
Wild West is coming when it comes to
small company stock advice that's that's
right and we have a little bit of this
Wild West ten years ago you know now
that people have kind of forgotten the
bust of 99 2000 and some of the fraud
associated with that and people are now
starting to forget the state crisis
there
looking for the next big thing of the
what I call the Rolling Thunder bubble
which is it tends to move from one
sector to another and right now it's
really about technology once Facebook
goes public I think it's going to be a
net scape moment in the sense that will
generate a lot of excitement on the part
of individual investors about public
market technology companies as well as
private ones okay so I think it's really
exciting it's a great thing that's
happening but it's new there'll be
people say it's bad because there's
fraud and other reasons but they needs
to be probably need to be more
disclosure there probably need to meet
new research services to kind of fit
these investors okay George any final
advice for people on either side of this
equation either the entrepreneurs or the
investors it's a new world so think
carefully about what you're going to get
by tapping into the new opportunities on
every side investor psychic underside
small investor side do your homework
it's called diligence we do it as
venture investors and just get armed
with as much facts and data but remember
great investment decisions are always
usually made by intuition first with
data that supports a second good advice
George thank you very much for your time
and we'll see right now you're going to
be out here in you know in a couple of
days for a live event here at seen it
right that's right I'm very excited for
that event with Paul Sloan all right
good we'll see you then thanks a lot
thank you thanks for inviting me
alright we're back that was a George
Zachary of the venture firm charles
river ventures we've got two great live
guests now I've got chance Burnett here
in the studio and timro dialing it from
Boston and tim i want to start with you
you run the cambridge innovation center
if I got that correct yay okay uh what
do you make of all this should people
jump in to these crowd funding
opportunities right away or would it
make more sense for them to sit and wait
and see how things a level out after
this bill because bill becomes law which
is almost certain going to it was
certainly going to happen well so first
of all they won't be able to do it right
away because the bill gives the SEC a
little bit of time to do real making I
think it's 270 days so a little hot a
little bit of time to get ready for this
you know hearing George's comments I
have a slightly different perspective on
how this is going to play out overall I
think by the way you and George have
captured you know X in a great way you
know the potential here it's huge one of
the things that I see is that the
crowdfunding is going to be used much
more for people to raise money from
friends and family and the next level of
acquaintances beyond that for businesses
that may never see venture capital uh
you know tiny can't you have that
already I mean people have all been
raising friends and family for startups
forever so what makes the jobs act
different about that so if what you
can't do right now or two things you
can't invest in a company if you are at
an accredited investor or in a very
small number of investors under 35
investors under current laws so if you
want to be able to go out and say post
this on you know Facebook let your
friends you went to high school with
went to college with or people in your
church group or whatever let them know
that you're starting up say I knew a new
plumbing business or a new catering
business and you want to raise a hundred
thousand dollars to get the equipment to
get going that wasn't something that you
could do before and so there's you know
the idea one notion is that the you know
almost ninety seven percent of
businesses i think that that never see
venture capital or angel capital may see
this as a way that for them to get
financed
very different thing than the kind of
the Wild West picture this is more hey
you know soon Susan starting a company
let's all put in 500 bucks to help her
out what is the mood of the
entrepreneurs of your work with that the
Cambridge Innovation Center what are
what are their thoughts are they
thinking of this isn't for us or this is
a great opportunity for us to raise
money so we don't to deal with those
pesky angels and VCs I think it's more
the ladder announced this yesterday
there were cheering crowds of people
whoops of joy this was this has been
long awaited uh I you know I could tell
you stories of companies recently that
raise money on Kickstarter and love it
and people see this as you know
Kickstarter on steroids now just for the
record just so everybody who's watching
the show knows Kickstarter's a
fundamentally different model in that
model you invest in a project it's kind
of a donation and you get the work
product you don't ever own a piece of
the company exact day it's a fundamental
difference that's right yeah and so
people but people actually don't see it
is that different what Kickstarter does
is gets thousands of people to support
you in your project right and this way
now they can actually get equity and put
more money in there's data there's there
is one crowdfunding company out there
now that's got some traction it's in the
UK it's called crowdcube they've
invested it's new its its last year and
what they found is that most of the
investments that they get most of the
dollars in these investments are over a
thousand dollars whereas Kickstarter is
more like 50 bucks or a hundred bucks so
it really ups the ante in terms of how
much money you can raise with this this
approach chance Barnett is the CEO of
crowd funder which is one of these
crowdfunding portals and chance your
your business is based on the passage of
the JOBS Act is it not absolutely so
this means a lot to you you're out on
the circuit but the JOBS Act changed as
it went through the house originally the
bill said if you make up to a hundred
thousand dollars you can vest up to ten
percent of your income in startups and
the Senate version of the bill which has
to go back to the house now has a tiered
a sliding scale of caps talk about that
about what they are and why that is so
important share a great question so one
of the things that's gonna be happening
with the bill that was the Senate Senate
amended version the Senate got it two
hands
would had been the original bill and
said we want to try and and really push
for what we see is important investor
protections and one of the ways of doing
that is putting a maximum cap on how
much money any non accreditor individual
person like you and I could invest
someone's mom could invest in their sons
company and and I think that's one way
of going about trying to protect
investors and I think that's a
reasonable start but what I think is
important here is to keep the whole pie
in mind and not just piece it apart and
and to take a more holistic systems
approach to thinking about this in any
system generally you see the 8020
principle of play if not something more
dramatic you'll see eighty percent of
any activity or let's say in this case
investment coming from twenty percent of
the participants or the people on a
platform so what this cap can
potentially do is while it provides some
some roof to how much money someone
might lose an investment it also limits
the amount to which the market can
really start to fund effectively and so
I think we want to be careful in making
sure that this act doesn't too much push
down that that limit for a variety of
people well those limits actually are by
the way just since you asked that yeah
right question the bill points out that
they want to limit people with forty
thousand dollars or under income to two
percent of their annual income and then
people over a hundred thousand dollars
or more can invest around ten percent of
their annual income so that has been the
constant as the bill you know bubbled up
in in media buzz that became kind of the
rallying point of all the content was
the the concept of fraud and of course
people who run the public markets I say
this advisedly as a journalist for more
than 20 years are obviously against this
because this this takes some of the
control and the power and the money flow
off of their plate so of course they're
going to fight this and it's just
reality of the way money people who
control money want to keep that control
but the the rallying cry around fraud I
think is relevant and this and that has
been the push and pull how much do you
make this a free market and at how much
do you protect people who don't know any
better now you as running a
crowdfunder calm which is a place where
investor or entrepreneurs can go and say
this is our company you can come invest
in us now you have a lot of competition
there are at least five companies that I
know of that compete directly with you
and they've all pitched me so very smart
of you to be here today uh there uh you
your business though it's not you can't
buy stocks and then resell can you do a
job Zack mutual fund is that your
business mean how do you guys make any
money not all so there's this this
important role that crowdfunding
platforms like us at crowdfunder com
need to play which is to remain very
much hands off of any representation of
what's good or not while providing
really important safety checks for that
deals are legitimate and that the
founders of these companies are
legitimate so this is where I think the
rallying cry of some of the opponents of
the bill there their argument doesn't
hold water because they want to just
claim that hey there's going to be a
rampant fraud here even as the bill is
suggest now there's regulatory framework
and so some of the requirements going to
look like background work background
check requirements for principles of
companies anyone who's ten percent or
over owner and a company that's looking
to raise money they'll also be probably
standardized disclosures about the
company that might include use of funds
that might include a your existing cap
table things like that how much money is
in a bank account of the company and
then what I think is interesting or two
other really interesting points to say
what's the quality or some qualitative
measure of what this person as it or
what this company might look like which
are some level transparency around
identity and I think the web has done an
interesting job and come a long way in
the last five six years about making
that easier for everyday people to do
and so the simple ways that I can speak
to that is connecting your facebook
account connecting a linkedin account to
your profile as an entrepreneur raising
money hmm those things have some social
checks and they're not as powerful and
is important as a background check but
that's a really good signal if you're a
potential investor can you go and look
and meet
really see someone's job history check
them out on linkedin and make sure
they're legitimate that's a nice check
to have and then the other thing that I
think is interesting will be data so
right now the investing world
particularly the early-stage vesting
world is very opaque meaning if you
wanted to try and get and understand how
much should a company at a certain stage
and a certain industry be worth it's
really hard to get a fixed number on
that and there's good and bad reasons
why that's true why the industry is
opaque what I think crowdfund investing
is really going to do that's interesting
is start to open that up and create a
lot of transparency around the data and
the funding of these companies and help
investors from that side to not have a
bad experience in investing in a company
it Tim from Cambridge animation center
do you think that entrepreneurs are
ready to open the kimono this much in
order to get you know five hundred or
thousand two thousand dollars from
investors here there oh absolutely and I
think we're seeing it right now I think
we're seeing using the existing models
crew in the United States there's crowd
lending sites like prosper com that are
up and running right now also in in
Europe people are very happy to go out
there share their information raise
money from the crowd there's a company
called Gotham bicycle defense here at
Cambridge innovation center that
recently you know went out on
Kickstarter they needed 18 thousand
dollars they shared their whole story
videos of what what they're doing etc
got sixty thousand dollars and you know
they're the heroes right that this is
people saying this is the way to do it I
think I think this concern about fraud
is overplayed there are two reasons why
I think that one is that if you look at
all of the sites now that allow people
to raise money online like the crowd
lending sites like the existing
crowdfunding sites angel list which is a
credited investor only crowd funding
site right now they they all report that
they are not experiencing fraud Angeles
prosper Crowdcube circle lending these
guys are i'm sleepy funding circle these
guys have all gone pop you know going on
record saying they have have zero cases
of reported fraud at this point so i
think that that's probably less of a
real issue than it appears to be
although obviously we will have to wait
see how this unfolds you know I want to
transition from that statement which i
think is very telling to the even bigger
picture economically which is the new
rules that the JOBS Act puts on place
for the public markets which is when and
how a company goes public now as I
understand it and I'm new to
understanding the way public markets the
history of public markets the SEC was
created in response to the 1929 stock
market crash which was a bubble which
happened because a lot of people
invested in very bad investments and
then we had sarbanes-oxley which
happened after in 2002 somewhat after
then tooth out the dot-com crash and the
JOBS Act rolls back many restrictions on
how companies go public they can stay
private longer or they can go public
more easily are there what are the real
advantage are there first of all let's
talk about the going public without the
sarbanes-oxley restrictions do you think
that is going to be good for technology
businesses overall I mean obviously
they'll be able to go public but is that
a good thing to have more less regulated
public technology companies Tim want to
go to you first on that one through
there's no question that that would be a
good thing first of all there are two
ways that investor two reasons that
investors invest in companies in the
first place they either can sell the
company get it acquired or they can go
public between the two of them they make
much more money if the company goes
public so you got to understand that
making it it feasible to go public is
really driver for investors to invest in
these startups in the first place if you
don't make it easy to go public there
aren't going to be people investing in
startups second the you know the
argument is not we are going to relieve
these companies of dealing with
sarbanes-oxley for all time it's just
saying that for the first five years or
even less than that if the companies
grow quickly the the restrictions are
going to be somewhat more limited than
they are today so they're what they're
doing is they're scaling or graduating
in those new rules slowly to let
companies learn how to deal with all of
the reporting and so forth that's
required
the professionals in the industry that
that that I talked with I've talked with
a lot of lawyers about this I've talked
with a lot of venture capitalists about
this and people who work in public
markets is that we really went just a
bit too far with sarbanes-oxley
particularly in the sense that it was
hard to get out the first place to go
public because the rules were so tough
that a new company just couldn't comply
with all them from the get-go now
another part of the JOBS Act is the
companies if they want to stay private
longer on the total flip side can do
that chance have you studied that alone
is there an advantage to staying private
longer well there certainly is you know
one of the things that's most
interesting is when you become a public
company there's suddenly a shift in the
focus of what you think your business is
about and you know there was a great
article written a while back that I saw
which was management to stockholder
value this is not ideally what creates
long-term value when a company is trying
to meet expectations on a continual
basis on a quarterly basis for earnings
reports it might in the short term help
your stock price long-term that's not
always the best way to manage your
company and think about your product or
your customer value and so I think it's
important for companies to think really
hard if the barrier the cost and the
time it takes to go public suddenly
there's a new capital market for you to
raise money that's really expansive and
it's important but you really want to
balance that with what are the core
values of my company who am i seeking to
serve am i seeking to serve my company
best and my customers or am i seeking to
seek the market and there's a balance to
be played there so I think it's on a
case-by-case basis that company needs to
consider that but I don't think anyone
is really rushing out and saying I want
to go public right now it's a very big
consideration I know no one is allowed
to take lightly because of these
regulations but that would be the big
thing that that I would look at as a
founder and entrepreneur looking to take
a company public as a really huge
consideration because there's cultural
and there's business considerations
about how you allowed to act you know
they're there are extraordinarily
innovative public companies I mean it I
guess to your point is probably more
difficult to
keep the fire alive in a public company
the fire of innovation of excitement
that startup mentality but it's not
impossible so if maybe this just makes
for you know these restrictions make for
better management I mean I maybe I don't
know yes no I'm gonna say that I really
think it's really what's of key
importance and Tim already touched on it
is this is a source of revenue or
capital market that companies can access
and you know there's two ways to have a
big success with a company to have an
exit which is you're getting acquired
and it taking public and taking a public
is certainly by leaps and bounds
oftentimes much more lucrative provides
more constant long-term stream of
capital firm yeah I want to ask you both
this question for again into the last
topic as we've been discussing the
potential here is that a smaller
investors lower income investors can win
by playing in this market although they
can also lose because these are highly
volatile investments entrepreneurs win
because they have more flexibility in
how they raise funds and then was the
company's got bigger they have more
flexibility in their approach to the
public markets new businesses trans like
yours can win because there's a new
opportunity to aggregate information
incubators venture capitalist etc I
believe they win because as more money
enters the market the spread between the
amount invested and the exits gets
bigger which means there's more money to
be made who loses well I think you see a
trend both in the business models that
you see on the web and how humans behave
economically towards a more
collaborative model and so if you take
the the record industry's a good example
there used to be only a few distribution
points a few radio stations that would
play so it was a hits business and there
was a few people that make those
business hits and and that was it and
everyone else was left scrambling flash
forward to today there's a mass of
niches there's tons of internet radio
stations so there's a lot of winners and
the people who lost are the industries
that were the two main radio
distribution networks
I got all the value from the hits and
the few record labels who were able to
get into those all the time so what I
think we're going to see with this
collaborative environment any
environment that's opened up to this
more distributed model which is really
what the web's about you see a wider
distribution I think we're going to see
really interesting alignment of
communities that want to take over the
funding of themselves and that's
essentially what crowdfunding is about
humans self-organizing and and you know
i think that the tech world and the
startup world is already relative to
most other communities very organized so
i think this will have a significant
packed impact in the tech industry but i
think it's going to have a much broader
and more revolutionary impact on small
business in the states because they
don't have a rallying hub they don't
have Rafe Needleman who talks about them
all the time they're just everyday small
business heroes and this is going to be
a huge part of the economy Tim yeah you
know I think that saying that they're
you know looking at the loot you losers
is a little too narrow in the sense that
this is really going to expand a pie the
pie right now is the number of new
businesses that get funded in the united
states and i think the anticipation is
that this is going to vastly increase
that if there is a loser it's probably
those that are competing for that same
talent so perhaps it's it's bigger
businesses that now we're going to see
more and more people going into
businesses startups I think that that
mesh may shift the mix towards more
smaller businesses in the United States
and fewer large businesses I'm not sure
that that's entirely a bad thing I think
it's a healthy shift for this country
interesting now which brings me to the
final topic this is called the JOBS Act
which is a reverse engineered acronym
jumpstart our business startups but what
impact will this Jobs Act have on jobs
will more people be hired or are we just
changing the distribution of
unemployment Tim first then chance so
there you may be familiar with a study
that the Kauffman Foundation did
recently that showed where jobs come
from in the United States it was a
groundbreaking new research they said
that they looked over 30 years and found
that companies five years old and
younger created all the jobs in this
country and then some
for every three jobs that were created
by these companies five years old and
younger the older companies the six
years old and older companies lost a job
in collectively old companies lost jobs
in almost every year in the last 30
years so we know that the jobs are
coming from new businesses and it only
follows that if you have more new
business activity you're going to have
more job-creating activity chance
there's engineering stat and I like data
rather than pontification oftentimes so
Tim and mentioned Crowdcube which is one
of the only other great references to
business crowdfunding where people
actually investing and this is going on
in the UK and they had data about what
they estimate the job impact is of the
investments of the people made in the
companies that were crowd funded by
doing a survey and that data was roughly
you know across a few of the companies
in the sample that they had there was
about a hundred and fifty employees in
those companies the estimate that was
going to be you know I think the number
was around 370 employees as a result of
this funding so that's yeah so that's
more than a doubling of the jobs and and
then you also have to imagine that
hiring is just one piece of that what
companies also do is spend money with
other people in the business ecosystem
zoom whether that's advertising whether
that's partnerships whether it's web
hosting there's always a vibrant
community that companies are investing
around and with and so those those
people in the ecosystem who are also the
tool providers all benefit and there's
jobs there too cool well listen guys
thanks very much a real interesting
conversation on the JOBS Act you can
