credit bureau it's a good time to be in
the identity theft business I'm Bridget
Carey this is your CNET update hackers
have stolen personal information of 15
million t-mobile customers and that
includes anyone who just applied to sign
up for t-mobile service between
September 2013 and this year it's not
t-mobile that's to blame here the
hackers got the data by breaking into
Experian a major credit bureau that
t-mobile uses to conduct credit checks
for customers
needless to say t-mobile CEO John ledger
is angry with Experian and he said so in
a blog post the hackers made off with a
treasure trove of personal info to
conduct identity theft they have names
addresses birthdays Social Security
numbers and even driver's license and
passport numbers this isn't the first
time experience has been in hot water
for not keeping your data safe in 2013
it was uncovered that experience sold
personal data to criminals a group of ID
thieves and fraudsters in Vietnam if you
can't trust a major credit bureau to
keep data safe then maybe they shouldn't
be one of the three bureaus entrusted
with this sensitive info to make up for
the t-mobile hack Experian is offering
free credit monitoring and ID protection
but you need to give them more
information about yourself it's insanity
15 is a hot number in hacking this week
we go from 15 million t-mobile customers
to 15 gigabytes of personal user data
stolen from the crowdfunding website
patreon the website is a place where you
can be a patron and donate a few bucks a
month to people who create things you
enjoy such as artists video editors and
podcasters and some are offering gifts
as incentive for you to donate more
money patreon announced the hack in a
blog post saying that the breach
involved names emails and some shipping
and billing addresses no credit card
numbers were compromised the data stolen
has been dumped online to various sites
and so far about 2.3 million unique
emails have been discovered in that data
dump as with any hack it's good to
change your password as an extra
precaution but that's not all a bad
Android bug is back in the news it's
called stage fright 2.0 and essentially
it deal
the weak spot in the Android operating
system a hacker can steal data from your
phone if you visit the wrong website it
involves sneaking bad code into a music
or movie file and if the file is on a
website and your phone previews it to
play it you're infected we first heard
about this flaw in April but the
security group does imperium found the
problem is broader than originally
thought every Android device is at risk
of this glitch but patching can be a
problem not every Android phone gets a
software update and when they do it can
take a long time Google has said it will
issue a patch to the Nexus users on
Monday that's it for this tech news
update and for more head to cnet.com and
stay safe out there folks from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
