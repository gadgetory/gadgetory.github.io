shell will recover everything related to
alphabet Inc today we're talking about
the new Google Maps a new version of the
YouTube app and Google's gaming dreams
but our top story is about Samsung first
stop Android avenues Samsung's made it
official its next unpacked event will be
held on August 9th at the Barclays
Center in Brooklyn take a look at that
snazzy invite it looks like a close-up
of an S Pen which suggests this is gonna
be about the note 9 the Twitter account
for Samsung Mobile News says the new S
Pen of the Galaxy Note 9 will have some
remote control features this upgrade
might be the best which the S Pen has
ever received the account also says the
pen would be charged by putting it back
in the note L Dermot azan has a bunch of
information about the note 9 on mobile
review.com where tazón has a good track
record when it comes to leaks he also
says the S Pen will add support for
Bluetooth and you'll be able to unlock
the note with the stylus ET News says
the S Pen will be able to control music
take pictures remotely and be usable
when giving presentations the same
report says Samsung is working on a
digital signature function which could
be used like a personal authentication
method like a fingerprint where tazón
says the note 9 will be packin a huge
four thousand milliamp hour battery the
note 8 has a 3300 milliamp hour battery
if the S Pen needs to be charged by the
note this makes sense when it comes to
design route azan says the note 9 won't
look that different from the note 8 but
the position of the fingerprint sensor
has changed on the back that seems to
line up with what we've seen posted by
on leaks and ice universe next up play
plaza
the new version of Google Maps is out at
the bottom of maps is a new tab called
for you
you tell maps which areas you want to
follow and it'll put together
suggestions in that tab when there's a
place that matches up with you
maps will tell you why that place was
suggested apparently I should go over to
the Stags head because it's similar to a
couple of bars I like if it's not for me
I can choose the not interested option
I'm gonna save this for later by
bookmarking it let's talk about the
YouTube app Google updated the app so
now everyone running Oreo can use the
picture-in-picture mode one snag though
music videos won't work in
picture-in-picture mode unless you're
paying for premium next stop google
Gardens Kotaku has a report up that says
Google is working on some kind of video
game platform the report says it's a
three pronged approach number one some
sort of streaming platform which is
codenamed Yeti number two some sort of
hardware and number three an attempted
to bring game developers under the
Google umbrella apparently Google has
met with several video game companies at
the Game Developers Conference and at e3
the streaming system would work like
this Google servers handled the heavy
lifting of rendering the games and then
that would be streamed to a computer or
maybe even Google's own Hardware device
so it'd kind of be like on life but that
service was not long for this world do
you think Google make this work let me
know in the comments speaking of
comments let's head on over to comment
Cove
the part of the show where we shine a
spotlight on the best audience in the
world that's you guys on the Oppo find X
J Lopez says the many problems with
phones that have moving parts are one if
you're one of those parents who lend
their phone to their kids there's a
chance your kid won't take care of that
phone they can accidentally get jelly or
peanut butter on it Jay from now on I
want that to be a new phone selling
point
this phone is jelly and peanut butter

comment about a posed face scanning

before it was agreed upon and not one of
them thought there was anything wrong
with calling it old face I agree with
your sentiment Thanks to everyone for
