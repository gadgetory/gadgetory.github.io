all your google licious it's everything
google that we can pack inside of a show
now the 1+2 phone is still getting all
the attention right now with a waiting
list of over 1.6 million strong and
people are even waiting in lines in New
York just to check out the new phone but
how do you kill all that great momentum
well try this in an interview with USA
Today 1 plus co-founder Carl pay said
the company will have a second phone
coming out this year and said when I saw
the prototype for that phone I was like
hold on that's gonna be my daily driver
but when the 1+2 production version came
out it's also super nice so it's hard to
decide now what to use see this is where
you insert foot in mouth come on Carl
don't kill the hype train when it's
rolling like what are you doing now it
makes me want to wait and see what is
coming instead of going for the 1+2
right away especially since a reddit AMA
with employees confirm that the phone
will not have an NFC chip in it or
wireless charging and lack of quick
charging capabilities like the previous
phone did after they continue to pound
us with the motto never settle now in a
response they said never settle holds
true and if you aren't happy with the
product you shouldn't settle for the
oneplus either translation just go buy
someone else's phone now the ask me
anything also revealed the other phone
leaked out by karl pay won't be the one
plus 3 or 1 plus 2 s type of phone but
something different that hopefully has
NFC wireless charging and quick charging
seriously they need to just stop talking
already instead of killing this good
mojo they've built up and if you guys
want to grab some of these pretty sweet
1080p wallpaper backgrounds from the 1+2
for your own phone you can click right
on the link right here and download them
because they look good alright Samsung
has been playing around with a few new
names for their upcoming circular watch
which has been rumored to be called the
samsung gear a it's going to use their
own Tizen based operating system the
company has already trademarked wheel UX
but they also recently trademark
circular UX described as operating
software for wearable digital electronic
devices FYI that's just
our watch so samsung's next big unpacked
event is expected to reveal the note 5
and the s6 edge+ on August thirteenth so
maybe we'll see something there or not
now renders of those two phones have
already leaked out to the public thanks
to eville eeks the purported specs have
also been revealed for the device
codenamed samsung noble with a five
point six six inch quad HD display for
gigs of ram and an octa-core exynos 7420
processor that's really two quad core
chips with a 16 megapixel rear camera
and a 5-megapixel front-facing one
running android 5.1 point one also sony
just announced what they're calling
their super mid-range smartphones with
the Sony Xperia z5 ultra and the Xperia
m5 both phones will run Android 5.0
lollipop the c5 will have a six inch
display and the m5 will be different
with a 5-inch display and it's also
waterproof now you know I'm one of the
people that pre-ordered the more premium
pebble time steal but it looks like
shipping times continue to get pushed
back from mid-july to the end of the
month and now to August but wait there's
more and now there's an issue with the
steal time watch bands that are also
getting pushed back with an indefinite
ETA so it'll be more like a pebble time
partial steal awesome and something that
will make your tummies Happy if you're
in New York City Google is running a
promotion with food trucks where you're
given a challenge to find a photo based
on a keyword search and if you do it
fast enough you get a free waffle so you
can check out the schedule right here

Austin are up next alright that's gonna
