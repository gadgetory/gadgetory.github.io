appliances here at Corky's headquarters
and today they have announced a whole
bunch of new products Tripper is a door
and window sensor basically you just
stick it on your door or your window and
it'll send you alerts when it detects
motion so you can keep your home secured
similar to the accessories that we've
seen in other security kits and this one
is going to be a 2-pack and available
for $40 and it's shipping December of
2014 another product is overflow it is a
moisture sensor so you can stick it in
your basement under your kitchen sink
anywhere you think there could be a
potential leak or flood so that you can
get a signal from it if there's a
problem out link is a smart outlet now
we've seen a lot of smart clogs not so
much a smart outlet so this is going to
replace your regular outlet and do a lot
of the same things that smart plugs
usually do you can connect it with the
wink app you can see real-time energy
stats from your fridge or computer
pretty much anything to try to save
money over time and that's going to go
for $50 the tapped light switch is
another product that was unveiled today
it is similar to the Belkin Wemo switch
that we've reviewed except that this one
has dimmer capabilities but you don't
need an extra dimmer to dim your lights
you can do that all directly from the
wink app it's also different than it has
two buttons the top button is used for
turning your lights on and off and the
bottom button is kind of a bonus button
so that you can apply any shortcut you
want some of the other products
announced today we're the spotter uniq
the ascend and norm spotter uniq is
basically spotter 2.0 it lets you
customize the sensors that you want so
you can select passive infrared or
motion or temperature and humidity
basically whatever you want and quirky
will make it for you in their new micro
factory and then ship it out norm is a
sensor that basically is here to replace
your existing thermostat and integrate
with the wink app so that you can
control everything remotely
ascend is a garage door controller so
that you can open and close your garage
doors from far away and also extend
access to friends and family so that was
a quick summary of today's quirky
announcements on Megan Bullard
