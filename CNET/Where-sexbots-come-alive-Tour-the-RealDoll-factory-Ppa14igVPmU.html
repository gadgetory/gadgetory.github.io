hyper-realistic sex dolls for 20 years
it's now adding robotics and artificial
intelligence to help bring those dolls
to life or at least make them closer to
the robots we've seen in sci-fi abyss
wants to create a companion that can
talk to you and get to know you we went
to see how these future robot lovers are
made we are at the real doll factory
obviously and these are some examples of
what we make here these are the real
dolls
I run the media representation as well
as the shipping and receiving operations
here so how long does it take to design
for the different dolls how much work
goes into making a different unique doll
so I think the best way to get onto that
we could just head straight down to the
production floor and you guys could get
an idea of how much work actually goes
into making a real doll so more or less
like a regular production line it starts
out all the way on this end of the
building we start with the very core of
the body which is building the skeletons
these are basically the forearms and the
hand game put together for the dolls so
we take the skeleton we place it into
our custom-built two-piece molds we mix
our custom silicone mixture up and we
pour it in there and let it sit and
basically out comes a real doll it's the
birth of a real doll I would actually
say this is a it's only maybe 40% done
once it gets to this point we go through
we fill all these minors holes here that
are part of the molding process we get
them ready for makeup so everything has
to be thoroughly cleaned washed and free
of debris free of grease for your oils
anything like that because it's it can
cause issues down the line it might not
be visible right now but if we if it's
not perfect down the line it could come
up later and I see you've got a lot of
female dolls and also a couple of male
dolls is that like the basic percentage
pretty predominantly female with a
couple of male options or is it more
split evenly if I had to estimate maybe
around a 90 to 10 split so maybe one
male doll to every nine female balls
the main difficulty is in the
engineering aspect once we once we got
the framework laid out it hasn't been
too hard to keep replicating it but
obviously we had to basically build our
own skull that you know replicates what
the human skull would do so it has a
functional jaw that will stay in place
obviously this doesn't have the mouth or
the face of the eyes inserted in a or
the top of the skull but you can see the
base work of where this is gonna go
these are all magnets that will be
attached to the face we make it a very
easy process for customers to put a new
face on every option on this doll was
chosen by the customer all the way down
to what color he wanted the nails color
of the nipples and style
the skin is made of a medical silicone
so it's actually really it's quite easy
to keep clean it doesn't absorb fluids
or oils or anything like that for the
orifices the mouth and the vagina can
both be completely removed and you know
you can clean it and sink if you want so
since she weighs about 75 pounds the
crate weighs only think great ways right
around 90 pounds actually so the crazy
little doll will take hurt will hang her
up in here
and this is what they see you in the
open the box yes it's uh you know it's a
pretty cool thing to open the box up to
it so we really try to make it's really
all about presentation here so we we
want it to look great when they open the
box that's why they go fully clothed wig
makeup everything's done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
