physical wallet with a digital one
instead of an ATM card you can use your
phone to withdraw cash or check balances
so the first step is to access your
digital wallet you can do that with your
fingerprint connect that to the ATM
machine enter your PIN as you
traditionally would and get your cash
the ATM uses the same NFC or near field
communication technology found on some
in-store registers you can use most
major digital wallets including Android
Apple and Samsung pay it even works when
you have no cellular connectivity I took
out cash several times at these ATMs
some using the cardless ATMs on ality
and sometimes using a debit card turns
out that using a phone definitely feels
a lot quicker if you lose your phone
there are security measures in place
first is obviously you know the
fingerprint second is the additional
security on the ATM machine of having to
use the Penn 2400 machines across the
u.s. we'll have the technology in May
and 5000 will have the feature by the
end of 2016 this is not the first time
we've seen a cardless way to take out
cash in Australia many Bank apps let you
generate a one-time code and enter that
at the ATM to withdraw money Wells Fargo
will deploy a similar code based system
and cardless NFC access to over 40% of
its ATMs by the end of 2016
Chase is also upgrading its ATMs to have
the same cardless option in San
