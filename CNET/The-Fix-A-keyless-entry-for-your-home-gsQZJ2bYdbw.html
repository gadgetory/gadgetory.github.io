lock or unlock your front door from
anywhere in the world
just using your smartphone well there's
a wave of Internet connected smart locks
that promise to do exactly that but a
lot of them are total replacements for
your existing deadbolt I'm gonna show
you one that's designed to fit over your
existing lock
it's called lockitron it's coming out
this summer for $179 and it's one of the
only smart lock options out there that's
great for renters this is not going to
damage or replace your existing lock now
the first step is to download the
lockitron app it's available for both
iOS and Android it's gonna walk you
through the whole process and on this
first screen here you're gonna notice a
little thing for checking the
compatibility of your lock you take a
photo you send it to the lockitron
people to make sure it's gonna work
because I swear we had to demo at least
five different doors before we found one
that would work for this video first
register online then add batteries to
power it up and finally connect your
home Wi-Fi network alright it looks like
we're all connected it says the lock is
unlocked
let's give it a swipe let's see if they
can communicate to the lock try the
other way great now it's time to get
this thing on the door using a
screwdriver I'm gonna put this C plate
behind my deadbolt and that'll give it a
nice base for the lock of trying to snap
on enough to take it all the way off
just get it loose enough where I can
slide this thing in place
there's two little grooves here on the
back it's gonna lock right in here and
then slide carefully right there
now that everything's in place snap on
the cover and you're ready to go for one
last test the door is locked I want to
make sure I can unlock my door from my
phone from outside it's good a shot I
heard it
there we go all right my old lock is now
but upgraded and become part of the
internet of things I can now lock it and
unlock it from my smartphone of course
if the internet goes down or the
electricity goes out or the zombies
start attacking I can always just use my
good old fashioned front door key
