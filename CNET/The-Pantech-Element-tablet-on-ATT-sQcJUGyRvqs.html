CES 2012 and I'm here with the pantech
elements due out on AT&amp;amp;T s network this
month for $299 on contract you're
getting honeycomb 3.2 here on an 8 inch
screen so there's a lot of features here
we're used to seeing on honeycomb
tablets you're getting a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core processor front and rear
cameras and you're getting all these
ports across the bottom here you've got
micro HDMI micro USB micro SD card slot
and you're also getting a sim card slot
for 18 piece 4G network but the really
big deal about this tablet is that it is
waterproof now it's not meant to go
diving with but if you're the type of
gets really paranoid at the idea of
taking your tablet outside and the rain
or taking with you to the jacuzzi or
whatever you're gonna do that might
endanger and completely ruin your tablet
this is gonna be waterproof up to one
meter you got to make sure all the
gaskets are here covering the ports so
hopefully you don't have your headphones
already plugged into this by the time
you take it out and fall off the dock or
whatever it's going to happen to to test
the waterproof capabilities here but
it's a nice rugged design for anyone who
is otherwise worried that they're gonna
get their tablet wet or you know it's
going to fall into the water and you're
also getting the benefit of 18 t 4g
network so you're gonna be able to
really take advantage of being outdoors
and not worrying about your tablet being
ruined
so for CENTCOM I'm Donald Bell showing
off the pantech elements on AT&amp;amp;T</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
