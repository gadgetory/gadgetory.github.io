my name I'm a perfectionist because I'm
a Virgo everybody sings in the shower if
they tell you they don't they're lyin
see you're gonna turn your back on
family
as the trailer tales Dom has gone rogue
on us so I don't think anybody saw this
coming my character is it the tech guy
he is the one who wants to have the most
electronics and powerful guns at his
disposal bombs away usually remote
control power things have been waiting
for this we got a tank this room
everyone has a car that fits their
personality and that one fit line as a
man with a lot of testosterone this is a
you know shooting guns is definitely
something that releases a lot of its
kind of therapeutic is what I'm trying
to say that was complete destruction
they were blinks for all of the you know
gun control people and people who might
have issues with that statement the hell
with you I'm not as much of a techie as
the character that I play in Fast and
Furious but I'm trying to catch up my
favorite piece of tech is definitely my
iphone everything is so accessible it's
very easy for me you know I'm a Mac type
of guy my iphone annoys me because at
the blink of an eye they have an updated
version of every single thing you could
ever buy right now so it's kind of
scared right ma'am I tech investment yep
Rhodey is doing very well we started at
about you know two years ago and it's
kind of like an uber for packages words
with friends was one of my favorite
applications but there were certain
words that haven't been added to the
dictionary yet that should be a part of
this game so we came up with something
called sling and friends you know some
of the slang that people are using these
days you know turn swag or lit you come
up with words that people use on an
everyday basis that are slang and you
can use those words in this game did you
want me to smile you up it genuinely
make me laugh
[Laughter]
now you can read the comments and talk
to people and let them see your live
world everybody sees that the insults
and people being mean a lot of those
people just want attention we wouldn't
know what good was unless we understood
what bad were so I still sleep very well
at me even though technology is always
going to be the future sometimes you
have to disconnect yourself and have
some you know actual social interaction
with other people pick up the phone and
talk to someone in person I think that's
a very important and I try to instill
that in my children at work okay I guess
it would be I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
