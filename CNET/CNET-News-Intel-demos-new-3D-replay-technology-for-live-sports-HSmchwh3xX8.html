video format
it captures the sport and the action you
love and turns it into a 3d experience
that you can now watch on broadcast in
the stadium or on your PC at home and as
if you're right in the game it
completely changes the experience and
what it means to be a spectator and with
this technology you'll be able to view
the game from any angle you want you
will become the director and no that's
hard to believe
so let's take a look at this here is an
NBA clip from the marquee matchup
between LeBron James and Kevin Durant
and you could see in the Brawn breakaway
he's got a great stuff there nice view
but it wasn't very immersive I didn't
feel like I was there I didn't see it
now here is the same experience that
we're going to see with us really right
there using we play real three-date
technology we're going to stop and what
perspective do I want to see it from we
play is giving you the ability to change
the highlights and it's no longer just
limited to broadcasters so John here is
going to show us that we can do replay
on our system at home they're using a
Microsoft Surface pro 4 we can relive
the top highlights of almost any
perspective you can see he's choosing
where he wants to go and what
perspective he wants to see it from what
you're seeing here is the power to
redefine what it means to watch and
experience sports</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
