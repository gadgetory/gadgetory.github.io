about playing Pokemon go again the
mobile game that was a global sensation
a year ago is adding rare and powerful
legendary Pokemon to celebrate the
game's anniversary but if you want to
catch one there's well a catch
legendary eggs will appear at gyms and
you need an invite to go on the
legendary raid with your team to battle
them and when the countdown timer on the
egg reaches zero that's when the raid
begins and if you can beat the legendary
boss well then you may be able to add it
to your collection
the first legendary Pokemon will appear
Saturday on July 22nd in Chicago's Grant
Park during a Pokemon go fest now once
people there beat the boss creature then
whatever creature that is will appear in
other read battles around the world
a teaser video shows that players are
going to get invites to fight in the
raid but it's not clear how you can get
that invite or how limited it is to play
the video also shows six legendary
Pokemon but what does it mean all six
are gonna appear on day one and let's
say you do get a powerful one you're not
gonna be able to leave it at a gym to
defend I guess they feel that it
wouldn't be fair since it would be too
powerful for others to beat it this
whole new element requires people to
come together to play something that
brings back the spirit of why people
found this game interesting to begin
with but we'll have to see if it's
enough to bring back players that
abandoned the game for CNET I'm Bridget
Carey and you can catch all the latest
news that's Tina calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
