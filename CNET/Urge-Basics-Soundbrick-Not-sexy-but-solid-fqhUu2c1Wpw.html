cnet.com and I'm here with the urge
basics sound brick yes this is another
mini bluetooth speaker it has a
rechargeable battery and gets about
eight hours of battery life it looks
similar to the jawbone jambox but it
costs less than half the price it has
almost the exact dimensions though it is
a little bit deeper there's nothing
particularly spectacular about the
speaker but it does have a nice
understated design and it does deliver a
little bit better sound than some of the
competition it does have a bit more bass
doesn't have quite as much basis the jam
box but again that speaker is
significantly more expensive but all in
all it sounds pretty good does have a
couple of nice extra features there is
built-in speakerphone capabilities
there's also an audio input as well as
an audio output that output allows you
to string a couple of these speakers if
together if you wanted to allow you get
a little bit bigger sound or you could
connect it to your home stereo and use
the speaker as a bluetooth receiver and
the stream music from your smartphone or
tablet to your home stereo the one small
design element that I didn't like so
much is that there's a blue light that
goes on when you turn on the device and
then it flashes when you pair it so some
people won't whine that so much but then
again some people will find it
irritating that's really all there is to
it there are some competing speakers out
there other small bluetooth speakers
that now cost around forty dollars I
haven't tested all of those speakers
this one as I said costs sixty dollars
it does sound decent for the money I
would like to see it around fifty
dollars and you can get other speakers
in the ninety nine dollar range that do
deliver bigger a little bit richer sound
but if you want a small bluetooth
speaker this is worth considering at
this price point i'm david caro and
that's the urge basics sound brick mini
bluetooth speaker thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
