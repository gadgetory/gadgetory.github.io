here senior toy maker at Santa's
workshop so I hear you want the inside
scoop on what toys are gonna be hot this
year well let me tell you all the
high-tech stuff
sure is changing the game for us toy
makers it's making things way more
complicated I mean everything now is
packed with motion and touch sensors
some even answer to voice commands just
check out Zoomer the playful pup roll
over there you go good boy good boy do
you have to go pee and then there's for
real Ricky the trick lovin pup now as
his name suggests he does do tricks get
it you can feed him
and he poops out the treats you know
robots maybe getting more advanced but
trust me a pooping toy never goes out of
style there's a whole other category of
smaller tech pet creatures now to care
for them you have to study up on their
color codes for their eyes and memorize
all these different action combos now
I'm sure you've heard of hatch emelles
well these mystery toys are still hot
and the new ones are these babies you
have to help hatch out of their eggs to
find out the gender is it a boy is it a
girl it's a it's it's more complicated
Furby and I do mean complicated just
look at this list of things you have to
study to know how to raise the little
furball okay so orange eyes mean you're
gassy hmm this is vital information
purple eyes mean you're hungry oh I have
to feed you now okay well here here have
some of this there you go there you go
the success of Hachem else has given
birth to all sorts of other fuzzy things
with sensors and I like codes and secret
combo reactions too of course
'sheriff with your friends so with the
gleamers if you press and hold the tail
button while hitting the nose three
times it activates fourth-of-july mode
obvious right and remember the
fingerlings trend last year
well there's war now and they're a
little scary you have to know the right
moves to train the prehistoric beasts to
be friendly or nice now if you want a
real dinosaur to train
check out this clever girl alpha
training blue she's got everything a kid
wants to pretend they are a jurassic
world velociraptor trainer because you
have to do certain combo moves with the
motion sensor clicker to level up your
relationship and you can control it like
a puppet oh I'm sorry
do you want something bigger oh we can
go bigger hey bring in Scout we're gonna
need the help of our elf intern for this
one this is the first kid tracks right
uh moles it's a country loving pony
named Scout it's like a Power Wheels
Jeep merged with a Disney animatronic
robot this 70 pound pony has fully
motorized eyes ears and head and of
course wheels on the feet to ride it
around there are 100 sounds of movements
there's a rechargeable 12-volt battery
and there are two forward speeds one
backward speed and it can go up to 4
miles an hour Scout is smart to know
when you feed it treats and when you
brush its hair now ponies are fun but we
elves know the importance of making toys
that teach kids good science and
technology skills so I figure if you're
gonna make a stem toy why not make one
tied to superheros the little bit's
Marvel Avengers Hero kit teaches kids to
program their own super power gauntlet
to fight with the Avengers get creative
to make it respond with custom lights
and sounds depending on the powers you
want to engage it tracks motion
light and there are 18 different
activities you can follow with an app
but sometimes you can't go wrong with a
classic if you love Hot Wheels there's a
car that puts a new twist on the
racetrack the zooming addition car costs
only $1 but it is designed specifically
so you can snap in a cube-shaped gopro
hero session camera sold separately
you'll need to give it some momentum
downhill to give it speed because it
won't work with launchers but when the
GoPro hitches a ride with your hot
wheels you can capture video of fast
flying stunts from the driver's seat now
that's how tech puts a new spin on
playtime I've better clean this stuff up
before Santa gets back excuse me
