we're going to be taking a closer look
at the shark rocket those of you who may
have seen our review video or article of
the DC 59 might be screaming copycat
right now and there are undeniable
similarities between the shark rocket
and the Dyson lightweight model but
there are a lot of differences to most
obviously the fact that the sharks
hundred and $79 price point makes it
less than half the price of the $499
Dyson another major difference that's
obvious right off the bat is the fact
that while the dyson dc50 9 is a
cordless model the shark does have a
cord meaning that you will need to be
near an outlet when you're vacuuming and
will be held to the same constraints
space-wise that you would with a more
traditional vacuum but shark makes up
for this inconvenience by giving you a
lot of options to really customize the
rocket to do whatever you need to be at
hard floors carpet upholstery curtains
stairs or car detailing and they put all
of these attachments in this bag so that
you have easy storage and you know where
everything is it's all in one place all
the time one of my favorite tools that
really sets the shark apart from other
lightweight vacuums we've tested in this
group is this attachment which kind of
works like a Swiffer vacuum for those of
you who may have it and that here's the
vacuum nozzle right here and then this
microfiber pad that's totally detachable
and machine washable follows along
behind and picks up any dirt or debris
that may be caught or stuck to your
floor's these options for total
customization are one of the things that
we really liked about the full-size
shark that Megan Willerton reviewed in
2013 I was really impressed that the
rocket is such a dynamite with pet hair
pet her proved to be kind of a struggle
point for some of these lightweight
vacuums partially perhaps because their
suction is less than a standard
full-size upright but also because their
brushes are more narrow the diameter is
less and pet hair just gets caught and
tangled in those bristles I'm happy to
report though that the shark rocket
performed really really well and
honestly above my expectations
weaknesses are large debris and fine
particulate on carpet particularly high
pile
but I really like this vacuum because I
have two pets that shed pretty
aggressively
so that day-to-day carpet maintenance is
something that can really get out of
hand if you're not keeping up with it
and this would be a great vacuum for
that daily maintenance just run it over
the floors really quickly and then
you're done
and then you can pull out the full size
vacuum your upright for your
heavier-duty weekend cleaning so if you
like the idea of customizing your vacuum
perhaps a little bit more than the dyson
and you also like the fact that this one
retails for half the price at 179
dollars then I would recommend
considering the shark rocket for CNET
