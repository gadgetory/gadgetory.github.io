about when driving has become a memory a
car with no transmission and scene
that's top 5 affordable cars of the last
year it's time to check the tech EC cars
differently and under the hood but also
check the tech and are known for telling
it like it is ugly is included at no
extra cost the good the bad the bottom
line this is CNN on cars welcome to CNN
on cars the show all about high tech
cars of modern driving I'm Brian Cooley
Mercedes fo 15 prototype car looks like
it just drove in from the future doesn't
it it is autonomous self-driving it is
also a fuel cell car but those are
almost footnotes the real story behind
this is to get a sample of how we'll
live differently how society will change
when cars are autonomous let's drive it
well ride in it and check the tech let's
face all that wood and leather and
$6,000 Audio upgrades are basically a
way to make your time in prison more
pleasant
you're still suffering under the tyranny
of driving you have to sit there and
babysit a machine the wheel on the
pedals over a repeat and route of
driving that is not very interesting
day-to-day this is what Mercedes is
solving for not self-driving map we've
already figured out this is more about
what happens after you achieve
self-driving how do you get real luxury
out of that and the answer is twofold
you get real space space is always equal
to luxury and you get your time back the
greatest luxury of all because mobility
is to be honest it's mostly stressful to
give the people the opportunity to relax
to have a private place while moving
yeah are the people will be more
friendly very simple better mood and the
changes in pursuit of that mission are
clear even before you enter the f o 15
notice the shape of the vehicle is very
different than let's say a current
s-class this is not about having several
volumes of boxes as they call it the
three box design of most sedans today
but instead having what's called a mono
volume pushing the wheels way out to the
ends and creating big spacious doors
that open up to almost an entire open
side of the car
here's one of the various first sketches
they did of it and notice how similar it
looks to a very old diagram above it
there is an ancient carriage from what
couple hundred years ago and notice how
it's got some similarities to it get rid
of incursions from wheel wells drive
shaft tunnels nearby firewalls and
protrusions where gas tanks or batteries
live and let's give the passengers the
prime space all to themselves
like a bird's nest it's like a like a
cocoon actually that creates this
atmosphere of privacy that that we
consider is is the next level of modern
luxury the self-driving technology
enabled us to come up with a radical
design concept so this is a proof that
technology and design stimulates each
other to have such great results that we
have now in the car
now here's an example of what it's like
to sit in the Mercedes fo 15 as you can
see now the seats are facing each other
this is what they call lounge mode as
opposed to everyone looking forward and
some of them looking at someone else's
head and that kind of communicates that
everyone's view is about the drive and
where they're going but again we're
trying to break that tyranny the lower
half of each door in this concept Bulova
glass is a large screen that can do a
lot of different modes one of the most
important is that they call the guided
path mode and you have several menus
under that one which shows your point on
the route when you're going to arrive
there's also a social screen to show you
who's around you and who is at your
destination there's a places area which
is kind of a rich Pio eye presentation
that is again geographically sensitive
great when you're visiting a new city
right this is interesting beam cam this
will allow you with another drivers
permission to actually log into the
surround cameras on their fo 15 and
watch their drive and this is so the
most interesting psychology of all
here's the drive mode menu but I have
real questions about what the nature of
a cars drive mode means when you're not
driving
when you aren't connected to shifter
wheel and pedals what do sport and
dynamic modes deliver anymore aren't
sporty dynamics from a car that's
driving itself actually disruptive and
distracting from the peaceful
environment you're trying to establish
in the cabin in the first place the face
and rump of the FO 15 are part of a new
relationship with others along with
sensors and lighting they also include
an array of LED indicators that can
express what the car nose sees and
expects from others around it the cities
beam will become dens and ends up now
there will be competition about public
space so we its will be impossible that
we maintain in the cities lanes for
everybody yeah free lane for everybody
at separation zone that will become
shared so the machine the mobile robot
so to say the car has to give science
what he's doing so you have to build up
the relationship between the people and
the machinery well here we are this is
the FO 15 let's go for a ride and see
what it's like under its own control and
power
now the autonomous driving in the
Mercedes fo 15 is not a new concept what
they're doing here along with having the
car figure out how to drive itself is
also to allow it to be smart enough to
work with new infrastructure to create
dynamic shared spaces they're talking
about smart pylons that could
inexpensively and easily be adopted in
your front yard to make sure no carver
backs over the curve into your long way
you're having a picnic with your kids
powertrain tech isn't the main point of
this car but for what it's worth it's
envisioned as an electric electric
hybrid that means it's a hydrogen fuel
cell car that generates most electricity
on demand from stored hydrogen but it
also has a battery storage system
charged by that same fuel cell power
train or by being plugged in it all goes
out to twin electric motors one on each
rear wheel with a total predicted range
of 680 miles 560 of those from the
hydrogen fuel cell and 125 from the
batteries stored charge even more than
what the f o 15 tells us about itself is
what it tells us about the future of
automotive design reorienting interiors
from the driving task taking back time
from the tyranny of the commute
redefining the concept of performance
and rethinking how personal cars utilize
road space read more about the Mercedes
fo 15 from our day spent with it over at
cars cnet.com the original auto safety
improvements that were really technology
were just three things ABS anti-lock
brakes SRS supplemental restraint system
also known as airbags and ESC electronic
stability control but today you've got a
few more to keep in mind we'll run them
down when CNET on cars continues
here's your new safety tech checklist
when buying a car rear cameras they'll
be mandatory in all new cars by May 28
team meanwhile they're becoming pretty
common but look for differentiating
features like a variable angle rear camp
a front cam or surround view cameras
cross traffic alert this warns of cars
that are about to t-bone you as you
creep out of a blind spot if another
vehicle is approaching from the side the
system notifies you with warning lights
in the side mirrors and a warning beep
adaptive or smart cruise control this
maintains not just speed but the
distance between you and the car ahead
cruise control without this is beginning
to seem like unguided missile mode
forward collision technology it'll
either warn you and lights up a warning
on the dash and sounds an alarm to alert
the driver to the vehicle ahead there's
the warning or actually apply the brakes
when you're closing too fast on
something in front of you and there's
the auto break people stop by itself the
insurance industry has found that either
version of this can make a real
difference in the rate of claims blind
spot tech like forward collision it will
typically warn you of a car in your
blind spot you'll see an Amber icon
illuminated in the mirror to the same
side as the overtaking vehicle and on a
few cars it will take active measures to
keep you from drifting into its path
Blind Spot Assist can take active
measures by applying the brakes on the
wheels on the opposite side of the
vehicle the vehicle is steered out of
the danger zone lane departure tech also
available as a passive warning or a
corrective version note the calibration
of this when you take a car on a test
drive this is set at the factory and
some are just sort of off adaptive
headlights these steer with a car's turn
they can buy you up to 15 feet of
reaction time at 30 miles an hour that's
about 7 pedestrian whips 6 more than you
need to avoid hitting so
object detection this calls out people
or animals straying into your path
especially at night that you may not see
a variant of this is night vision
display which gives you a real-time
infrared view of the road ahead it's
night vision the driver sees
approximately three times further than
is possible with conventional low beam
lights the display shows the driver a
clear black-and-white image of the
driving scene drowsiness warning this
one is still fairly rare drowsy driver
alert systems use a variety of sensors
and cameras to monitor your driving
behavior new innovations in this area
are coming a few model years down the
road most of these technologies are
factory installed and not something you
can retrofit so it pays to double check
if your next car offers them or if the
other car on your list does welcome back
to see net on cars coming to you from
our home at the Mount Tam Motor Club
just north of the Golden Gate Bridge
when we cover a lot of transmission tech
on this show because frankly in the last
few years there's been a lot of it to
cover but several of you wrote in about
a transmission less technology getting
rid of the gearbox entirely yet keeping
the combustion engine it's from a
company called Kern exec they're a
boutique shop Swedish it's their direct
drive platform just came out in
prototype form at the Geneva Auto Show
not on the road yet but it definitely is
worth a look at as it is their road to
the future
your typical combustion engine passenger
car has always put its power out through
a transmission either a three five seven
nine today even the 10 speed gearbox the
reason that gearbox is in there is
because your engine's got a relatively
narrow range of rpms and sweet spot for
power yet your car runs at a wide range
of speeds and offers different load
requirements so you broker the
difference with a wide range of gears
but the overall problem with
transmission is amazing as they've
become is that they remain a crutch
ideally you'd rather not have one for
three very good reasons first of all
transmissions tend to be heavy and
complex they're one of the most
elaborate things in the modern car
secondly they're expensive largely as a
result of being heavy in complex
expensive to put in expensive to fix
that's on you and of course they tend to
introduce some slop and some slow gear
changes now that's been improved a lot
lately but wouldn't it be nice to take
all this out so cooling zeg says we can
do that because of two interesting
trends in power trains one we have
higher rpm high-performance engines and
turbos give them better lower end grunt
secondly we have very torquey electric
motors that are quite well proven these
electric motors have all their torque
from zero on up and can spin in a wide
range of rpms put it all together here
and maybe your powertrain has a wide
enough range of rpms and abilities to
deliver power that it doesn't need gears
to help it
let's take a look at how they lay that
out here's the spine of the car you can
see you've got a vertical battery pack
up in between the seats basically that
brings you down to the turbocharged gas
engine which has an electric motor on
the back side turning the crank when it
needs to - more electric motors are back
here that go out to your drive shaft to
your rear wheels and in the middle there
is a fluid coupler and a final drive
here's how that looks in a schematic
this fluid coupler and final drive do
two important things if you didn't have
that you'd have basically the automotive
equivalent of a fixie a fixed-gear
machine and that's not really useful in
the practical world and then you do have
a gearbox of sorts a reduction here it's
a single speed transmission that never
changes so it's very simple it's
basically a free to Ones of the gas
engine can run at the higher rpms which
is its sweet spot without having to
drive the car at like 60 to 180 miles an
hour all the time now I'm not saying
that this is the Beyond end-all in
future drive trains we may never see
this again but it does underline two
important trends engines that have more
grunt because of Augmented intakes from
turbos and superchargers and electric
motors that can pick up the slack where
gas engines don't do so well put it all
together you've got a spectrum of power
that maybe doesn't need to change gears
one day
in a moment big block versus small block
and five affordable cars
CNET style you can seen that on cars
today
this of course is the Bentley
Continental GT a car known and loved
across the world for welcoming in the
beginning of a reclamation of the
original Bentley spirit the most amount
of power in the smallest amount of space
for the best possible weight
distribution by more from the ex car
team of C net UK at cnet.com slash
welcome back to see net on cars I'm
Brian Cooley here's the part of the show
we take one of your emails this one's
coming in from Mohammed in Kuwait who
asks about engine blocks
he says you always hear in car shows
about muscle cars having big blocks or
small block engines what's the
difference between them he wants to know
how do you tell which is which and how
does a big block versus a small block
affect performance and horsepower it's
kind of a fuzzy question Mohammed
there's no bright line between what
delineate a big block engine or a small
block end let's break it down briefly
the block of course is the lower largest
single part of the engine
it's where the crank that turns here and
the Pistons and there connecting rods
all live above that are the heads with
the valves but back down here in the
block region here are two rules of thumb
that make it a big block or a small
block first of all what is the spacing
between the bores between each of these
cylinders if there's more space it tends
to be a big block if they're tightly
closed together it has to be a small
block when they're closer and tighter
the engine is more compact and yet it
could have more heat generation between
the cylinders which could make it harder
to manage the second consideration is
stroke stroke is how far up and down
these Pistons travel each cycle if they
travel more you can get more
displacements have a bigger more
powerful engine for a given diameter
however to have that additional travel
you have to have a crank that is more
eccentric that has longer or deeper
throw lobes and that means it needs more
room down here that makes it a taller
block so these are the two main factors
little delineate a big block from a
small block well you don't hear much
about either anymore
in the modern era it tends to be a race
performance or classic car term now I
recently brought you our top five cars
of 2014 as judged by CNET ratings which
quickly prompted many of you to ride in
and say that's great now how about
something I can afford we here yet
instead of a list riddled with Audi rs7
s and BMW i8 s here instead is our top 5
affordable cars of the last year or so
according to their C net ratings now
this is by no means an exhaustive list
of the entire market but it does cover
cars reviewed by C net in the last year
that came in under 25 grand with
destination and got really great review
scores basically four stars or more or
an 8.0 or higher with one exception you
can find cheaper cars by the way but
they don't hit the top scores that we
give I figured you wanted the good stuff
so let's go I'm gonna rank these based
on that C net score but filtering in the
MSRP to new ones that a bit number 5 the
Ford Fiesta ST not quite an 8.0 score
you'll notice but close enough to it for
one of the hottest hatches on the market
right now about 200 horsepower and 200
pound feet of torque from a little
engine that delivers 2635 MPG that's
great and equipped with wheels
suspension and torque vectoring that are
all geared for the curves it's the
cheapest way to show up at Auto cross
and have the right gear number for the
Mazda mx-5 you know it as the Miata
easily the car that I would most want to
drive on a nice road though not of
course if that road leads to Costco the
Miata just sneaks in under our price cut
and even then it leaves out Bluetooth
and USB unless you upgrade so buy some
earbuds and realize you're in a great
handling fund shifting happy revving
open top icon for under 25 grand and
bring something bigger to Costco number
three it's a Subaru Legacy even a bass
legacy has their great symmetrical
all-wheel drive that's a big plus it's
the only car on our list that has all
the we
driven Subarus not normally a cabin tech
leader to be diplomatic but their system
gave us less to complain about then last
year and they distracted us from its
shortcomings with their quite nice
optional eyesight technology that
handles driver assist well and again
comes in at a nice price point number
two is the Mini Cooper hardtop the
Classic Mini now they have one less
cylinder in the engine this generation
but more power than they had with more
cylinders the Mini connected
infotainment platform is much improved
now it taps much of the latest
generation of BMW idrive design rather
than tapping the first generation you
either love the look of a mini or wish
it stripe ode to the dot-com era would
just go away but know that its iconic
shape is now much roomier than it was
last year before I get you to number one
a couple cars I want to give an
honorable mention to first of all you
get the GMC Canyon it misses the cut on
our score requirement by just a little
bit but it's a real pickup in a small
package that drives like a car and as
far from the bottom in terms of cabin
temp and I got to tip my hat of course
to the VW GTI it missed the cut on cost
by about 600 bucks but it scored a list
topping 8.2 score thanks to great
driving dynamics good cabin design and
not bad technology our number one car on
the list is so strongly the Mazda mazda3
it's the cheapest car in the list and
it's the only one that got an editor's
choice from our reviewers it's fun the
drive has a choice of manual or
automatic transmission you've got
Pandora stitcher AHA and modern apps in
the dash even a little head-up display
that pops up though it's a bit like
something out of a cereal box
still this is your bargain choice and
knowing Mazda likely built to stay that
way
thanks for watching hope you enjoyed
this episode keep those emails coming a
whole bunch of this episode was driven
by your requests that's on cars at
cnet.com I read them all reply to as
many as I can I'll see you next time we
