government and computer scientists have
largely been on opposite sides of the
privacy debate no doubt defense of the
NSA's program was it's just metadata and
so it seemed to us it would be worth the
time to try to see whether that claim
was true empirically metadata includes
details like the number dial the time of
the call and duration just how sensitive
is that information according to
research done by Stanford PhD student
Jonathan Mayer and his partner very they
created an Android app meta phone that
asked users to volunteer their phone
records in an effort to learn what can
be uncovered from metadata more than 500
people signed up we began by identifying
the organizations associated with the
phone numbers in our data set and we did
that primarily using phone books
provided by Yelp and by Google totally
public totally easy to access with the
help of Facebook's phone directory
feature people search services and
Google more than 90% of the numbers were
quickly identified we noted when a
business was a firearms dealer we noted
when a business was a health service
provider users also place calls to
religious organizations financial
services and marijuana dispensaries
although NSA surveillance is limited to
two or three degrees of separation from
an original suspect the meta phone app
illustrates how the program can reach
many people there are these numbers that
are very very popular like t-mobile's
voicemail number or FedEx or Delta
Airlines or one of my favorites
telemarketers these the spam phone calls
which call loads and loads of people and
the NSA's rules don't prohibit the
agency from following those hops Mayer
and his partner plan to examine the data
further to see if other information can
be found though focus on text messages
next and they're working on something
called a dating detector but this is
like what computer science people do on
a weekend I guess we don't go on dates
we just build systems for detecting
people going on dates and so we built a
machine learning system for identifying
participants who were weren't in a
romantic relationship
it
raises very real privacy concerns about
what happens when our phone records and
public information reveal very personal
affairs in Stanford California
