here
Jason Coker's ATV struck a downed power
line
he took 7,200 volts of electricity and
doctors had to amputate his arms below
the elbow you know the first thoughts
the problem with in my mind was I got
three kids now but at the time I only
had two I had a 21 month old and a three
month old little girl and you know I
didn't know if I'd ever be able to feed
myself or put my own clothes on or or do
anything that you know I think people
take for granted I mean I did two Koger
uses prosthetics called islands made by
touch bionics the fingers are made of
titanium and the eye limb was the first
hand on the market with a motor in each
finger he has two but changes them out
with other prosthetics including body
powered hooks depending on what he's
doing after a lot of work kogure we
learned how to do everyday tasks like
getting dressed and playing with his
kids at their home in Owensboro Kentucky
he can even crack an egg and open a can
of soda aside from the sensors and the
prosthetics that help him control the
islands there's a mobile app for iOS
with the app he could pre-program common
grips he might want to easily access so
sue she hasn't hit again it
automatically goes into a mouse grip so
this would be to hold a computer and
when I closed and then was if you look
see the finger just the first finger
moves so that would be a click on your
mouse pad he can also use the app to run
a health check on the hand and send the
data to his prostitutes in Texas or he
can look at a graph that shows him how
he's using the hand in a real-time touch
bionics is also added Apple watch
compatibility everybody asked what I can
do with this I can do everything except
for three things I can't cook clean or
change dirty diapers and it's just cuz I
couldn't do it before when I had real
hands so uh but there
and literally allows me to do anything
Koger says he's not sure if we'll ever
totally replace a person's real hands
but by limbs come pretty close</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
