everyone don't miss it and don't go with
the same old collection of flowers and
candy you send every year I'm Molly wood
in for Bryan Cooley with a scene at top
5 the top 5 tech gifts for mom coming in
at number 5 it's the Amazon Kindle if
she doesn't have a Kindle yet people now
is the time I mean the ad-supported
model is only 114 bucks just make sure
you pair it with an Amazon gift card for
book buying and some sort of certificate
for several hours of alone time for
reading preferably by a pool somewhere
in at number four get her a smartphone
we have a lot of favorites in this
category from the obvious iPhone 4 to
the HTC Thunderbolt 2 the shift 4G on
Sprint the main goal though is getting
mom a gift that will help her take
pictures get on Facebook text with you
when you don't have time to talk get her
email and play games on the go if she
doesn't have a smartphone yet this is
the year to make it happen coming in at
number three the Microsoft Xbox Kinect
every mom I know right now is loving the
Kinect for one reason
dance central it is an awesomely fun
workout and the kids love it too
if you don't have an Xbox it's a great
bundle and if you do the Kinect add-on
makes it less of a boy's toy and more of
a family console of course if your mom
is anything like me you can get her
Kinect and the new Mortal Kombat game
I'm not trying to stereotype here much
at a very strong number two the iPad 2 I
got my mom and iPad and we've never been
better Facebook friends it's the perfect
email web and video watching device for
Mom especially if the dude in her life
hogs the remote plus hello Angry Birds
Rio and I can tell you from personal
experience the iPad is the best kid
entertainment and education tool you
will ever own kid airplane iPad she will
thank you and finally my number one tech
gift idea for mom this year is my number
one tech gift idea always a Roku
streaming media box the Roku is the
perfect gift it's as cheap as 59 bucks
now with no monthly fee plus it's dead
simple to set up and you'll be watching
streaming movies internet video and
don't forget that
every episode of Mad Men is coming to
Netflix Instant Streaming and if there's
one constant in the universe it's this
we ladies love to watch Don Draper okay
now I'm stereotyping but don't try to
pretend that it's not true
because it is true and that's it for
this edition of CNN top five I'm Molly
wood and you can find all the rest of
our top five videos over at scene at
