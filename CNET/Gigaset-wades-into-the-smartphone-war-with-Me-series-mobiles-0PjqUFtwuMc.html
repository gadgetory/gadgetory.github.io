into the smartphone wars we're taking a
look at its first effort it's the
gigaset me series less investigating so
there are three variants of this phone
but let's start with the standard one
it's the gigaset me ok so this phone has
a 5-inch display it's got a 1080p
resolution I have to say that display
does make a good first impression this
thing looks very crisp colors are quite
natural and my first impressions are
good the design is also quite pleasant
it's nothing revolutionary this thing
really does just look like most other
smartphones but it feels quite good it's
built with metal around the sides and
that gives it a very solid feel around
the back that's a 16 megapixel camera
while on the front us an 8 megapixel
camera which means you're going to have
plenty of pixels for all of your selfies
and video calls there's a couple of
other camera tricks worth mentioning the
first is the gigaset says this phone has
very very fast autofocus which could be
good if you're trying to take a photo of
a moving subject and the second is
something called focus later which means
that you'll be able to take a photo and
then afterwards tinker with wearing
sadly the point of focus should be on
that image it's also got a fingerprint
sensor on the back for a little extra
security and this is a dual SIM phone so
you can have two SIM cards in it at once
if you don't want two SIM cards you can
use one of those slots to store a micro
SD card because that's also saying that
it has a very high capacity battery but
we've heard a lot of battery claims
before so we'll be looking at that when
it comes time for the full review so
that's the standard me now there's also
the me Pro which is a little bit more
fancy it's got a 5.5 inch display it's
got a 20 megapixel camera or if you're
looking for something more basic there's
the me pure now the pure has a 5-inch
display again but it's got a slightly
less powerful processor it's got 2
gigabytes of RAM rather than 3 gigabytes
so let's talk about the all-important
price tag well the me pure that's the
low-end one it's going to cost 350 euros
the standard me which is one we looked
at first is gonna cost 470 euros while
the more expensive me pro cost 550 euros
they're all gonna go on sale in Europe
and China in the autumn so what do you
think of these phones let me know and
