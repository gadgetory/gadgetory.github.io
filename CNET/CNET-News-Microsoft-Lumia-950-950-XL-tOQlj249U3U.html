everybody this will be disembodied voice
auntie anne's hello jessica Dahlberg
Christina I'm looking at the microsoft
lumia 950 and 950 XL these are the two
new Windows 10 devices from Microsoft
the regular 950 has a 5.2 inch display
so that's the smaller one but believe it
or not it's pretty big and the 950 XL
has a 5.7 inch display now the specs on
both of these are very similar they both
have 20 megapixel cameras on the back
with a three-step LED flash that's
supposed to make skin a lot more
natural-looking and we do have the tiles
on the interface there are 5 megapixel
cameras on both of them one difference
is that the processor is a little bit
thicker on the XL we've got an octa-core
processor versus a hexa-core that six
core processor on the regular 950 so
these are pretty powerful devices they
are plastic most of what we're seeing
today is metal but they do have a lot of
specs that people are going to like
including removable battery micro SD
card slot and a new
the charger that introduces over school
and it is also fast charging now we
haven't had a chance to really look at
all the details here but it will support
biometrics iris scanning so that means a
proposed block can you look into it so
jump it and it will unlock so that's
pretty cool there's another feature
called continuum and we don't have that
setup right here yet but it basically
means that you can use your photos and
computer definitely and check out CNN
