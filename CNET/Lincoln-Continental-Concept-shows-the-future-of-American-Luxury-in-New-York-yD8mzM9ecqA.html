York International Auto Show and welcome
to this the Lincoln Continental concept
now on the outside this car is a bit of
a departure from current Lincoln's
through dramatic styling but the real
story here is actually on the inside
specifically the rear seats it's the
interior they've got a lot of attention
to detail on this the Lincoln concept it
was inspired by executive jets a really
high-end airline travel we've got some
lovely reclining seats here beautiful
materials everywhere as I recline my
seat the front seat will move forward
automatically there's a fold up pop-up
desk that comes out here in the middle
I've got touch controls here and even if
I unzip this pair of custom leather
loafers on the outside this car looks a
lot different than current Lincoln
specifically this front grille if you're
familiar with the current Lincoln's
they've got that big chrome wing on the
front something that not everybody has
really resonated with with this we're
going with a more traditional looking
chrome grille looks a little bit like a
Bentley perhaps we see some flak
actually from Bentley designers who
think this is a little bit derivative it
is a little bit less distinctive and
then currently because what it is very
sophisticated I think it looks quite
nice on either side of the grille
there's a stack of LED lights and
lighting is actually a big story for
this car as you approach with the key in
your pocket the car wash you begin to
light up into glow unfortunately not
something we can show you here on this
brightly illuminated show floor that's
something of the presence of the car to
make it more of a dramatic arrival
something of a homecoming if you're an
owner now this is just a concept cars
you can probably tell by the skinny
mirrors and the lack of door handles but
Lincoln is promising a new full-size
sedan for us sometime next year if we're
lucky maybe look like this again this is
the Lincoln Continental concept the show
floor here of the New York International
Auto Show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
