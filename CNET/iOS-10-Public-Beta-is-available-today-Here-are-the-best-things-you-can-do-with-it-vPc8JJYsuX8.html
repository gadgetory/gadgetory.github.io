coming in a more polished version in the
fall but it is available now for free is
a public beta and you can download and
check it out for yourself before warned
it's an early peek at the software
feature set that's coming and it may not
work perfectly on your phone so don't
use it on your primary device but if you
want to see what it's all about these
are the best things to check out right
now raised to wait maybe you have an
Android phone that already does this but
finally the iphone can too you can pick
it up and you can now see notifications
without pushing any buttons to open up
the phone you still need to press the
home button however new Apple music well
a new coat of paint Apple music on iOS 9
is weirdly designed and it's really hard
to figure out Apple music and iOS 10 as
a whole new look you can explore it's
cleaner but finding genres and songs may
not necessarily be all that much easier
depending on what you're looking for
whether it's a better app remains to be
seen I messages get funky you probably
heard but I messages can now do all
sorts of wacky things they work on iOS
10 public beta 2 invisible ink slamming
super large emoji balloons lasers
stickers and emoji translating keyboard
marking up photos I messages will
support third-party apps but not yet
right now all you can play with all the
force sticker packs and all the other
weird features that are currently in it
deleting stocks or iTunes or just about
anything you can remove Apple's corn on
removable apps or well most of them they
don't really get erased but they get hit
in there basically gone and then you can
get the back again via the app store but
some apps still can't be removed like
health for instance or the app store
memories what this means is basically
all your photos in Apple's iCloud are
now scanned using machine learning to
collect in a moment's inside Apple's
Photos app they're organized by faces
and places kind of like Google photos
this worked with my photo library after
its satin baked for a while but I still
couldn't get to play any of the promised
cool memory videos that it does maybe
you can bedtime reminders and wake up
music in the clock app there's now a
cool new feature to set bedtime
reminders and track sleep kind of like
what Fitbit does and best of all there's
also new music for wake up alarms nice
gentle stuff and you
gently Rises and it made me feel more
relaxed happy exploring the final
version of iOS 10 arrives in early fall
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
