and welcome to the 404 show live from
CES 2012 my name is Jeff Bakalar I'm
Wilson tang and I'm Justin you and this
is the show where we put it all on black
that is correct that's how I lose a lot
of money but we're very happy to be here
trimming live from CES 2012 guys how are
you enjoying the show so far until it's
officially started today it has
yesterday was a lot of press conferences
going on a lot of strangeness at press
conferences a lot of kangaroos a lot of
kangaroos and apparently that's going to
get up people buying DVRs yeah I never
put two and two together but it's
brilliant the first thing I think of
talking about laptop manufacturers
making TV we did TV manufacturers making
laptops for the topsy-turvy world yeah
absolutely yesterday was pressed day and
there were a lot of really cool press
conferences I think my favorite though
the Panasonic press conference a lot of
weird thing is going on is like a return
to the 19th right yeah throwback yeah so
I don't know if you guys saw this but uh
by the way it's really nice to have more
than two people in the audience this is
great really interesting fantastic
people so yeah yesterday panasonic
announced their new social televisions
in conjunction with myspace most last
time even heard those two words we're
gonna walk yeah well I'm surprised that
you would use the word myspace and
anything that's must be buzz-worthy yeah
usually it's like remember my space all
right happened a while ago right now how
to get rid of your myspace right
absolutely so we've seen social
televisions before but panasonic they
didn't release a lot of details about it
but basically you're to be able to sort
of tell your friends on the TV what
you're watching on the TV you probably
don't want to do that though right well
I probably don't do it either a lot of
guys probably wouldn't want to know or
wouldn't want to share everything that
they're watching and sure everything you
watch on your TV is sort of your own
personal experience right yeah I don't
know how willing a lot of people will be
to share that information
right yeah well I watch a lot of Cartoon
Network Wilson I don't know what you're
right here but uh it was really close at
the end they had kind of like a one last
thing moment where they brought out a
celebrity to promote myspace TV on
Pennisi right that's Justin Timberlake
how about that came out to a very quiet
audience nobody seemed to care that
Justin if i was there i would have been
screening in the front we're gonna throw
in your panties up there what's going on
to here with this was it euro you're
blowing me off anyway uh yeah so justin
is apparently bringing myspace back a
single handedly is that something you
guys would well you know I was talking
to Rafe Needleman about this yeah and
like myspace should just stick to what
it originally was and I was like
something that bans could you know get
into and really like a continued to
develop that right nobody needs another
social network nobody needs another
video service right especially one
that's full of crap so far yeah I mean
you know it's like the myspace TV that's
the sort of thing feel like they should
have like the myspace well you know like
music player or something like that
that's what I associate myspace with
yeah that's how I listen to you know
quote unquote undiscovered bands in
point yeah I really don't associate my
series with TV ever well you know it's
fine it's sort of in that same vein last
night I was at digital experience and I
gotta see television set sure that I
think arguably is cooler than a myspace
TV and that was a TV set with bittorrent
built right in okay um I don't know how
they manage to do this it's just gonna
spit out citations every time I down you
just buy it you go to jail right um but
no apparently bittorrent has gotten
together with a bunch of European and
Asian manufacturer okay and they built
the technology right into the TV set
right um I haven't searched for anything
sort of you know illegal or where
someone doesn't own the copyright to it
but I feel like it's sort of like really
taking that removing that middle step
sure admit you know people won't admit
it but they'll tour in something and
then they have to hook their computer up
or they have to
you know get a player that plays the
indie this is just bypassing the whole
thing me I got easier for four straight
from the remote you'll be all search for
loss right ever that's a dangerous
combination I mean as long as it's not
in 3d that's all i care i got i just
want to hear about one TV announced but
that's not actually going back to the
panasonic news they announced that this
summer you know the summer olympics in
london they're happy broadcasting that
in 3d that's the first Olympian the
Olympics of every woman answering now
she's going to move 3ds the summer
olympics do i really want to watch mens
weightlifting right like the shot put
yeah like ping pong yet like men's table
tennis wonder if yeah definitely I would
think I am I don't know about nothing
about the javelin yeah absolutely one of
those things that really just gonna hurt
the Olympic brand and another think so i
think i mean i get people tuned in to
the Olympics there's a lot of national
pride I've suddenly a lot of people
start watching it on their HD 3d TV and
they get nauseous cheering for their
team I don't know if that's a good thing
for all right not know you're the only
one that gets nauseous watch AMD not
gonna hear in order our live honest
Wilson was watching were you watching I
was watching an African documentary
right and he got nauseous after what six
seconds of watching three details yeah
and I took on the train on the way home
Maddie know that I that's gross all
right let's bring along what else we
have going on apparently there's a hand
crank powered a tablet that is debuting
here at CES Majesty is like the third
version of the this project has been
going on for years now it's called the
one laptop per child yep it kind of
almost gave birth a bit in a way to the
netbook revolution right I'm gonna
supposed to be a super low cost pc sure
connect to the internet have Wikipedia
built-in right um and you know after
netbooks took off nobody really had good
reason to buy a One Laptop Per child and
now they're they're also behind it
it with this new product it's a tablet
yes this tablets called the XO
three-point Oh like you said it's the
third version it's going to have an 8
inch screen you're going to have you're
off your options of two operating
systems to put on it that's Android and
then a lineups based operating system
here's my question though why don't they
just give away touch pads yeah they're
gonna cost about a hundred dollars yeah
her tablet uh-huh for that price you
probably could have just sent over a 16
gate touch said what I use at home
perfectly good you won't have to
manufacture sure and you're not left
behind it all a little buddy yeah well
yeah but you imagine a bunch of kids the
first thing I'm gonna do is like root it
or right you're really upset I think
they're really like that McCallum yeah
thinking about rooting yeah all jokes
aside this is actually a really cool
product absolutely a hand crank you
mentioned is used to power the solar
energy power on the battery on it and
you just crank it up or put in the Sun
and it'll charge your battery for eight
hours interesting well speaking of a
sort of non 3d HDTV tech that finally
sort of taking off right um Thunderbolt
yeah I was the you know high-speed data
connector mostly available on max so far
they've been one or two other computers
have variants of it but the connectors
the adapters and everything that you
could get for from their boat is really
frigging expensive right right like
they're a couple hundred bucks but now
manufacturers turn to release new
products that really take advantage of
that yep and intel a said that they're
building Thunderbolt into their Ivy
Bridge processors which will debut
actually not now but in the next half of
the year right which is why in a blog on
our own CNET's crave you can go to crave
Dina calm and read Scott Stein's blog
about why you should maybe hold off on
buying a laptop one of the reasons he
said that is because a lot of drives are
coming later this year sure in the
summer time it'll actually have
Thunderbolt ports built in right now you
don't have anything to access those drug
understand why they can't line up that
whole laptop release schedule to make
that up it seems like you come to see us
you're looking for the latest and
greatest yet and then they're like now
we don't have that
that's good little later on I mean it
really is a good point like there's a
huge onslaught of ultrabooks right but
they're going to be quickly replaced
with brand new processor technology a
lot faster to a point where you can get
some real heavy duty work done on them
right and the batteries are going to
last forever essentially what's really
cool though is that I was walking the
floor earlier today and there's a new
drive that came out at the show called
the elgato huh that's a solid state
drive that has a thunderbolt port on it
and it's self powered by the bus so now
you can attach that to just drive you
won't need an external batteries or
senator power itself well you know I
really think we're getting to a point
where Thunderbolt in a lot of ways is
finally going to be able to fulfill its
promise sure you know that I think the
coolest thing is the apple thunderbolt
display you know like you like to carry
your computer around go to a meeting you
you want to sit and write in the part
right but when you get back home and you
actually need to do some heavy-duty work
on a much bigger screen right you just
plug that one you know that boy in now
you got your gift gigabit ethernet your
get all these firewire ports it becomes
like a fully functional and computer not
to mention the tank gigabit transfer
speeds right yeah super super fast no
beyond that there been a couple of big
you know product announcements over here
in OC es a big one that's on a lot of
android phones that we've seen is this
new gorilla glass yeah and this is
something i'm really a psych devout
because i feel like every cell phone
everything i've ever owned has always
just eaten it totally you know a week
later I look at my new phone and it's
just scratched to all health I feel like
now that you know this new and improved
girl glass too they were throwin I heard
they were throwing them against the wall
right is that what is that what they
were demo yeah they were like literally
having people over you know stuff like
that right just to prove how scratchers
isn't that stuff is proved out careless
people really right yeah bill you'll
probably you know counter oh good you
know so you'll drop your phone off in
the middle of the street in a dump truck
this is what's gonna have to other thing
they should just do a product demo right
behind the stage of this legend to start
dropping phone right now super nun them
go and see my thing with the display
yeah all right cool uh well I think
we're gonna take a little break a little
break yeah hopefully we'll have a Kevin
Pierre from g4 on the second half the
show he's supposed to be here somewhere
I don't know where he is but maybe he's
on his way but ok we'll find that out
and then we'll be doing a couple
giveaways with everyone who's here so if
you want something for free and you like
free stuff like everyone does you want
to stick around we're going to give a
lot a lot of stuff away in the next
segment cool alright so we will be right
back this is the 404 mr effers the show
where we all sing songs
the 404 streaming live from CES 2012
we're very excited to welcome our guests
can be mean that excite yes filling out
at the crowd can't even hear you over
there oriental one thank you guys write
anything give it up for Kevin Bleyer
really okay thank you three people there
is that guy over there has no idea it's
almost like they don't even see us look
I don't mean to cast such giant shadows
over this beautiful side but no Brianna
appreciate you being here my I always
love being your madness is this is my
yearly pilgrimage not just a CES but to
this table right here coming an annual
sort of tradition we gotta break it
immediately everybody in volatile ong
have you been here I three and a half
minutes or so since getting my definite
so yes several years now i don't know
they were asking me what my first year
of coverage was and i don't remember but
after that 3d was the next big thing
here and it still is probably six to
seven years later forever yeah anything
that you've seen so far really captured
your attention or I mean you know I
honestly haven't had a chance to catch
much yet i'm really i'm an audio file
when i love new audio technology i love
that noise cancellation is finally
getting good where it doesn't muddy up
they assure sounds are trying to hear
and they're taking that you know
headphone manufacturers are putting
multiple drivers and headsets it's not
just one speaker less and you lose all
the resolution did you have a chance to
go check out monsters new set of
glorified headbands and necklaces no
they're beautiful in a hundred like you
wave interference is not a monster
branded I saw parrot has a has a set
that sort of uses the jawbone jaw
movement sensing technology plus three
microphones built in to handle ambient
noise cancellation when you're talking
and listening right that's a lot of
technology there plus you can do volume
up or down by swiping the side of the
head phones that are violent skip
through tracks as well going to be hours
of listening time I mean it's headphones
yes but the technology is getting better
and I like that it's here it's not the
promise of 0 in five years right this
thing will do this they're delivering it
again and you know I feel like that's a
big shift just in general this year now
it's like really really really cool to
like go down the street and tell people
what kind of headphones yet well just
layin down the street like I get stopped
and you know sometimes I'll be testing
like a new soul headphone and people
will just ask me hey how do they sound
and really I feel like there's two kinds
of a no audio files one the guy who
wants the base as loud as possible where
it won't blow his eardrum okay and then
the other one is the one who really
wants like high fidelity audio sure and
that's where like the difficulty is in
the middle right like you want if I and
I'm the ladder guy I'm the guy who wants
to know what it sounds like when they
mixed it in the studio right now versus
like the base being so high I can't even
hear the words they're in this all right
blouson also thinks he's getting stopped
because people are impressed by his have
one they're just very funny discuss it's
just two speakers doing what's wrong sir
all right tell me about your unfortunate
look abroad um all right so very cool so
headphones definitely a big deal to show
so far yeah I think it's time we get
into one of our segments and if Kevin if
you would like to participate that be
ought to be all chance to talk yeah
chance to be doing alright so the first
thing we're going to do is we try doing
this yesterday we're calling it New
Year's tech resolutions obviously CES
starting off the year on the right foot
we we kind of want to break maybe some
bad habits that maybe we've gotten into
the you know habit of doing on a regular
basis right so uh my personal tech
resolution for 2012 I'm going to stop
collecting meaningless wires and usps
and just every recommended after you've
ever seen I have a you got to have a
drawer or a case yes and the crane feel
that looks like not at Christmas less
like I bought i went to the container
store and got this huge dressed up in I
have 30 pounds the containers to or the
hoarders Emporium like I show people
this bin and I go
oh my god Jeff is where's TLC they need
to come and do a documentary field RF
switchers forget up your Nintendo exact
you keep like a parallel port cables
yeah like 10 you might you know travel
scuzzy my back into fashion never know
retro I said it went into early so
that's my personal resolution 3d you're
gonna give them away you're gonna burn
them line i don't know i only got to
radio shack where they came from open
your own one and it just is out it's
like a flavor in a jar it's like a
confetti of just all these different
wires is also funny it's like a trip
back in history though sometimes yeah
it's a time where the hell did I get
this right there does it go to or sure
that you line it with lpt1 brackets
would close I just convinced myself hey
one day I'm going to need this I gotta
hold on to your anything so do people
that collect cats live the same stuff
for you down there in tality my kudos on
I have a problem good thing these wires
don't leave but anything behind i think
is there anything that you're looking to
change for your personal tech life 12
yeah you know I was just thinking just
now a I gotta leave a sponsor's I need
to be aware of known exactly where katie
man okay it's don't you syndrome at this
matter better customer I feel nauseous
whenever I pay the monthly fee to drop
calls and no sir I've been able to check
my email in like a day and a half except
the hotel on the Wi-Fi and that's insane
to me that here we are surrounded by the
latest and greatest technology and
they're trying to say we're going to
stream multimedia to the car I can't get
a text message so I believe you're doing
anything else yes that's all side 18
he's actually sponsoring the payphone be
present the land
need to be promise we won't hurt either
so I got to get rid of them and then the
other thing is that I I pride myself on
again I'm an audio file I like high-def
graphics and greatest and yet for some
reason i'll spend money to go out of my
way to have a seedbox in lithuania so i
can get bit torrent of low-quality xvid
movies that are probably available on
deck yeah great sup look at a 7.1
surround sound and high-def graphics and
i'm watching mono yeah cameron from a
theater is somebody because i feel
entitled like I shouldn't have to pay
for I'm paying thirty bucks a month for
a seedbox insane sure I need to start
your own personal demons you gotta back
yeah I got it I gotta do that yeah what
about you guys good luck with that in
2012 what was my mutt I like yours
actually yours yesterday you were saying
you didn't want to you wanted to stop
labeling people random yeah yeah I have
a habit of renaming people in my contact
book yeah things that maybe shouldn't be
said aloud and borrow their car on my
phone and find out that I've labeled
them something awful what it's Kevin
you're gonna reset when I relation to
her that will let me and just me and
Justin and his asian and other Asian
yeah a 180 all right let's let's let's
switch gears and do another segment that
we're calling this is this is a little
up close and personal I think I spilled
too many beans but the resolution of the
year but now it's getting to something
I'm calling tech confessions
all right you like that look Kevin what
can I confess that i would pay monthly
for access to videos like that we can
arrange that in with the show don't you
worry about that ah so check confessions
I believe Justin you have a tech
confession you want to share with us
it's gonna be hard for me right now you
know it took me a long time but I think
it will help that i'm saying it in front
of a huge audience it's a big deal Kevin
um so my confession is that I still
record music off the radio onto consent
I have literally hundreds of five nike
shoe box of maximal cassette tapes look
at the way it's true creamy way they're
like music on the radio yeah there's a
thing called ready when they broadcast
free music on what is it that you can't
be that you of you clear channel you
have to get it yeah vs itunes or Spotify
figure out how to do this downloading
thing off the internet yet so it's so
easy we hit that record button on my
boom box and then I little that
yeah that lot of retro yeah man what I
mean how many I'm not know let's open up
a museum how about that wedding although
is that it's not even one boom box
you've got the two next to each other
one record and when actually with a
radio tuned in nice but then i can make
cassette tape mixes you know i can label
them like now that's what just in case
that mean in case someone invents a time
machine yes i like that if that's a
hobby like you just happened to live and
record did you actually do that you know
like when you're younger like report
things out the radio come on you know
maybe a howard stern episode or dream
when I should have been listening
sharing kind of recorded out of
alignment listen later right but no I
wasn't I wasn't big like that and I
didn't really
oh I I mean Justin's still doing it but
either I think we had this group of
tapes we're like you'd have some track
on there and then you have your mom
screaming in the background right green
bay's on the radio so once you have a
mixtape do you then encode it and dial
up to a bulletin board system yeah that
is probably account that's my confession
that is a pretty terrible terrified
attic is there anything that you would
like to disclose with our live audience
and people watching I mean to me it was
I mean the sea bots thing is something I
really got a kick I gotta get rid of
that no I you know I don't I'm pretty
upfront about my you know it's not like
a all right I used to be the guy we go
I'm sitting down for a dinner a meal or
whatever I haven't seen you in a long
time the phone would come out and it
would be face up and any little
distraction or I'd constantly hits a
home button looking for I'm not
connecting did you say something let me
see if you set it in a tweet bad conduct
just trying to get I'm trying to get rid
of that and get through that because I
find that so many the friendships that I
have with people that I truly feel like
her good friends with the good hey did
you see that thing that I tweeted yeah
yeah I did cool and that's the entire
discover the article was or the shorter
was your experience it was just did you
see it right well great so that's my
confession i'm guilty of doing that and
I want to try to get away from that this
guy too bad news oh no that was my
resolution actually that I would finally
start looking people in the eye and I'm
having a conversation with them instead
of looking at my phone bill I'm going to
lock eyes with people i think i really
want to get guns absolutely uh so i
think we're ready for another break and
then when we come back we're going to be
getting a few people from our live
audience here to participate in a brand
new game that just didn't spent three
minutes developing Wow all right all
right always playing farmville right now

give the audience a chance to win a
really cool prize a cnet sweatshirt yeah

going to stop by this stage right right
after we get off at two p.m. Eastern
fantastic that's right alright so he'll
be on with brian hong got a few more
minutes let's talk to kevin a little bit
about what he thinks of what's coming up
at CES is coming in what are your plans
what would i well I'm doing a metric ton
of live coverage for attack of the show
right I've been running around doing
packages we hit the digital experience
pretty hard last night have you guys
seen the or azum no real time it's an
app that you can go download now on
iphone or android it's it's sort of the
promise of augmented reality ok but it's
actually being delivered now and you can
you know pointed out a movie poster in
the trailer will play or put it out a
pointed out of concert for really tap it
and get access to itunes or facebook so
it's really being used by marketing but
what i love about it is that within the
app which is free there's a not a paid
spokesperson wink wink but uh within the
app there's an sdk where you can create
your own tags so someone out there have
the app they could tag this stage it'll
upload the image or a fingerprint as
they call it and then you can create
shoot your own video and tag it to the
spot you can download from a library of
pre-selected like 3d animation and you
can make logos come to lie really you
could have video play yeah you could
record a message and say if you pointed
out that cnet logo out in the crowd your
head will appear on it and start talking
it works it actually works and it works
pretty well and it's out now i will you
sold me it really it impressed me don't
get me wrong it's got a ways to go but
that is the promise of the future of
search we're no longer have to look at a
bottle and wonder what's the nutritional
content or what is this beverage that
you point your phone at it it's going to
pop out in real-time display when you're
at a bar they can throw out a coaster
you could point them at it drink
specials here's what we're known for tap
it of course yeah i mean you get that
into eyewear and you're set and it's in
its sky i'll bet it reality when they
first started coming out we're starting
to see a lot more nowadays that's when i
realized that we're in the future sure
that's what I knew the future is now
yeah i went to the lego store
that's a lego store that popped up and
down in California where I'm from and
they have a monitor with a web candidate
if you hold a box the box of Lego's up
to it it'll show you what the completed
project will look like on top of the box
you hold up right it's insane like all
the augmented reality terms you
mentioned SDK and I'm looking forward to
like that time when you know like people
can develop things like x-ray vision or
you know I think you feel that quite
nicely I lined out just like you grow
you're using x-ray for i think that's
that's cool i mean little things like
look of course CES is always iterative
we always go well the screens are a
little thinner they're a little brighter
they're a little whatever and and the
promises from three years ago or on the
floor today and they work and the
promises of today in three years time
they'll be there from 3d glasses yeah
exactly that's always been the big thing
but i like the little innovations i like
a GPS dog collar that will alert you if
your dog is out of the yard and text you
right I saw that last night tag like
it's a simple little product but that
could be meaningful and customers have
already you know bought that product and
it saved animals it's reunited families
last night I digital experience I got to
see a lot more of what Fitbit is doing
and that's something that you know it
can really impact a lot of people in our
community because we sit on our butts
for 16 hours every day and I want to
track that I want to track of activity
and cardiovascular endurance Eddie
horizontal line I like the notion that
that it discreet tracking to you know
that having to take a picture of your
food for the go Bryce little whatever I
mean it's a novelty right now but the
notion that in a year time two years
time that data will be automatically
collected without me having to think
about it and I'll be able to track my
progress set goals compete with other
friends on a fitness level that might be
the motivation that people need to keep
going or at least make healthier
decisions if a bracelet can vibrate as
I'm reaching for it'll happen definitely
