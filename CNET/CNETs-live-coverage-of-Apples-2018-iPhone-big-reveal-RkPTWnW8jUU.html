you
morning and welcome to sina live this is
the biggest Apple event of the year it's
gonna be so much fun thank you for
joining us we got all the commentary all
of the fun things planned for you today
we have such a great show lined up my
name is Lexi savais Dee's and joining me
in the studio to talk all things Apple
is the wonderful ms ashley Esqueda hi
friends they finally let me back in who
knows why we've been asking for you we
want you Ashley okay Patrick Collins
dramatic turn Oh see I asked him to do
something theatrical and that's what he
came up here it was I'm so glad that he
did it and of course the man with the
magic missed a Stephan baton good
morning everybody good morning oh my god
this live audience back here is a fine
are so they're all Stephen become fans
anyway the keynotes which is what we
here for is happening at 10 a.m. Pacific
time that's in about an hour from now
it's happening at the Steve Jobs data
it's in Cupertino California it's around
50 miles south of where we are right now
here at CNET's headquarters in San
Francisco we are gonna be talking all
things Apple up until then and then
throughout the keynote we have some
surprises in store if you want to tweet
us your questions on CNET lies will tell
you a little bit about the housing
crisis not bad ones as they say the best
kind of prize is a surprise and I love
it I like it I stole that from a movie
it's mine I heard that I love it I love
it so this is I guess one of the first
Apple events in which we've known so
much ahead of time about the product
that we're gonna see and kind of the
tone of the event and we're taking a
live shot right now you can take a look
at the Apple pop campus that is the
glassy and glassy Steve Jobs 30 cans
a whole bunch of people milling around
outside spaceships getting ready to spin
up and head to Mars
it still looks amazing and futuristic
one year on I think last year was the
first time that we saw this and it was a
little bit sparse in terms of like the
tree coverage and all that now it's like
building that roof does not look like if
it rained it would leak unlike well okay
well let's speaking speaking of leaks
I want to know what you guys are most
looking forward to today on CNET live
jump on the hashtag on Twitter let us
nari
and also let's talk a little bit now
about things that we're most excited for
how about you Ashley well first of all
as as I feel every year I am most
looking forward to Craig federighi hair
Oh hair for Swan is is my he's like my
dream Apple daddy like we we all have
hair Force One but um yeah I think I'm
really looking forward to what they do
with potentially a new watch so I like
right now I have a Fitbit and I really
like it and I haven't really had the
need to swap over to an Apple watch and
I'm curious if this will be the year
that I finally I'm like well maybe I
need one of those and it still hasn't
happened yet so I feel a little bit
skeptical about it but um but yeah you
never know what kind of features they
may have so I know there was a story a
few like a week ago or a couple weeks
ago but a guy who signed up for some
like research thing with the Apple watch
and that was monitoring his heart rate
and he found out he had an irregular
heartbeat and like so I'm really
impressed with all of that so I'm really
looking forward to seeing what they
bring this year it's gonna be so much
stuff coming on the Apple watch front I
want to talk about that a little bit
later but Patrick what are you looking
forward to today well firstly I use the
C net logo behind me it looks like it's
like powering my head the way the little
no I'm really excited about there's a
rumor that one of the cameras or one of
the phones might have three cameras
kinda like the oh I would be a
interested in see if they add a third
camera what it would do and if it would
actually make things better would have a
bigger zoom what
I think I'll probably like go like plan
to portrait mode right you think
portrait mode I think that with the
Huawei escape as you get that 3x zoom
three times zoom we can telephoto and
I've portrait maybe a portrait lens like
it could be cool I'm not sorry I mean
the biggest weakness right now for I
think for all these phone cameras is
low-light so if it adds anything that
like the night mode my Apple existence
which is I love shooting video on my
phone it's like my favorite thing and it
is god-awful in any kind of low-light it
just looks bad and I just this is the
one thing that I always every year I'm
just like come on Apple like wow I would
still say you remember that like apples
videos still like probably the best you
can get on a phone right when it comes
to all right so we have watch we have
cameras Beecham what about you what are
you looking forward to I'm looking for
an affordable phone because I'm not
going to spend over $1000 predecessor is
one of those phones that for me I'm not
really sure how I feel about it like I I
love the price point but I don't love
that it's so behind what I know the
technology is now right and it has its
place but I know that if I bought it I
would just go oh I know that I could
have if I spent a little bit more I
could have got all of the other features
but but I feel like it like that phone
is for people who don't care or they
just really can't afford even that
little bit right and so like for me oh
if you could cram in a better processor
and the battery's fine and a problem of
that and again me up the camera on that
that would but yeah I do feel like it's
for those who's like oh I don't want to
spend a thousand I don't want to because
it's 700 and some people do I mean I get
it like say you know it some people just
use this as like a tool that they
upgrade every four years just feel that
hold it look at the difference is greedy
like it is pretty cute small but I mean
that is that we say that design though
it was
iconic I didn't really have this design
and it was beautiful right and it lasted
the test of time it really really did
and that's the thing I mean can say the
I 4 in 10 design is this gonna be
something that is gonna be iconic and
carried through I mean if the leaks are
what we think they are and we're gonna
talk about that in a little bit then I
would say that it's definitely gonna
look the same for at least the next
generation but I don't Nouri there's
something about that I wore my best gold
eyeshadow you see I'm expecting a gold
iPhone today yeah like a gold gold not a
not a pink that was very cz that's a
pumpkin spice iPhone and I don't want
that about that anymore I want that gold
24-karat magic iPhone I wore my Irish
complexion today hoping for the rose
gold because it's beautiful in the
cheeks I love it I love it I love it
okay so I mean what we know is so far is
we have a lot of leaks we're talking
probably about three iPhones we have
let's try and break it down because this
is kind of confusing for many many
people we have the iPhone 10s see how
normal I almost said excess right but
it's not it's the 10s and that is a
total tongue twister we made it so easy
for Android to make fun of Android fans
to make fun of this I thought it was
like a tea ball they just like set it up
on a little stick and we're like good
please but if you are a Serena Williams
fan the 10s could be really excess okay
so the 10s as we gonna call it I mean we
do want to talk about the names
okay so 10s now this is the successor to
the iPhone 10 so we're talking a 5.8
inch screen or LED screen same form
factor and same design very very similar
you can see what Ashley is modeling
right now it is gonna be a cool case
sorry one for me but also yes 10s then
we have the 10s Max or potentially Plus
now this is a big one this is the 6.5
inch oled screen again same form factor
as the iPhone 10 or 10s and it's gonna
sit at the top end of this spectrum
probably the top end of the price
spectrum 100 F that is gonna be the
highest price one but that one would
have like the footprint of like like
some like the 8 plus would be like the
physics yeah it would be the largest
screen we've ever seen on an iPhone
exactly and it's even larger than the
comparable Samsung and you know many
Android phones so you know what the S
the note 9 is six point four inches so
it's gonna just tip the scales just a
little bit more one more one more point
one like like 11 like I'm spinal tap
point one more smack bang in the middle
this is the most interesting phone for
me though this is the iPhone X sorry 10
are are it's for par okay so if the
naming is a tenor you let's got the
tenor is the tenor okay tenor a tenor
this is gonna be the 6.1 inch LCD model
this is gonna be the one that sits kind
of is like the entry into the 10 world's
I'm actually really intrigued by this
one because if the price point is to be
correct and we're thinking probably
maybe like six to seven hundred dollars
for the lowest configuration I think
this one is gonna be the real promising
one okay people are going to talk yeah
well it's got an LCD screen versus Oly
so you know if you but do you think
it'll look this is my problem so you
have this like lower end I felt lower
end lower end iPhone at like you know
600 bucks but you have all of these
other really good flagships from other
companies that are really compelling
like these days you know there's parity
between the between iOS and Android like
we've we've seen this time time again it
really is just personal preference you
prefer to use iOS you prefer use Android
and there are so many compelling devices
at that price point that I think Apple
will have a very hard time convincing
people to take a step down from what
would be an Android flagship device to
get one of these like so I'm not really
sure I'm really curious like what the
response will be by normal people not us
weirdos who literally upgrades our
upgrade our phones every two seconds but
normal people who are like well I do I
want this or do I want this like
high-end Android device that I could get
for the same price but I do think there
are people on those like those leases
and stuff like that and they just get
the next yeah after that so they're
gonna be a bunch of those people who
it's just great who'd get the upgrade
and they might get be able to get like a
little more storage or if there is a
like a better camera like that I think
what's curious though is like Apple has
always had really good LCD screens on
their iPhones just one reason I think
they've stuck with them up until the 10
mm-hmm but on the flip side it is a
curious thing because it's kind of like
the iPhone 5s when it came out we also
had that 5c model that replaced I loved
that 5c it was cute and part of it was
it came in a bunch of different colors
right now and I think there's some
rumors toward this thank you I don't
think they're rumors I mean Apple
straight-up leave their own links to
these like different colors of device a
coral which is obviously named after
rest in peace Carl from The Walking Dead
and then we've got you know all kinds of
other cut you know different colors that
are coming I think there was like four
or five yeah it was but it was a brown
let's not avoid this one but let's think
about what Apple is going to call this
color my money is my own mahogany I'm
gonna say chocolate chocolate earth cuz
you've got space grey you've got rose
gold your earth brown like it's a very I
like that guess and the other point that
I wanted to bring up not about colors
though is about like this are don't say
it like that now max like new coke plus
like I can't too many names like Apple I
can't like this is my I I can't with
this it is so annoying and like I look I
love your phones I have one I use it
it's nice but this is insanity like just
can't we just pick up the naming scheme
for I don't know the Mac books the
MacBook line so you
got your you know you got your iPhone
Mini or your I if you know you got that
then you got your iPhone 2018 late 2018
and then you got your iPhone Pro like
why can't we just have these three
things like it doesn't make sense to me
to be like oh now we're gonna name it
the 10r and just simplify like we don't
it's too much and it's weird and all it
means is I'm gonna have to field a lot
of text messages and I'm like I don't
want to have to be my family's Genius
Bar ever well you probably always have
to do that but I think that part of it
it's like they had the iPad for when I
came out they went away with that number
and write a new iPad just get rid of it
which was kind of cool but also the same
time anytime you go to buy one it's like
is this the fourth one I really but
that's see that's generation I don't
like that just see like the MacBook what
year it came out no like it like a car
basically cool car model it's the 2018
iPhone is a 2019 iPhone pro they already
said I'm any earlier this year the one
that they announced in Chicago the the
Bret it was the new iPad like let's just
super generic they could be like oh
which one do you want I want the 6.5 one
or the five or the five-point eight one
and exactly right there would simplify
it so much I love them for a company
that touts itself as a company that
loves simplicity and elegance and design
and all this you know Johnny I've is
always oh it's dreadful like all this
confusing stuff like you have done the
opposite with this naming scheme like
that literally the opposite of what the
phone you've you guys as a company fill
the phone stands for it's like the exact
opposite
here's the thing though what if the
naming convention is to get people
really confused and then they have to go
into the Apple Store to get it all
explained and then they end up getting
up sold perhaps just call me there's one
more there's one more little wrinkle
which is the fact that this is all
leaked stuff and until they actually
announce it on stage it could be they
have a different name they could trick
us let's get you sorry let's hope so
anyway the other thing that I wanted to
touch on will die a good tweet oh okay
well we want to get to the scene at live
questions on Twitter
really soon I'm on the hashtags yet live
Ashley is gonna be reading I'd be
monitoring your tweets because as some
of you know I am well known for my live
streaming my live snarking of the Ethel
event which I'll be doing live on camera
this year but I will also be reading
your tweets out loud on the air and if
they're really funny
maybe maybe you'll maybe get a little
bonus so that might be a little
something okay before we get to that
though let's just talk about the upgrade
part because I think this is where the R
comes in I'm sorry I'm gonna stop doing
that now because it's gonna get accuser
late 80s hearing me talk like a pirate
it is not international Talk Like a
Pirate Day
I did that once got over it out of my
system it was a great video that you can
watch so did you do video for that I
don't think I didn't do a video and
that's actually 9 that was real life but
anyway I feel like now actually let us
we just have on the line let's cross
live to our reporter on the ground she
is an apple talk outside the Steve Jobs
theta it is Vanessa hand Arianna she is
gonna be chatting to us live the one
Raleigh home a school about a host of
apple core Vanessa can you hear me hi
fantastic where are you now explain
where you are we are inside the Steve
Jobs theater but we're waiting to go
downstairs where the presentation is
going to start
I don't know if you can see kind of the
madness behind me there's a lot of
people there that is a lot busier than
it was last year I don't remember there
being that much many people there harder
to get tickets to this than Hamilton Oh
gather round two oh I see is there any
there any hints though have you seen any
kind of hints about what we're gonna see
today like I mean this is live from the
ground what's happening out there
I mean other than this symbol right here
I believe it's called a circle it could
be so logical about this maybe that's a
giant charging port oh the whole theater
powers the entire thing I like they
covet the air-conditioner you being a
shitty Anna how's it a food are they
feeding you
that's so deeply disappointing like this
pecan swirls to fit with the theme I
think sorry we want to feel beautiful
look at what a great beautiful view that
is it's like a brisk 75 degrees I'm sure
it's gonna get warmer as we progressed
through the day but yeah we're getting
ready for the main event
and honestly I think we've heard a lot
of rumors of what's gonna come yeah
there's like up to the very last minute
coming out so I'm just I'm just praying
for a surprise over here because you
want the London one thing you want the
one thing I know you do all the rumors
turn to be wrong that would be oh you
think it was a little bit of a decoy
wave that maybe those pages will put
there and then it's the old
bait-and-switch thing that would be that
would be one more thing that would be a
big surprise okay and now just Vanessa
what are you most looking forward to
today I'm looking forward to that Apple
watch we've heard a lot of things about
what kind of sensors it's bringing and
I'm just ready to see what they what
they do with the Apple watch because
it's it's going to be one of the biggest
jumps in terms of design at least
since they launched the watch so that's
that's kind of what I want to see but
just also the air power Matt I I just
want to see it in the store already yes
waiting so ladies please yeah now like
this okay we're gonna get in silly the
wireless charger for the air pods that
would just kind of bring everything
together oh I see it the whole ecosystem
of wireless charger but look you know
the circle is there maybe the air power
mat is gonna suddenly be the circle no I
don't think so but hey why not I let's
throw it out there let's do some wild
guesses the more I look at it the more
it starts to look like a target ah and
then underneath it's gonna be like a pot
of gold with all the new on I finds the
gold I actually I think they can launch
a rainbow right from that theater out
and this guy's incredible yes she's
gonna try and take us in as far as she
can
oh man it's gonna be just seeing a lot
of backs there we have amazing seen a
team on the ground who are going to be
the live-blogging all right we'll see
you later
thank you for calling all right bye it
looks like it's madness that last year
was not that that busy I don't remember
it being that busy explain I thank Scott
you know it last year well Scott always
Scott it tends to find like a quiet
location but essa' likes to be in that
is insane I didn't even know the Steve
Jobs theater could hold that many people
there you go that's a lot that is crazy
all right so let's check in on seeing it
live the hashtag on Twitter I want to
know what people are asking about what
questions they have and then we have
some surprises some lucky people that
tweet us but we'll talk about that first
Ashley well let's see first of all I see
Leo Roberts on Twitter saying watching
the Apple event on CNET live on my
iPhone ironically my battery is running
low
please can we have a bigger battery I
agree with you I am a person who will
burn through my iphone tens battery by
noon every single day I'm a to charge
girl I'm a double charge girl what are
you doing sweetie fine - day
what about like get my an a-10 battery
case that's something we have not Oh
Apple hasn't Apple has not been really
giving in the way of MFI cases because
they want to close that ecosystem loop
like we haven't even seen a movi pack
for the iPhone 10 because they are they
are clamping down so hard on that and I
don't know if it's because we didn't
even see an apple battery pack for the
iPhone 10 and so I don't know that we'll
see that and like and the thing is is I
look Apple like you got to get good at
battery or you got a like let other
people make battery packs well here's
the thing I mean you know we've talked
about how like you know we've seen the
actual like teardown of the iPhone 10
it's got that l-shaped battery with the
two cells potentially if it becomes a
one that's like a single cell battery it
could be squished in into such a
configuration that it can improve
battery life that's one thing and I
really hoping that Apple does address
today because it's one of those things
that it's not a really sexy keynote
thing I understand why they don't touch
on it probably also because why they
don't talk about it too much with
something like the Apple watch is
because it's terrible anymore it lasts
great the whole day especially that's
why I take it well exactly you'll get
like three to four days batteries a
battery on exactly Apple watch series
and I'm forgetful I can't remember I
can't be bothered to put stuff on a
charger at night except my spouting I
would say - we have iOS 12 optimized but
then we're probably see some new
features of that with these new phones
yeah but I'm curious - they should just
hire Ashley to test the batteries before
them I think so I am the bring I'm the
destroyer of batteries I like the aya
that's me I will destroy a battery on
any cell phone no problem I am scared to
look at my use beta since the third
building I'm just moving my phone slowly
away I will drain your battery
wirelessly
I really like this this made me laugh
and spam
on twitter said xxs tennis tennis max
and ten are just sounds like models of
Ford Falcons are most a su super or
Oliver 1212 says are you guys gonna
upgrade regardless of what comes out
today question great question for me
it's gonna have to be a really
compelling buy it's gonna have to be
something that involves the camera I
know Patrick you'll begin to the camera
and for me like that is the ultimate
like if we can do everything that we
talked about improve low-light we
already have fine enough video but if we
can improve the low-light performance it
actually improve the telephoto lens the
quality of the telephoto lens I've been
a little bit disappointed with some of
the shots that I've taken on that fifty
six mil I don't know why but they're not
always in focus I don't know why maybe
it's just a little firmware tweak I'm
also like full disclosure I've been
running the iOS 12 developer beta my
primary phone cuz that's just how I roll
and I'm gonna add a little bit uh you
know I like to take risks with my phones
I know I shouldn't but I'll run that
beta beta yeah good great yeah well it
worked actually really smoothly even in
early builds anyway but I mean maybe
it's just something that wants the you
know the gold monster and then the final
iOS 12 drops so maybe it will improve it
but I have noticed that's been an issue
for me that's the big incentive to
upgrade how about you guys
I mean I'm rocking a please don't laugh
iPhone 6s plus with a Patrick you are
fired cannot work here this probably I
can't afford a nicer phone no but I've
been sitting on there for a bit I so
this is my year it's more like if
there's something that is not compelling
to upgrade this may be the reason I
would not upgrade but it's definitely
that it's I think if I did upgrade if
it's all these rumors are true I
probably go for the other five point
eight inch or give that give that iPhone
and XR tenner
yeah and the only thing reason I would
go back to like a bigger screen would be
if they had that camera there they have
cameras a delineation of like a better
thing or a more maximized use of
hardware
max yeah I I'm a I'm a dum-dum who
upgrades every year nope no questions
asked like I'll be there probably Friday
when pre-orders open at midnight which I
normally goes no I'll be on the internet
at midnight
and I'll be you know probably screaming
at screaming at my television while I
wait on hold to talk to my you know
representative t-mobile's like pre-order
my phone for me and yeah I do I do it
every year so is this is like a this
like a weird like ritual every year for
me it's like it's fun and frustrating
and you know I do it every year I just
don't know if I'm gonna go I want to see
what the differences are between this
ten ask max and the and the 10s um I
think the big thing for me is if the
tennis max has a third has a third lens
I have to go with that bigger I have to
go with the bigger one if it had the
same cameras exact same cameras or both
but you had more battery on the 10 oh I
don't love the six and a half inch front
like that's a lot of phone at when I had
a seven and eight plus it was a lot and
I really loved this return to a little
bit smaller form factor for the 10 I was
actually really excited about it so I
don't know that I want to go to that 6.5
inch screen and like
like I feel really weird about it I
think I'd have to you know kind of think
about it for a second and really decide
but if they had the same but they didn't
last time remember it was optical image
stabilization when they announced the
plus for the first time only came on the
plus yeah and so I have to have that
because I shoot a lot of video on my
phone and so for me it's like it all
comes down to the camera for me because
that is the thing I use the most so I
like but I'll upgrade regardless you're
gonna be there waiting my line midnight
on the Apple side all right one more and
then we're gonna talk about the
surprises that we have who else on
SEANET Live is asking us a question well
um we have somebody awake at 4:40
something in the morning in one year's
Australia represent on you mate well
done I'm watching pretty great we also
have gosh there's so many people
tweeting right now about this somebody
else was hoping for I'm looking for that
tweet I missed it oh here we go Luke
watching seen it live oh he's okay so
here's another while watching seen it
live from Auckland New Zealand
I'm Thursday morning keen to see the new
iPhones Cameron's tech summary says I'm
one for a bigger watch do you think the
rumored forty and forty four millimeter
watching I'd become a reality
hey interesting I mean that I don't know
about this one I mean I I feel like with
the Apple watch it's like that pretty
much salute like they've decided that
that's the form factor and those are
kind of the two sizes that they're going
to offer I don't know if we're gonna see
anything larger I mean really is there a
market for a larger watch space I mean
for me I think those two options they're
thirty and forty two I think those are
pretty adequate and I feel like for many
larger wrists and men's wrists included
I feel like the forty two is a pretty
it's it's really well yeah and I feel
like it's adequate but maybe maybe this
way you've got a nice man-sized wrist
like do you feel like the 42 millimeters
enough do you feel like you want a
little bit bigger of a watch because for
me I want actually a smaller one I had
to go 3644 like that seems like I'd go
even bigger on the difference in size
yeah I don't know if it's like also like
the same body with a wider display sure
I don't think that there was a leaked
image I think that would be the way to
go versus going physically larger with
it but that's something I guess we'll
find out but what secures at least at
that leaked photo that we saw was how
much more stuff could be on the screen
more complications with like weather
notification look more a little more
like the Versa check what I have so
here's my here's my wrist it's a little
bit more like a square so it's it's a
little bit better you know
oh I have no idea so what I'm saying I
couldn't tell you that looks nice for
day battery life I'll take it that's
basically all right I judge all myself
yes there you go all right well thank
you to everyone who is tweeting in on
CNET live on the hashtag on twitter keep
the questions coming do you have some
surprises for some lucky people that do
tweet us we have around four packages
that we are going to be I guess
surprising people we've let's just take
a deep dive into what we're gonna get
it's some CNET swag so I'm gonna reach
into the bag swag music oh I love it I
love it
Patrick you wanna model one item all
right Cena swag we have this looks like
Cena what about reusable totes we have a
tote bag to carry your new iPhone in
yeah I like the tone it's a little
exploratory bag weird lexi go where are
you are you a fighter pilot we also have
in that little swag bag some iPhone
cases and some other little surprises
too so keep tweeting seanut lives is the
place to do that
okay so let's switch a little bit to
Apple watch and we were just talking
about it I want to like get into some of
the features that some of the leaks are
suggesting the one that I'm actually
most interested in
I know battery life for you guys is
really important and the form factor but
for me like the point of the Apple watch
one of them is for monitoring right and
so if Apple is gonna start really taking
health care seriously which we've seen
that they definitely are thanks to the
health app they've got lots of different
integrations and partnerships they've
done a lot of different studies if
they're going to start to integrate an
ECG or EKG sensor into the Apple watch I
think this is gonna be a bit of a
game-changer
now we have like a bunch of other
products out there in the market that do
somewhat similar things so there's the
cardia band that can basically track ECG
and but the thing is for Apple they can
build a sensor short that's not the hard
part the hard part is what do you do
with that data because anything that you
do that involves like heart rate or
interpreting that data for the end user
you got to get FDA clearance right and
sorry if you have the sensor great all
well and good but I am expecting Apple
to kind of announce something about how
they're gonna make this understandable
to people like me or anyone else so you
don't suddenly have like heart rate data
and something saying oh maybe you have
afib and then everyone starts panicking
and then runs to their doctor that's I
that is not gonna happen because the
WebMD here you type in like uh some
people Wow
and it's like you're dying in three
hours not a good thing sorry that
actually like similarly that happened to
that guy so he got a notification saying
there we detected your Apple watch
detected an irregularity but he had
opted into a study that was submitting
his data to blue a Stanford research and
so so I'm really curious you know one of
the things Apple always announces is
partnerships and so obviously every
single time they come up and talk about
Apple watch and their what's the medical
like they have this health health kid um
every time they talk about health kit
there's always some new partnership that
they have that you know they're really
proud of and it's something that helps
advance patients to be able to connect
better with their doctors and give them
more accurate and just more data about
their health on a daily basis when
they're not at the doctor right and then
Apple is actually involved in one of
like the FDA phos tracks I think it's
called there's a bunch of other
manufacturers like Garmin Fitbit Apple
as well are involved in that so maybe
there'll be something else that they're
going to announce um in relation to that
at the keynote today because you know
there's so much data you know for people
that aren't medical professionals trying
to interpret and understand that that's
the hard part and that's what you need
and you shouldn't they had they were
taught they publicly expressed wanting
to even figure out a way to like track
blood sugar with the watch and stuff
like that but again like you go through
the regulation of the FDA you also go
through a privacy thing which Apple's
always puts out in front of any of their
products but then on the flip side like
like I look at some of these these
wearables it'll tell me how much sleep I
had or deep sleep and it's like a neat
thing to know by Mike how do I use this
information and that's not something
that's really gonna be life or death for
me little let's hope not but but more
like if I want to optimize that I really
don't know what I can do to like with
that information
yeah well sleep tracking is a huge one -
yeah because there's so many other
companies that are moving into sleep
tracking devices apps I think that an
actual bed the tracks yeah look I don't
need any of that stuff - no I sleep like
trash
because you're always on your iPhone
they give you more anxiety it's already
like for me if I was trying to check
myself that's why I never like try it up
when I was doing the Fitbit I never wore
it to bed because I knew I would wake up
and it was like you only got six and a
half hours of sleep and I'd be like
panicking it wasn't quality sleep is it
a self fulfilling like prophecy where
house you didn't get a good night saying
I so you asked the rest of the day like
you got it even more terrible kind of
in-between like being like the
notification like headquarters for your
wrist and also some fitness stuff but I
feel like adding a health component to
it is the next logical step and probably
be even more useful and then if you have
the ability to go to your doctor and you
control and like send them data for the
past month of your like blood pressure
but what's that partnership what what
company is going to handle the
transmission of that data and how are
you gonna get a literal plethora of
different doctor networks companies who
are they gonna partner with is it gonna
be oh we're only partnering with anthem
or Blue Cross Blue Shield or you know
whatever this national healthcare like
how are you gonna do that when every
insurance is so different and doctors
are so different and networks are so
different across every single not even
state county well into like go back to
like a decade or 15 years ago when they
were doing the same thing as music
labels I realized musically it was much
different than a health provider but at
the same time if any company could do it
it would be someplace like Apple or
right they have the clout to do it well
the flipside do we want them to but also
on the flip on the flip side of that
side the flip flip side these companies
have now seen how Apple took advantage
of the record industry to get all those
deals for the iPod and for AM for iTunes
originally and now they know they're
wise to apples game and they're like no
no no no no and then maybe Apple doesn't
want to pay those licensing fees maybe
they you know it's like it's a dance
which is why Apple has struggled getting
into the TV industry the FDA and that
might be where a government plays a role
or if there's a regulation and I know
our that's a bad word for some people
but for how this information is
transmitted not only from Apple but
other devices good we're gonna see
patient privacy laws and things like
that they're gonna have to figure out
and international usage as well like I
mean we we very focused on how it's
gonna work with the US market and US
healthcare providers but we cannot
forget everybody else around the world
who sees these Apple products
announcements and then they don't get
them for X number of months X number of
years even you know it's so so many to
like Apple pay for example when was that
announced like 24 yeah it was a while
ago right and we're only finally just
like Apple pay is now finally like you
see announcements rolling out to
countries around the world you're like
wow it took a long time these things
take time
and I hope that there's gonna be a
little bit more inclusion of like
acknowledgement of that at least for
other countries that are not just the US
I use Apple pay for getting M&amp;amp;Ms at the
spending machine that's your health
information goes from your Apple pay
that's even statement is really
concerning part of that which is what
happens when Apple watch tracks your
data and says well that you don't move
enough and now your insurance goes well
you don't move enough so we're gonna up
your premiums
yeah like what where it's like really
it's a very kind of scary thing to share
literally every waking moment of your
your health life with with a third-party
company that could easily get hacked
your data could leak it could get sold
there's a lot of there's so many
different factors here that are that are
concerning and I'm sure you know Apple
III will say Apple has a really good
track record on privacy like user
privacy they are good about that but but
these third-party companies don't that's
like and that's that's the really scary
part is that I don't want to send
I don't want beech to have to you know
pay more for health insurance because he
buys a bag of M&amp;amp;Ms
insurance premiums to go up just because
you sit at a desk for eight hours a day
and like you know maybe you work at a
company who doesn't like when you take
breaks you know there's just there's a
lot of really scary stuff in there and I
really hope that however they navigate
it it gets navigated appropriately and
I'm sure there will be mess ups along
the way but this is like a my dad is in
the medical field and it's like I think
about this stuff a lot because I used to
work at his office and so the
ramifications of that kind of stuff when
you have a private insurance industry
that can just up your premiums at any
time especially if they find out that uh
you know you eat too many M&amp;amp;Ms or you
don't walk enough or you know whatever
is really concerning and I think the
great point you're bringing about is
that's probably why it's taking so long
for this stuff to come on Tuesday
I hope yeah and I don't expect it gonna
be there's gonna be any sort of big
announcement about partnerships like
that in terms of with insurance
companies today I don't think that is
probably the right Avenue that is
definitely gonna take time I think on
the point about privacy Apple is very
conservative when it comes to the data
that he is gonna be collected and
they're very conscious about you know
opting obviously with iOS 12 we've seen
all over the you know for security stuff
in terms of like you disclosing fully
and giving full access and consent to
having certain parts of your data I'm
being presented to apps and services and
things like that so I think that's gonna
be a really big part of the keynote if
there is anything to talk about in terms
of sharing but let's do a quick time
check we are around 20 minutes out from
the live do some trivia we will we got
all the memos about me from CBS Sam
they are memos well they're also trivia
ok fired be fired or see I'm going for C
note B I this is a live shot phone
outside the Apple Steve Jobs theater in
Apple pop its you really quiet now
everyone's inside there's music playing
out so that was what I think Wow
actually it's the trees the trees are
trees it sounds like air show music feel
like they feel like it they have a bunch
of
with the Apple rainbow just launched it
right out of the theater it's really
beautifully apples turning into West
world Steve's finals to make sure that
the spaceship campus
shot out a rainbow good alright so happy
the particle and the particle and all
right let's quiz I've put together some
questions about Apple all right so we
get some this music yeah more apples
apples
yeah quiz music and also feel free to
play along at home on the CNN live
hashtag because we want your input in
this I like that that's nice that's good
okay but you just saying oh yeah yeah
that's nice okay first question how
heavy is a bushel of apples is it about
24 pounds 42 pounds 13 pounds or 7
pounds I like how you did them out of
order that it's raw
I like throw you off and I mean you know
a bushel I have no great question 13
pounds 13 I have no idea I'm gonna go
for 42 7 it is in fact the answer to
life a Polly founded on April 1st 1976
January 1st 1976 October 31st 1976 or
February 24 1976 which I know seems
random but is Steve Jobs birthday oh
that's sweet I think it's a professed
wasn't it beeped she got an answering
anything I was texting with Senator
Scott Stein he's gonna be on the line
here soon
yeah you know in fact Lexi is correct it
was April Fool's Day
from a garage guys how long can an apple
tree live is it more than 50 years is it
more than 250 years 100 years or a
thousand years oh no no it's not a
thousand I think it's what you say a
hundred everyone who said a hundred is
right rollercoaster of emotion hi it's
fired hide but do you guys know how much
the Apple one cost when it launched in
1976 was it a lot of money
was it 999 was it 999 dollars two
thousand dollars five hundred 99 99 or
600 $66.66 because we're getting close
to hell yeah the second to last five
9999 600 bucks it was the most expensive
of those option in 2000 you're wrong it
was six hundred and sixty six dollars
and 600 and not a jockey I love it hey
Scott Stein on the phone line from
inside the Steve Jobs theta Scott can
you hear me loud and clear
Oh fantastic oh it looks like you are
situated and seated you said one of
those $500 chairs
you just yes bill in a chair looks very
comfortable be a car appropriate it
looks comfortable that's all we need to
know we're living vicariously through
you the sidearm shot of the chair
nothing more than that love it people
want those details it's very comfortable
it's it's a very nice like movie
theaters movie theater see special
edition type check what's happening in
the theater at the moment is that can
hear some sort of music in the
background
I don't like Ice Capades it's your is
that what it is
it's very upbeat music
and we're all sitting down it's actually
like a pre-trial atmosphere like I see a
lot of people still milling around
getting ready to sit down there is ecute
obscene the front who often kind of
gather in that front area to kind of
shake hands and talk and be seen before
it starts just like last year you know
we milled around outside Apple Park and
it was snacks and views of the campus
much better smelling than last year
oh yes oh it was smell like a lot of
course everything had been freshly
planted right fantastic I like the guy
behind you rocking the PC yes we have a
PC user right he'll be escorted out
shortly all right that right there we go
he's like I'm on Excel right now ladies
he's better lit than you are that's a
little image that they were kind of
sending out to people on Twitter as well
and the little glow that my face that's
what your face is just as beautiful
senator Stein yeah you have less than a
stem growing a tell us tell us go what
are you looking forward to today and
what are you expecting them to kind of
focus on in the keynote so what I'm
expecting is everything mobile and what
I mean by that is you know we've heard
rumors about iPads I increasingly feel
like they're gonna focus on there's
enough to talk about between all the new
iPhones three of them but also air power
which was talked about last year and I
think it's part of a charge everything
live your digital lifestyle thing
they'll talk a lot about that Apple
watch
I feel like Apple watch could have the
most improvements if they follow through
with all the stuff that I think could
exist on it in terms of battery life and
maybe health advancements and ear pods
so if it could be like a refresh of that
whole cycle and you know what's that all
about what's the iPhone Apple watch air
pod charge mat how much does that all
cost what is that like when you're using
it all and and sure hope app stops along
the way to talk about things like the
iPhones I feel like the iPhone I'm not
expecting necessary
biggest thing is the 10 last year but
there are a lot of improvements that the
10 needs to make especially face ID so
face IDs are more stuff I'm expecting to
talk a lot more about how that's going
to work better how Scott you mentioned
ear pods do you think you will once
again go viral for wearing them this
year please no New York is full of
people wearing air pods take pictures of
others with air pods I got it right so
air pods
yeah knows I'm waiting for the AR
glasses for the viral moment that's what
that was I was waiting gonna ask is that
obviously like WWDC DC we saw a lot of
the kind of the aaaahhhh stuff being
pushed what do you think it's gonna be
apples take this time around in the
hardware event you think AR is going to
get any kind of screen time I think it
definitely will I think Apple is super
into a AR and at WWDC they showed what
if I was really it was multiplayer AR
the way that you could all gather and
see the same thing and I expect more
apps to be demoed on stage that could
use that but also I think that this new
phone is bound to take advantage of AR
in some new way or it should maybe it's
something like google lens you know
Google actually has the ability with its
software to scan the environment more
stickers things like that stickers or
translating things or note noticing
things I got like a little tricorder you
can just pointed it things to me that's
a type of they are and I feel like
that's something that they could do and
you know that they'll talk about it they
made demo a lot of apps I'm not sure
where they can advance it other than
more reliable and maybe they'll have
some 3d scanning element something that
we could like add things in to your AR
collection for your health kit scanning
body for your BMI or something at all
Scott thank you so much just quickly
have you seen hippos one have you seen
Craig federighi yahoo who've seen legs
exploding nor it's really lame that's
really what if he shaved his head oh my
god you guys don't get so obsessed we
have a funeral for the neck
guys no eating I wonder I wandered up
the campus though I took the path so you
know there are a lot of meandering
pathways over here so I wandered through
and I got to see Apple Park and it
really just keeps going so there are
walkways you can just take a look and
and wander around and there are
bicyclists and joggers and I don't know
where it ends I mean I feel like I could
have just kept walking and never come
back to the Apple that well I heard I'm
glad that you did come back very good
thank you so much Scott and don't get
lost when you walk around the campus off
to you yeah yeah after it's over fine
like do whatever you want but for now
just stay in the theater to let your
wife know it's inside the spaceship at
all times
all right thanks Scott enjoy the keynote
we're looking forward to seeing
everything that you are gonna be talking
about on the live blog as well see you
later Scott love that Scott Syphax
everybody Scott Stein also an avid
magician he's amazing he is he regularly
entertained regularly entertained every
year yeah he's a man of many many
talents he truly a fantastic love that
guy Scott brought up a great point about
face ID like there's a lot that needs to
be unpacked and re-engined improve a
sighting absolutely like can we just
talk about how it just for me face ID
has good days and then it has really bad
days like some days I'll wake up with
bed hair no makeup everything the phone
will totally see me unlocks perfect the
next day nothing and it will continue
for the whole day like flag head a bad
face ID
face ID it really is really judgey right
because it's like it's like having a
really judgey friend where it sees you
and it's like oh you're not wrong yeah
that is not you I will not unlock this
phone until you fix it like that's but
it did get better over the year at first
you couldn't even unlock it while you
were laying down or like on your side
and now if you are laying in if you have
the phone in landscape mode and you
tread on like your phone while you're
laying down it
unlock for the most part like it unless
your face is smushed but he has gotten
better I will say it has gotten better
so I am curious what kind of
improvements they will make this year
response time is a huge one and I've
actually have been impressed though with
my study working in the dark I actually
thought that would be the use case in
which it would totally fail but actually
find in the dark are you able to see the
little infrared light sometimes I think
it's really fun yeah actually I mean
it's funny when you feel bricks me out
and you film the iPhone you see it
flashing yeah a retina scan I feel like
it's because if you think about it go
back to like like touch ID like the
first year came out it was good but had
like that weird okay yeah had that lag
and I feel like this you do hear like
about face ID too that would be neat
because on the Android side we have
these face unlocks but they're not as
they're not secure but we are seeing
companies moving forward over the next
year like lucid who are taking
technology to take two cameras and
replicate what Apple can do and do it
faster and be less cost less so if she
would reduce the price of a phone so we
start seeing some of those come out like
that red hydrogen one phone has
something like that apparently but as
far as Apple I just would love to see
that and also if it just goes faster and
it's more accurate or the way the tooth
on that so the the C nut live hashtag is
yes right now there are a lot of people
asking about the new iPad oh it's
actually iPad then I think we've only
got like six minutes left so we got a
touch on this really but we've got Mandy
we've got mass annual we there's like a
lot of people on our Twitter who on see
not live hashtag who are like hey what
about that new iPad guys do you get rid
of the home but what about that new I
just I say interrupt Tim Cook to sent
out an interesting tweet right now did
he now you can get it here quickly so
maybe he's talking about the new iPad
maybe that is reference there oh really
I'm just Joe I can't see it on Tim
Cook's Rita I might maybe took it down I
think it out because I can't find it did
somebody retweet him and go was this
supposed to be a supposed to be there
not really a Twitter yet you got oh yes
it's gonna constant with Apple like
they're not particularly
although they are running you you were
saying that for the first time they're
running the Apple event on their Twitter
ah and nowhere else okay so go down yeah
it does he pulled it down but the
content of the tweet said know who can
get it he quickly like Patrick said so
why Air Force One oh my god question why
why is Tim Cook and why are the Apple
execs using Twitter to communicate just
I don't slap it down that really went
from an Android I'm kidding somebody who
has been fired fired from face like the
face time fired or it's just like moji
cook and he's just like I'm so sorry I'm
sorry you're fired
please walk out of the Apple Campus and
get lost you'd like the remote erase on
your phone if you do the iPad
no we need breaking tweets freaking
tweet Tim I'll Bri I'll make you a latte
I mean great lattes really good lot to
Patrick what who can get here get it I
phone excess yeah something was not
prepared for the I wonder if that means
the event is not gonna start on time
given that there is something 11 minutes
before they was supposed to start the
tweet not is true okay well let's let's
get back to the iPad because we got so
many questions about that now I mean a
lot of the room is you know in the weeks
leading up to even past few days we're
talking about the new iPad potentially a
pro and also changing to potentially USB
see as opposed to lightning obviously
it's kind of the time in which Apple is
going to make trying to make that again
the big push into saying that yes the
iPad is kind of the do at all device
changing to USB see would be I
think I like a big pot of making that a
reality I mean obviously the MacBook Pro
line has completely moved to USB see and
it just makes sense that the iPad would
but I still feel like lightning as a
like like a legacy connector it's still
really really important like USB see
Apple pencil like how about that work
but it would it would signal that hey
we're going this standard and this would
be looking more like a computer than
Apple also worked on Apple worked on
that standard yeah the problem right now
is that Apple has three different
devices with three different ways to
connect headphones and uncles that's
real bad yeah that is not that is USB
see and headphone jack it's like yeah
your headphone jack your lightning and
then you guys it's just and and the
people are gonna say air pods or the way
but it's like I have a lot of yeah
where's it's fine I mean I have so many
I need to be able to see me Ashley go
back and forth and I have a you know I
got a pair of Bose cans that are
Wireless like I use them across all my
devices but the thing is a lot of people
one lose their headphones a lot like
kids teenagers caution to my mom like
it's the people whose headphones like
and so you always have to have a charge
and also you can't expect people to drop
two hundred plus dollars on a pair of
wireless headphones every time they lose
one or lose them but if they if they
went the USBC route would they be you
just a single port like it is now
lightning or were to be a multiple USB C
so you could have a dongle for
headphones you could have and it would
be single it would ruin the line and it
would be the other is pointing to like
almost like a smaller bezels I love the
iPhone 10 that would I mean that's a
very that's a longer but you upgrade we
shall see I don't know maybe I think
maybe for the 11 they don't tend to
change the hardware almost at all for
for the S variants so we don't see we
don't tend to see that so maybe for the
for the maybe for the next for the
iPhone 11 which again like just the new
iPhone yeah maybe for the iPhone next
year it'll be you know something
something a little bit more standard
across all the different devices
be expecting at least not great to the
a12 at least moving to the a12 chip in
the iPhone I would be very surprised if
it was like wow yeah but anyway Oh
Warren Kyle says waiting patiently while
watching Apple event live hashtag Zenit
live should be doing homework hoping for
better camera
your homework can wait yeah that's it so
you don't write you a note I'll write it
right here on my iPad with my pencil
I'll be like so quiet Warren is excused
for watching or watching he was sitting
with excitement over new iPhones I love
it you're going to write me all my notes
now I will write notes I love it I love
you like there's something happening
behind me there is the stream is
commencing they're starting the stream
they are starting they're studying the
stream okay so here's how it's gonna
work now we are not allowed to show you
the live stream live as it happens
however we are going to be commentating
all throughout the live stream we
suggest that you keep the Apple live
stream open in one tab keep us open in
another we are generally going to have
the details a little faster than the
live stream because we are reading off
our live blog which you can find on
cnet.com and that generally is like a
couple of seconds faster they I can't
move my finger in the right
configuration a gross
CNET live blog live dot cnet.com and
that's generally a little faster than
the live stream which this year is
actually on Twitter as well she's
interesting anyway that's the lowdown
you can keep asking those questions on
seen it live as well throughout the live
show this is this is gonna be fun we
also have some surprises too so if you
stick around and keep asking questions
we have surprises which I'll show you a
little bit Patrick do we have some seen
it swag this is just one example of some
of the scenes it's a lot we're gonna
send trust me big fan of the success
alright so we have let's let's talk
about what's happening now in the little
video so apple always loves to do a
little promo video to start off the
keynote she's saying know who can get it
here quickly yeah
was this planted by Tim Cook to make my
briefcase it's whatever was in there in
Pulp Fiction yeah a hundred percent it's
gonna blow when they open it bulb light
I know gold alright sir she she had to
is this live oh my god guys the new oh
it is a teleporter on it nice little
roll through there he went right up to
the enterprise you guys like energized
I'm out of here
let's go oh man I would not they're
gonna she gonna run right into this
theater oh my god she broke her legs and
that's an official Apple public bike
yeah they have public place on their
campus the same day you got her I didn't
know that Alright running down that says
this is building some suspense here yeah
I wonder how this is gonna play into the
actual she's on the moons into the
theater I hope she jumps on the elevator
I would have died by this point I am so
out of shape this is making me feel
extremely ashamed she has a parkour
professional who can get her here
quickly it's Allison Allison's getting
here quickly she's in place her badge
doesn't work it's already guy the
teleporter guys there why couldn't he
have just teleported this little
teleportation powers like once every
three minutes what is it what is it
cooks it's Tim Cook's got to go bye
please republic's is presentation click
bagel why isn't it glowing it is clear
that's all I was hoping to be LT looks
like a you know something that you're
gonna deploy something
this is clicker furious that Tim Cook
pulled one over I love it wait I just
officially I would like to offer a
formal apology it's for saying that
Apple does not know how to use Twitter
because clearly that was an all-time
epic troll
well
actually I would dare say I would dare
say Apple knows how to use marketing
because he's totally just got us I don't
like it
all right so Tim Cook's on stage as you
know Apple was founded to make the
computer more personal interesting that
he's starting off with the the computer
tip today right maybe this means that oh
i dressed appropriately here you have
the little synergies there see
all right over the years we're taking
this mission further than anyone could
have expected this is just quotes from
Tim Cook as he's onstage from straight
from our live blog so he's going through
all of the products throughout a apple's
life in the ecosystem that have changed
people's lives from the iPod the iPhone
and the Apple watch so I am intrigued if
he does start with a personal computing
theme does this mean that iPads maybe
even Mac books are on the agenda today I
would be surprised if he leads into this
and then goes straight into the Apple
watch or something but maybe that is the
connection maybe if he's talking about
products that do improve life it could
lead into the Apple watch I don't know
where he could just pull another Twitter
one well another all over our eyes who
knows I want to be so mad I know well
okay so today very hip-hop it is
actually the white soul yeah mm-hmm yeah
then like right out of the box all right
so they are about to ship their two
billionth I o s device that's too many
well think about how we think how far it
came since the days of yeah the days of
it look at this classic here
that's a glass very some classic beefy
briefie look they had like five times
the battery
yeah I would take a slightly thicker
iPhone if it had like a two day battery
life that's just me
yeah that's why I mean I I don't thrash
my battery that much I do maybe it's
because I don't use my phone that much
cuz screen time made me realize how much
I was using my phone I just don't know
that I turn screaming because it told me
that I reached my time limit on the
weather app like it's gonna be one of
two things you're foggy or I don't know
why I bother looking because you know I
know it's gonna be the same all right so
it's only fitting today that we're gonna
tell you about two of our most personal
products the ones that are with you
everywhere you go and how we're gonna
take them even further this is
everything that Tim Cook is saying live
now staged products he linked it into
the Apple watch no pcs first just
talking about how products change
people's lives you see I see what
they're doing there I'm one step ahead
now I'm glad we're not talking about
what check they've cut to developers
which I'm sure they'll do at some point
but like usually they start off with one
[Laughter]
well they often bring out the you know
the twelve-year-old developer and
everything which is always really sweet
I do like that but now it's just number
one number one Justin we're number one
watching the world okay for millions of
people around the world the Apple watch
has become an indispensable part of
their daily lives okay I don't where
that might not mean but you know I know
I I just copy both the chichaja things
I'm like you actually I just never
remembered a charge things well maybe
that's the watch would tell me that I'm
a lazy sloth and like music that's
Hashmi I really have I can't I feel like
an Apple watch is just like a like a
daily shaming device that the phone is
it's not that it's intentionally shaming
me it's just that I feel ashamed when
it's like oh you've only walked not
10,000 steps today that's what I thought
about screen time I felt like it was
shaming me even though I
didn't always hit the limits that's on
us that's on us who's on stage this is
Jeff Williams Apple's chief operating
officer and he's gonna chat about the
Apple watch they were going the blue
very shiny fabrics today yes same shirt
store he's also a member of the Genius
Bar not only is he a member of the James
bar he's also the president he's also so
he's just running over the features in
the Apple watch that people are really
into which is fitness as the core of the
Apple watch the health and obviously
connectivity last year with the series 3
Apple added the LTE connectivity so you
can obviously talk stream music from
Apple music kill your battery life at
the same time so that's my favorite yeah
that's what my personal favorite was
like three hours oh okay bye if you're
using LTE I'm sorry Apple watch now
looks in the background and notifies you
if it detects an elevated heart rate now
this is just the using the regular heart
rate tracker this is something that then
we working on for a while this thing
would be screaming at me all the time so
it's gonna warn you I think this is the
context is if it's elevated and it
detects that you're having a constant
panic attack 44 BPM it'll I care about
my users okay sorry
they're taking Apple watch to the next
level today in each of these areas
staying connected living an active life
and managing your health and we're going
to India to the next level yep here is a
video apparently has also Apple watching
space sounds is like a hot beat sound
space all inside the chambers of the
heart Angela shape we're not gonna say
anything new it's not the giant red
block right now it's just the red ring
much more subtle the red thing was just
like hey I have a Leica I have a lot of
money that's all it basically like
statuses yeah did not do it for me fire
face looks fire fire here we go this is
the serious sport now this look looks
exactly the same as the surface okay I
don't see anything different the multi
complications that we were talking about
earlier are present in the real deal
Apple watch series for no surprises
there with the name everything about it
has been redesigned and re-engineered
every detail has been thoughtfully
considered and it's just beautiful
personally by Johnny I've made all go
Siamese nine things about one detail
changes yeah there's nothing I love more
than a Johnny I video I'm well you know
that's like your that's gonna be the
best part sorry hoping that aluminium is
one of the ingredient aluminium I say
well I say just the way I'd learn so 35%
larger display on and 32 percent I think
those are the two different sizes I
would imagine so yeah so yeah sorry
display on those holes yeah okay and
there you go there's your 44 millimeter
watch oh there we go we do have it
those are massive watches you can wear
them what do you millimeters we're gonna
be too big well I don't know because you
think about the more things you do on a
screen the more you want the screen to
be large that's not on my wrist I would
say matchstick like yeah overpower me
and I I have a bigger wrist that's maybe
two Mac sticks but I still don't look at
this it's a small big this Fitbit it
takes up most of my arm it doesn't look
that watch doesn't look too big on your
looks but I think I can go
it wouldn't but you're aware having it
on your wrist yeah and I don't like them
the Apple watch the the smaller one the
38 I want to not know one of my friends
is in the circle on the top excuse me
was it Tom from you can add your loved
ones on your watch face and tap to
connect to them so I guess I call them
straight from your watch that's crazy
stop hello the dream yes it is the dream
you can customize it to set that
different time zones actually that's
great because I really need that because
I always like trying to text my friends
and see you and then it's like 4:00 a.m.
and of course I'm gonna either wake them
up or they're not gonna answer so I need
that on a watch you have to go to your
world clock lots of different options
there on the watch faces
I even have Sydney right there on the
world gonna be doing a show okay we
should make it justified hmm oh that's
for me right there I started Quito if
you got your cake house you got calorie
count 13 that would be yeah Wow this is
made for me the conscience app ie
Australia's national airline you can
track the boarding information I got
scared I thought you said the quantum
app and I was like the Avengers I was
like oh really is that the default watch
face it's on fire I hope it is that's
the dynamic watch the display that's
pretty cool but what is that gonna do to
battery life like let's
that's like the whole battery I'm also
I'm also a crank and I'm like I don't
need a Harry Potter watch fit I don't
need an animator watch face please yeah
I just want a traditional watch face
show me a stuff that I want to see well
it's what I have right here which is
like my steps my battery life my heart
rate and the time you guys have the date
and the day of the week
I need the date and the day of the week
yeah okay so now the digital crown has
haptic feedback that's kind of
interesting I don't know if I need that
I can't buzzing whoa buzzing - tell me
I've selected I don't know I actually I
don't think I love iPhones is the haptic
feedback if you go to like an Android
phone like it's just not quite this yeah
I don't even think that that was
something that I was those lacking on
the watch like having optic feedback ya
know it's extra I'm just doing that like
I like haptic fever I understand why
they do it
well maybe it's like you know like menu
like you're switching through menu stuff
and it kind of has that click appeal and
also if it goes fire fire screen does it
like does the fire heavy properly it's
not buzzing even more somebody on
Twitter wants to start the wave Brian
Bell says everyone watching Apple event
on CNET live at home or office ready to
do the wave we could start it in Sweden
let's do it let's do it I start the way
start really quickly ready right now
there's four people doing the wave at
home fors of people well done okay the
speaker is 50% loud man I love when
Betsey calls yeah remember how last year
there was the walkie talkie feature that
they talked about now they're probably
talking about this is the speaker
functionality would be good if it was a
louder speaker to have the walkie-talkie
doing that - okay so the back is black
ceramic and sapphire and apparently the
back of the watch is going to improve
that the cellular connectivity Scott's
just right cellular so I'm assuming it
means connect to showing them makes
sense sapphire crystal radio waves can
pass through the front and the back
resulting in improved cellular reception
and the heart rate sensor has been
redesigned and then the brain is the s4
chip was what we were expecting powerful
new jewel core 64-bit processor new GPU
custom-designed by the Apple silicon
team to deliver to exper
formants I well mean Apple watch receive
double the performance yeah that's fine
that's fine it's impressive that's nice
it's a little but I think it was the
software that improved it yeah every
watch OS is like leaps and bounds ahead
of the previous version better yeah
better sensors in there that's nice
let's say I mean there's a like a
standard upgrades I'm happy happy for
them I'm so glad watch series fall can
now detect if you have a full this is
actually really well that's great for
any accessibility the elderly someone
you worry about maybe you as a inner ear
balance issues because like falling down
like is really dangerous you know
actually I'll tell a quick story but it
happened to were like one of my mom's
old friends recently where she fell and
she was not around any phone everything
she could not get up for and she was on
the on the ground for five days
something like this could be very
helpful and don't move then maybe it
will alert an authority or someone like
loved one or something yeah and cars are
doing that too now where you know you
get in a car accident and alerts
authorities it's similar this is good I
mean it's our we're gonna work out for
certain slips yeah so after detecting a
fall this is great for lawsuits you if
you have a slip and fall you got your
data you can show it in court saying yes
legally it alerted and then it was
calling emergency services if the watch
senses that you're not moving or
immobile for a minute it will start the
call automatically and then also contact
your emergency contacts great that's
really awesome and then they say fall
detection is a feature we hope you never
need but it's nice to know it's there
sure this is this is like a big selling
point is this something that you're
going to gift to grandma or grandpa or
something you know it's gonna be an
expensive watch I mean for this feature
I think it's a double-edged sword here
because a lot of older people let's say
boomers so anybody over the age of like
65 70 I mean you're looking at people
who are not necessarily in tune with
technology yeah
they're nervous about it like my grandpa
calls his iPad his computer and he
barely knows how to use it and so and
he's afraid of it and but like my
grandma when she was around
she loved like computers and the iPad
and stuff and she was around the same
age so it just really depends because if
you buy this device but then they never
put it on they forget to charge it to
charge it that's gonna charge ya it's a
geek one my grandpa's phones the knife
has always did everything's always like
it's never charged and so this is like
that's kind of the one thing I would
worry about yeah well hopefully the the
air the air power is gonna be part of it
so it's actually just put everything on
that I mean that would be a good - like
a little pendant or like something small
that was cheap that Apple could do that
ties to your iPhone like cheaper than
been a SmartWatch I am like less
complicated for somebody who maybe is
not used to using a lot of Technology
how much do you think the air power is
gonna cost hundred and 749 149 yeah is
that what I'm gonna say like $69.99 or
sometimes Oh an iPad case for $70 to the
optical hot sensor being essential to
the Apple watch since the beginning yes
and now it's they're talking about the
actually the elevated heart rate feature
and so they have the first notification
if your heart rate appears to be too low
that's one new feature and then the
second is to related to heart rhythm so
it can screen it in the background which
is what we were talking about with a
theme that was that study that guy and
now it looks like this is sort of a
regular yes regular feature and then
it's great won't catch it every time he
says but it can help people who didn't
know they had an issue and the first
actually interesting because so that
this a fib detection is through the
optical senses it's not I mean cool but
we yeah it is cool and then exactly I'm
sorry and then they then they have added
ECG through one of those senses it is
the first ECG product offered
over-the-counter directly to consumers
well the cardia band was technically
available to buy over-the-counter I
believe
something was it was an Apple watch yeah
it's ECG device yeah oh I mean maybe
they don't maybe then cool it like maybe
it's not officially one or maybe it uses
a different it must be like how it's a
watchband but there must be some reason
why they're calling this one the first
over-the-counter one anyway so yes
obviously ECG is detecting the
electrical activity of the heart beat
and then doctors can determine if you
have a different heart condition like
atrial fibrillation the open the open
the app and put your finger on the
digital crown that's interesting I
didn't realize that was how they were
gonna do it through the digital crown
was not expecting that I thought it was
gonna be through the base of of the
watch new senses I'm sorry it looks
ridiculous like seconds is a long time
when you're out in public looking like a
fool yeah it's a long time what is the
appropriate time to look like a fool
3220 the amount of time that it takes
for no one to notice half a second a
half a second could be a blink of an eye
but sometimes maybe it's a minute I
don't know maybe you got time hide
somewhere hide behind a tree into it
there you go whistle how it's used by
yeah oh yeah you don't want me on how to
channel trust me oh no I think I do
okay so now the president of the
American Heart Association is gonna join
them on stage dr. Eve or Jay Benjamin
it's a great name even though I've all I
don't know if I'm saying that correctly
but then what we sing during the
livestream now there before the doctor
comes on stage because remember our live
blog is faster than the live stream live
stream they are showing the heart
beating at a normal rhythm which is the
sinus rhythm so that's kind of like your
baseline reading and then anything else
it is going to be able to give to your
doctor and to just like show your
baseline reading and then anything that
is detected that is abnormal if you can
export that image of your heart rate
this also makes for a really good tattoo
for a loved one or together
your heart your heart rate on your real
shaving I see that a lot in LA I don't
know oh cool I'm almost like hey it's
our anniversary dinner I'm gonna save
this heart rate at this moment yeah yeah
or like people like gonna get like the
little print out of like their baby's
first heartbeat or whatever and then
they be they get it tattooed on them
it's like a thing oh I did not know that
we're weirdos in LA I'm sorry I don't
know this is very la look we're very la
in LA overly so I'm proud of it oh you
can laugh Patrick it's fine no you
aren't working well I love it capturing
meaningful data about a person's heart
in real-time is changing the way we
practice medicine
this is dr. Benjamin talking people
often report symptoms that are absent
during their doctor's visits well yeah I
mean I guess when you go to the doctor
it's again one of those situations
either you have sky high blood pressure
like I do because I'm nervous to be in
the doctor oh yeah or it's hardly normal
and everything is fine because for some
reason all your symptoms just disappear
yeah it's like taking a car to the
mechanic you're like it literally was
just doing this and then they take take
your blood pressure every night you're
fine it out and just like no but it was
wrong minutes ago so FDA clearance
it has FDA are you guys so there we go
it does have it that's interesting
because I probably came through
something like that study that's yeah
I'm guessing like they've been working
on kind of getting this clearance for
the last year
yeah right I mean that's true I looked
on the FBI site yesterday to see if I
could see a sneaky of something being
approved that is however thank you
that's why you're in charge but it
wasn't sneaky enough because I probably
it was probably under some different
code name so people like me didn't go
and find it and say next time put me on
the case I'm like the Daryl Dixon of the
Internet I will hunt it down all right
so this is a de novo clearance which
means it's the first of its time oh well
that's why I couldn't find it because
this is the first time I just cleared it
like that in addition yeah the regular
heart rhythm has also been FDA cleared
this is really interesting so all of
this stuff is going to be available
later this year and then basically
because of FDA clearance it means that
this is going to be regulated and so
this data is going to be able
be interpreted by the app and given to
your doctors and it's a reliable source
not just like some lights shining
through your wrist like some third party
yeah some third party app maker saying
hey you know bootstrapping it and
they're just like yeah this looks
serious yeah to access this data give us
50 yeah we are known for making the
spark tap and bring you platelet prize
okay so this they were just showing how
it works hold your finger on the crown
yeah I feel so sorry for the people who
are only watching that livestream
because we are hilarious we got the
details
we got the funnies I mean this is way
more exciting than listening to you know
Tim Cook I'm just thinking also like if
you have this Apple watch and you're
using these like how can you use this in
a non serious way like are there gonna
be apps where it's like a game where you
can bring your meditation apps that's a
great that's a great watch in this right
now so I'm already just send me a
royalty check make it out to Ashley
together and we're good semi royalty
check so me that co-creator that's
definitely a torille name right privacy
is obviously a big deal that writing
about now all of the health and fitness
device data is encrypted on the device
and in the cloud as it should be yes so
that means if they had to that was it
but in terms of privacy though they just
it's interesting though that because
it's all on the device and in the cloud
I'm glossed over it normally Apple II is
very much just like in the device device
device device not I mean obviously if
you were sending it to doctors and we'll
find out more details about this after
it's worksheets and everything will work
at how it communicates through the cloud
I need to give iMessage where it's got
that encryption on either
well I would I would imagine also so
like my health provider has their own
app right where I can schedule my
appointments and you know message my
doctor and all that stuff so it imagine
those apps with those providers would
have to opt in to supporting health kit
data like that so then that way it would
there would be a sync that would happen
where you would you know give it access
to your health data
now does this make it more interesting
or more compelling to possibly want an
Apple watch for either of you nope what
about I just saw all-day battery life
flash on the screen oh all day stuff the
same 18 hour all-day battery life it
says the same which means that if you're
using LTE what's that have to compete
back in those dynamic wallpapers it's
the same battery life guys outdoor
workout time is six hours I'll take a
thicker Apple watch I'm sorry with the
exception of like Chris Evans preparing
for a Captain America doing a six hour
workout every day
oh my god Johnny I was on the moon nope
it's on the watch face nevermind I got
really excited I was like is Apple gonna
surprise us it's not aluminium up here
Apple store on the moon Space Gray
thanks great that's where they get the
gray from yes the moon dust leaned us
yeah grounded us they brought in actual
chunks of moon to Apple and let them
scan it and then they improved on the
moon color and Kim OH Space Gray I love
this curtain I love Derek Derek you're
on Twitter right now saying I do not
even want to be in my lecture right now
because I want to stay tuned to see that
live while they cover the Apple event
today yes Derek thanks Derek amazing
alrighty so there's another video
playing more Apple what happens when the
foot what happens when your watch lights
on fire like and then it's confusing
you're not sure if it's actually on fire
or if it's just the wallpaper like maybe
that's just not a great I don't know
anything with lithium-ion I don't want a
fire wallpaper and live fire laughing
there's any other year oh say maybe it's
a little
shades of oh my god why am I forgetting
it it was Mike my favorite operates as a
webOS in there with the cards flipping
through the cards we have tick feedback
some some definite Oh rest in peace well
it's not totally done it's mateesah
lives on an android through matias 40 as
i'd like I get it I just really love
that poem likewise like a TV thing now I
think guys gonna be 10 years old next
year can we have like a little
celebration
I love the Palm Pre I waited in line for
that phone that was the first phone I
ever waited in line for I was fourth in
line at a Best Buy and they only had six
and I got one and I was excited it was
only on Sprint right yeah
that was literally why I had sprint it
was like everybody else was like I'm
getting 18 see because I want an iPhone
and I'm like yay sprint probably and
then like expert forever but yeah it was
the iPhone that brought me to at 18 T
and then what's Verizon happen it's like
bye bye-bye done see you later hey my
boy bye
alright the little of these fancy Y the
animations and it's like they're sick
and watching videos a lot of watch
videos well I mean because they don't
want too much about the other stuff a
lot of stuff to talk about so I'm gonna
say I think they're really being out of
this I think this is like I mean it's a
big deal the heart stuff is really a big
deal the healthkit stuff is a really big
deal they apples made it really clear
that healthkit is an extremely important
part of their business and not only for
you know obviously the health of the
user but also it's very lucrative I'm
sure to have that type of data to be
able I mean medicine and the medical
industries has tons of money in it untap
next front oh this is yeah this is this
is definitely a place Apple wants to be
and and they're obviously very excited
about it and McConkey forget Tim Cook
basically this was his project Apple
which was his thing and when you know
the series one came out obviously it's
it's taken several generations to kind
of reach the level I think in which it
feels like are fully mature and fully a
product that I would be seriously
thinking about me if I was a SmartWatch
person not a SmartWatch person and so if
I was the Apple watch would definitely
be the one that I was probably gonna get
even though I do love the old a battery
life of the Versa yeah and I do want
there to be Spotify on the Apple watch
but that's not
happen yes or montz like me wishing for
you know carplay and my bottle three
mites
my Tesla happen it's like me wishing for
a retina MacBook Air that's not going to
happen five years every single time I'm
like please there must be something at
Apple where they did not well usually
don't they have like another event and
like maybe it's Mac books and iPads at
some later event this year and then it's
just the watch and the phones today I
think all three of us a new way of kind
of them like that audience were on that
edge where it's like they're all have
just different wants for the Apple watch
it kind of make it compelling to us for
me it's like price and what I get out of
it I feel like right now the dollar
value for me is not quite there I mean a
lot of people it's a fashion statement
but going to like Ashley's point I think
finding something that I could have my
wrist I don't think about but does all
these things is kind of neat these are
mez loops by the way are like $1200 like
is everybody that break they were just
showing these Hermes watch Laura it has
an extra loop around it's like leather
bands they're like $1200 anything from
them it's gonna be ridiculously
expensive bananas by then I think kind
of temper that with hey the series three
just got a price dropped I'm so strong
and so the this series those are all the
countries I'm good it's really represent
it's the Apple watch series for is gonna
be in gold aluminum or aluminium and I
would say space great aluminium steel in
space black steel and gold stainless
steel it's not a collar options like
this black steel one that's nice subtle
its class no we've seen your selfies we
know well yeah three hundred and
ninety-nine dollars restart Christ and
then four hundred and ninety-nine
dollars for cellular oh that's a lot and
you want to sell the look if you have
the iPhone and you want to use it
outdoors and on the run and for
potentially all the security things when
the for
if you're outside of the home I feel
very myth about it I'm just like ants my
my god like obviously yeah if you have
if you want a series for you got to get
you got to get cellular you can't have
it without because you're getting all
those features you're not gonna be able
to you know exactly you look at me I use
them well outside of the home and you're
not with the phone then yeah can't you
it's not gonna work right I don't care
for it
[Laughter]
statement there we go not for me let's
find other people cool
I'm not another watch video guys so many
watch videos you know it's almost there
I did the one thing I just I always went
around watch it's yes even like this
square I just want a nice little tiny
watch face i they'll never figure it out
because it's just it's well that we got
at the galaxy watch worked it out we
gotta get nanotechnology and graphene
batteries going before we can have
little tiny watch faces and it's just
like I yeah the technology's not quite
small enough to make me a little tiny 36
millimeter and round watch face that's
that's really all we're seeing so I'm
like really cool like mock-up stuff even
though like Android wear itself is not
quite where the is gorgeous then there's
also the ones that Qualcomm kind of
teased this week that aren't real
watches they're just the processor for
that they're also like male like they
lean so male looking right it's like
they're very masculine the design is
very masculine all the galaxy watch I
think what the rose gold got close but
it's so big yeah the thing is that for
me it's not the design that I don't like
it is this size and how it feels on the
wrist and that to me is the biggest
reason why I'm not the SmartWatch it's
like putting an ankle weight on your arm
it's like I can't deal with the baby and
I also the thing is I'm clumsy I will
bash it and knock it and crack it it
needs to be tempered it uses a weapon if
you ever gonna swing your Michael Kors
watch Michael Kors watches without being
smart watches yeah yeah watches are
heavy so it's like I think people who
are used to them like are happy to get
these watches but people who are not
used to them like me I almost know where
things we do you wear a watch when you
weren't wearing that no not about you
Alexi I never
where this I used to wear a watch but
then I have the phone and I don't need
NCI yeah it was like a carpenter for
years they broke my Brooklyn but now I
feel like I'm out of that habit yes so
we're back into we're back to the iPhone
Tim Cook is up on stage again I don't
put on an eyepatch Twitter troll cookies
back
all right iPhone time different
twittering - tens up there they doing
all right number one smartphone in the
world there you go what they're not
gonna mention is the China market in
which other smartphone manufacturers so
much they're rapidly overtaking Apple
yeah yeah I'm so much there yeah
iPhone 10 has changed the industry and
along the way it became the number one
smartphone in the world says cook what's
most important to us is it is the most
loved smartphone with an amazing 98%
customer satisfaction at test one time
it actually was accurate really it was
accurate it's time to meet the new
iPhone Oh goals there we go gold gold
god I did not see that coming Oh me
neither man I wore the right eyeshadow
on complete accident today
your body is dependent yeah look at that
the 10s it's official and it's not the
XS it's definitely the 10s there we go I
want it out by this
it's made of a surgical grade stainless
steel so this image so you can cut
someone open and not worry it's real
well it came from Apple's website that's
the leaked image that 9 to 5 McAvoy was
direct from Apple's website they just
changed the URL address trickery and
they just guess the names of the product
and there we go I have to say one thing
I'm liking about this is the gold is
come back a straw gold when should we
see that like Evonik I grew up in New
Orleans Saints fan so this will be very
satisfactory to a bunch of us sir any
sports team that has golden black
but I kinda like that versus our
fashionable Roseville I also wonder if
this is another play to the Chinese
market because gold isn't extremely like
like people love that wreck have it very
coveted color in the way of like just
everything like that's a very cultural
like they or is this a Trump thing
traditionally well he loves those gold
toilets it's great for tweeting great
for tweeting most durable glass ever in
a smartphone well we'll see about yeah
we get your hands on it that's wondering
though he's Gorilla Glass six I mean I'm
really not going to say okay here we go
but that was the thought I pee 68 you
still gotta hop you got a camera huh nor
three cameras though look two meters for
30 minutes so you can throw it in a pool
whoo we can test that out you know that
the team tested it on many different
lucrative lives I'm gonna need everybody
to green screen his shirt immediately by
the way yeah immediately especially
right behind the guy's hand yes turn him
into an iPhone
they even tested eight I think that's a
fig Rodriguez hair does he know that he
should stand right where that guy's hand
is he's like I'm reaching no I run her
water dude look this is amazing like um
what a terrible waiter
well they tested on BIA and wine village
so there you go be sure to tip your
servers guys yeah okay tray full of beer
it's super Aetna all fifty appi HDR
movies oh I'm like what is that bezel on
the old iPhone bezels are back Chris
calm yeah yeah green screen that on his
shirt yeah was encouraged okay up
division HDR ten rage that's what I like
but then I always saying 60% graded
dynamic range for color in your photos
than the I front end display beautiful
now I'm gonna
now this is now I told you I'm Marty I'm
already in so I agreed every year just
for research purposes and so it's like
now and your research yeah it's really
impressive you're very predictable
though right Apple letter and I'm like I
believe my research is coming to an end
so it is now time to release them all
right and I put it in that briefcase run
it right in the above totally guys it's
really cold the 10s max gross really
would you like an Android phone like the
razor max would never yeah yeah that's
all I think about with max max power how
cool would it be like yeah is that like
a Homer Simpson max power I hope some
effort yeah max max max they regard
iPhone 6.5 inches short for a Maximilian
of course my French kid is named max
billion I bet he's very happy iPhone
Maximilian 10 Maximilian that's a
million 10s Maximilian we're now in a
lake Harry somebody's definitely some
celebrities definitely gonna name their
kid that oh yeah 10s Jackson right now
I'm sure changing the name deed poll
okay so two girls way cooler than I'll
ever be oh it's like man it's Bjork it
was yeah 3d touch is a thing oh wow they
kept 3d touch over they were gonna drop
3d touch because nobody uses rice on an
iPhone almost never I you know I you
know when I accidentally use 3d touch
its what I'm trying to delete an app and
I press it the wrong way and then it
ends up going do you want a 3d touch
this I'm like no no no one had 3d touch
I forgot okay so here's the big spec
sheet that displays so these are the two
the tennis tournament max 3d touch
tapped awake color accuracy Dolby vision
in HD ah 10 which is a nice touch can
watch all those 4k movies on my tiny
back 28 in the screen
uh why does stereo sound my de I mean
maybe like a wider frequency range well
I have seen a lie I have seen some
technology I forget the name of the
company but it you sit in front of a
laptop and they play it and it literally
sounds like surround sound like a gob on
the laptop so that's the Huawei there's
another company that does it too but
it's really impressive that technology
is amazing the dough anything that has
the surround sound without just that
like tiny strip bar speaker you know
series really they just kind of delay
the audio a little bit yeah yeah it's
like I sang in that band if it is I'm a
member of the food I was a an honorary
member for about five minutes all right
you get tired of fighting food
I get so it's exhausting oh my god
exhausting so many ah all right they're
gonna talk with a camera finally because
I want to know about the camera dot
projector well this is the face ID
camera so this is just oh okay I thought
we snarled networks okay back those
notifications my god please we want I oh
s well yeah well he's talking about Iowa
but worse especially on Twitter like you
like three of them now I don't love it
yeah this is a lot of buzzwords
algorithms if you have a buzzword bingo
kind of going algorithms I refer to my
house as a secure Enclave it is indeed a
secure a secure Enclave that has a cat
you know the link to myself man it's not
on that courage is on that new iPad is
on that I don't think anyone's gonna be
there but I find we haven't seen XR yet
series four so we can check that
life-changing do we see that we haven't
heard no transcript
like Tim Tim Cook said something similar
yeah people yes products that do change
people's change she's alive so I'm gonna
say how many that's a give me I'm gonna
say that's okay I think I love these
ships the processor and now this one is
probably going to be transistors it's
the H it's got it's like a seven hey I
hate to interrupt but I just got a
registration email from CES 2009 the tv
went off to come back to the or
nanometres sir it's a six core CPU four
core GPU Ural engine that's kind of
exactly what the rumors were telling us
sorry I'm I and these nice Peaks against
that but it's good for them yeah it's
nice yeah well thanks thanks for the
updates - yeah thanks me up grace yeah
that's good 15% faster okay it's all
it's like you know the same sort of
stuff that we would expect from and ship
upgrade and yeah you know what I'm
interested they're not gonna talk about
Qualcomm versus Intel what no they would
and they tend not to be dramatic about
such they are its came up with their own
solution and I was thinking that maybe
if that is the case they want to do like
to stick it to them this is the Apple
one five trillion neural engineering a
cup of coffee I'm like good like six or
seven trillion billion neural engine
operations per second same dude yeah not
impressed hard Sammy I love this
I got obv G says hashtag iPhone sugar as
Sugar Smacks that's like that's the
that's a good nickname sure I dig them
snacks I like that Kenny says
get Kenny says I'd clap harder if they
announced an iPhone 10s Mad Max edition
I really good some silver spray paint
some spray paint and man this is just a
whole lot of uh you know well that's
okay so now we're hitting Samsung
territory with okay good
expander memory always great that's half
a terabyte whew is it John Madden
Rockets it is if it's the terabytes the
most room please green screen this
somebody okay if I said this is all well
and good
it's like yep we've got a really amazing
process so we can do all this stuff but
like what actually can we do with it
green screens like a puffy Jerry
Seinfeld here
oh the pirate shirt yeah the Pirates
that would be brilliant all right well
let's say I don't have the time now but
maybe later I am working on it as we
speak
because you got that process or the
trillions in your head yeah I'm up like
seven trillion processes yeah first
woman on stage right there we go talking
about the she's the senior director of
iPhone product marketing I'm talking
about the phone and the chip so let's
see what this this can do now I want to
see some cool demos you know normally
Apple has the you know some some good
demos you think we have like a game
developer demo like oh it's not WWDC so
Infinity Blade Infinity Blade or we have
like the iPhone like 10s for tonight
Edition or something the 10s that's on
the bingo cards open all right every
time you take a remarkable photo
everything you do touches the chip even
an unremarkable photo I daresay it would
go through the chip as well that's a
good point you know any just horrible
fart oh there's my parking space
actually you're terrible photos the
phone goes I'm not
I know or maybe he has a that's why he
has a shiny coat you have too many cats
in your diet gonna cut back machine
learning here we love machine learning
yes real time machine learning okay well
this is they're talking about an emoji
in live FaceTime call which actually
works pretty good on the beta I have to
say immersive AR experience what are
they going to demoed that that will be
something that Scott Stein will be is it
I like this two-tone displays like we
could like it's like washed over pretty
quickly but I think that's a I'm a big
pro oh I love that true tone - it's
great I actually you know I was a kind
of a skeptic at first when they
announced it but I sort of love me mo
geez you guys I'd mine looks exactly
like me and it's really fun to send them
to people because they get really
freaked out or do live facetimes with
them when you haven't put on your makeup
and you don't you just can't be bothered
that's actually emoji okay well I made
mine makes me look like Jimmy Neutron
guys there's a new clips aren't we
excited some more space but you can use
the clips app to possibly mesophyll
Schiller's shirt just put something over
it then draw some series shortcuts is
gonna get a boost from the chip okay
series show guys is actually more useful
than I thought yeah it's almost it like
it just still needs a lot of tweaks but
it's actually quite useful because it
kind of prompts me everyday and it says
hey you know
normally text someone at the same time
every day maybe before I texted them do
you want to text them now I don't like
Oh actually I think I do
Thank You Siri shortcuts I do like Siri
shortcuts up because I've been using the
beta for a little bit and every morning
we have our morning call at 9:30 it
reminds me it knows it has realized
every morning at 9:30 I make this phone
call and so it says hey yeah you should
call at this time and so now I miss so
many less of those meetings like because
usually at 9:30 the barely awake yeah
you just assume I'm there I send a robot
this makes it easier there he has hair
for his one seeing the audience he was
oh to be on stage though maybe he maybe
he will maybe you think will come up
maybe he'll be part of the demo that's
my that's you think it's like the Oscars
where they have like two seat fillers
they have seat fillers for when the
execs go up there of course they'll have
to have an apple genius a are here we go
we're talking about
ergo AR kit and a our core are so
impressive and I'm so excited about the
future of augmented reality it's been so
interesting to see how it's evolved ever
since these two companies have to have
given developers tools to create things
that is easy and that utilizes a device
you already own so like I love the the
magic lips and the hollow lenses of the
world and that's all well and good and
I'm looking forward to seeing those
evolved but the fact that we all have a
device that can use AR right away it's
already here it's in our hands is really
exciting to me and I'm looking forward
to seeing what they're doing with it and
somebody like just real quick that blimp
I was this little light slide four
cameras off which was we were talking
about earlier so be fun to test to see
if Scott called it enhanced surface and
object detection in AR kit - that's
great multiple users a new measure app
this is yeah this is really interesting
in the point that you bring up about you
know the advancements in AI kid and Al
Khor it is fascinating for me though
like as the end user I don't feel like
the applications have been built out
enough yet they're not integrated you're
not integrated
so there's not enough awareness of what
AR can do as sure in consumer I think
we're all trapped in this world where we
totally know what augmented reality is
like we've seen multiple iterations of
it we've seen how far it's developed and
I think though for many people they act
like sure measuring a box or whatever
with your phone is cool and useful but
most people don't you even know that it
is yeah I think the big thing is is that
they absolutely should integrate it bake
it into the OS in a way that is like
extremely organic so for example you
have me emojis right and you have you
know there are there are things that I
think you could do in the welcome to iOS
12 that would say like hey and now you
have these AR abilities Oh Todd Howard
here he comes probably to talk about
elder scrolls but I like what you're
saying because I think if you did think
of it like a keyboard where the keyboard
pops up what you need to type right but
if you have a are like hey this would be
a situation and finding more mundane
ways would be we could bring back Clippy
yeah yeah let's guys I love Todd Howard
I'm excited about fallout 76 I don't
know about anybody else I'm gonna be a
murderous band of musicians that's my
that's my RP that I'm going with and
fallout 76 I'm getting those new codes
everybody shall suffer under my shoe but
Todd Howard I think that's on the record
guys yeah but Todd Howard this has been
very exciting with this Elder Scrolls
game that they're releasing so there's
been a little bit of back and forth
because they want it to be cross play on
every device so they want you to be able
to cross play across PC mobile console
but Sony is not playing very nice and so
they're like well maybe we just won't
release it on PlayStation like which has
been I'm really curious who's gonna win
in that fight because I think Bethesda
is one of the few companies up there
with like Blizzard and maybe like if
they wanted cross-platform they could
get it yeah there seems like this has
been able to convince them yeah and
that's think that's the issues like if
Sony will they were lit yeah but this
looks great I mean I'm really looking
forward to this it's interesting it
supposed to be free-to-play if I'm not
mistaken
it'll be free-to-play
and elderscrolls blades and they
announced us at e3 so you can we have it
I think we have some coverage on on this
actual game back in June if you if you
go to Sina and search but I was at the
press conference for this and it was
people really seemed to enjoy it and
they were excited about it this is the
new and gorgeous I mean look at that it
looks absolutely beautiful that's that
is literally like PC levels of graphics
from like ten years ago and it weirds me
out
I mean that's the thing is you playing
it on the 6.5 inch screen then it works
out pretty good that's impressive okay
so we're about an hour into the Keen
right now we've seen too far ends we've
seen the Apple watch series four and
we've got a game demo right now I'm so
what else is it's gonna be up I mean
it's going along pretty quickly yeah
there's quite a cliff yeah but it has
been an hour of eclipse yeah burn the
spiders down burn the whole forest down
if it has spiders in it you should just
not be there how much pressure do you
feel the guy playing it right now it's
so much a really good free yeah I would
imagine Apple would want to take chances
with with waking up to demo lags or
crack their version of lip-syncing is
like games thinking yeah that kind of
stuff happens everything son of a let's
look no it's a let you probably die in
the game if you weren't looking at the
screen you should you should definitely
painted well that's my point is if it's
recorded I'm doing great
he got I picked up some loot he's a
hundred forty three coins got some gold
good job good dude who'd play a good job
man with an Apple watch on is it dragon
please that looks badass I want to play
I think we should probably put in the
bingo next time dragons because I feel
like we see a dragon in every iPhone
event one five three years dragon Alya
got to be something well we definitely
saw five multiple just there's somebody
obsessed with dragons at Apple and I
want to know who it is it's Phil
Schiller we all know it's a big game
with this whole office is just full of
dragons okay everybody call him Khaleesi
police you know classy killer
well there's your Photoshop opportunity
now we have an app developer on stage No
two-time NBA MVP oh it's Steve - it is
yeah okay see it's gonna be talking to
an app developer there we go all right
what's going on with home court what's
happening here I'm really this I'm very
curious about this I don't tend to watch
the sports ball but I find this very
interesting yeah and also Steve Nash
you're just an all-time great
this is an app that this this app
developer has made and it tracks how
many times you miss and make shots on a
basketball court
oh that's harsh because on that before I
mean yeah but is this this is an AR up
oh I see okay I believe I believe that
is why he's here I mean right now like
that paper toss game yeah years ago but
it's like AR so I'm wondering if this is
kind of like maybe well we can see the
demo running now is it AR I can't quite
tell because yeah and maybe it's I know
it looks like it was detecting like the
ring and it's detecting if you're
actually making your baskets
you see it's counting up so we can see
the basket and it comes with Steve Nash
help you teach you how to play
basketball
mm-hmm oh and see the spots on the
ground they are spots that she's
standing on it she so if she's taking a
shot from the right place yeah okay
that's pretty cool
yeah now I'm like standard regulation
and it shows you where you're taking
your shot so many if you make them so
you see some of them are are kind of
transparent those are the misses you can
see where you missed that's cool so this
is an a oh that's like after the events
are you filming it well I'm like why
from the camera
yeah it's live what's happening you can
track you know like a coach could be
able to maybe an assistant coach should
be able to track like your your shots
which is pretty cool that is Nate I mean
I just I want to know how bad I am at
shooting hurts like because I'm pretty
bad but it'll help you get better you
could be the next Steve Nash oh I need
this for golf yeah
yeah I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure first
way that's sports
here's your posture your your you know
you're back with the iPhone on your golf
club and it has the swing like swing
dynamic oh yeah why in the world would
you ever do that which is the iPhone all
the time yeah I love this this is really
cool
and I could I mean you could apply to
more than just sports I mean think about
physical therapy applications well your
range of motion if you're if you're
working with a physical therapist this
is a really good way to track your your
progress um if you are you know there's
a lot of god there's so many different
applications I can think of to do this
if you're building something
architecture you can see the degree of
buildings like a are buildings things
like that you can put your put your work
in action it sounds like this is really
good slam dunk its ups and downs ups and
downs I found instant rim shot calm so
I'll be ready next time on stage doing a
are so I think we're gonna see some
multiplayer AR which is pretty cool I
always love watching three people
standing around here you go there's a
classic arcade okay like this okay
on the cabinet very charming they're all
plugged in because their batteries are
dead that's fine they all have the smart
note they all have the smaller they all
have the smaller iPhone 10s they don't
have the big ones because we still
haven't seen the back of it I can't
believe you're not right beside the edge
okay this version of Galaga is very
upsetting to me I like it
would you call this Galaga it looks
great Galaga its 3d 3d AR Galaga I could
my kids begging me to play this game
today and I guess you like after two
times yeah like I'm over my arms are
already tired
fYI like again then my Apple watch would
be like you are lazy it's not counted as
a step though if it's just a side
movement that's I will to this day every
day of my life
Big Apple to pay the woman who plays
GLaDOS to be my Siri like and shave me
and hate just hate on me all the time
like maybe I
I definitely like there's something to
talk about a therapist with there but I
would love to have GLaDOS be my Siri
like I would pay a premium for that I
would definitely pay a premium Apple if
you listening Tim I know you're I know
you're watching just wait him through
this again like I said I'm furious at
how good that was like I'm we all fell
for it I'm so mad
you know that's great that's probably
like really professionally written news
articles like accidental tweet leads to
marketing mayhem yeah and did we put
that up on Sina it's really good I'm
glad oh the camera is up next Phil
Schiller is on stage Oh
I mean that this if the camera if
there's three lenses they should have
led with this on the flip side on the
flip side if there's not three lenses
like there's something there's nothing
to do well because there's a lot of
tweaking the APR thing is a little over
they could tweak that a bit I feel like
it does kind of these are all just
really like oh like this stuff that can
be done in software
not the hardware development that we've
seen like portrait mode even in iOS 12
like has gotten so much better than the
cropping yeah on images is really really
improved and we have so you know we have
the new processor so right there is
going to be yeah it's bionic I want try
on ik yeah we need to keep moving
Yannick is better okay here here's a
camera let's say okay the important
thing for me it is the world's most
popular camera your true
that's what I'd like I'd like perhaps
somebody like like a for like a $200
clip-on that would be amazing
that's what I want camera gets people in
trouble let's face that'd be like a mm
if I knew it would last me more than a
year like a zit clip I'd like I would I
would literally use an add-on that would
that would make my phone a little bit
more like a mirrorless camera
I would 100% buy that in like Sony than
a few years ago that is better like I
like I need something that is made by a
camera company like a Canon or Nikon or
Leica that is a that is some sort of
device you can add to your iPhone like
an accessory that's like oh I don't
wanna I want it you need a camera that
DX Oh Martin made that was from like
that or someone or branded like yeah all
right yeah yeah make a picture a 12
megapixel senses improved true trained
flash this is all the same image
stabilization cool f-stop 1.8 that's
nice it's always nice to be sub 2 and
the image signal processor that's kind
of doing all that delicious but if it's
the same as before if that f-stop is the
same slope is the same then how are we
gonna get better low-light like it's
gonna be through prices well yeah well
processing the the problem is we've like
I hate about aperture if we're talking
about like gathering like it's not it's
too it's so expensive the wider you go
it the more expensive it gets and it
becomes so out of range of a consumer
phone no that's what I was like you want
give me that you want f0 yeah if I give
me an exit give me like a Fuji xt3 level
of like camera and I'll pay 2 grand for
that I would device I would pay a
premium to have this like amazing care
but here's the problem then I upgrade
every year
seriously with that we don't know the
price of the mat I guess it's like
probably 1200 1250 or something like
that so we're getting like County rx
whatever version X 106 version we're
getting up there we're getting close to
basically yeah 1200 is like a Fuji F the
100 F - yeah it's around the same price
like $12.99 that's like that's my go to
cameras they have the teeth I have the
one hard - yeah I do - this is why we
get along so well and I want that t3 so
bad now the t3 look fat oh yeah and the
video on that looks I just want the
Inari I just need this Sony mirrorless
a7 s3 that's a great camera that's a
great camera that's like private phone
Mac yeah yeah exactly
alright so they're talking about HDR
smart HDR taking it further and they
need to do that good they need to now
one thing I love about the iPhone
currently is it has really probably one
of the best dynamic ranges next to like
the pixel they're kind of neck-and-neck
to pee yeah I would say they're very
close but again I think the iPhone kind
of does better video than the pixel my
friend clearly does better be the pixel
video I mean like the cinematic
stabilization is amazing well the pixel
does really hyper smooth stabilization
so it becomes very unrealistic when you
watch it back yeah certain movements
that it looks unnatural so unnatural
instead the jello effect is really
prominent in certain movements and Apple
does a much better job of doing of
dealing with that but it's soon a zero
shutter lag they always say zero shutter
lag and there always is some early yeah
but remember like the days of like that
where's our original iPhone in the pile
there it's like the house really fun it
was like sitting there three two oh
there's the photo okay but it look it
wasn't that bad honestly compared to the
other point-and-shoots on the market at
the time of that camera on the iPhone
the first iPhone being released it
wasn't that bad I have sitting honestly
in good light
highlight details that guarding through
everything that the camera is gonna be
able to achieve I guess basically
they're just talking about better image
processing yeah and this is something
that then YouTube is gonna help with
they're showing a lot of great photo
samples but to be honest anything taken
by a professional photographer with any
camera is gonna look good I'm sorry it's
not the camera it's the person taking
the photo and they probably took like
400 of that one shot to get the one good
shot which is that's that's standard
yeah I mean like yes look at the
beautiful definition on the hair great
well in portrait mode I mean that
actually is really impressed
is that okay how are they getting those
water drops in like that's like a fast
shutter speed probably but yeah yeah
well don't forget that but it is yes
they are shot on iphone but then they
are put through these images are often
like put through things like Lightroom
where they are just boys or don't forget
they have darkroom on my phone that I
can use RAW images from the iPhone and
like a just don't forget you can take a
number of third-party apps but you can
adjust the shutter speed you can adjust
everything so even if the default app is
not getting you that sort of the look
that you want change the closer let's
discuss my my camera camera is my camera
folder where I keep all of my camera
apps there's a lot your girl off to my
own channel which just like mine well
okay so my go-to is camera I have camera
plus I love careful I mean I used
darkroom to edit my pictures and then I
or in light I love and light um and like
awesome and then I've got you know your
boomerangs you got your pro shot I got
obscura vseo like I use all of them
Holly SEO is my fav I got a blank one I
just love them all so much I love them
all say Oh Gary Kira gotta get my
sparkle video I got lots of camera apps
you said Lightroom in the iPhone no no
it's so complicated it's the interface
difficult to use and it doesn't do
exactly what I want to do that if from
the desktop and I don't like sharing it
through Adobe's cloud I just don't want
to pay extra for that it drives me up
the wall so we're seeing some bouquet on
the screen here you guys big like porch
users yeah yes or both really can I take
portrait guys give us some secrets
actually I take portraits of my dogs all
the time if you want really great pet
photos like portrait mode is where it's
at you've take them out into the grass
I have framed these pictures like in 12
by 18 and they hang in my house and they
are gorgeous pictures of my aunt I'll
look alike he's my sweet little baby but
that's with the eyes literally with
portrait mode and it's like it looks
great like I have never had a problem
with it like they look awesome but this
is cool you can now adjust the depth in
the camera now this is sweet like you
heard change like you're actually
changing the aperture Wow I mean we've
seen this if you think about how it's
done in many Android phones I'm sure
there is one that does it this way too
but like this it doesn't give you the
f-stop reading no on many of the Android
phones when you adjust the blur and
maybe for some people that's too
granular but for me I really appreciate
that and I think because I want to see
exactly what this has to be like Bailey
but the other thing where it is like we
know that these F 1.4 is not the actual
apertures right that's like this all
simulation stopping it down now looks
great with iPhone 10 portrait mode but
the cool thing is like I would this is
this is great in photography but then
think about how we can do videos with
this well yeah this is the thing if you
can adjust the aperture the simulation
of the aperture in video - that's cool
well and now we have the processor I
mean we're all about processing so yeah
exactly I mean they can scan these
pictures they look great I'd say I'm
telling you like if that's where it's at
for pets take great pictures of your
better photos oh yeah
okay so there's now recording stereo
sound really thank goodness because the
motor was not doing
for me but to be fair like okay I've
done a lot of testing and I know Patrick
has to with a lot of different Android
phones and iPhones let's just say the
audio quality in video is terrible
across the board in pretty much every
camera the iPhone is probably I'd say
like a good but no hey no recording at a
concert is really impressive on the app
the microphone is so lot of Android
sounds aren't great and I will say that
it's I think it sounds great you think
it sounds great I think it sounds
acceptable but it's much better than all
of the other androids that I've tried so
far I'm wanna try I haven't tried the
note 9 how's the note 9s audio now the
another has pretty good audio effect we
did like an audio test with the note 9
and or the yeah the no 9 and we did with
the razor phone which I think has
probably the best audio which cut but
not everyone's getting that phone mm-hmm
but yeah that's it sounds great
I think what's the standard on like the
LGD has it like it's that DAP ldap right
yeah yeah that's got the best audio but
that's gonna be out of your headphone
jack so it's different yeah absolutely
different mm-hmm they are now showing a
relaxing cycling video of people racing
and watching the sunset or the sunrise
Tim Stevens on one of those bikes Tim
loves riding bikes he's he's a pro our
editor-in-chief of Roadshow it's a
prolific bicycle writer exactly rides a
lot big-time big-time cyclist so they're
just running through this the nice big
cheat sheet of everything that they
talked about highlight well they're
showing they basically just told how no
and pointing to everything its bouquet
but okay
sorry recording and has 30 minutes
longer battery life than iPhone 10
really wait a half hour 30 minutes is
that it so it's gonna last you until
12:30
oh great well thank you it will last me
you're gonna say 30% better than me
thirty minutes literally the only
measurable like wow I got 30 minutes
woo thirty more minutes I mean I guess
like something you want to notice an
hour and a half more than iPhone 10 well
the max that's the max an hour and a
half but geez that's okay well at least
I gave us a number gigabit LTE no 5g no
surprise there um that's not gonna be
for a lowly this is interesting keep two
phone numbers and use two different
plans this is the dual SIM card support
sorry this is one of the rumors is
actually great dual sandwich well
actually
okay so Shara's justjust just written a
sim technology so this is the same tech
that was used in the the Apple watch and
the iPad so it's basically like
simulating another see my can merge my
work phone and my can I do that
the number perfect because I just wanna
have a red retro phone in my office that
rings whenever someone calls my work oh
that's never happens
don't ever call me call you PR
representative say email it was Batman
like hey you got one red one too
it's going to voicemail like I'm not
picking up like I'd I will not pick up
the phone yeah I won't this is so good
for travel dory because every time I
support it I need to I have to carry two
phones with me one with my us work phone
oh that's great other with my personal
Australian number so now I can merge
them actually overseas so maybe I'll try
it out if I get a phone before the noise
should telecom tree phone Bell gig I'm
just reading the International isn't the
popular ones there's the ones mostly a
lot people overseas use the ones that
I've seen it Australian ones know maybe
Vodafone I mean for defines Australia
we'll see in China where you can't have
an e SIM that phone will have two SIM
slots so physical Sims oh wow that's
interesting so they're actually really
addressing the Chinese market we
smart very smart it's something that
Apple definitely needs to do given the
sales numbers and it obviously a big
push into China having a dual SIM slot
is huge I wonder if that would be
available like I mean you know II seems
great but maybe some people just want
okay so special - max will have the
Chinese market there was a rumor we
heard for the iPhone X but we haven't
heard about that little one thing though
today is it just that is the cheap one
yeah that seems like a really
underwhelming one it does but I mean
yeah sure I guess our chance for maybe
maybe I won't even be mentioned in the
key would it be amazing if they called
the charging pad the power pad and then
there was like Nintendo sued that no I'm
scared
no and it charges your phone while you
hold it and it can maybe go make them go
back in time like that you're well a
diorama yes get our get all ready
Jerome is a Greek what's Charlie is like
a puzzle game kind of were you trying to
make through like you make like tubes
you know like the Mario oh yeah sounds
fun it's fun it's cool well here is the
specs everything that we've taught there
so many words on all sightings lots of
things depth control portrait where's my
teleportation revive some important come
on yeah excuse me energized and now okay
so now the iPhones mostly done maybe
they're talking about renewable energy
okay okay okay so maybe we should take
it a little check in on seen that alive
I think we should what's happening
seeing is Apple's big on the
environmental front well let them do
that thing there's a sustainable energy
and all their on their location it's a
good little time for us to transition
yeah let's see what's happening I'm how
much oxygen Apple has made from those
trees outside last year Brian Bell says
breaking news from Apple event Ashley
asked ewa on CNET live is offering the
first person who buys her a brand new
iphone before the end of the keynote a
free lightly used dragon hurry while
supplies last fire and triple-a
batteries not included
when
responsible for shipping and tax you
know yeah this is what happens when you
up the the character count
I also Vanessa our very own Vanessa
Freeman's she's tweeting from inside the
theater that tweets are coming from
inside the theater tweeted at me and
said is that you at the Apple event and
did the picture of the girl looking back
as she's blonde and has bangs and then
somebody else wrote back and said it
can't be there are no sentient glasses
attached to that human pod and that is
true I am actually a pair of sentient
alien glasses and I'm just wearing a
meat a meat suit that's that's my life
it's wearing a little meat suit but yeah
like that's I mean those are the those
are the big ones that I've seen on the
on the sea net live hashtag great and
don't forget if you are on the scene at
live hashtag and you are tweeting us a
question a comment something fun
something funny we have some surprises
for some lucky people we have some lucky
grab bags of great stuff CNET swag this
is just one thing because it's like very
easily accessible to me there's more in
the bag trust me as I'm really heavy
back we also have some tarts a beautiful
compact tote a CNET tote we have some
cases it's embroidered it's like
actually embroidered very CLE
embroidered we also have an apple book
this would be very popular in LA by the
way really this is so cute and we have
some sunglasses so you can look like an
extra out of Top Gun I'm gonna take a
picture of this because I want to look
at their website it's adorable we have a
lot of things so please if you have
questions for us so you have something
funny to say we just want to say hi
seeing it live is the hashtag so they're
still on about environmental
sustainability so they're talking about
the the glass and the plastics program
that they are trying to eliminate in
terms of like the the in terms of
eliminating the new materials
essentially so that can they be
sustainable in recycling and the logic
board is using recycle
Tinh so they won't have to mine Newton
that's really good that's great mm-hmm I
think on ten I friend 10s look at this
all there's a 55s up there it's so cuz
iOS 12 still works on the 5s there we go
and it actually improves the performance
a little bit but it's significant you
know it's you know Apple in WWDC made
some claims about iOS 12 running on all
of the range phones and even provides
increased performance and improve
performance and they quantified it with
the 5s
I actually did a side-by-side test I ran
the beta on 5s and then iOS 11 on a 5s
separate Oh actually the same front
except refresh thank you separate oh
that was separate friends yeah but as
identical as you can make them and yes
it actually was faster I mean it was
like the most significant one for me was
like the loading of like the share sheet
and things like opening Safari and
loading pages that was like almost a
second in some races which is
significant on a phone as old as the 5s
absolutely yeah so that was that was
good to say but I mean I wonder if the
time is gonna improve when the gold
master / the full version drops
something we have not heard about
Windows happening everything but the
iPhone 10 are and or what's going to
happen to the iPhone 10 8 + 8 + so I'm
sure we'll are they gonna go away 10 get
dropped in price me and that becomes the
the entry into the system but it's still
not cheap enough though yeah $1,000 how
can they drive it but down 849 maybe
well even that's too much I know it's
like I got an entry into the Apple
ecosystem on the iPhone yeah it's a lot
it's too it's too much so I think that's
still it well I mean yes but then it
sounds like so a little too much of a
reach for someone who wants to get 614
don't wanna crap
well that are maybe I mean I mean people
like we like the bezels and stuff but
it's like they have the same internals
as the iPhone 10 I say tradition like
just as Apple events go this one has
been pretty uneventful and I don't mean
that because of the leaks and stuff like
I think this is just really like it
doesn't feel it doesn't have that like
it's not special like there's always
like there are every now and again we
get these Apple events that feel really
special and and this doesn't feel like
one of them this is the cheapest I'm
getting orders Friday I'm getting
pre-orders Friday it's Friday available
next the for two weeks from now so that
would be not it's a pre-orders on the
14th and then we're probably thinking
maybe the 21st in terms availability
yeah that's usually how it works that's
a week later I'd say - you think - I
think - well there was the room is that
the the chain that the 28th pretty quick
oh it's one more thing thing he said one
more iPhone iPhone this is the closed
captioning on why the camera is that
back see I would have just like that
holographic back that has all the colors
that would have been cool aerospace
grade aluminium XR XR is the tenor white
black blue coral and yellow so no get
back in the house coral hey no Brown
ip67 so it can stay it's six seven is
the water one right it's dust and water
so seven would mean it's the other one
was 68 so it can stay in the water less
time yeah I need to brush up on the IP
ratings again it's you know it looks
just like the 10 there we go and there's
a product red model as well that's real
sorry the other one looks really cool
it's very vibrant it's very vibrant and
again they're going back to that iPhone
5c colors yeah Melissa on our Twitter
visas hello following along while
working today love you all we love you
thanks for watching and then tio Becca
says iPhone 10 is my max okay I like it
I like that that was a good tweet I
liked that too
LCD edge to edge display so no surprise
there from what we've thought was gonna
win the case but liquid yeah liquid
retina I think I've seen that man before
amazing six point one inches one point
four million pieces a little bigger than
than this it's yes this is a lot of
great and so the X the sorry the 10s and
the ten of the same size five point
eight this one is a little bigger a six
foot inch LCD LCD yeah the most advanced
LCD magical LCD but the thing is though
that if I want to see dive more into
this LCD they don't tell us now but here
you go there was talk that it was gonna
be was something called an M LCD which
is actually not far off what you were
saying magical else they need magical
LCD M stands for magic yeah because G
stands for courage magical liquid
courage display that courage display is
what I'm going to call liquid liquid
right now for the rest of my life M LCD
friends oh yeah my self does the scene
that review needs to do a handstand
upside down I love it
okay so they were just running through
again sort of the specs of what the
screen can do we have the resolution
1792 by 828 tapped awake 1.4 million
pixels and the true tone display so
don't worry still they even though it's
not an OLED yeah I mean I'm gonna be
intrigued by who makes this screen is it
an LG 1 because LG was making the LCD
that was rumored to be in this phone
which is an M LCD which has I think this
is correct there's a separate white
pixel that helps it to develop
brightness in a different way I think
using the LGB 30 I think Patrick you
might be able to correct me though
you're right I was there talking about
on 3d touch for a second there exciting
3d touch is still there the feature that
knowing news it's it doesn't
oh so this is the thing so 3d touch due
to the engineering of the screen there's
why was the reason that I can't put 3d
touch in the LCD I did that's I've that
I just saw go by side Oh Patrick why
don't you know you should know every
time when to turn into this you know
live shall find it so it has haptic
touch instead of 3d touch do you think
it's gonna haven't the a12 in there yes
I think it will be but it will be scaled
up up faster secure Enclave oh that's
that's my mobile that's the name of my
mobile home yeah so my regular house
secure Enclave yeah when I take my RV
out then it's faster so this haptic
touch is this gonna be like what's on
the MacBook trackpad yeah believe so cuz
that back it's kind of I don't know how
I feel about that well I mean that's
what we had for the the home buttons on
like this that's true that was can we
also officially pronounce the home
button as dead well yes right P home
button they don't drop the price and
they ate and it disappears out of the
lineup and it's a net and then button
it's dead and then we can almost
guarantee that the next I mean we can
pretty much guarantee the next iPads
will have no whole button as well oh
yeah it's gonna have to just be face ID
yeah
same it looks like yes
oh so it's all stuff way done mmm still
I've stopped 1.8 yeah that's the same
bad that's the same as the other one
yeah same experiences that's pretty neat
if it can do the depth effect opus makes
you which I believe everyone joking like
that the same same same 16 element lens
system 1.4 microwave millimeter pixels
that's the size of the pixel in the
center I think that's the same as the
previous previous one I think so I will
have to double-check that back cut out
the the the way that it cuts out for
portrait mode is really impressive the
software update has been has actually
been very impressive I've been nothing
but impressed with portrait mode and
it's only getting better and I I'm very
excited it everyone out have you used
the portrait mode on the pixel by
comparison cuz that's a single lens
system as well but it works it works
pretty good and it yeah it's um I think
it has a little bit more issue it's I
think when they both came out the pixel
had an edge and I think now it there's
been a shift back toward the iPhone I
think the software's been optimized a
little bit better but when the pixel 3
happens I'm gonna be really curious so
that cameras like yes I said anything
about the pixel 2 is I'm sure well it's
the way it's a different way it renders
it's more of almost like a cutout right
and look a little it can look a little
bit false but it also looks very it's
Chris hit the details in like the faces
it's so crisp but then on the flip side
I think the iPhone makes it comes closer
to what a DSLR camera would look like
right what you think from a lot of
people's with it and now the battery
life is being talked about an hour and a
half more battery life than the iPhone 8
plus so this is the phone that they're
definitely seeing is the upgrade path
from which means it looks like they're
gonna get rid of it then yeah right
because they're saying it's better than
the eight plus I would think he that
would mean that they wouldn't have it
around right exactly
or maybe they will I don't know well
maybe that's why they're carrying it
maybe they drop it significant you get
those $100 $150 price points though what
how much does this phone have to cost
for it to be compelling six I'd say six
fifty or less six fifty
6:49 it just can't be I mean if it's any
more than that what are they even doing
because I pixel to cut when it came out
will cost 649 the ate costs $6.99 going
up ever since then the s-97 8 for 700
700 yeah it was in the 700 somewhere and
then it's just keep getting more and yet
this cannot possibly be any more
especially with a single lens I can't
possibly be more than 649 if it's yeah
the 649 this is if they really wanted to
make it compelling $5.99 $5.99 would be
insane that way that would be a Mike
droppers that'd be a mic drop moment
$5.99
I didn't your mind all right Joanie I
video time after the event get my
popcorn out get a glass of wine watch my
Johnny high videos like I mean
back-to-back it just it's like a shower
experience he's just so relaxing
I would like Johnny I have to release an
album full of bedtime stories that he
reads to you that are meditation app if
you just like read the periodic table
elements that would ya like it asleep
immediately
dreadful yeah no I would love that so
much
nice okay here we go here's the family
picture here there you go family
portrait and Phil Schiller tiny Phil
Schiller not included yeah and here's
the video
turn your screens off no okay so we
basically didn't get anything from the
back of the 10s max it Sounion the same
camera okay no third lens okay that's
how they want to play it what's okay so
wait we're going more like the Google
kind of made fun of them last year for
pay more money to get a better camera
but you really know now you don't you
tell the get bigger screen the same
mm-hmm unless you really want to
telephoto lens I can't decide if I want
the the bigger one or the regular sized
one I think it's gonna be like a hand
test I have to think it just I do really
like this size of phone I'm a fan of
this that's the thing that's why they
get you because they know you that you
probably don't want to go to a larger
form factor but then
do you want to go down to an LCD no
that's the thing I don't want to but
that's bigger than this yeah so it's
like no I that's why it's my definitely
gonna say OLED I mean that's I got a
yeah I mean the plane but plane like
with the note nine for last couple of
weeks it's been D because that screen is
just bonkers beautiful and the way
they've calibrated it over past years
where is maybe I thought a little more
oversaturated before but looking at that
versus like the even the ten screen as
my eyes still always go to that so be
neat to see how their other looks yeah
yeah so I can the bigger one because
technically it might actually have more
pixel yeah and we will absolutely have
Scott Stein and our our team that is on
the ground in there they will be
checking out likely demo units right
after the event so we'll hopefully be
bringing you guys that as well so stay
tuned to us to see nut for that because
we're I know I will be
I want that goal you've never wanted go
I don't it's gonna be the most coveted
sold out color report it's gonna be like
the white iPhone all over again remember
we do I have white faces on iPhones
anymore because that was horrific why
would you ever do such a white back but
then the black nice so it's much easy to
read yes do not like some questions from
the chat yes we'll give some A's
santosh wants to know when will i OS
twelve be out to update great question
so usually if this is following
digitally traditionally this is
following the pattern of previous Apple
events the gold master will drop
probably later today that's the kind of
the final beta version and then probably
the iOS actual official drop in terms of
like the final software for you to
download to your phone will probably be
a week from today that's traditionally
or maybe Tuesday so that's traditionally
how it's been but I'm hoping they're
gonna say something before this wraps up
because they usually do make it might be
like in iOS 12 is available right now
well that's the fact that might be a
thing so I think that it's gonna be
given some information on that but
that's usually what we've seen from me
is past so that's what we would expect
anyone else we have
Oh question they're all asking about
when iOS 12 oh is that the question okay
that's a good question Billy that gives
you yeah that's a lot of times they want
to keep the hype up right but in that
week between pre-order and launch and so
they'll they'll release iOS 12 to remind
everybody there are new phones coming
out and so there yeah hey I got a new
iOS told there must be a new iPhone out
so if you haven't even seen this event
getting they've Pavlovian trained us to
see a new iOS means a new iPhone and so
we go look at the last year where they
kind of staggered the release of the
phones well I've heard that NR is gonna
be delayed a bit delayed in terms of
limited production run because of
potentially the LCD screen right you
know and then well liquid courage is
hard to come it is it's all 749 749
that's the price of the 10 are too much
you were wrong way too much way too much
and that's starting from so that's not
even so it's variants with a 64 gig the
128 so they're gonna be $7.99 get out
the 250 C is gonna be like 849 like
that's no easy that's and that the coid
is that's less expensive than the iPhone
8 plus well thank you for that
the I friend 10s the same as it starts
at $9.99 same price as the high friend
10 the tennis max he's 1099 dollars for
the 64 gate and then it goes to two
especially impressive this is anuradha
difference that's cool 64 get yeah
that's but that was the base price but
jumping a hundred dollars well I always
thought it would have been two hundred
dollars pre-orders October 19th
available to 26 for the are that's the
ah yes okay and the 14th is the
pre-orders for the 10s and the 10th we
now which we put your predictor E and
then the ships the 21st exactly what
great I'll have it in time for my trip
I'm so excited okay well if they can get
it to me on time I'm tired
look maybe John ledger I'm talking
directly at you right now
I have t-mobile and I am going to need
the device right I need it please okay
well I mean this is really
because I I don't know that threshold if
they're trying to attract people into
the next iPhone as the upgrade 749 no a
lot of money yes it is tax too much for
that for 64 gigs too if you're shooting
1080p its 4k video just shooting 4k
video or even 60 sounds like that's gone
in in six months if you shoot a lot of
stuff yeah
by like that's that it's not enough yeah
first of all we needed just like
dispense with the 64 gig storage like
it's ridiculous it's funny how quickly
that's not completely dead I mean look
but sure I don't think this iPhone 10
are it's like if you want to shoot for a
phone you're not getting that 10 are
you're gonna buy a 7 or an 8 to 10 is
spending 749 you're gonna you're if
you're on a monthly plan yeah it's been
the extra $200 on your monthly plan for
people who want the iPhone 10 buy it now
go to the store an hour but it's still
gonna be $9.99 well they might drop
aside a tip because Patrick used to work
I think it's an iOS available September
17th was that what I just caught
September 17 as well I'm checking if the
live look has updated that yet I saw a
card that had a whole bunch of my OS 12
icons yeah okay well yes it was 1717 for
iOS 12 so you were right next week next
week yeah sorry home pod home bad you're
gonna be Monday next week the u.s. time
there we go
I'm pod oh wow we already need ok WDC so
where is air power that's my question
yeah where's air power where's the power
ok so now on the home pod you can
research some pot on the air power so
you don't get that ring on your wood ok
so now you can search for favorite songs
by lyrics on her part actually you can
do that on Apple music without the home
port just FYI
or apps or apps
valuable timers make and receive calls
from the home part and ping devices to
find them around the house now all of
that you can do on I'm not sure about
the lyrics one but pretty much
everything else on like all of the other
smart speakers all right yeah
pinging devices around the house there
you guys I don't find my iPhone yeah
let's log in on your computer yeah but
can I find you a remote only hope
TV OS is getting support for dolby atmos
4k great yeah well this was announced at
WWDC though right sorry did we do a lot
a lot of this stuff so as they say
they're building up to all right so the
updates there on Monday for the home pod
in TV OS and the next week Mojave is
coming up September 24th Oh delayed but
I mean I feel like I have like a week by
week yeah I haven't run the beta on on a
Mac yet because this is my work one and
I'm too scared to run it cuz I've heard
that they're a little bit more out of
different things with Mojave well it's
it's dark worried that important to many
people I can see but I know a lot of
Reem Liam a lot of people tell me that I
care about doc yeah i andwhere know what
the apps I used to have people don't
care about it until they use it and then
I want everything to be dark my Apple is
all in on the dock mode on my hobbies
make apple music doc martens cook
sneakers are not dark mode beautiful
yeah okay so now cooks back up on stage
I think he's running through everything
that we saw I think you know Scott's
diet no iPads here today no iPads no new
iPad come on this was a year ago in this
very robot that we heard about AMPA I
think honestly I think if they're not
announcing anything today I mean it
means they have gone completely back to
the drawing board
yeah they don't run there something's
wrong they can't get it to work the way
they want it to work maybe it works okay
maybe it's fine but maybe it's just not
enough maybe it doesn't charge fast
enough maybe with multiple devices
there's a problem I mean there are a
million things that could be going on in
I sleep Apple has always traditionally
said it's done when it's done like it's
done when it's right and it's done when
it's done and though no air power either
that's what yeah that's what I mean like
that oh Airport and no new ear pods like
there's no air pods no air power
reaction from the Chow like twelve
twelve hundred or twelve fifty to go
from an iPhone I guess the hundred
dollar difference was shocking me 64 gig
doesn't even exist I would rip off
another guy says expensive AF I mean I
I'm genuinely surprised that the 10r is
that expensive I honestly like I mean
sure yeah you can get the seven but why
would you get the seven I mean it's full
before I mean I've seen weight responses
to that in my timeline yeah like just
people saying like oh it looks like oh
the 10r is lit and I can't wait to get
it everyone's gonna have one and then
other people are like who is gonna buy
that like I don't I mean the colors the
it's really weird like color is a really
important thing like that's like people
like that that's like a really weird
like non it doesn't mean anything it
doesn't matter but it's a thing that
matters to people because it they can
personalize it a little bit better and I
think that that is gonna be the selling
point of view the 10 mm hmm nothing else
oh yeah absolutely
oh I get this really cool colorfull
iphone like I love that and that's the
thing people make such a big deal about
the color and then they put a case on it
whatever you have to because it's so
breakable I mean you look at how far you
go to keep a case on it we're starting
to see the demo room has been opened up
so what happens is the keynote is over
and the demo room is when everyone runs
in and tries to get quick hands on with
all of the products the Apple watch
there's gonna be all the new iPhones as
well and so we're going to get live
pictures of that coming in
throughout keeping an eye out so we'll
be the first to bring them to you
but you know let's gets good to some of
the questions on st. out live I mean I
know people have been watching and
tweeting us throughout the show this
one's funny from from Jen see it says
again see sorry if I said your name
wrong bro can you just tell me how much
I will have to sell my kidney for so I
can afford the iPhone tennis max totally
if you can find it or probably more cuz
do you really want the 60/40 so when you
think it's me like a hundred other
increments I'd be like would I take over
just so you can get all your accessories
your dongles whatever else you need like
just do a good cool 1500 you guys
AppleCare no no no I think the Apple
cares was more pricier for the yeah what
do you think it's gonna be I wanna let's
see yeah I mean it was only 149 isn't it
I think it's let's check ok the store is
let's say so the I'm looking on the
Apple website it just says iPhone 10
welcome to the future hmm okay so it
hasn't been updated update I love this
vanessa tweeted what's the R in iphone
10 R stand for and Charles wrote yeah
right that's great you know I heard that
they're the reason why it was well this
is what I think it was from a Bloomberg
report originally when they first came
out with the 10 our name it was that I
was the letter before s sorry I didn't
want to associate with the C the 5c
because as much as you know it was a
loved phone I don't got I hope it was
seen as like a success in that front so
there you go maybe it's the letter
before s I don't know well the grain of
salt maybe it's true and the clue
they've moved away from all the other
naming conventions except for the yes
like there's no plus there's no see
that's the thing why take away the plus
because to me that doesn't necessarily
say this isn't like it's an extended
version you know basically gives you
more it gives you more battery life but
maybe they would think max is a better
name what with the plus I always got I
get the better camera I got the better
battery life the higher pixel density
screen and now I'm just getting that
screen and I don't know what the
batteries I did see what the battery
specs
we're on the bigger one imagine if
bitter bitter 30 whole minutes yeah 30
whole minutes here it's been updated
someone in the chat room thank you thank
you very much okay yep welcome to the
big screen all right
pre-order on the 14th of September which
is Friday it's gonna be like a midnight
thing as they always do I wonder if I
worry the same as last year last year's
pre-order was such a couple I remember
it is every year yeah but it was 3 a.m.
East Coast time people are angry in New
York and everyone on the west coast is
like I gotta stay up a little late time
it was particularly bad I remember last
year because then I think even the apple
the Apple site was just ridiculous I
ended up getting it from Best Buy and
they charged $100 premium hot tip when
you do when you order your phone this
Friday use the Apple store app it tends
to work better than the website I have
multiple that's what I call strands of
multiple stream having reorder but don't
order more than one well actually you
could just take it back well in the
Apple Store app if I merrily classy you
could get in a lot of the information
beforehand this is why so I got a call I
have to be able to go and talk to a
physical person which is last year
what's that like oh wow it is really
exciting and by that I mean nothing at
midnight - I'm sure everyone's in a real
copy place ok so I mean like be nice to
your customer service representatives
this Friday please help you do yeah do
them a kindness and even if it's
frustrating even if the you know the the
connection is bad and they can't get
onto the servers to put your order and
just be kind be patient the chatroom is
speculating what the R stands for so far
we have rubbish we have what was the
last one I just saw that was kind of
funny
rainbow well I mean this for me like I
think that a lot of this comments on
saying it live a kind of echoing
everything that we've talked about in
terms of especially the
dollars extra for the 10r as seem says
$100 of lesser price could have
attracted 10 million more people see
yeah that's my big thing like take a
take a hit on the price to be able to
get people into the ecosystem who maybe
aren't there yet and are looking at
other devices I mean to me like that's
the whole point of that 10 are is hey
maybe you've had Android for a while
don't you want if you're thinking about
switching to this premium device but you
don't want to pay eleven hundred dollars
or a thousand dollars like try the
iPhone 10 are it's got a lot of the
features it's it's you know it's got
face ID it's got all the stuff that the
other premium phones have with the
exception of a few different things and
you can get it in a variety of colors
and you can try out iOS I mean they get
you into the ecosystem like that's how
that's where Apple makes their money
anyways the ecosystem and services like
it's not even really so much devices
anymore I completely agree it but I want
to flip it on their way so think about
it now that if worth saying that the
iPhone 10s is the that's the phone
that's the baseline is that a thousand
dollar mark then this is seemed like it
just got i completely agree that a
hundred dollars less to get tracked more
people but also i think there's a lot of
people who are not android users who are
have older iPhones now it's like well if
I'm already paying but 749 for and and I
wonder like how much is it make that
jump at the end of day it comes down to
gross margin and I think apples go sell
a lot of phones either way there were so
many naysayers about the thousand dollar
price point and they sold more of those
than they did in any other phone yeah
this year will be the same yeah well
we'll have to wait and see doesn't mean
I like it like I mean I'm just still
like I understand completely like no
yeah I would just really love to see
Apple do something really cutthroat like
they haven't done anything like really
bold and daring like that in a really
long time I think I missed that like I
miss those the days of like it feels
like a thing not not to say like oh this
is what Steve would have done or
whatever but it's like this this is now
a very safe Apple right and so it's like
it's a lot of dads ecute 'iv running the
company and like they're just like you
know good dudes who are just like you
know they've making profits and that's
cool but man I just love to see them
really just be cutthroat like Tim Cook
got to where he was he is the CEO of the
company because he was so cutthroat
about
I chain that it sucked the oxygen out of
the room for everybody else and it's
like those are the kind of things that
make me excited to see companies like
compete with each other and it's not
necessarily like you know there's other
stuff that other factors that go in that
come into play with those types of moves
but the thing is man I just you know I
think about the the PlayStation event
ps3 and the the Xbox 360 event where it
was like oh the Xbox 360 night $600 11
inch MacBook Air that got to like with a
849 price 850 and that was insane that
was crazy
one I think that was the best one was
the original iPad and everyone thought
it would be like 800 ah it was like 399
and it was like right there just like
we'll just double the price of the
iPhone like double the price totally
agree with you I think though the thing
is Apple is very clearly a middle aged
company you know like 40 plus years we
also saw this you like Apple itself as a
dad Zack it is but it's really like it
hit trillion-dollar market value cap
right and so like this is it now it's
gonna be have to play it very safe in
terms of maximizing profits and you know
returns for the shareholders I mean
that's what Tim Cook was brought in to
do yeah and then he's done it and it's
taken enough risks with products like
the Apple watch and obviously we've seen
the home buyer you know the home word
hasn't necessarily been the runaway
success that perhaps they wanted it to
be I think there's a lot of iterations
there I think home would probably
version 3 is probably gonna be the one
that we wished it was to start with
especially in the smart speaker market
right now because we smaller version
would be nice yeah it's so big yeah but
I mean in terms of the size it doesn't
matter so much to me the sound quality
is great on the home pod but it's so
limited in what it can do compared to
the other you can get or sonís I think I
Sonos or look at yeah there's a ton of
new speakers yeah I want to go back and
say like the the pricing is it's a
little concerning
I do thinking like the sticker shock
thing is what I call it we're we're good
at okay that makes sense you get time to
justify it but I think the hardware that
we saw is so compelling I am really
excited by the iPhone 10 are but I loved
the the the 10s and the 10s Mac's are
I'm excited to try them out
my side I love that new gold color I
really look forward to trying these
cameras out I'm interested about those I
don't we just say this every year it is
but L so that's why I'm like I'm not
there's nothing that I'm saying this
year that I didn't say last year but I
would be surprised on a nest year
especially that you say anything more
than well he's he's the things with the
cameras though I wouldn't know nests
like the antennas like this is the same
stuff we say every year and I'm just
like okay yeah I want to know what the
cameras though are they gonna be all of
those updates they're gonna be backwards
compatible so is that gonna be a
software update because none of that is
a hardware thing to be honest none of
that looks like it's a hardware thing I
could be wrong I have to go check but it
looks it should be something if that is
the reason why you would buy one of the
10s or the 10s max to me like that it
that's something that's software based
and that is something that should come
to the other phones with dual cameras
thing it'll be both kind of feature sure
hammer is processor driven and also that
on the flip side yes some of these
things like the an emoji which could
actually be on really any phone yeah
that's gonna come but that what
something held for that and we did see
12 tour and everything did I miss the
face ID part because I feel like they
didn't really talk that was a little bit
crazy but I don't think it was as deep
dive as we were expecting in terms of
like the upgrades what he does and it
you know let's just see this was a
hardware event right it was like there's
very little focus on software hardware
and that's fine like that that's really
cool they use WWDC for that now like
that's that's fine actually can't go
back for a second so you're saying like
this is like it just seems like we say
this everywhere what would have been the
thing they could have added to like the
iPhone 10s that would have made you be
like oh yes you know Apple pencil
support would have been really nice
I used the pencil all the time on my
iPad and a pencil Mini would have been
really cool like an optional pencil mini
would have been really cool
not that I need a stylus but it is nice
to have sometimes if I want to like
sketch something or show somebody
something that I am thinking about and I
can
like verbalize it and use your finger to
draw something it's not nearly as you
know it's not nearly as detailed but I
mean maybe that maybe you know just
something new like I feel like we didn't
see anything new today like we just saw
we just saw a standard upgrade it was
very iterative of the 10 and that's fine
it is an S a year it's a year where we
don't see a major Hardware change we
don't see we don't see a lot of that
stuff and that's that's totally fine but
it but I mean for me it's like I'm still
gonna upgrade and that's cool but it was
just you know very pedestrian for me
today so I think the airport's for me
was like the one thing that I was
expecting Apple to do because it's a
two-year-old product now essentially and
you know for not to have any significant
updates in that time I think is a little
bit of a disservice to the product line
because obviously Apple is you know
they're never going back to the
headphone jack they're making a big push
into having like everything connected
through the Lightning port / Wireless so
why not have a product line or even
something in the beats line as well I
mean don't forget like Apple has almost
totally forgotten about Beats like what
happens to that we don't haven't seen
like many significant updates we
obviously have the oh very Bates tree or
threes and you know the beats X and all
of that but in terms of like updates and
newer products around that line and
nothing around the the w2 chip and the
in the air pods - because I mean that's
where like the airport's need that boost
is like increased connectivity in
battery life etc so I mean I think even
if that would have been such a little
incremental update that I feel Apple
could have made very easily and what
would have pleased a lot of people is
some of that they like going back to the
air power like maybe they're like there
is that ear pods waiting to happen with
that charging case and they're waiting -
yeah I mean maybe that's gonna be the
October event it could be later this
year that where they do you know the
MacBook the air pods the yeah iPads like
I mean that's the thing is is we did see
five new devices here we saw two
different watches we saw three different
iPhones so it's like to me it's like
okay that's five devices then maybe we
got like five more coming later this
fall or whatever
our very own CNET twitter account makes
a great point they show a picture of
apple's store before and after the event
and they're like so long iPhone 10 yea
iPhone se and 6s now
if 749 for the 10r is the trade-off then
okay fine maybe like if that's the
discounted ten yeah like okay
it feels like that's the way if that's
the way we're looking at it then like
okay I accept it I accept that price
that's fine that's a hundred and fifty
dollar discount be you're still not
getting dual cameras you know what if
they built in a lot of that technology
on if they could combine they had tens
technology into a single lens then that
doesn't really matter right right unless
you want telephoto which not many people
do to be honest yeah I think it's one of
those thing also I think telephone is
one of those things it's just when it's
there you like it but it's not something
I don't know I didn't really I think the
again it's bright colors but doing that
for years oh yeah right and they bring
an actor what other fun people do it
we're gonna see the red one sure someone
in the chat room on a YouTube chatroom
pointed out 60 a 64 gigabyte iPhone max
is more expensive than 128 gigabyte note
9 yeah see that like this is my like
constant struggle where it's just like
you know people
I mean look apples gonna be fine like
god they're they're nobodies doomed like
we always hear these like naysayers off
isn't it apples gonna be fine they're
sitting on a literal mountain of dollars
and at the end of the day like I'm not
worried for them or I don't I think this
these all these phones are gonna sell
like gangbusters people are gonna buy
them like that's fine
but man I like if you're trying to make
the decision between either staying on
iPhone or going to Android or switching
from Android to iPhone like that is the
thing that will help make a decision for
you like that is a tipping scale level
price point issue do you think it's like
do you think it's the people coming from
Android to iPhone or do you think it's
more retaining the people an iPhone
because I feel like that's more the the
current I feel is that there's so many
really good Android phones sure one plus
the Samsung's the Google and I brought a
piece about that too I think that is
compelling because if they always tell
people what use what your friends and
family have because right that's gonna
be a better experience but now it is
there is a parity a little bit between
operating systems but there's
not always a parody if you look at
Samsung there is it's the cost is close
right yeah on the flip side any other
brands like Google and one plus
especially like yeah you're not looking
at that a huawei LG and I think that's
the thing is like how do you kind of
hold out people I'm tempted but I'm
gonna stay here cuz I'll pay the 749
well exactly and if you think about okay
it's the 749 price point and also the
time in which it's gonna be available
which is gonna be later than the 210 s's
people are gonna be thinking okay well I
want a new iPhone I'm ready to upgrade
but maybe that's 749 like you know I
have to wait like three weeks a month
laid out maybe I should just spend a
little bit more and get the 10 in JSON
yeah you know and that's actually really
interesting strategy if that is you know
how people are gonna be funneled into
that way of actually not getting that 10
are off the bat just because it's not
available as quickly as the other two
phones yeah and I think that's that's a
really interesting you think too because
a lot of people just can't wait they've
decided they're gonna upgrade they've
seen the new phones they knew exactly
what they get your order start on Friday
and they're gonna do it exactly they
like I can't be bothered waiting it's
not you know it's not that much cheaper
it you know only it has one camera and I
want to and if you're on a monthly
payment plan it's really it's not a huge
difference I mean it can make the
difference for a lot of people hands
down totally but for a lot for other
people it's like well it's one less
Starbucks a month or whatever yeah yeah
well I was looking at the price at the
top in the top in note 9 with 512 is 12
49 here in these states 50 top end top
and s max is 1440 we're talking about
400 bucks dollars recycler durability
the chat room is also actually asking uh
will there be iPhone X refurbished in
the Apple Store oh well I think you
probably will see something like that or
there's gonna be a number of I for
intense flooding the market come
yesterday and today sorry many check
eBay you know if people have taken care
of them and they factory reset them it's
only a year old it's gonna be totally
fine for your needs like I don't even
know how much refurbishment needs to be
done if it's not broken if it's not
smashed it should be you know I mean
guess you want the Apple certification
yeah not fun yet you want that peace of
mind but the prices of any sort of
second-hand modal right now go check it
out because I think that's if you're
really thinking about getting an iPhone
10 or one of those models and you're not
quite ready to make that jump to the 749
you definitely should check out I'm
getting a lot of questions just by that
phone camera you get a brand new device
what's that what's the questions people
are asking us to explain a hundred and
twenty Hertz and they're asking is that
like razors phone what is 120 rows okay
yeah I think I saw this flash up so
razors phone has 120 hurt refresh rate
on screen so usually most phones have a
1666 refresh rate though they were
talking about wasn't it like haptic
something yeah and so what what we saw
flashed for the Apple event wasn't about
the screen refresh I believe it was
about how the refresh rate of the haptic
feedback right touch digitizer someone
waits try yeah so meaning it's it's
tapping in like 120 I believe that's the
same thing for the iPhone 10 I don't
think that that particular metric has
changed from what I'm just reading right
now I think it's the same but the the
big I was right there but the razor
thing is about this the refresh rate of
this but that would be cool to see a
screen refresh rate like that on an
iPhone because I don't you guys have
seen that razor phone screen it's pretty
well it's like an iPad pro yeah
definitely an iPad pro $759 for a new
sealed iPhone 10 64 gigabytes on eBay
right now $10 more than your iPhone 10
are and you
yeah Patrick a few time well I didn't
fire you I mean CBS right that's not my
fault
what am I looking right now at like my
iPhone storage I'm like okay which
iPhone do I need like so other things
they didn't even talk about that always
think we don't you know that are
important when you buy phone we talked
about like Apple Care iCloud never got
mentioned we still and then other things
that we did that were kind of rumor we
didn't anything about Apple TV or in the
Apple streaming service well we just
heard of Apple TV the upgrade for the
Dolby yeah that's WWDC so now this is
like yes they said that activates on
Monday of next week
CBS out yeah when they update the OS to
include support for Dolby and stuff so
the same day as middle iOS updates and
stuff going out we don't know anything
about like Apple streaming services they
know I mean that'll be its own thing I
friends countrymen people who are
watching the stream you can find out all
about streaming services on my show on
every Saturday stream economy on CNET's
YouTube channel wait I'm getting a
message from I'm watching the Twitter's
and coming in we've seeing some
celebrity spottings
in the Apple demo room well Senators
gusty senators cosine yet of course Jon
Hamm okay so Connie's Twitter I put it
in that a little chat look at not chat
it's in this or he's just standing
around with is that we this hat is
looking very authoritarian like it's
just sitting around just having a good
old chat about how he still looks really
handsome
he painted with a terrible baseball cap
and just like green khaki jacket he's
still very handsome yes yes I was
talking about Tim Cook
sorry we're gonna have that ready that's
water that's all great here we go I am
so much a Josh on CNET live says who
needs over 500 gigabytes on their phone
if you are reading everyone I eventually
okay so this isn't an ID he's my macbook
pro uh let's find out how much I'm
really running out of storage every day
I log in and it tells me that I have
like no like 9 gigabytes left I have
what is this a 1 terabyte a little
storage let me check no sorry it's only
this is only a 512 gig hard drive right
I have 8 gigabytes left and I've had
this for less than a year like that and
like I use a lot of stuff videos okay
and then we are waiting to hear from
Connie who is going to call in hopefully
from somewhere outside the demo room
just gonna call in on skype to have a
little bit of a day brief which is she's
also tweeting yes she's stalking John
Hanning all the celebrity shots right I
have a little bit of breaking news
coming from this is where you bury your
bad news
oh and Google has done so right now at
12:02 so less than 10 minutes ago
announced they will be sun setting in
box and focusing on Gmail inbox at the
end of March 2019 it feel like we
thought we that was coming given the
whole Gmail redesign and inbox hasn't
been touched for many many yeah I mean
my Google+ but yes we need 500 gigabytes
I mean I do at least many people don't
maybe that's that's why don't you go but
I need minimum to five six yeah that's
like that's the base I can't this
anything less
then three I don't get out of bed for
anything less than 256 what about a for
Terry drive $85 anything with video now
then only you get the 512 but then you
have this you can do a 512 SIM card not
ridiculous if you think about it but a
phone FileMaker and you're shooting in
4k like I get it not most people do not
on a dead space on their phone but
here's the thing we were talking about
iCloud before right if we don't need
this much storage
if iCloud or another cloud service but
mostly iCloud if we took an iPhone
because it's much easier to connect
everything that way we need like a cheap
iCloud storage if they're going to do
like if we're going to talk about having
a less capacity on our phones it needs
to be cheaper than I thought but it's
not so I want my physical storage that's
that's it yes I just would like to just
see that baseline bump from five gigs to
maybe like 50 right how does it compress
I mean even 64 gigabytes especially now
with the new format that they're using
was HD if you see but I was gonna be
like even just for your iPhone backup I
don't think you could if you had a 64
gigabytes of storage filled on your
phone right the backup file would be
bigger than five days right sure it
would be and that's the thing much
bigger
yeah and power again I'm retweeting the
scene an article that says whatever
happened to apples Airport Wireless
where are you right now it's like
totally able I don't understand I don't
understand did you have any more Apple
trivia though I have one last question
it's a it's not a company when it's an
actual Apple's one how many varieties of
apples are there in the world it's a
template over 1,000 over 7500 over 5,000
or over 9,000 yeah one thousand seventy
five hundred five thousand nine thousand
I just want it should be nine thousand
so you can do that again
yeah I would vote 9000 for that but what
do you think Beach I'm gonna say over
over a thousand four thousand make me
right no matter what it is I'm sorry no
you're all wrong
there are over 7,500 different varieties
out in the world I know a lot of actual
fruit Apple trivia like Red Delicious is
the number one grown variety here in the
United States and it's also not very
most taste delicious one know that
they're wrong that is that that is a
bait and switch I named it that so you
would eat it thinking it was gonna be
good yeah yeah exactly what's your
favorite Apple Heidi Macintosh don't
joke thief don't you joke thief me know
I was hoping it was a good that was good
that's good
all right that's picking up where
there's no yeah I know that's no I
appreciate it okay let's just run Jake I
want to I want to run through some of
the specs that and Pramila glossed over
a little bit in the Keene right from yes
sighs so so tennis tennis max 2 meters
waterproof 10 R 1 meter
waterproof whatever sorry what a
resistant people get angry when we say
what a proof it's not it's what a
resistant 1 meter up to 30 minutes
they're all 30 minutes it's just the
depth that changes wireless charging I
wonder why they didn't mention that
because people would know like okay well
actually probably only us and tech
journalists and maybe some members like
some people that are really big tech
enthusiasts and Apple enthusiasts on
photography somebody who falls Mesa heel
says I think it's safe to say they
probably don't want to talk about it and
hope we forgot about it is a really cool
product that I think is once it is out
it would be a very popular thing I want
the distance charging or it's like it's
from far away
we have that really cool company that
brought in the stuff and you could see
like yeah the lights where you can see
the distance there's a throw to like the
wireless charging just put it near this
device and that would charge your stuff
like that makes that's actually wireless
a microwave my body to make sure that
it's all safe before they bring it to
market oh yeah okay that's fine I'm in
finals and stuff
I'm sorry bet you I bet you the reason
why they haven't finished like
developing it yet is because it's too
expensive the way that they want it to
work yes they know they could sell it
the way it is if they're gonna make it
for a price point between one to two
hundred dollars which i think is the way
that they were I think it's too
expensive right now yeah it's probably
gonna be like a 300 device now going
back to three weeks or four weeks to the
Samsung event when they had their own
charging pad and then there's also so
many other third-party flasher ones on
the market like crazy knockoff cheap
ones yeah you can get
I bought a 3d printed like so I got a
model three earlier this year and it
didn't have because the production of
the car was finalized before last year's
iPhone event they didn't have wireless
charging because they they didn't know
and so I got you know I get the car and
it's like oh here's how to plug in your
like chargers and like it's hidden and
it looks really cool I was like I don't
want this
but there's this company called Jetta
and they made these like really nice
wireless charging pads that literally
just replaced the little pad that you
would put your phone on and it works
awesome like it's super good it's like
it's a hot take a hard bucks hey my live
stream from the inside the demo oh great
that's a tenner okay so he's the senior
batter so a tenner can hear the ding can
you please find jon hamm the Steve Abid
from the audience there yeah by the way
whether wait for the shot plugging
Ashley's video there's a great video you
got picking up your model 3 and driving
at home I do I love that video thank you
I don't have a model 3at probably one
get one for a while I would love to get
one but it made me just so happy I
picked it up I rode tripped at home from
the Fremont factory I picked it up fresh
fresh out the factory mint fresh the
video is great I like it a lot it's nice
we might do a little
because I want to do like sort of a
Turner diary yeah I've had it for three
and a half months now let me explain
what's happening so camera guys are
actually like shooting video now so
that's why getting our b-roll to go out
of focus and they'll move around a
little bit actually shooting Beauty
shots all of our beautiful iPhone videos
that you have a live streaming backpack
and it just happens to be connected to
my TriCaster conveniently that could be
dangerous to anything anything creepy
happens so that's the ten are actually
so here's the thing it's actually
heavier than the 10s heavier it weighs
more with the screen the screen yeah it
weighs more that's a little bit slightly
bigger and then the 10s max is seven
point three four ounces or 208 grams
something like that weight could feel
like like like going back to actually is
like a reference earlier like when you
pick up like a like a camera just feel
that density that's not a bad thing yeah
I definitely want to see what it does
feel like in the hand I mean we know
what the 5.8 kind of feels like and it's
heavy yeah the 10s max is a little
heavier than that and we can see it
right now side by side we'd be it looks
like that's the tennis and the tennis
yeah the one on the right that's much
too much that's a Scott Stein hand it is
plus thing where it does the
split-screen fur yes so that's one of
the things they were showing in the demo
they showed I think the calendar app
side by side I mean this is something
that I think the larger phones at least
in the calendar app have been able to do
but I want to see what extra things that
can do on the max that's our phone lag
that's that's connection lag on our
parts this f.y.i
the matrix is not glitching yeah it's
just see black cats run by the yeah we
should be concerned but the I mean look
OLED screens look gorgeous on any device
OLED is it's a better it's a better
screen technology too
better display technology in my opinion
it uses less battery you get those
really deep blacks because each
individual pixel is not on so you're not
you know you're not using battery power
like I mean obviously it's it's gorgeous
and other OLED screens that are Android
that are powered by Android look just as
beautiful like these are all beautiful
screens and they'll have the only other
thing that they're different tunings of
stuff like Apple that found a nice
warmth warm tunings like 110 Serena B
I'm sure these are fun gonna be tuned
just fine definitely and actually Scott
has just posted his first look from
inside the the demo room looking at the
10s the 10r and the tennis max is on
YouTube it's on YouTube let's pull it up
let's watch it he's just taking us on a
walk through nice big boring video it's
a video with a new video so you don't
have to leave the livestream to watch it
we can show it's gonna well a little
crappy because I'm playing it from a
computer that's not that's very matter
of you it's like we we forgive you live
stream within a live stream yeah yeah
well we are waiting oh yeah total I mean
I'm triple streams look guys I'm
shameless if I can get more people to
watch my show I will take it watch it
it's all but it's all geek pop-culture
like I'm pretty sure this week we're
gonna talk about Henry Cavill not be in
Superman anymore what nope oh that's
needs to make the rumor that's the rumor
but we're gonna talk about more than we
do deep dives now so instead of three
topics we do one main topic and we
really dive into it so last week we did
who is Captain Mark Steyn and to the
Oppo demo room is that livestream
inception I am Scott Stein and you're
gonna take a walk with me to the Apple
demo room this is what it's like to exit
to Steve Jobs theater and actually go to
the demo room
this is what we do every year this year
Apple design a couple of new iPhones
three of them iPhone 10s iPhone 10's max
- 10 our watch and we are in the holding
area well that's going in a sack and
there's also the Apple watches they
feature is that it gets into Excel it
gets into ECG so tiny dancer will dip
out of this and come back yeah oh this
is live right now here's some pictures
that's a detail got to get your grasp
pictures in guy always have they always
use the best photos and that's just me
is hanging out in the Pacific Ocean I
had dreads other beautiful people
spotted at talking to Tim Cook Karlie
Kloss who does the a lot of coding
initiative she's a supermodel who does a
lot of coding initiatives and also Naomi
Campbell one of the greatest supermodels
of all time just you know rubbin elbows
rubbin elbows she's trying to figure out
if she can throw this cell phone at
somebody that is a very small Venn
diagram watching this Apple event who
who have deep knowledge of Naomi
Campbell events and who love the iPhone
it was very I'm like a party of one in
that Venn diagram - maybe - yeah look at
the apps is still his video really like
the lack of bezels look really
impressive actually in this footage it
is a nice it's a nice looking watch I
think it's definitely improved looks
wise even though it's an around watch
face it's getting closer it's so
interesting to me how the look and feel
of the device changes so much based on
the color like oh yeah and and the
material actually yeah like so this
silicon band with the with the aluminum
case is like so bubbly sporty looking
and then you literally go right next to
it and you've got this like steel with
the really beautiful like machined band
and metal band stuff that and it looks
so much different yeah like I I'm always
I'm always impressed by that I will say
that it's still not enough for me to go
it's worth to mention that he also shot
all of this on his iPhone 10 yes one
from last year so all this video is
coming from his iPhone tanga see I don't
think we got like a real pro camera in
there yet when he did that before they
allowed cameras it's the demo err err is
interesting because it looks like it's
just next door to the theatre or just
maybe underneath or something like that
it definitely is a big space but I am
pretty sure knowing Apple in previous
events is probably not that many devices
around so there's surely everyone's
scrambling for like 5 or 6 phones and
then maybe some Apple employees and
through the walkthrough yeah doing a
walk through the gold yeah that's an
interesting color looks the same as the
wood finish on the table Justin not
lighting anyway Wow look how many people
sky blue that's the same as the 5c one
their colors I'm glad to see them back
to be honest because that was a thing
that I like that coral is that coral
yeah stay in the house coral I want them
to bring back through some you know the
ads they did within the 5 say in the ads
with multiple colors and stir yeah
remember those they had like this little
mesh rubbery or silicone cases because I
see the back color and and yeah it was
like that weird transparent or
translucent case like that was really
cool yeah maybe there's something like
that on the store now I know maybe we
should do a deep diving oh yeah probably
probably at least that anyway we are
waiting for Kony to give us a cool but I
don't know I'm not sure she just seems
to be pretty deep I think she's a little
John how she's found Johnny I've she's
found
Namie Campbell she's having a mini John
look Scott is back working on changing
the depth of the of the portrait mode
which is a new feature I really do like
the selective aperture I know I didn't
talk about that before but the fact that
it tells you what aperture you're
stopping up or down to that is really
cool
is it this I know it's on the rear
camera is it also on the front face well
he just took a selfie but I don't know
if it's a selfie was from the rear
camera that's right but I it's really
impressive though yeah it looks like a
selfie that what kind of looks like a
selfie angle and pose in everything
mm-hmm well he's doing the the different
lighting mode so like the stage lighting
in the contour lighting so that's
something that's actually in the current
phones at the moment I think I chose how
I feel it's fine I mean let's not make
no mistake Apple is gonna sell a lot of
phones this is a very safe play as we've
discussed before there's nothing out of
the ordinary here I think this is
definitely something that people that
are from the iPhone 6 iPhone 7s are
looking to upgrade this is their year
this is the phone they're taking the
leap there may be the 10 was too out
there and they weren't ready to upgrade
from a home button to another phone like
the 8 with another home button knowing
that the 10 was out there so I think
this is a good compromise for them yeah
it's an expensive compromise but then
again Apple is definitely showing time
and time again that that's the direction
in which they're moving their products
towards expensive compromise compromise
so there's so much courage you guys um
Scott Stein Senator Scott has tweeted
iPhone 10's max hand feel seems very
plus like so if you're used to holding a
plus in your hand that's what it feels
like I have to say just like one of the
things I really really appreciate today
was that there was not missing features
that they're the same phone yeah because
this was the thing that I I mean maybe
that the max has more battery life a
little more battery life that's fine but
they are the same device I don't have to
get a 6.5 inch screen to be able to get
all the features that I want I can still
stay with this size iPhone which is what
I wanted this is to me this is like the
perfect size iPhone 5.8 amen amen
I don't have to get a huge ridiculous
honkin iPhone two of them one for work
one for orbit I guess now I have a dual
SIM stuff Isom but um but yeah I don't
like I don't want to carry that around I
don't want it aren't even up stuff too
many things but I mean it's 30 minutes
more battery life enough for you know
something to be like five days more
battery life and then maybe it would
last me one day like a normal person it
might last two days but for me it would
be one day yeah just once one whole day
well you know mine somehow lost a day as
soon as I say this though it's gonna
drop it up yeah I'm gonna get - my best
friend my best friend away so he's like
I don't I don't know what you're doing
to your phone because mine lasts all day
usually have like you know 20 30 40
percent charge by the end today I'm like
you're like what am I doing wrong but
then I was like a big again like I just
avoid my screen time usage I know I
don't want to know it's a lot don't look
at it it's it's a lot I turn mine off
just for that exact fact yeah anyway so
let's wrap up exactly what we saw today
we saw three new iPhones we saw the 10s
the 10s Macs and also the 10r that's
seven hundred and $49 phone available in
a couple of different colors hina
reminiscent of the 5c colors we kind of
like the candy bar kind of style colors
there we also saw the Apple watch series
four and that comes with an ECG sensor
built-in sorry basically so you can get
details about the electrical activity
happening in your heart so you can
detect things potentially like atrial
fibrillation and with that was about it
you know it has of hardware that was
that was it we saw no air power we saw
no iPads no iPad pros no MacBooks no
home pod meanie no Apple TV and we
definitely didn't see what was the one
that I'm missing the Mac Mini we didn't
say Mac mean we didn't see a really
really cheap iPhone instead the iPhone
seven and the eight were discounted to
around four to five hundred dollars so
all in all I think it was a very very
safe Apple event um no huge surprises
especially from all those leaks no
surprises so all that's left to do I
guess you guys wait for the devices to
go on sale which is happening on the
pre-orders are on the 14th
and then the final devices are gonna be
available on the week after the 14th so
let me check my day I don't wanna get
that wrong the 21st the 21st of
September and then the 10r is gonna be
available in October
to sum up how do you guys feel about
today's event
it's a it was it was a fine at a quid
event I think my favorite part was right
the beginning when Tim controlled us
with his tweet I think that was he said
a very high bar that was no that was not
crossed for the rest of the event very
high bar I think I think there's a lot
of good hardware I'm going to send you
an email by the way after this I don't
you never read it but I'm gonna be like
hey Tim I just want to say I did it at
him like this is brilliant but I think
we saw like a lot of good hardware but
again there's nothing groundbreaking or
revolutionary no on the flip side and
the colors are pretty exciting in the R
it depends how you look at it see
they're very expensive cheap phone or a
discounted last year package iPhone 10 I
don't know how about that are we
officially saying our IP to headphone
jacks I think we are now hardly knew you
so no more headphone jack next event
it's gonna be no more home button it's
just gonna have to go her it's gonna
have to go that's it bye no no we know
Craig federighi gonna see him oh we
didn't know he's usually some guy right
there maybe another Apple event I'll try
them out for more devices they'll be
more to buy my books more things happen
it'll fly a minute semantics anyway
