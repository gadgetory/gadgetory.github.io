to the Apple buy for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple and let's
start off with the latest iPhone news
and rumors that surely you are sick of
at all by now a new poll conducted by
online magazine quartz found that only
10% of US iPhone owners would be likely
or very likely to upgrade if there is no
design change now the poll only surveyed
525 us iPhone owners but it also found
that 25% of people would be very or
extremely interested to upgrade with a
redesign now iPhone sales have dropped
in the first quarter of 2016
they're expected to sink again in the
second quarter and the general feeling
is that people with a 6s or even a6 will
be waiting for the 10th anniversary
iPhone instead now that's what I've been
telling you for months but I will buy
one because Apple bite all right a bleak
sand on Leafs Twitter accounts are
teaming up on you info for the next
iPhone Evan blast claims two models are
coming in 2016 like we've been expecting
and not three they are internally
codenamed Sonora and dospollos two
cities in California on leaks also says
it's almost almost 100 percent sure that
the iPhone 7 will bring an improved
battery with 1960 milliampere hours
versus the iPhone 6s is 1715 so you lose
the headphone jack
you'll need a dongle for it but you'll
get more battery life now I'm actually
ok with this in theory but it's not like
you'll be getting a significant increase
in that battery life but what about you
all it's a slightly better battery a
good enough trade-off for losing the
headphones for you I want to see what
the Apple buy nation thinks about it so
post it down here in the comments
because I read them all and what about
those potential wireless earbuds from
Apple a trademark application for air
pods was made back in September of last
year by a company called entertainment
in flight LLC and Delaware now Apple has
used this strategy in the past to hide
what it's been up to with the iPad and
carplay and even the iWatch which ended
up not being used now this week the
trademark was amended and signed for by
a man named Jonathan Brown which is
pretty generic
except that Apple employs an attorney by
the name of Jonathan Brown and MacRumors
has found that it's the same person so
be on the lookout for those air pods
they're coming in I'm buying those two
also if you're still thirsty for iPhone
7 stuff anything you can get feast your
eyes on this video from my relatives in
China
featuring an up-close look at the one
hundred and fifty dollar iPhone 7
mock-ups that are already available in
China now it features the updated design
that removed the antenna lines a larger
camera lens and a lightning port at the
bottom with no headphone jack and if
you're wondering yes that's my sister
you see the hair it runs in the family
okay Apple is released the third beta
for all the developer versions of their
new OS is including iOS 10 TV OS watch
o'the trace and yes Mac o Sierra oh you
thought mac o s-- was coming back now i
can't give them to you every time now
iOS 10 gets the most obvious tweaks you
can set your touch ID button to unlock
your screen by resting your finger on it
just like iOS 9 the lock screen has a
new sound when you press it and your
phone gives you haptic feedback when you
do that as well but the biggest
improvement according to MacRumors hopi
Mongo is working properly with beta 3
yes and sidenote Pokemon go is getting
so crazy now there's a Pokemon dating
service called pokey dates see you
answer some questions post your schedule
where you'll be not creepy and then
they'll match you up I've also been told
the number one pick-up line for pokey
dates is can I throw my balls at you an
Apple TV continues to get more apps
updated with its Universal search for
Siri vh1 MTV and Comedy Central now have
the ability to show up in search results
when someone is looking for really
quality programming and ass show me Love
&amp;amp; Hip Hop
alright Apple continues to release new
shot on iphone commercials on its
YouTube page two new ones feature
wildlife like an ant crawling across the
sand really dramatically or this fun one
of a chipmunk stuffing a shelled peanut
into his mouth
that's so funny now it really inspired
me to see what I could find in the wild
oh I call that two dogs humping all
right that's gonna do it for this week's
show I'm off to comic-con you see right
here so if you're gonna be there I'll be
there say hi and let's be friends you
can always email us at the Apple bite at
cnet.com or tweet me and Brian Tong

catch you all next time for another bite
