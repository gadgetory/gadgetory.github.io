to the apple byte for everything good
and bad inside the world of Apple now
I'm in Hawaii right now getting my tan
on a whole lot of good coming my way and
it looks like a whole lot of good coming
soon for the Apple by nation because
we're breaking down everything you can
expect to see at Apple's spring-ford
event on monday marks the 9th at ten
a.m. pacific time now the obvious
no-brainer is that will finally find out
the pricing for all the Apple watch
models we pretty much know the Apple
watch sport will start at 349 and that's
probably just for the smaller thirty
eight millimeter design apple said so so
let's peg the 42 millimeter Apple watch
sport at 399 but after that what will we
see the stainless steel one go for you
know I'm dreaming they keep it at 499
but the guess I'm going for is that
Apple will push it to 549 and 599 just
because now there's also a lot of
guesses that are putting the 18 karat
gold apple watch edition at anywhere
from five thousand dollars to 10,000 or
even higher Apple's even prepping retail
stores with specialized safes to hold
them and scales to weigh them if someone
returns one and tries to remove some of
its gold content it's just too scary to
guess this one so we're gonna put them
at 5k + for our pricing guesses but if
you really want to go all out with the
bling-bling the luxury and tech
modification company brick has announced
their line of luxe watches that are
pimped out Apple watches now they range
from a single row of diamonds at half a
carat to a fully emblazoned 12 carat
diamond Omni edition that will cost up
to 75 thousand dollars it's the watch
for the point 1 percenters will also get
more details about the Apple watch we
know what it looks like and we know some
of the things that can do but we haven't
truly seen it in action now we expect to
see features they've been keeping under
wraps like the ability to control your
Apple TV they briefly showed us how the
watch can act as a viewfinder for your
camera so you won't have to rely on
strangers taking horribly framed or
blurry pictures for you which is about
ninety percent of the time there's also
a walkie-talkie feature that to Apple
watch users with iPhones can use for
that Dick Tracy quick style conversation
and if you thought blue tools we're
annoying it's going to look weird if
you're talking to your wrist like a spy
you know actually now that I think about
it yeah I want to talk into my wrist
like a spy now we expect to see even
more than this and a deeper dive of the
features we already know about as for an
official release date macrumors sources
believe the release will happen in the
beginning of april instead of the end
Apple is planning to begin moving Apple
watch inventory to centralize
distribution points in the US during the
first few days of the month with a
release possibly coming during the first
week of April between the 6th and the
10th that's just a few days after my
birthday so feel free to send one my way
now what else did we expect to see
macbooks that's right timing would
suggest the rumored macbook air 12-inch
with Retina display will be unveiled but
we don't know this for sure or a refresh
to the macbook air line across the board
or both but I guarantee we'll definitely
see something new with apple's laptop
line specifically because they've
invited seen its own dan ackerman our
mac and laptop editor to be in
attendance at the spring forward event
they've done this in the past so really
it's a no-brainer now for the 12 inch
retina air all rumors have pointed to a
new design that's even thinner than the
current airs a fanless design retina
display the new broadwell chipset a
redesigned a buttonless trackpad and a
reversible USB port for connectivity
this is a product I'm personally excited
on seeing myself now that's a lot of
stuff already and I don't expect them to
pack that much more in but what are some
of the sleepers that we might see what
about Apple's beats music service it's
been six months since their acquisition
a recent report says they've hired the
BBC's number one DJ Zane Lowe who could
be doing some content or will Apple
actually have a live radio station as
part of the service we still don't know
anything really about it reports say
Apple has been eyeing to make it a five
dollar monthly service but somewhere
under the 999 price point of their
competitors I'm hoping we hear something
it doesn't mean we will but it's still
Spotify and Pandora
are dominating the streaming music
services also I don't think we'll see
anything in the form of the ipad pro the
Apple product that I'm the most excited
for because of how I use my iPad it
really deserves its own event and is
more likely coming with an entire iPad
line refresh and Apple TV fans we still
won't see anything until we hear real
news that Apple is locked down the
proper content deals to create its own
ala carte service sling TV has done it
with our $20 internet web TV service
Apple still isn't there yet but my
friend no-show Tongass and I still
believe it's coming this year why yes
yes it's not a song it's going to be a
fun event and there's a lot of growing
hype around the Apple watch but I'm
still not high on the watch I've said
this over and over the past year I'll be
getting one to use and try out I know
I'm going Apple watch stainless steel
back with a link bracelet because come
on that looks pretty sick but they are
really going to have a hard time
convincing me that I need one that it
will make me replace my current watch
and that I'll wear it and charge it
every day alright that's going to do it
for this week you can always email us at
the apple byte at cnet com or tweet me
at brian Tong and tell me why you think
the apple watch will be a success I'll
flop or somewhere in between thanks for
watch it will catch you all next time
for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
