programs and which Hollywood Chris rules
them all well hey what's going on
everybody welcome to nope sorry the
debate show where I Jeff Bakalar debate
my friends and colleagues over three
rounds of dead serious discourse I'm
fully prepared to lose friends over this
nonsense
joining us today Sadie Dennis from TV
Guide what's going on Sadie
not on I'm ready to destroy you that's
comforting who's gonna be our judge for
this program today us well it's none
other than Liam Matthews what's going on
Liam how are you sustained
overruled you're taking the judging
thing way too seriously and now I'm also
realizing that I've once again screwed
myself by picking two people that work
for a company that is not mine and I am
at a disadvantage I just need to get
that out of the way to start here's how
the game works
Sadie and I will debate for three rounds
whoever makes the best case each round
will get some of the five points or
hopefully all the five points that are
up for grabs Liam's gonna sign the
points I have no shot at winning let's
start the first topic now what is it
Liam so Netflix has more original
content than anyone could watch if they
live for a hundred years and they keep
adding more and more are there too many
shows on Netflix you have 90 seconds on
the clock go okay Netflix obviously has
too many programs too much original
content on its platform it is getting
ridiculous there's so many goddamn shows
they're starting to cancel the good ones
like American vandal and maybe Netflix
maybe every now and then you say no to
somebody maybe you don't let every
asshole over the script and a camera to
make a show stop green lighting
everybody what are you doing all the
good stuff is falling through the cracks
it's a bit it's it's obvious I don't
understand why you have to it's not like
fishing you don't feel like cast out a
huge net and hopefully you like scrape
up a breaking bed while you're dragging
the whole lake through the whole process
it's nonsense
stop saying yes to everybody Netflix you
got too many goddamn shows who the hell
is gonna watch all that Netflix
absolutely does not have too many shows
their historic life
is bleeding right now without them
producing more original content they're
not gonna have a Netflix anymore do you
want to get rid of Netflix cuz that's
what you're saying
everyone's launching their own streaming
service Netflix needs to build up their
original library and yes some of those
shows are gonna be duds but like their
shows have always kind of been bad like
house of cards was never great think of
it like a numbers game like the more
shows they produce the more good shows
they're gonna make and Netflix isn't
about like the big mainstream appeal
it's about nish appeal so most of these
shows probably won't be for you but that
means they're gonna be targeted to all
these different specific demos and that
means that they can also invest in these
little shows that otherwise wouldn't be
getting renewed like one day at a time I
I don't know I just feel like how many
people are watching some of these shows
okay Liam that was a heated debate I'm
sweating just a tiny bit how did that
shake out in your opinion well Sadie is
right about nish appeal but you are
right that there are too many shows so I
award three points to Jeff and two
points to Sadie okay I respect your
decision those okay grudgingly accept
that okay fair enough that's your
opinion
round two Sadie will be going first Liam
what's the topic so TV ratings are
declining every year as streaming
services become more and more prevalent
do you need cable in 2019 absolutely not
there are way cheaper and more
customizable options you can do services
like DirecTV or subscribe to networks
like FX or an see if you want their
content or just get Hulu for $12 a month
you get their streaming library original
shows current shows old shows and no ads
that's already better than cable plus
for $40 you can get DVR and live TV the
cheapest the cheapest optimum package is
$60 you get so much more with Hulu no
but I think you can get like all the
premium cable in it it's so much easier
and you can watch these on your TV your
computer your tablet you can watch this
anywhere cable it's not that convenient
to watch on the go or in bed like
there's no reason
have it if you have like Hulu or FX plus
or all of these other options look I
understand what you're saying and that's
fine that sounds it a little like
commercial but will disregard that I am
someone who doesn't actually have cable
but I still think there's reasons for
cable this year and moving forward live
television that is a huge deal and if
you're like me and if you like sports
I'm a die-hard hockey person if I wasn't
able to watch hockey live I don't know
what I would do Hulu is live TV they
know the real stuff doesn't work that
well they don't play nice together
there's still this legacy of like
garbage where you still have to buy a
cable subscription for regional sports
and then what about like award shows
like you know the Oscars if you're if
you're late on Twitter to that you're in
trouble no one watches those anyway
you're not wrong okay Liam what do you
think about that round Jeff you said you
don't have cable
I I write but like it's not about you
know you got to make the best case for
the topic you have like five points to
say t oh man oh that was crazy
no one's ever done five to zero you are
bad he's a good case Hulu had live TV
yeah but it's a different live TV Thank
You Bryan seven two three is now the
score I basically have to like smoke you
this round
alright here's gonna be a weird one
Liam's gonna introduce the round we are
going to preemptively tell you what
we've chosen before we get to the debate
so Liam why don't you introduce this
final round man I got all dude five
nothing Oh TV Guide is doing a thing
called the 12 days of Christmas where we
celebrate all the Hollywood Chris's now
the four most important Chris's are
Pratt pine Evans and
Hemsworth each of you pick your Chris
there are 90 seconds on the clock
alright so before we go I will be
choosing the best Chris the Pratt
variety and who is your Chris obviously
a pine
obviously pine okay I guess we'll get
the 90 seconds on the clock and here we
go okay I dare you to find a more
lovable Chris a more likeable Chris sure
perhaps he is imperfect but he can he
can do many roles he can be tough guy
super hunky guy or he could be a comedy
darling
like he portrayed in in Parks and Rec
sure mistakes were made of the Jurassic
variety and you know who you showed me a
perfect person and I'll show you I'll
show you a perfect fortune and his name
is Chris Pine we can do it all he's hot
he's funny he's woke he's smart he can
sing he's the most versatile actor he'll
do wet hot American summer and hell or
high water he'll do Angie Tribeca and
Zia for Zechariah like Chris Pine is the
most versatile Chris like the Chris's
represents sameness but pine is distinct
he was caftans he was a flip phone
that's lame Chris Pratt is objectively
the worst he brags about eating the
happiest lambs on the planet he had to
apologize to his hearing-impaired fans
for an insensitive like post on
Instagram his dog was found emaciated
wandering the streets like he's out of
touch he said that there are no blue
color films in Hollywood Pratt isn't
passengers Chris Pine will wear win an
Oscar pine for ever Chris Chris Pratt
sucks who can talk to Raptors that's the
dumbest ever seen that movie sucks
Sadie should win this round you know you
made a very compelling emotional case
Sadie gave very good facts but I didn't
feel it in the same way but the facts
don't lie I got to give four points to
Sadie one point two Jeff all right at
least I didn't get shut out again so
four to one that makes the final score
11 to 4 CD Guinness this has been a
pleasure
III would
pleasure losing to you all I can say is
that you are the winner of this Oh God
okay so this week you get a very
authentic musical washboard I'm unsure
how you use such a thing this is not
musical at all nevertheless that is your
gift to take home and mount on your on
your wall thank you so very much to say
to Guinness thank you so very much to
Liam Matthews thank you for TV Guide for
lending us these fine people we will be
back next week with a brand new show if
you have an idea then I should debate
next week please do yourself a favor and
leave that in the comment section below
Chris Pratt sucks that's all I can say
Sadie had it right i gracefully bow out
of this one we'll see you next time
