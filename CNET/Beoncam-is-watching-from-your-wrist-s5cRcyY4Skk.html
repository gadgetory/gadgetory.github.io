camera is the one that's with you but
what if that camera is on your wrist
this is the beyond can a wearable 360
camera that sits on a wristband just
like a watch and it tells the time so I
guess it's a watch too but you don't
have to wear it just on your wrist
there's accessories like a handlebar
mount and helmet clip or you can just
walk around with it in your hand to
point and shoot there are three buttons
for recording picture taking and power
and the company promises three hours of
recording time on one charge you can see
a live view of what's going on through
the app and trigger the camera remotely
with a phone flip between the raw equi
rectangular spherical or wide-angle
options to get different views so I've
been wearing the camera as a watch on
this wristband for a little while now
it's very chunky I found that when I'm
wearing a jacket or anything with long
sleeves I have to pull the sleeve all
the way back otherwise it gets in the
vision of the camera and also there is
one big problem I know this is a
prototype so hopefully they'll fix it
however the watch itself does not lock
in properly onto the wristband so I have
dropped this accidentally a lot of times
it's forward off the wristband and it's
pretty precarious so please I hope that
they put a locking mechanism on the
final version video quality looks good
on the phone screen but export it to a
computer and it's not all that clear the
resolution is pretty limited at just
1000 by 1000 pixels recording a square
video image at 25 frames a second stills
are 5 megapixels but the real question
is do you really want a 360-degree
camera on your wrist the make is
certainly hot so right now this is a
prototype but will go into production
with successful crowdfunding and
hopefully they can iron out some of the
quirks
