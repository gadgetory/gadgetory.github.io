counterfeit brake caliper cracks during
a hard stop or an airbag doesn't deploy
or does like a bond instead of a penalty
one of the most ominous things about
poorly made counterfeit parts posing as
genuine is that they likely evaded all
testing by posing as an original that
was tested and basically getting a pass
even legit low-cost alternative parts
are tested now of course automakers and
even junkyards have a vested interest in
you buying genuine parts because that's
what they sell in one form or another
this is a Honda airbag and this is not
but the government agencies that
intercept and monitor these things are
ringing alarm bells going so far as to
suggest you contact the FBI
if you suspect you've been sold
counterfeit car parts you don't need to
be a shade tree mechanic to spot them
be wary of too-good-to-be-true prices
it's one thing to get a seventeen dollar
macbook charger this is different
steer away from that guy who approaches
you in a parking lot to fix your car I
shouldn't need to tell you that
be wary of parts purchased online that
ship from distant countries especially
countries that aren't feeling in the car
business and look for typos on the box
motor craft and Delphi never misspell
their own name it pays to do a quick
double check on the likelihood that
you're buying a cheap fake it will
damage more than your ego when it
reveals itself more realities of modern
driving revealed now at CNET on cars.com
