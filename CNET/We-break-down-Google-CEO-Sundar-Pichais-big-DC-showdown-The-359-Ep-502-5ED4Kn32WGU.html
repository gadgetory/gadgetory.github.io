Joanie Saltzman Google CEO sundar Pichai
appeared before the House of
Representative to talk about well all
things but mostly about political bias I
spent three and a half hours testifying
and we covered all three and half hours
of it
anything for you that stood out Joan
Google and YouTube have very clear
policies they're clearly defined and we
publish them right you know that but
like other than that that the fact that
he said on multiple occasions that
there's no political ideology that goes
into their their algorithms you know the
we thought that maybe this session would
be a chance for Congress to kind of
delve in a bunch of actually important
topics like personal data collection
what's happening in China and there was
some of it but it felt like it was still
dominated by this political bias
question I windows issues that are more
relevant maybe to mainstream consumers
hmm um a lot of times it's handed handle
didn't up really ham-fisted way like
with personal data collection yes when
congressman asked about it they don't
realize that Google doesn't make iPhones
right there we're seeing some clip of
congressman ted poe holding up his
iphone and like demanding that's enough
which i tell him if he could be tracked
location-wise if he walks 20 feet across
the aisle part of the problem in what
allowed to DiNardo kind of dodge the
question was he was holding up an iphone
which google doesn't make and yes if if
that phone had google apps then yes he
his location would be tracked but sundar
was able to kind of darn it it kind of
shows that like when they're asking
these questions is not being that savvy
about it yeah you need to have very
tactical surgical smart questions for
somebody as smart as the shy to really
answer them and very few people are on
this panel and yeah and not just search
of the questions would be able to follow
up with that with a good response
because i think yeah there were a couple
of times where I noticed the
representatives had pointed questions
that were clearly prepped for them right
and when sundar serve offered up the
response there was no fault to it yeah
there was no there's no way to could it
be critical about it it's a good point
look there's uh those law back and forth
about the political bias was it ted Lieu
from california sort of called this a
giant waste of time
basically said if you want positive
results do positive things which
generally that's that's good advice on
life we should do more positive things
and then well I guess you know some of
the stuff that we actually did learn
about was a little bit from China right
yeah mostly evaded questions said that
you know there are no plans to launch in
China but we did get some details more
than a hundred people had worked on the
product that way and it's interesting
that when pressed to commit on whether
or not they would outright dismiss was a
censorship and surveillance of users hmm
he denied he just said like we'd be open
to engaging with people he didn't
actually say you wouldn't like make that
hard line in the sand saying that's a
line we won't go yeah I just noticed
like he kind of had he would go back to
that line to get away from any questions
that were particularly pointed now do
you remember from when Sheryl Sandberg
was testifying before Congress I
remember she made a sort of a definitive
statement about activities in China do
you recall what that was I don't I
remember it was kind of like the
question was posed a little differently
it was like would you participate in
China under the circumstances that exist
now and her answer was no yes that's not
how they put it to sundar no and I think
that's how I was able to get out of that
crown and again speaks to the the kind
of level of tech savvy right like no one
really followed up on that like well you
actually answer the question but yeah it
was uh between that and I guess the
personal data it just seemed like we
didn't get a lot out of 3.5 hours no I
mean anything any other surprises for
you any I mean I agree with uh with
representative Lu that a lot of it did
feel like a big waste of time yeah it
just it was a little frustrating cuz it
felt like congressman after congressman
who wanted to talk about the political
bias thing we're like I know you're
saying this stuff but I don't really
believe you I'm just gonna and I'm gonna
keep asking you the same question there
were a couple of congressmen that just
sort of like shouted in this guy they
didn't ask any questions they just
ranted for their allotted five minutes
which is always gonna happen in these
grandstanding sort of hearings but it's
helpful if they're grandstanding isn't
like butting up against incompetence
about the subject matter right right the
reality of the situation right all right
that's that's it for us thankfully it's
over more coverage check us out a scene
I'm Roger Chang I'm Joey Sullivan thanks
for listening as always thanks for
joining us for the recording of the
audio podcast you can subscribe to us
using the links below now is the time to
go ahead and send in your questions and
comments any er thoughts and emotional
takeaways from today's very in-depth
session no but to be honest a lot of
people have a lot of let's call it clout
in this game being that it is heavily
politically charged don't you know don't
hold back we want to hear what you think
for one I thought that he was I'm gonna
go ahead and take it from my perspective
which is like composition and video
playback so he was more composed than
Zuckerberg and they think they treated
him more like an adult that way I'm
gonna go ahead and put that one out
there yeah I mean his responses were
definitely more there was more finesse
to it there was an opposed like you he
clearly prepared for this
I think sundar at least from the
interactions I've seen with him in
public I mean he's just generally a bit
more composed he's like a better public
speaker than Chuck is so there's less of
that yeah I mean he answers the
questions the way I mean boy I would
really want him to answer yes exactly
didn't offer up too much information he
he kind of knew when to dodge I'll get
back to you or I'll have my team get
back to you yeah always very polite
there was that one inner that one
exchange where it kind of was the most
tense you remember that near like the
the notion of the Latino voter right
basically the one of the representatives
had asked about his represent Jordan who
asked about correct yet the issue of
getting the voter the Latino vote out in
three in these states three key state
three key states wording from an email
by a Google
yes who's like as you pointed out
probably having the worst day ever right
that's like the last thing you want to
do is have your name appear in that
context during a congressional hearing
yeah the idea that like yeah we got
folks out we we change the algorithms
which we added new features to allow
voters to either get to the polls easier
or actually pay for some of the
transportation in these 3k it's three
key states and like the representative
made the point like taking out those
three words like everything else seemed
fine those good corporate citizenship
but then when you when you are being
selective about what states you're
you're going after that's when you kind
of get in trouble it implies it implies
the possibility that that person had
political bias yes
yeah and cenar like he was fairly quick
to deny that this was a Google thing he
was the least composed when he struggled
the most to come up with a way to answer
it that I know I would probably have
struggled there I definitely think his
Mo's or the least compose moment was Poe
when he couldn't even fathom how to
answer that question and to be fair
neither could I 120 feet over here he
was Google no I walked 20 feet over here
definitely knew the answer that question
but the fact that he held up his iPhone
definitely gave him opened the door for
him just basically say like I don't know
I mean it's an iPhone that's not one of
our things I mean realistically yes if
he had Google's Google Maps if you had
Gmail any number of Google services if
they're very ubiquitous on almost every
phone I mean you can't assume because
technically they're not default you're
right you'd have to install these phones
at least one of the representatives said
she didn't have any apps on her phone so
I think that was a rhetorical or
theoretical question I can't really I
can't really I don't want to assume with
any of these representatives but like if
yeah if so technically he could he like
was in the right to say like I can't
really answer because you know you're in
your testimony you don't want to make
that assumption that's what a lawyer
would tell you yeah and so I mean he did
the right thing but also the fact that
Poe holding up that iPhone just
definitely elem danced around the topic
oh yeah for sure
honestly there were a lot of really good
questions and commentary coming from the
aisle today from a few candidates whose
names are all kind of blending together
in my head right now but there really
were some fantastic grilling questions
that need to be addressed but at the
other side of it there was just a whole
myriad of grumpy grandstanding yeah
there was the one in particular I mean
there's a there's a couple but the stuff
about the political bias and then the
questioning of Google staffers for their
political bias was was calm point to me
like it it seemed like I think it was
representative king who I think had
asked basically for Google to start
investigating their employees for a
political bias which how do you do that
as a company do you like you can't you
can I mean like that's there's I think
they're literally laws okay so I don't
really know how that would have worked
in like yeah I think Congress served
once like part of Congress basically
wants Google to be this completely
sterile non-political entity but it's
made up of human beings let's say then
they need to sterilize the entire like
world they need to sterilize society
because they're they're all they're made
up of people people have their opinions
they're you know they're and they're
going to use Google and those opinions
are going to rub off essentially right
Google should be sterilized but the
search results that it returns should
not be sterilized at all in any way
especially if they have a it's like
conservative bias like we love free
speech and our search results we don't
love free speech at Google itself yeah
right as long as it doesn't interfere
with my own personal views and
perspectives right yeah free speech is
great when you agree with some of the
questions were being asked like you know
why all these negative search results in
darken ceiba if you like look at the
sort of the tenor and like how these
things are looked at actively like
there's some you know arguments made
that that negative coverage is warranted
honestly I was kind of hoping right
there that sender was gonna launch into
a two-hour tutorial on how cookies work
well he did go through a definition of
like going to the
the Trump idiot thing or someone had
asked why Trump an idiot are so linked
together and se own because trolling
yeah well no it's it's it's essentially
it's Google bombing right there if their
folks out there who can manipulate
search results by flooding the zone with
idiot post linked to Trump and that will
alter the the SEO so Trump an idiot come
up together
yeah and that shouldn't necessarily be
on the Google people be like we're not
responsible for that right exactly
that's that's what the public feedback
is now I always floors me like you know
I'm trying to come up with a good
analogy we're like okay so if a drug
dealer transports some like crack
cocaine or something like that to
somebody and then that person who uses
it dies is the taxi at fault
like right okay all right yeah I'm
working through it yeah yeah yeah I can
see that the vehicle for terrible people
should not be held accountable for
tonight I do feel like there is there is
literally to the argument that if Google
is susceptible and exposed to being
gamed in that way it has a
responsibility to fix the loopholes that
allow it to be gamed like if it's if if
their mission is to return accurate and
personally relevant information then and
there's ways that people can make sure
that they aren't then they need to fix
that problem oh sure but then someone
who's just gonna find another way to
poke a different hole in it yeah I mean
if Google doesn't do anything then
they're just as complicit right yeah
yeah there has to be a good-faith
attempt at least to to make sure all
this stuff is and biased objective yeah
although to your your taxi analogy if
the cab driver took extra money and like
continued to take extra money then they
would be liable that's a good point
fair enough fair enough so I mean no to
that analogy like if Google continues a
profit from all the right
the added engagement from negative
content you know then they're they're
just as complicit
so knee-jerk take away today how much
was theater how much was legitimate it's
like mostly theater like
percent theater mm-hmm yeah I mean it's
pretty high up there
like I said I thought some of us stuff
from China was interesting and like I
think we got like the tip of the iceberg
on a smart discussion about personal
data collection we weren't really there
I mean so much of it was so dominated by
the political bias stuff and again
there's like it's sort of a back and
forth right like Google says there
aren't and then Congress says we don't
believe you and it just it's that for
like three hours
yeah that was kind of what was
frustrating about this process because
it this really could have been an
opportunity to talk about some of the
real problems that Google faces it just
ended up being not about that yeah like
I think it would have been really
interesting as someone you know like for
example so you know push I said when
there was a discussion of conspiracy
theories on YouTube he said like it's
something that we need to work better on
you have to keep in mind we get 400
hours of content uploaded every minute a
great question I wish that someone would
ask is are you too big to even handle
the responsibility that you have like
have you created something that you
cannot control and what are the
implications of that you know yeah I
would love to hear what his answer to
that is because I don't know yeah
lawyers I'm sure he doesn't know either
he's good prepped for it either way a
good day to be Alta Vista Yahoo Bing or
DuckDuckGo never a good day to be Bing
all right fine fine fine
I heard somebody suggests that monopoly
man was a big employee was it you oh I'm
glad you mentioned that because Jay
Petrie done it is asking did we see the
monopoly me yes we did we ever yeah yes
making his second camera I think he was
at the Equifax hearing okay what I
picked I think so from context right and
then there was someone who was kicked
out for holding a sign that was like the
Google logo matched up with China yeah
yeah we caught yeah yeah it was so
anticlimactic I was expecting somebody
to be straight-up rioting yeah like the
police will take him away
there would be a lot more chaos but it
like ended so quickly that I didn't have
a chance to process it I just want to
say that China Google sign man has a
better budget for graphic design than I
do that's a nice sign right very nice
sign I was very impressed this fantastic
typography solid coloring a little bit
on the small side would been more
effective if it was you know an
oversized banner on a stick you know how
those things work but hey that was yeah
that was what I was excited to see I
could appreciate your respect for sign
craftsmanship Brian before we wrap it up
for the day our wall up is asking is
there anything that comes out of this
congressional hearing are there any
changes in business yeah no I mean like
in a perfect world the response would be
like if you know lawmakers were
unsatisfied with the answers that they
received and they should craft
legislation to fix it yeah but I mean I
mean there were some questions about
privacy like a legislation and since I
was already talked about sort of
Google's been supportive of it mostly
because they know the writings of wall
and yeah this is gonna happen there was
at least what I think only one question
on GDP are causing millions of I'm very
aware of GDP are so I mean in terms of
what will come out directly out of this
particularly like the political bias
nothing will come out of this no I think
in terms of going proceeding with the
privacy legislation and I don't know
maybe this inspires more talk about
legislation over a personal data
collection beyond beyond privacy that
that could happen too but like in terms
of anything like tangible coming out of
this no but we're probably get more of
these I mean we've had three or four
this year I have another so that was
going to be the closing concept was what
is going to be the next step
do we have anybody else on the chopping
block and what is specifically good
specifically going to be next for Google
after this I don't know who else is on
the top they've trotted out the heads of
two heads of facebook the head of
Twitter now the head of Google yeah
that's I mean a short game like Larry
Page
right yeah we're having Apple come but
apples in a different sort of an apple
right now is sort of viewed a lot more
positive yeah they're I mean they're
stuffs crazy expensive but they're you
know right now they're not being accused
of dismantling elections or the
scrutinies mostly around like social
media search results content and Apple
doesn't play in that game quite as much
right so it's been a little bit like
that but we're not gonna have a
follow-up hearing for for sundar I don't
know well I don't know have a word it's
interesting cuz it was only the House
today and the Senate didn't participate
so I'm I'm curious if the Senate gets
his turn later but so far nothing's on
the schedule so well cuz isn't that
happen isn't that how it went for Zaki
had one and then the other exactly right
and so I I'm surprised the Senate didn't
schedule something the same day or the
day after
I'm really hoping it doesn't happen
because I don't want to sit through
another three and a half hours of this
no that would be nice but I don't know
part of me thinks that maybe we won't
see it just because it's not as much of
a theater it's not as much of a circus
as Todd trotting out the boy genius you
know yeah I mean it is attractive having
the sea of Google you know they're the
answer to your questions it is but it's
not as entertaining as watching a bunch
of old cronies slap around you know
little tuck keys are covered drop out
it's luck Meister yeah well anyways
whatever does happen stay tuned to seen
it because we'll have all the updates we
will plenty of updates next couple days
but we are out of time though and thanks
