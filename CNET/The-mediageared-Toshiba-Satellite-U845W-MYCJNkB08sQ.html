twist in ultrabooks how about a super
ultra widescreen laptop the toshiba
satellite you 845 w is a new type of
ultrabook that is a strange mutation on
what we've seen before this screen has a
17 92 x 768 screen resolution which is
odd and has a 21-9 aspect ratio so your
average 13-inch laptop or Windows laptop
would have a 16-9 screen this is even
wider and for cinema scope style movies
or movies that get letterboxd you think
well this would be perfect and that's
what it's meant for to show movies
without any letterboxing combined with
some really over-the-top good Harman
Kardon speakers that are included sounds
great in theory and practice it's a
little bit of a hit and miss experience
and I'll tell you why because hey
there's no DVD drive on this laptop
there's no blu-ray drive on this laptop
that's because it's an ultrabook but
we've seen ultrabooks now with optical
drives in the last couple of months so
it's not really much of an excuse and
for this type of laptop you'd want to
pop in your cool old movies that you'd
like to see in widescreen and you can't
do that here unless you plug into DVD
drive via USB and are you really going
to do that I wouldn't so what you're
stuck with here is downloads and
streaming video now if you're
downloading a video file or able to you
know rip your own video files that you
want to put into that format that you've
recorded well then sure you can show
them off in this format streaming
depends on the service provider and how
they stream their videos I tested out on
Netflix Hulu Plus and YouTube for
instance and the results were mixed
sometimes you'd see that the video clip
would show off perfectly within its
borders other ones showed off pillar
ring or pillar boxing which is that
black bars on the sides not a surprise
if it's not a full widescreen video and
other show window boxing where the
entire video gets surrounded by an extra
container of black bars like a mat
within a mat
and that's pretty frustrating but
there's nothing you can really do a
couple of netflix movie showed that
through trailers on hulu plus and there
really isn't an easy tool on this
toshiba laptop to blow up that video to
fit the screen so you're left a little
bit between here and there but this wide
screen is also pretty good for putting
two windows that you're browsing on side
by side now it's not quite the extra
screen resolution of a 1920 x 1080 but
it's close and i found that it was great
for putting those two windows or two
word documents on one screen there's
another advantage here and that the
footprint to this laptop is really
shallow so you can fit into an airline
tray or a place that doesn't have a lot
of depth there it is long this laptop
feels a bit like a surfboard and it may
be a tight fit in some bags it's kind of
the footprint of a 15 inch or but a bit
of a sawed-off barrel here because its
top height here is actually lower than a
13-inch laptop and let's get into some
other details with that screen it's a 14
point 4 inch screen but what does that
mean really well if you use it you might
find that the text is actually coming
off a little bit small and that's
because the height on that screen is
five and three-quarters inches which is
actually a smaller screen height then
you get on a 14-inch laptop or even a
13-inch or even a 12.5 inch in fact I
held a new third gen ipad up to it and
it was about similar screen height so
imagine that ipad screen stretched out
super wide and you've kind of got what
you've got here it's a it's an odd type
of a screen it's an odd type of
terminology and that's not the same as
calling a regular 13-inch laptop of 13
inch or even a 14-inch laptop this is
its own beast and so buyer beware in
terms of that now you may get some use
out of that screen you're going to get a
lot more use out of those speakers which
sound fantastic and are the best that
I've heard on an ultrabook and the rest
of the specs in here are pretty
straightforward a 500 gigabyte hard
drive six gigs of ram a core i5 3rd gen
processor that's ultrabook and we've
seen that on a lot of laptops the
problem is you can get those specs in
other ultrabooks for about eight hundred
dollars and this is 999 so you are
paying up for the feature set here with
that wide screen and with those speakers
if this excites you will then hey
so she was made you a concept laptop and
you don't have to pay a lot of money to
get into it and the battery life is good
but on the flip side are you really
going to use this ultra wide screen and
what are you going to use it for yeah
that's the concern and certainly that's
a valid concern and how many software
programs are really going to take
advantage of that screen resolution
you're basically going to have to fit
those windows yourself I'm Scott Stein
and that's a look at the funky weird and
kind of useful toshiba satellite you 8
