differently than any iPhone before it
it's missing a home button it ditches
the fingerprint sensor and it has a new
fancy camera system but don't let that
intimidate you it's still just as easy
to use once you get the basics down here
are some tips and tricks to help ease
you into your new iPhone 10 unlocking
your phone with your face sounds crazy
but it's not face ID is impressively
simple fast and reliable once you take
the time to set it up pick the phone up
swipe up from the bottom of the screen
and face ID will recognize your face and
unlock almost instantly no home button
no problem swipe here and a swipe there
is all you need to know and here are the
most important so I popped from the
bottom of the screen to return home
swipe left and right along the bottom to
quickly change apps I swipe up and pause
or a swooping swipe up and right from
the bottom reveals the app switcher and
finally swiping down from the top left
reveals Notification Center while
swiping down from the top right will
show the control center with gesture
based navigation the force closing an
app isn't quite as straightforward as a
use of B swipe up to bring up the app
switcher long press on one of the
application previews and tap the close
button in the top left corner of that
preview since the home button is now
gone taking screenshots has changed as
well you can only repress the lock and
home buttons at the same time to take a
screenshot so now you have to press the
volume up and lock buttons at the same
time from that point it's all the same
and since there's no home button you may
have also noticed that Siri is not where
it used to be since you can't long press
the home button do not have to long
press the lock button along the right
edge of the phone to queue up Siri
hidden notification previews is the new
default your iPhone 10 won't show you
the contents of an alert unless you're
actively looking at the phone it's a new
privacy setting that takes some getting
used to but it's still not for everyone
to turn this off go to settings then go
to notifications then show previews
select always or never unlike older
iPhones there's simply not enough room
in the status bar to show battery
percentage now to see how much juice you
have left just pull down from the top
right of the screen to reveal the
percentage in control center you don't
even have to fully open control center
either just a slight swipe down and a
swipe back up will do a talking poop or
robot emoji isn't the most traditional
medium to use for a conversation but
that
exactly what an emoji allows you to do
while you can only create new an emoji
within iMessage you can then save them
to use in other apps you can also use
them as a sticker and a conversation
change the character after you've
recorded and much much more
and finally fancy selfies are now a
thing on the iPhone 10 with the true
depth front-facing camera and dual rear
facing cameras on the iPhone 10 you can
take some pretty cool pictures but it'll
take a bit of planning and practice to
get it right for more iPhone 10 tips and
tricks and other how to's be sure to
