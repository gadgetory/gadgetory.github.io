a first look at the Lenovo yoga tablets
there are two models one with an 8 inch
screen and one with a 10 inch display
but the internal specs are identical the
yoga is super thin and has a unique
design with a thick rounded edge that
props it up when you lie it flat it's
remarkably comfortable to hold the
tablet by that's fine and it feels
sturdy and well built that rounded spine
also houses an aluminum kickstand it's
awkward to open you have to grab the top
edge of the tablet grip the rounded edge
and rotate the kickstand away once the
kickstand is open you can adjust the
viewing angle behind it is a micro SD
card slot for extra storage on one end
of the spine there's an oversized power
button that's easy to press buttress s
enough that you don't accidentally hit
it above the power button there's a
micro USB charging port on the other end
there's a headphone jack above that
there's a volume rocker on the front
there are two dolby digital plus ds1
front-facing speakers which sound loud
and natural there's a 5-megapixel back
camera that takes so-so pictures and a
1.6 megapixel front facing camera for
video chatting the most disappointing
feature of the yoga is its screen both
the 8 inch and 10 inch models have 1280
x 1080 resolution displays which is low
compared to today's top tablets that
resolution looks decent on the 8 inch
model but the screen on the 10 incher
looks dull and fuzzy the tablets make up
for their poor screen resolution with
impressive battery life there's a 6000
milli ampere hour battery for the eight
incher and a 9000 milli ampere hour for
the 10 incher which is on par with
batteries you find in laptops that
should give you nearly all day battery
life and in my testing both tablets only
went down by about five percent after
being left alone for roughly 36 hours
the yoga is running Android jelly bean
4tube it has a completely custom design
from lenovo there's no app drawer so all
your apps live on your home screens
there's also a media shortcut menu
called smart bar which gives you quick
access to books movies music and apps it
also includes different modes for the
tablet depending on if you're holding it
or using the kickstand which changed the
video audio settings and alter the
screen for
best viewing experience inside there's a
quad-core 1.2 gigahertz mediatek cpu
that powers both tablets the performance
doesn't blow me away but it's not bad
either the yoga tablet 8 will cost you
two hundred fifty dollars and the 10
inch model will cost you 300 both have
16 gigabytes of storage those prices are
competitive but the mediocre screens
definitely reduce the value of what you
get for the cost once again I'm Sarah
mitrik with Cena and this has been a
first look at the Lenovo yoga tablets 8
and 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
