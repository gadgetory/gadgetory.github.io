2015 new york auto show taking a look at
the mclaren 5 70s now this car may not
look that much different the MacLaren's
previous model the 650s but it actually
represents a full new lineup for the
british automaker five Sony S is
designed to be your everyday sports car
this is a car you can drive to work
every day but also take to the track on
weekends it uses a similar design
structure as McLaren's previous cards
it's got a carbon fibre tub and aluminum
suspension elements so that keeps the
weight way down this car weighs about
3,000 pounds under the hood well
amidships actually cuz this is a
mid-engine car we've got a 3.8 liter v-8
with twin turbos that's a similar engine
then McLaren is used in its previous
cars but this has thirty percent
different parts on it this produces 562
horsepower or 570 PS that's the British
measurement that's where the name of the
car comes in that's a little bit less
than the 650s car but still should be
exceptionally fast we still have an
adaptive suspension so you can set up
from sport to comfort modes and it also
uses corner breaking to get you around
those corners with a lot of agility this
car uses adaptive suspension so you can
set it for our comfort mode while you're
driving to work or a track mode when you
get on the track it's also got a sport
mode just if you're playing around in
the back roads it's got corner breaking
for more agility in the corners and I'm
told that in track mode it will actually
let the back end come out about 15
degrees in sport mode that's only about
5 degrees it'll rain you in a little bit
more keep it a little safer when you're
just messing around on public roads
we've got a 7-speed automated manual
gearbox like in McLaren's other cars so
you get paddles on the shifter no clutch
pedal these doors open vertically and
I'm told the access is really good into
the cabin better than a lot of regular
production cars and it's got comfort
elements such as a premium audio system
it fits a lot of speakers around the
center that's actually really cool
looking for pedo shaped tweeter right on
the front dash gives it a sporty look
but it also good sound so this is a car
you can enjoy every day and I'm really
looking forward to driving it I'm when
cutting him here at the 2015 new york
auto show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
