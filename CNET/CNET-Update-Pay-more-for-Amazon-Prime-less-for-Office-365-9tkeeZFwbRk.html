office 365 I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your see Annette update the day we all
feared has arrived amazon announced that
prime will cost 100 dollars a year
that's a twenty dollar price increase
for the subscription service it includes
free two-day shipping on most of
Amazon's items plus access to free shows
on Prime instant video and free ebooks
in the kindle lending library the
student rate also increased but that's
just fifty dollars a year this is the
first time the price increase since
Prime launched in 2005 fuel and
transportation does cost more but Amazon
may also need more cash when competing
with Netflix to provide more quality
shows for its video service if you sign
up for prime by April seventeenth you
can lock in the original $80 cost for
one more year everyone else will have to
pay more when their account comes up for
its yearly renewal prime is still a
pretty good deal if you could take
advantage of the perks if you just look
at prime as a way to stream some TV
shows and movies amazon costs three
dollars more than one year of Netflix or
Hulu Plus but say you don't care about
the free shows and you don't have a
kindle so you don't care about the free
books you need to take a look at your
ordering history to see how much you
would have paid in shipping my cnet
update blog has a few links to help you
figure that out but you can also prolong
the price hike paying for one more year
you buy an amazon prime subscription now
as a gift but you gift it to yourself
and you have the delivery date be when
your current membership expires turn off
the auto renew and tada you just saved
twenty dollars on prime by paying for it
ahead of time but as one subscription
service price goes up a few others drop
Microsoft has a cheaper option for
accessing the suite of office programs
coming soon is office 365 personal it
costs seventy dollars a year and you can
only install office on one computer and
one Windows tablet if you need more
devices spend a hundred dollars on
office 365 home that lets you install it
on up to five computers &amp;amp; 5 smartphones
the google drive storage prices also
dropped
everyone gets 15 gigs of free storage
but if you need more 100 gigs of storage
now costs two dollars a month instead of
five dollars a month some folks may be
itching to get a Fitbit but others are
just itching from their fitbit's Fitbit
is offering a full refund for its force
activity tracking wristband after more
than 10,000 users complained of
developing allergic reactions and skin
irritation from the strap the 130 dollar
fitness bracelet was the first Fitbit to
come with a screen that's your tech news
