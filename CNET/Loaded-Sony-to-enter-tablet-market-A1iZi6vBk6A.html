and it's time to get loaded Facebook has
started rolling out facebook deals there
Groupon competitor it offers local deals
that you can share with your Facebook
friends it launches today in Austin
Atlanta Dallas San Diego and San
Francisco facebook also launched
something called the send button which
is like the like button but not so
public you will soon start to see these
littered all over the web when you push
it you can share an article photo or
page with a select few friends on
Facebook rather than your entire feed so
now you don't have to be quite so
embarrassed to like the things you like
sony announced a new lineup of android
tablets today they run the tablet
specific honeycomb version of android
and they are called the sony tablets the
s-1 is the 9 inch version the s2 has 25
inch displays that fold together like a
book both can link to the Sony Reader
store and Android PlayStation content
which is very cool they come out in the
fall yahoo has purchased into now a TV
check-in service it's kind of like
Foursquare for TV watching you tell your
friends and family what you are watching
and share it through the app the app
scans the airwaves from the television
and knows what you're watching was just
kind of cool it can share this with your
Facebook and Twitter friends and it's no
iPad but the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Nook is now
more of a tablet than an e-reader
because it can run apps this is called
nook apps in their apps for email
calendar contacts and more it can also
run adobe flash and adobe air the color
milk runs android but it can't run all
android marketplace apps there are
specific apps designed for the nook and
right now they're about 125 of them last
week we reported on a tmobile app called
bobsled that lets you make calls to your
facebook friends in facebook chat on
your mobile device well that doesn't
work anymore t-mobile shut it down
because users were confusing it with the
real facebook chat and Facebook
complained t-mobile said it would
redesign the app so users aren't so
confused that's your news of the day I
will see you tomorrow I'm Natali Morris
