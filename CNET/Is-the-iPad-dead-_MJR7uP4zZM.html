what we're here to discuss with me is
rich Trenholm i'm lee west away okay
rich you think that the ipad is finished
and we shouldn't bother with it anymore
why the ipad is it's over it's dead it's
done it's peaked its past its prime it's
people are still buying it certainly but
that's just the last gasp of a bloated
rotting corpse okay Cara hurtling
downhill with the brakes car it struck
me that maybe apart from the smartphone
it's the most influential piece of
technology in the last 10 years so is
that not true is that not true it
totally is true but the thing is so well
the reason the iPad was important was
because we needed an intermediate
between your phone which was portable
but didn't do very much and your laptop
which was kind of portable but did
everything but you couldn't really carry
it around when you take its bed and all
that kind of thing we needed something
in the middle and that's what we got
with the iPad the big screen it was also
so at the big screen and it was powerful
just like a laptop but if you carry it
around with you could slip it in a bag
even in a pocket you could take its bed
with you all that kind of thing you can
sit on the sofa with it you didn't have
to wait to turn it on all that kind of
stuff we needed that
but now smartphones they're so powerful
you've got the power of a tablet in a
device that's always in your pocket and
that you can always carry around with
you so you now have the portability of a
smart phone and the power of a laptop in
a smart phone you don't need an iPad
anymore I don't agree people point to
phablets and bigger phones and say like
we don't need an iPad or a tablet now
because these are so massive but I think
that the use for them are completely
different because some babbler
ultimately is your phone and finally
something you have to carry around with
you and the battery dies and has to make
calls and all the usual things a tablet
is a more peaceful like take a step back
kind of product it's just sort of
chilling out in your house on your sofa
you look at the smart smartphone
sales and they're like up and up and up
year a new year in year and and that's
that's fair enough because people always
need smartphones they using them
everyday they kind of work a day things
and they break and you lose them and
things like that but the tablet is is
different like I don't think people use
tablets in the same way that they use a
smartphone I think people reach for the
tablet when they want to do something
that they don't want to do with a
smartphone something that is a bit more
like okay now I'm taking a minute out
cuz on your phone you've got like emails
and texts and everything like in like a
smartphone to me is just like the thing
that I have to have to be alive in the
world and functioning where's the tablet
is
it's more peaceful it's like it's a Zen
product is it okay I think it will
occupy long term the same sort of
technological space as like a CD player
or something like that it's going to be
a relaxation gadget it's not going away
well I'm not saying that the tablet is
necessarily going away what I'm saying
is that no one's gonna be buying them
anymore the other thing of there the
difference between tablets and phones is
that you swap it you change your phone
much more often you you have the
pressure from a network or to buy a new
one every year so you can get an upgrade
every year so you're much more likely to
change the phone on a more regular basis
also you have the fact that phones are
much more innovative they innovate much
much faster whereas tablets they're not
changing people don't change them that
often because there's really no point
they look at the difference between a
new iPad and the previous year's iPad
there's nothing different they might
have a slightly better camera they might
be a tiny bit thinner
how much thinner can a tablet really get
they might have a fingerprint scanner on
them well whoop-dee-do but the thing is
there's not really a huge amount of
innovation between the first iPad and
now and look at how much phones have
changed over the last five years it
sounds incredible so people already have
tablets and then it's not going to buy
anymore
so why was you know it why would you buy
another tablet it's like it's like
fridges no one's gonna be changing their
fridge every year so I think what you've
done is you've mistaken slowing sales
for a sign that something's completely
on the way out and you're right people
do out great their phones all the time a
lot more than they would buy a tablet
but that doesn't mean that tablets
aren't being used it just means that
when we look at the graphs it looks like
tablets are dying because phones are
like going like up and tablets like like
a meteorite or something but that's
because everyone is at home using the
tablets and like and I think also that
something with tablets it's easier to
sort of like shift them around the
family you can use some secondhand you
can sell them things like that I think
it's easier to trade tablets than it is
with a smartphone which has all your
sort of personal stuff on it and and
they go out of date so quickly it's the
other thing tablets last better they
have better longevity so I mean I'm not
surprised that we're seeing you know
when when when the iPad came out
everyone bought one because everyone
wanted to own one and now that they own
one obviously you see sort of sales sort
of like you know just fall a little
little bit little chunk to me it says
like slippery slope start of a spiral
everyone is not the start of a spiral
spiral Pleasant Plateau it's like being
on the top
of a really nice mountain or something
that has like a field of Heather that's
where the iPad is accessible gently and
settle gently into that no it's plunging
into the abyss that's what's happening I
mean I don't think it's any coincidence
that sales of the iPad peaked and then
start to fall at the same time as Apple
released a larger phone the iPhone 6
plus
sold at some sold absolutely in their
Millions they're at the 6 and the 6 bus
and I think it's because of that because
that you can now get this bigger screen
option you don't need an iPad anymore
and let's say people who've got them
they they keep them forever they pass
them on that kind of thing well so that
means that means is it's on the way out
it doesn't mean it's on the way out it
mean so it means that you just have to
buy them more slowly like we're talking
in this sort of smartphone timeframe
where we look at sales from just the
last few years and we're like it's not
selling like millions and millions every
month we don't expect that of other
things like you know like music
equipment or like I don't know kitchen
technology or any other part of
technology it's like smartphones are an
anomaly in sort of house or rocket II
take off their sales figures are and I
think people look at tablets and go that
looks a bit like a smartphone so they
think that sort of like if it also isn't
succeeding then you know it would those
same sort of figures then it's failure
but I don't think it is I think you know
the the the the iPad and other tablets
can quite comfortably you just sort of
sell a pleasant amount every year you
know enough money for Apple to keep
making them
just keep ticking over well so much to
make them probably I think it's just
like spider webs in a bit of metal tears
yeah a new quantity is well the thing is
I mean I've got one word for your iPod
right everybody had an iPod for ages and
then it went away because the smartphone
took over it I'm glad you brought up the
iPod rich you've just activated my trap
people and into it yeah okay so the art
the iPod actually is perfect because I'm
not saying the iPad is going to be
around literally forever
last year in me but look at the iPods
longevity so that was launched I believe
in in 2001 and it was only recently sort
of retired after like after over my the
iPod Touch has been like a shambling
corpse of the iPod like that's that I
know but that's the point at which they
retire it the point where they're like
actually isn't there's no point in us
making that anymore and Apple being a
sort of capitalist bastion that it is
would only stop doing that if it didn't
think it was making money anymore
so using the iPod as a perfect example
which continued for many years
successfully after the iPhone came out I
think the iPad clearly has more than a
decade left yeah but look at the
gimmickry they had to resort to with the
iPod they every year they change it they
bring up the Nano and the mini all that
kind of thing and they change it from
being Square to being rectangular tubing
square again to being round to being
like bow shaped or whatever well you
were just saying that there was no
innovation in the iPad and that oh
basically the same so wouldn't you
rather see them in some different colors
that would be great but it's not going
to happen you can't show you can't mess
with the tablet that much why well when
they stop being humming a tablet you
could make it into like a cylinder
that's one that's one in one example
that's one million-dollar idea right
right on that Apple yeah I'll just call
em definitely okay you might be right
you may have some good points all right
well I believe that the iPad can exist
quite comfortably alongside smart phones
rich well you've heard what rich has to
say involved the world hobbled or
something like that wasn't very pleasant
yeah gambling courses yeah yeah well let
us know what you think in the comments
and stay tuned to see net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
