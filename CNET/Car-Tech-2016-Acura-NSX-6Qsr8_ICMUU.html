the Acura NSX first debuted you really
missed something it was a sensation
which is interesting because it was also
rather subtle it came after supercars of
the era and said I can do something you
can do but with less brawn with more
finesse with more elegance now 25 years
later and ten years after the original
NSX died it's been reborn here's the
second gen car but much more complex
under the skin the powertrain is getting
a ton of attention it is still a
mid-engine car with a twin-turbo v6 now
mounted longitudinally not transversely
in the car in between it and it's nine
speed dual clutch transmission is one of
three electric motors the other two are
planted up front in the bow each one
serving one of the two front wheels and
that means it has instant and fully
independent power and torque vectoring
makes for a very smart as well as the
very crisp all-wheel drive experience
I'm sure exact numbers are still pending
on the performance but I don't think it
takes a lot of convincing you've got a
carbon-fiber plate under the bottom of
the vehicle and a lot of very strong
stiff aluminum members taking up onto
the chassis and other structure and
Honda says they've got a unique way of
making them that achieve some of the
strength and stiffness of forging not
just cast technology inside you'll find
an LCD instrument panel that's actually
becoming kind of common than cars these
days but it's actually relatively clean
by comparison to others you've got a low
- they promise and supposedly thin eight
pillars for good outward visibility as
you dive in and out of those corners and
seek apex ease I'll see what happens
when we actually get one those eight
pillars still look pretty chunky to me
and when they're laid down low like that
the sin tends to be compounded most cars
in this class have pretty awful
visibility out the corners the styling
is hard to miss but it's not as
distinctive as the original NSX was from
the rest of the market orders will begin
in summer of 2015 production starts in
fall deliveries shortly after that I'd
imagine and we're guessing at the price
but the rumor mill is saying a buck and
a half that also makes it different than
the original NSF</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
