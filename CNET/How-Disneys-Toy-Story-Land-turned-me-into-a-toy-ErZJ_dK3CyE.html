wanted to live inside of it alright
soldiers fall in fall in falling let's
see if you've got what it takes let me
see you stand through what's in shunt
salute at ease soldiers now you can feel
like you're living in the toy store a
universe with Disney's Toy Story land
it's a brand new section of the
Hollywood Studios theme park in Orlando
Florida
everything here is built to make you
feel like you're one of Andy's toys
playing in his backyard
I got an early look just before it
opened to learn how Disney and Pixar
made an animated world come to life
there's so much detail everything is as
if Andy made it himself with toy parts
boxes and hand-drawn notes there are two
rides one is alien swirling saucers
where our pizza planet pals spin you
around in spaceships the big highlight
is the slinky dog - coaster
and if you're wondering why is slinky on
a coaster
well Disney has a story for everything
is that ok well this can't look like a
roller coaster dance on a piece of a
park he doesn't look like a toy so we
came up with this conceit of the dash
and dodge roller coaster kit that Andy
got and he also got the expansion packs
and then he figured out that slinky dog
fit just perfectly on this roller
coaster toy track and so he created his
own slinky dog - and since these are
Andy's toys the gift shop has those
rides in tie form in fact there's lots
of merchandise to let out your inner Toy
Story geek strange things are happening
to me if you're hungry there's Woody's
lunch box a little food stand built of
juice boxes animal crackers and whatever
Andy's mom packed for lunch that day the
land also ties into an older ride Toy
Story Mania but now there's a new
entrance and new things to see while you
wait in line to get inside Andy's
bedroom game on let's do this put on 3d
glasses and spin around shooting targets
and other objects and a bunch of
fast-paced carnival games
what are you this place is so much fun I
remember playing with you when I was a
kid wait a minute your movie came out of
95 oh I'm so old the Toy Story was a
breakthrough when it came out it was the
first computer animated movie in history
it grew into a franchise that spans
three movies with a fourth movie coming
next year now the next generation has
more ways to play and connect with these
timeless characters you know with all
the details here makes you feel like you
really belong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
