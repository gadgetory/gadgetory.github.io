bringing you a review of the Panasonic n
n SD 9 9 7 s microwave with inverter
technology so this large stainless steel
microwave cost three hundred dollars
that's actually a mid-range price for a
countertop model this microwave has a
2.2 cubic foot capacity which is a
really large size and it has 1250 watts
of power I really like the look of this
microwave it's kind of sleek and looks a
little high-end although it's a
mid-range price I also really like the
blue LED light display the buttons and
the dial are all so well laid out and
really easy to see and use the most
unique feature of this microwave is the
inverter technology so inverter
technology works by maintaining a steady
lower power level most other microwaves
actually vacillate between a high power
level and a very low power level to
achieve that mid range we tested that
functionality by making omelets the
Sharp our 820 J s actually performed
better than the Panasonic because it has
a lower wattage of 900 and it's
convection so the heating technology is
just totally different the Panasonic
omelets were still good but not quite as
good as the Sharp another high-end
feature of this microwave is the sensor
technology a built in moisture sensor
actually detects the doneness of your
food and you don't even have to input a
timer there are 18 sensor presets that
range from ground meat to potatoes to
omelettes there's also a sensor reheat
function it didn't do that well though
when we tried to reheat day-old pizza
this microwave also has an inverter
turbo defrost feature which defrost your
food really really quickly
I actually defrosted a chicken drumstick
in just 58 seconds and it did extremely
well I use this microwaves frozen entree
sensor to make Stouffer's frozen lasagna
I did three different tests and for the
first test I used a single serving
frozen dinner
and the sensor performed perfectly it
was absolutely delicious and it looked
great for the second and third tests I
used a double serving frozen dinner the
sensor actually underestimated the
amount of time it would need to cook so
even though it generally worked well
there were a couple of anomalies that
may require some trial and error on your
part overall this is a great mid-range
microwave it looks good it produces
delicious food and most of the features
work extremely well I wouldn't
necessarily buy this for the inverter
technology but I think it has enough
going for it that justifies the purchase
anyway especially if you have a large
family or regularly cook a lot of food
in your microwave thanks for watching
