scene at New York Studios my name is BVG
and it's time for episode 293 of the 359
podcast in the house today we got Ben
Fox Rubin n Scotty Stein hey Scott
thanks for coming hey thanks for having
me on
yeah so about this today we're gonna be
talking all about Google's event
tomorrow we're just basically going to
do a preview for the event yep kicks off
at 9 a.m. Pt 12:00 p.m. Eastern time you
can obviously see the live stream on CNN
if you like what are we gonna go through
today we'll talk about AR and VR news
obviously we're talking about Google
home the home in E there's a lot of
stuff that already leaked a couple days
ahead of time so photos so there's like
a bunch of things to actually discuss
but even though we know a lot of the
products that are being announced a lot
of the details about their features when
they when they're coming out haven't
really come out yet so there's a lot of
reason to actually see the Google event
tomorrow but at the same time we'll run
you through a lot of the hardware that
is expected to be announced tomorrow
either way sending your questions and
comments BBG we'll get to as many as you
can at the end of the show without
further ado let's get to the podcast
back in the chat to take your comments
and questions in 3 minutes and 59
seconds from 3 to welcome to the 359 I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm Scott Stein Google
will be holding a big hardware launch
event tomorrow starting at 9 a.m.
Pacific time 12 p.m. Eastern Time
yes the live stream will be available on
SEANET what's going to be presented has
largely been leaked out though
unconfirmed the biggest device from the
show should be the pixel 2 and pixel 2
XL notably they don't get rid of the top
and bottom bezels like the Samsung
Galaxy s8 and iPhone 10 do so Scott what
are your thoughts on the design of this
thing it looks fine I mean I love the
build quality of the original pixel but
again it had a large bezel on that phone
but a lot of people care about camera
quality pixel still has great camera
quality the question here is to me does
it do the 2 in the 2 XL take big strides
in camera quality
it already pretty competitive landscape
and it doesn't look like they're going
to include even in the Excel version two
cameras on the back do you think that
that could actually hamper them or hurt
them in any way I think it could hamper
you know I think that you know people
are getting more used to the dual
cameras and what they can do there is
the simulated bokeh fact that the pixel
did which was you know not fantastic but
which was mostly software mostly
software but that's kind of fits where
Google wants to go which is you know I
think a lot of these are about
computational things you can do software
wise are ways that are not in the in the
physical camera so maybe they talk about
that you know I think the general
reaction when you sort of see it is like
oh that's it but that's the case with a
lot fuckin Snap is like okay it's a
phone not only that but like think about
the iPhone 10 where we're supposed to be
a thousand dollars and people were there
were a lot of folks that were trashing
the design with like the knotch
up top a lot of people felt like that
was ugly or that was unattractive well
and at least that looked a little more
distinctive here I mean I guess you're
looking like HTC and LG being the ones
making these so you're probably going to
expect a phone that falls in line with
HTC and LG use recent phones and they
are making really good hardware
especially cameras so that's good news I
mean there's rumors about the reports
the squeezable sides the HTC you have
I'm nervous to see how that works that
is that a pretty interesting we's for
assistance like that's no weird that's
usually how I asked for assistance in
places that yeah give them a nice hug
it's good for SOS or something I'd be
interesting idea like when you're
panicked just squeeze and see what
happening so another important new
launch for Google should be the home
mini smart speaker it's expected to be
$50 and go up against the echo dot
there's also the home max which is
rumored which should potentially go up
against the brand new echo plus what do
you like this strategy that Google is is
essentially in many ways playing
catch-up to Amazon's variety of smart
speakers well Google has the software
and the AI down pat I mean their their
ability to assist as grave the question
is what is it going into so are they
going to compete on that hardware
territory certainly making a smaller one
would be
great to go up against the dot on a
large range which is phenomenally
successful as a big seller for Amazon
that's the big seller out of the entire
echo family yeah I think it's a great
idea if you already have a lot of
Android devices you're working in or
anything that's using Google assistant
then you could use it and get a lot out
of it the larger I'm one between that
and home pod and other stuff like you
know what is that premium market looking
like or are you trying to do this for
music or they try we don't even know
about home pod or what that's going to
do really beyond music that's the Apple
device that's all device that's expected
to come out in December for three
hundred and forty nine dollars yeah that
is definitely premium tier that one we
can't we came and talked about the
assistant elements yet because they
haven't even been discussed right and
Sandra has been a laggard in that area
for sure
right right so yeah you're definitely
looking at there's a huge landscape of
Amazon products and can Google make
theirs make sense Andrew Gephardt an
interesting thought in his piece today
what if you built the something into
their Wi-Fi mesh router and I like that
idea because if the question is how many
little things you're gonna buy and my
problem is that when the landscape
splits like that and you can't work
cross-platform you want to set up one
set of devices and which one will it be
right and when will I live with them and
also when will Google on the hardware
side start to try to lap Amazon instead
of just playing catch-up there are a lot
of other things that we didn't get to in
a forum in a podcast including the
expected pixel book laptop AR and VR
news but either way if you want to read
more about these stories check them out
on CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Scott
Stein thanks for listening I'm impressed
you crammed a lot into four minutes oh I
think I could have done more
Scott's a pro can always that's what the
post show is for well the airfare time
let's talk about it now because you're
you know a local expert on the subject
I'm hoping to see you there if we have
more time as I said am most passionate
about hearing about this but what I'm
hoping for
so let's talk about errand beer Google I
was at Google i/o and so it's hard now
because they make a lot of announcements
there but they increasingly don't show
stuff
and they used to show stuff at i/o I've
been like four or five times died oh and
it used to be they would debut things
and now it's like here's an announcement
we'll talk to you later
and so now when are they going to talk
to us later like google lens really cool
people were very excited yeah but like
when you know when are we gonna hear
about that so similarly with VR they
made a lot of claims at at the last i/o
and we still haven't seen the other shoe
drop with those yet one of them is that
they're gonna be standalone this is
outside of phones of these standalone VR
headsets they're going to be able to map
the world around you using cameras not
as advanced as Google tango but based on
tango technology so the idea is you
wander around kind of like an HTC vive
an oculus rift you can it Maps the room
you're in it can map a little bit of
your emotion not the entire room but it
means that if you're wearing if you've
worn mobile VR headset so you got one of
those it's not too often free gear VR
Zord a dream you can't lean forward it
doesn't do that you can only turn your
head around you lean forward everything
stays in place and you get dizzy so to
be able to lean forward this it's called
six degrees of freedom which is
basically what Apple and Google are now
doing with their AR where you can move
around and look at things in the
environment depth and see depth that is
a combination of the cameras and the
motion tracking chips inside the
accelerometer gyro working together
sometimes with other sensors so
basically the long story short that it
means you'll be able to duck your head
in VR and duck under the virtual table
it'll be more immersive but yeah more
emergent like nobody likes the idea of
you know being taken out of the moment
in VR what you're doing is pitching your
head forward right I didn't realize that
and that's that's obviously a major
oversight in the world of VR as it
stands right now if that's something
that's something that people do like so
normally and you can't do it it means
that like the holodeck part is gone like
it's it for mobile VR it means like 360
videos are fine but if you're gonna do
anything like I'm going through a
haunted house or I'm like look exploring
a virtual bedroom where you're
moving around as opposed to the world
coming to you it means that it it means
you basically start clicking around with
your with your controller to move versus
leaning forward and stuff so anyway they
be separate headsets which they haven't
really talked about much and and if it's
gonna be HTC and Lenovo who are making
those as these unknown priced entities
but then on the other side of it we're
expecting that Google will have more
developments for ad age for daydream VR
for the pixel and for other Android
phones at the same time they have
something that's a lot like apples AR
kit the stuff that does all IKEA on the
subway which became a tweet and then
stuff like that they're gonna have a
similar set of software called AR core
that they've talked about but they
haven't launched yet okay so if it'll
work on their phones and Samsung's
phones for now big picture here
who is the furthest ahead when it comes
to AR and VR is it is it like kind of a
scrum between Apple and Google is it the
major VR headset makers like oculus like
what do you see is like really
innovating and pushing things forward in
that market well for VR it's definitely
I would I would put oculus at the leader
of the pack and and also vive I think
I'll just
HTC from HTC Lou HTC has been in a
strange situation I think now with vive
um oculus being part of Facebook I think
there's a lot a lot stronger push for
for VR software and so that's the area
that's that's pretty interesting to me I
think they're to me they always seem
like kind of a leader of the pack also
they're in Mobile with Samsung's there's
a really strong collection of lots and
lots of apps AR it's funny because if it
depends on how advanced you want to talk
like hololens I mean Microsoft has been
exploring oh yeah things doing this but
I think they've lost ground they're
looking at the vanguard but they're
losing ground because right now in the
things you can do without buying a
Developer Kit Apple swooped in and did a
lot with AR kit we're now all of a
sudden you could have your existing
iPhone and play around with stuff and
develop apps for people who could
download them and his illusions and they
were it's it's obviously much more
relatable
and consumable thing getting yeah a
giant AR headset that you've got your
hololens yeah alright there's that and
Google I think is has been doing tango
for well before Apple but the problem is
there was only on two phones so now
they're there they've been doing
tremendous groundwork but they have to
catch up and actually get that stuff
shared out too with people but it is
novelty landscape right now so alright
let's get to the questions we have a lot
of really great questions but I'm gonna
be selfish for a second I'm gonna
because I'm sitting in the chair
first and foremost little you mentioned
the holodeck trivia for CNET die hards
that is the code name for this studio
because oh but my question is how do you
think Google is going to approach
exclusivity as someone who's very
interested in the pixel but is locked
into an 18 t contract am I screwed oh
boy well what were those rumors at first
about being Verizon exclusive I don't
know if that's still a case or not I
hope that well you can get it unlocked
get it unlocked now get it unlocked
that's obviously they you can always do
that but it'd be nice if I could
actually just make a clean sweep yeah
yeah yeah I'm hoping you just pick it up
and it'll be fine and you won't I mean
yeah carriers or stranger the first
pixel I think that was a strange story
with it where you were like oh it's
showing up at Verizon stores and you're
like why can't I just what can't just
get it ever why wasn't it just available
yeah
across the board well at that point I
think it was an experiment
Verizon probably came in and said hey
we're the big dog in town why don't you
bring it to us exclusively and we'll
help you out generally those are why
those deals end up working out I think
consumers tend to be a little bit
annoyed about it but it does reduce the
level of risk for a company like Google
in coming out with a brand new flagship
so yeah it would be nice if they
expanded at it out from a Verizon
exclusive but at the same time it was
kind of a leaky exclusive to begin with
you could get it in a variety of other
websites just unlocked sure absolutely
as any solution would be I was just kind
of curious if there was gonna be a
cleaner way for me to make that jump and
not spend several hundred extra dollars
yeah because that's a good question it's
it's a very good question we'll see
see and I'm sure a lot of people
watching will definitely be curious to
see what sort of carrier structure we're
gonna see tomorrow
Google innovates again no carriers ever
again right here's argon carriers are
holding carriers and carriers go the way
of the headphone jack which who cares
about the headphone who cares about the
camera I heard there's no headphone jack
why says Richard Rutter echoed by James
favor asking if they're gonna have a 3.5
millimeter jack
very good question all reports say no
headphone seriously okay super annoying
so droid life had a lot of the early
leaks of the Google pixel - when what
was this first and now it like first
came out September 20th so about two
weeks ago I in with the guy who
initially published his stories and was
like what about the headphone jack
because really he only had pictures of
the back of the phone he didn't even
have the screen and he said I don't know
because that's that those were the leaks
that he added up getting but it looks
like now we're getting a little bit more
information that they are gonna get rid
of the headphone jack which would mean
that it's probably USB type-c okay so
wait so Apple said it was because of
courage is everyone else doing it now
just because it's cool they're all like
saying so many story gist companies
Samsung stuck with it hipster and they
want to be like the anti cool it
wouldn't show they want to show you that
it can be done or not cool it's just
it's just you know useful because the
largest collective wise I hate that
phones don't have headphone jacks
however I like if a phone was coming out
that I really liked and it didn't have a
headphone jack I wouldn't be like oh I'm
never getting that phone because it's
missing the headphone jack something but
you've lived in that world for at least
a year now it's tremendously yeah it's
tremendously annoying yeah you forget
the dongle or you brought now you bring
multiple headphones on planes because
then you've got a lightning one and then
I brought a switch and I don't have a
3.5 millimeter headphone because I only
took that one again and then the battery
is dying
you got the Bluetooth headphones and
you're in the plane and there's no it's
like a Seinfeld episode
so this is no first-world for the record
its entire show could be called first
world problem which we have mentioned
many you should actually rebrand because
we never land a 3 minutes and 59 side
but the general the general move away
from headphone jacks is really obnoxious
and and I don't like it on anything but
I'm just gonna get back to the point
like I feel like phones you don't own a
phone forever right you have a phone for
like a you know - three years - three
years of people maybe you get to like
five but like it's not like a laptop
where you just can't make it that many
more years on phones they they don't
last very heavy use so you carry them
around with I don't know I think of it
as like a it's it's a multi-year
experiment if you go without one if
you're willing to do that sometimes I
would I would go well there was a phone
I like if it was a pixel - and I go the
cameras great I would go this is a lot
put up with it this is a little
disappointing though because I was
annoying I was personally looking at the
pixel to thinking you know what they're
not so aggressive on design as the
essayed with the edges and all right so
the note aid for somebody that's looking
to upgrade like I have an iPhone 6 and I
was buying an iPhone 8 made almost no
sense in the world to me like why would
I spend that much money on a phone that
was like very very similar with a lot of
some like just an upgrade on internal
components definitely to me the pixel -
looks like a very good option by to
suggest that they're gonna get rid of
the headphone jack does give me
personally a little bit of hesitation in
purchasing it because that means like I
have a bunch of headphones in my house
that now aren't gonna be useful I spend
my life dealing with cables your cables
around here to make this stuff run and I
hate cables and I want my life to be
Wireless but the headphone jack was the
last thing I wanted to go right it's
been perfect technology for how many
decades and it's been one of the only
universal inputs for decades and the
problem is is that that's now shifting
because obviously the technology world
has to change like the decision is made
at some point that like you know what
we're all using this let's let's move on
from it it's not good enough right we're
not there yet
USBC is still a bit of a weird entity
even though it's showing up everywhere
but not not everywhere it's showing up
a lot of places so then let's talk about
if it's gonna have bluetooth 5.0 or not
sure I would assume so yeah I'm like
yeah it's at this point in the year
Bazaar iPhone the iPhone has it yeah be
bizarre not to write in it so
expectation would be just to keep up
with the Joneses they're they're gonna
have bluetooth 5.0 as well
all right back into some questions the
cameras the thing for me I would say
again how good is that camera the camera
is anything for a lot of people the
pixel did have very good camera that's
what I remember from the pixels like if
there's one thing I remember about last
year's pixel is how good the camera was
and low-light and that's basically what
defined it and so now I almost think of
that as more of the defining opportunity
here it's like can the pixel to make
isn't make a great a splash it's gotten
so much more competitive to I mean like
a Polly touts the cameras obviously
Samsung does to be very curious to see
how Google tries to differentiate in
that field
speaking of splash let's segue into
Kurt's question is it gonna be
waterproof should be so that was a big
problem with the pixel last year right
yeah was that it was a lot of proof it's
supposed to be in a better damn well be
if it doesn't have a headphone jack I
mean I will throw something by the way I
will I think everyone first world Robin
saw a first world problem is unaware go
on to this podcast that we were gonna
lose the headphone jack let's just have
these gadgets be easier for us like
exactly it's like just stop complicating
things in it in our lives with these
little tiny annoyances but I think that
sure it should have water resistance and
you know be able to take immersion so I
think if Google paid any attention at
all to the criticisms about their pixel
they absolutely should have some level
of water resistance because that was
that was something that was definitely
lacking in their flagship phone last
year and I think it's still sold
reasonably well I don't know what the
numbers were but it obviously wasn't a
butter failure like the fire phone so
there's that good reason for them to
keep going with it that being said don't
go swimming with your phones don't
shouldn't be aiming for that in life and
right that's the hardest thing with with
reviewing like phones versus not
swimming watch yeah exactly I'm not a
swim
first of all big surprise but the phones
versus watches is just you know the
age-old water resistance reminder it's
like you can immerse some phones up to
thirty minutes
but they're not designed to be doing
that all the time you know at this
underwater scuba diving photos and
videos and people taking with them all
the time and showers other stuff it's
just like don't do it with a
thousand-dollar phone or a telephone
also in the native sense like the way
the phone is designed using the best
thing you can do underwater probably
take a picture right that camera's gonna
get warped by the lack of light
underwater and the way that the color
spectrum gets skewed so you're gonna
want hardware to add on to that anyways
to get the best quality picture
otherwise what the hell would you do
with a phone underwater it's just nice
for occasional toilet drops look yes
intrusively absolutely but I would argue
to that you know you don't really need
your phone with you all the time if
you're going on a swim like right leave
your phone sometimes like that's oh
that's okay you don't need to catalogue
it everyone asked some people would cut
their own hands oh I know
it's good if you're at the beach and
then you're in your be wearing your
cargo shorts and then like the water
rides up and then your shorts are wet
and you're like oh my phone my pants
you're right which happened to me once
it might happen to you other people I
know you wear cargo shorts all right
we're running low on time let's slam
through a couple of ones as quickly as
we can I just like the comment from Drew
Nielsen who says Danny Tanner would love
a huggable phone make some noise when
you squeeze it like I don't like Oreo is
an Android name by the way okay sorry
it's a stupid comment thumbs Timmy just
call it Android 7 or what I don't want
like these can you call it whatever you
want
we've been calling it the iPhone extra
days I'm gonna never stop and calling it
the iPhone x9 yeah it's gonna be axe
okay Michael Brown shadow Michael Brown
hey Michael I would be blown away if
Google announced iMessage feature in the
Google a low tomorrow mmm I don't know
why that would happen though you mean
like a proprietary like a no I think Oh
integrating iMessage yes yeah that's
like an actual iMessage I don't think
it's ever gonna know unfortunately it's
like a Sega Genesis playing a Nintendo
game right maybe somewhere down the line
but that's a little reason to do that at
Apple we would have discussed that at
WWDC or something if they're gonna but
we need to do it but why there would be
very little reason for them to do it the
this is another element of Apple's
walled garden where if at any point you
decide to break free from apple prison
they make iMessage this this thing where
but you don't get texts from your mom
for like three weeks or something family
right but like for this short period of
time like while you're running from the
Apple Island so no I don't think you're
gonna get I'm acid no I'm dollars
Michael but that's the longest longest
of long shots be a dream world
sure okay you want that real quick USB C
charger was that gonna equal fast charge
I don't know how do you think good thing
to do
yeah I mean totally on the table that's
something I would also expect at this
point because so many other good phones
I mean review Motorola's phones this
hearing things like that he said I mean
I'm used to seeing good fast charge you
know showing up the iPhone included if
you have to buy all these extra adapter
is in order to make it happen you're not
in box but fast charge capable sure
again a to use the words table stakes
but it's that as I hate that phrase but
I do feel like table stakes that and
also the water resistance I theaters are
just expected at this point Michael
Brown wants us to brainstorm for a hot
second what do you guys think Google and
the made for Google need to do to get
pixel as popular as the iPhone and let's
go ahead and bundle that together in
Nasser's follow-up do we like the pixels
design because he thinks that there
could be some improvements
of the original one I'm assuming I'm
talking about - yeah okay that's the new
one I definitely considered it could we
know that one got lots of criticism the
design pictures fine look now looks fine
but my offensive its I would say that
like Google does not have factories
Google is not the one originating B's
phones they you know provide the specs
and blueprints to somebody else whether
it's HTC HTC or somebody else as they've
created a better partnership with some
HTC engineers maybe they're going to be
able to create better designs in the
future but at the same time they don't
have the same power over design as
Samsung does or Apple does so I don't
think that it's as you know design
forward as it could be but I don't think
that it's offensive either I mean in the
original pixel everybody thought the
bezels looked huge it looked very like
interesting Oh looked like the iPhones
bezels or everything else so I don't
think that was like a major design win
either but it felt nice it was nicely
made I always think of Google's hardware
products even the way back to
Chromebooks and things every once in a
while when they debut a product that was
made by them I was thinking but more as
I get a good utilitarian very cleanly
designed yeah and as long as it is that
I like that I like I hope the pixel two
feels really super clean lensing the
clean Android like well they find they
should have the headphone jack you
remember they were actually trumpeting
that writing jack and when you talk
about a utilitarian design and something
that's just easily usable by most people
they were like we still kept the
headphone jack last year well I don't
want readers I don't want it to be over
designed like I sometimes I feel like
some phones definitely something that
Samsung with the first curved edges or
like the second display with LG's phones
and things like I don't I don't I would
much prefer a very clean functional
phone that just felt like it was really
well made I think pick it up and you're
like oh that's nice like I just I will
use that all the time so going back to
Michael's question about what would make
the pixel as popular as the iPhone I
don't I don't know exactly what that
killer feature would actually be however
I think that the field has been more
opened this year than in the past
because the iPhone ade it's kind of a
punt they didn't really do much with it
the iPhone 10 is so expensive
whatever iPhone an x10 it's so expensive
that I think it really pushes a lot of
potential consumers out of that market
so that give is the opportunity for
Samsung or Google or even LG some of the
other folks to come out with something
is the pixel tube gonna be that I don't
know but Google is also like big on
software so we'll be very interested to
see not only what the hardware looks
like but also what this phone is capable
of because that's that's a big strong
suit for Google I also think the pixel
may be I'm just working in tech too much
but I feel like it made a lot of strides
for getting in people's minds as a nexus
always seem like a phone you had to be
sort of like into that Club to be you
know certainly like I want the Nexus
phone but now I feel like pixel crossed
over into branding for for an average
person or someone just wants a good
phone and now if they continue that just
continuing to make good strides with
that doesn't versus like suddenly
dominating I think is very good place
for them to be right now
you keep wedging over there yeah I keep
wedging in there and then before you
know it maybe one of the top players in
the phone market yeah all right Scott
you say you've got nice clean and under
design over design phone but I don't
care I won't mind come pre Fidesz 'old
we're at the end of the show but we want
to make a quick mention nubs Media
tweeted at us and he had a great
question about the Wall Street Journal
story Ben you want to elaborate on this
yes so there's a Wall Street Journal
story that I think he mowed yesterday
they talked about the fact that Samsung
is gonna make some good money off of the
iPhone 10 I mean X because they're
providing the OLED displays on those so
we were talking about this a little bit
ahead of the show and just the fact is
is that Samsung because they're
providing those displays on the top tier
iPhone means that there's no way Samsung
loses if the iPhone 10 does well Samsung
kind of wins if people buy Samsung
phones instead Samsung wins so they
figured out a pretty brilliant strategy
well and it's like kind of like when
people talk about like Samsung versus
other companies the reality that's in
like the
Marketing in the ad campaigns but in
reality as a company that makes tons of
components and is doing all sorts of
worldwide business it's not that's not
the case like it's much more complicated
yeah they spread the bets around the
roulette table and they're basically
they're gonna do fine and that's that's
what they are they're a massive
electronics company so it's smart you
know is that you know I'm sure Samsung
would like to sell its own phones and
still do fantastically with that but to
be able to make these panels these OLED
panels that are gonna show up all over
the place that's a huge part and and to
have Apple beholdin to their OLED panels
is also a very powerful position for
Samsung to be in I mean until Apple
finds another supplier which could
potentially be LG at some point samsung
has some some very nice leverage on them
which which could be interestingly used
sometime in the future right and the
need for these types of panels is not
going to dissipate because there's gonna
be all sorts of products not just phones
down the road that I think it's it's a
it's an interesting landscape yeah
definitely but yeah I know your headsets
