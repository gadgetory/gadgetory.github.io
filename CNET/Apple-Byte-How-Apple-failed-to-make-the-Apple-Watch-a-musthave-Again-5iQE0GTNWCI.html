and welcome to the Apple buy for
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple now just like you I was
watching every second of Apple's keynote
so let's get to my reactions and it's
pretty clear the new macbook stole the
show
to simplify its essential components to
create the most efficient design
possible it's a product that couldn't
exist without invention across many
disciplines oh did I um just finish
watching an Apple porno because it was
that good now the new macbook delivered
with pretty much everything we expected
but even managed to blow us away with
its beautiful design Apple told us why
it's so unique from its butterfly
keyboard tech to its force touch pad
which is getting mixed reviews from
initial impressions but come on the
force is young with this one
now some of you may not like the single
USBC port and yes you'll need to get a
dongle to add more connectivity but this
is the future bi-directional power that
can also power multiple devices 10
gigabits per second data transfer rates
that are twice as fast as USB B you can
pop in any cable in any direction and
moving forward with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
will really need less and less cables in
the future now this is an even bolder
direction than before and I love
everything about it starting at $12.99
and $15.99 for the higher-end model plus
come on guys it comes in gold you know
which one I want so writing up that
killer momentum that had everyone
buzzing do you think Apple would swing
for the fences with the Apple watch I
was ready for them to show me that this
was actually worth getting but instead
they showed us everything we already
knew putting us to sleep with the same
low energy presentation that we saw last
time and spent 26 plus minutes doing
that until we saw the fact that it could
open up your garage door remotely and it
has an 18 hour battery life something
actually new really the devs are going
to make or break this product then Apple
tried seducing us with more sexy Apple
movies with Johnny ive saying aluminum
over and over not a menu and the
vineyard and the medium and the weight
you know how does he make it sound so
smooth I just can't do that but these
movies were about the metal in a watt
not the watch not the watch we're
talking metal is that what's going to
make you buy an Apple watch yeah sure
it's good on the eyes and gets me worked
up but that was pretty useless fluff and
the best part let's get to it
the pricing now the Apple watch sport
starts at 349 and 399 depending on size
with the entry-level rubber band
stainless steel version starts at 549
and $5.99 but wait a second where did I
hear that from before flashback I'm
dreaming they keep it at $4.99 but the
guess I'm going for is that Apple will
push it to 549 and $5.99 just because
yes then the 18 karat gold edition we
saw plenty of applause about the Apple
stores carplay coming to every major car
brand an apple's new health platform
called researchkit that will not be able
to see your data so what about when Tim
announced the $10,000 price tag it is
priced from $10,000
crickets even Apple's own employees in
the audience and management team
couldn't muster a single applause for
that and you know what that's a bad
apple for them now people are up in arms
about the price but I'm not even hating
on a $10,000 watch if you want it and
you can afford it go and get it but
there's just not a single one percenter
saying I can't wait to get the 18 karat
gold Apple watch with a rubber wristband
so Richie Rich's we're talking more like
starting at 15 grand which yeah I know
you can't afford but can we talk about
Christy Turlington see she made an
appearance in two-thirds of the audience
watching had no idea who she was but she
was there to talk about her half
marathon in Tanzania with the Apple
watch of course and her nonprofit so she
has this blog that's conveniently posted
on Apple's website about her journey now
here's an entry when I first got the
watch I went with the white sport band I
also chose the Milanese loop a couple of
leather options and a black sport band
so you know I could change it up
depending on my mood or where I am
wow it's good to be on Apple's gravy
train hashtag privilege so let's see
looking at the Apple Store a white sport
band costs around 50 bucks the Milanese
loop another 150 a couple of leather
options that's 150 times two more and
another black sport band at $50 yeah
Apple is so out of touch with this
honestly it's embarrassing and I'm not
asking you Apple to cater to the general
population with your pricing
you aren't but I'd really like to see
the ass from the cow that $150 leather
strap came from and you know what that's
a bad apple I was ready to give this
thing a chance and all Apple had to do
was show us three really cool features
in action that no other watch can do
they did that with the MacBook but they
didn't with the watch they actually made
the Apple watch appear less exciting
than it really is and something no one
is excited about as of right now the
latest iOS 8.2 update includes the Apple
watch app that is undeletable so it can
join all of iOS as other bloatware that
you can't delete like Game Center iBooks
and you stand that you hide in this
folder the best you can
this is just stupid and yeah you're
getting another bad apple all right
they're taking a beating but some of the
other nuggets from the event HBO now
streaming services coming exclusively to
the Apple TV for $14.99 if you haven't
already used your friends account to
watch HBO Go already and HBO's Richard
Meckler has a deep orange tan that I
couldn't even accomplish after spending
a week in Hawaii Plus Apple TV dropped
his price down to $69 which could be
setting us up for something new in the
fall in that area and in some of the
latest news after the event The Wall
Street Journal reports that the force
touch technology built into the Apple
watch and new 12-inch MacBook that lets
devices distinguish between a light tap
and a hard press will be coming to the
next iPhones and future Apple watch's
may gain additional casing options
beyond the aluminum stainless steel and
18 karat gold all right that's gonna do
it for this week we'd love to hear what
you thought about all the announcements
and we'll throw them into next week's
show you can always email us at the
Apple y2c Netcom or tweet me at Brian
Tong and you know maybe we can follow
each other on the internet in that
stalker sort of way
thanks for watching we'll catch you all
next time for another bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
