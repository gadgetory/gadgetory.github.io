and we're gonna take a look at the Sonos
playbar there have been rumors of a so
no sound bar for a long time now but
it's finally here although it's gonna
set you back seven hundred dollars now
on its own the play bar is actually kind
of plain looking which is a good thing
if you want it to blend in with your
home theater rather than stand out what
is unique is how short it is it's just
three point three five inches tall which
means it won't block your TV's remote
sensor like a lot of other sound bars do
the play bar is also unique and then it
can be positioned either flat on a
tabletop or flat up against a wall if
you have a wall-mounted set up Sonos
even includes two different remote
sensors on the play bar so it works well
in both positions you'll also notice
that Sonos doesn't include a remote in
the box so you're going to need to teach
it to respond to commands from your TV's
remote or your cable boxes remote
although the setup is pretty easy around
back is the Sonos is minimalist
connectivity there's just an optical
audio input to ethernet jacks and a
power port Sonos knows that you have
more than one home theater device which
is why they're expecting you to connect
all your devices directly to your TV
first then use your TV's optical output
to connect to the play bar in a lot of
ways it's a cleaner solution assuming
that your TV has enough inputs now
unlike a lot of sound bars at this price
range the play bar does not come with a
wireless subwoofer although it will work
with the Sonos sub which you can add
wirelessly to the system even better you
can add to play three speakers to the
system as rear channels creating a true
wireless 5.1 home theater system
although altogether that ends up being a
pretty expensive system but it is nice
if you've already bought into the Sonos
eco system and of course with the play
bar you get access to so Knossos
best-in-class digital music software and
that means you can access all of your
digital music including your personal
collection and nearly every important
streaming music service through Sonos
controller app and the big question with
the play bar is how does it sound and
well it's complicated it's outstanding
when it comes to virtual surround sound
so from just a single speaker you really
do get the impression that their sounds
coming from the sides of the room even
though you don't have speakers there but
on the other hand without the subwoofer
there's not a lot of bass here and that
really shows up if you're watching
action movies or especially if you're
listening to bass heavy music the other
thing is that the play bar does a lot of
sound processing to get that really big
sound and if you're an audio purist
you're really going to notice that
movies and music don't sound like you
expect them to and ultimately that's why
it's hard for me to love the play bar
it's just not a speaker that I'd want to
listen to every day now that's not going
to be the experience for everyone and
the play bar is a really nice solution
if you've already got Sonos components
and you want an easy way to get better
sound in your living room but there are
other sound bars around for the same
price that sounds significantly better
like the speaker craft cs3 and the
Harman Kardon SP 16 so if you don't
already have a lot of Sonos components
you'll want to check out those first I'm
Matthew Muscovy ak and this is the Sonos
playbar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
