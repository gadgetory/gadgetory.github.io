MacBook Pro has some new features to get
acquainted with first let's talk the
touch bar an OLED panel that sits above
the keyboard in place of the function
keys it's 60 pixels high and 20 170
pixels wide adapting what it shows on
screen based on the context of what
you're doing so if you're in a mail app
you'll have reply or forward controls
text formatting and quick type options
that predict what you might want to say
in the email or if you prefer talking in
emojis the touch bar lets you select
those two the multi-touch interface
means tap and slide motions for volume
switching browser tabs or even mixing
music are supported coming straight from
the iPhone the touch ID sensor on the
Mac is integrated into the power button
used to authorize payments with Apple
pay and quickly switch between users
it's a long overdue addition to the
laptop line it also hints at future
applications for biometric
authentication on the Mac beyond using
your Apple watch or a third-party app
skylake is the sixth generation of
Intel's Core eye chips and they're
finally available in the new MacBook
Pros dual core in the 13-inch and quad
core in the 15-inch just like before
it's not the seventh generation Intel KB
Lake process as many were hoping for but
a performance boost nonetheless with a
new space grey finish alongside the
traditional silver the laptop is lighter
and thinner than ever before the
butterfly keyboard and the force touch
trackpad are different to the MacBook
also has a new price the base 13-inch
model without a touch bar starts at
fifteen hundred US dollars that's $200
more than the base price of the last
generation 13-inch MacBook Pro if you
want the touch bar you'll have to pay
for the other 13 inch or 15 inch model
the iPhone 7 removed the headphone jack
and the MacBooks removed well just about
everything but the headphone jack
instead there are USB C ports two on the
entry-level 13 inch and 4 on the
higher-end 13 inch and 15 inch models
they can carry data connect to power
support HDMI out
but of course you'll need an adapter for
many devices think different maybe it
should be think dongle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
