and this is an epic battle between two
of the big boys in the smartphone world
it's a prize five put out between
apple's iphone 4s and the samsung galaxy
nexus on Sprint our judges for this
fight are senior editor Brian boom-boom
Bennet senior editor Jessica Duke it out
dole Court and myself ringa Linga ding
dong
we'll take all three judges scores and
average them out to the nearest tenth
each round the final prize five score
will be an average of all rounds using
the same system it's a five round
throwdown round one is designed the
iPhone 4s retains Apple's iconic design
there's no doubt it's a luxurious phone
with its 3.5 inch screen and an all
metal and glass body now I might be in
the minority that still thinks it's a
little blocky
but one drop of this phone and guess
what you're pretty much screwed now the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus brings a four point
six five inch Super AMOLED display that
pops with vibrant color and a curved
glass design it's bigger to hold but
it's also one of the few big screen
phones that fits in my pocket nicely the
phone has a textured plastic backing
that may not feel as premium but when
you drop it it has more than a chance to
survive beauty is in the eye of the
beholder and we're calling this round a
tie at for next round is user interface
and controller some of you might be a
little bored with iOS 5 by now but
Apple's nailed it with the easiest
pick-up-and-play OS on the planet that
even my unborn child can use over time
they've added features like quick access
to the camera a customizable
notifications drop-down in Syria is just
one button press away but there's also
the user that wants something sweeter
with more control Ice Cream Sandwich is
the answer and there's a higher learning
curve but it's the best flavor of
Android that we've seen to date that
feels modern and is still super
customizable this is another round that
comes down on what you like but our
editors give the iPhone for us a slight
edge with the 4.3 after our averaging
two rounds the 4s leads round three is
features
the iPhone 4s has been able to age
gracefully over time with HSPA+ support
that speedier but isn't true 4G it has a
dual-core processor Bluetooth 4.0 and
it's bag of goodies from iOS 5 now its
Retina display remains it's killer
feature Syria's half-baked and still
isn't ready for primetime no matter what
Apple tells you but the fluorescence
biggest drawback is that it's still a 3G
phone now the Galaxy Nexus can take a
moment to flex its muscle with 4G LTE
support that's on its way its larger
display is still sharp enough that you
won't really miss the Retina display
it's voice Actions have been around
since day one and it's turn-by-turn
directions still have no I o s equal
face lock isn't that big of a deal but
it's here if you're into yourself it
also brings Samsung's S beam similar to
Android Beam where you exchange data by
tapping it with another phone and it has
Google wall for mobile payments which is
useful but still has a long ways to go
to catch on mainstream and do we mention
4G LTE support neither phone has
expandable memory but the Galaxy Nexus
has a replaceable battery samsung
dominates this round with the perfect 5
and the iPhone gets a poor next round is
web browsing and multimedia the iPhone
4s brings one of the best mobile
browsers even without flash support and
it's crisp and tight with pinching and
zooming the Retina display still looks
great even if watching media on it feels
a lot smaller compared to the Galaxy
Nexus and the iTunes ecosystem still
delivers the largest library of media
content that you can find but his
standout feature is this truly amazing 8
megapixel camera that embarrasses
Samsung with more natural colors and
sharper images with both still pictures
and 1080p video it's really no contest
the Galaxy Nexus and its monster screen
actually makes navigating websites
easier and multimedia content looks
plain awesome there's an instant youtube
feature to upload videos and the Google
Play Store is now a legitimate ecosystem
with tons of app support and content
that's just slightly behind iTunes what
hurts of the most though is that in the
year 2012 a top-notch phone like this
brings a 5 megapixel camera now it
brings a lot more editing features and
we know megapixels don't mean
everything but it's camera quality is
disappointing and even it's cool
panorama feature and 1080p video can't
save it the iPhone 4s gets a perfect 5
this round and the Galaxy Nexus gets a
4.3 so after averaging four rounds we're
locked in a dead heat and tied the final
round that decides it all is called
quality and performance this round
partially comes down to carriers in
location but the iPhone 4s on Verizon
had great overall call quality and
clarity and our test now the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus on Sprint also sounded
excellent and solid as well data speeds
will vary wildly but using the
speedtest.net benchmark in San Francisco
the iPhone 4s was able to beat it out
for download speed but the Galaxy Nexus
had a better upload speed and that's
before the 4G LTE switch gets flipped
that will make a significant difference
and when it comes to battery life and
our video playback test the 4s was able
to get over eight hours of juice while
the Galaxy Nexus squeezed out over five
hours with this larger screen this one's
another close round but in the long run
4G LTE data makes the difference and the
Galaxy Nexus gets the edge with a four
point three to four so let's average out
all five rounds and in a prizefight
that's a photo finish
we had to nail this down to just one
hundredths of a point and the Galaxy
Nexus just gets by four point three two
to four point two six and is your prize
buy it wins i'm brian tom thanks for
watching we'll catch you guys next time
for another prizefight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
