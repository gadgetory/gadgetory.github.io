cable TV subscription you might start
looking for ways to record free
over-the-air TV that's available within
antenna there are a lot of options these
days from Aereo to channel masters DVR
plus and new vos tableau
but there's also an old familiar option
TiVo I'm Matthew Muscovy ak from see net
and the entry-level TiVo Romeo is
actually the best over-the-air DVR on
the market although it's going to cost
you the box itself is only $200 but you
also have to pay TiVo subscription fees
which is either fifteen dollars a month
or a whopping $500 lifetime subscription
that's a lot of money for a DVR so let's
look at what you're paying for first off
this is the sleekest most compact TiVo
yet with the curve stylus case that
looks better than any cable box you're
going to get from the cable company the
included remote has a classic TiVo
layout and that's great since it's still
one of the best remote designs out there
even better the remote works using RF
instead of traditional IR remote
commands so you can stick the TiVo
behind the cabinet and you can still
control it the Romeo can work with cable
but I'm going to focus on its appeal to
cord cutters using an antenna that means
assuming you get good reception you
should be able to watch CBS NBC Fox ABC
and PBS TiVo also has built-in Wi-Fi and
supports some streaming media services
including Netflix Hulu Plus MLB TV
YouTube Pandora and Spotify there is an
Amazon Instant app but it doesn't
support the prime videos that are free
with an Amazon Prime subscription so
that's a pretty big drawback overall
it's an OK list of apps but for this
price you definitely expect more where
the TiVo really shines is its interface
and the ability to handle recordings the
graphics are crisp and high def and it's
still the most intuitive interface there
is making it easy to find shows you want
to watch and manage your recordings the
speed of the Romeo is also a huge
improvement over prior TiVo's so zipping
in and out of menus feels really snappy
TiVo seasonpass feature is still a
standout letting you record all the new
episodes of your favorite shows with
exactly the settings that you'd like the
Romeo also has four built-in tuners so
you can record four shows at once or
record three shows while you're watching
another one live there's a 500 gigabyte
internal hard drive which holds 75 hours
of HD content and you always have the
option to add more space by connecting
an external hard drive and the Romeo
really stands out when you compare it to
other over-the-air recording solutions
especially when it comes to day to day
use every other solution has some
annoying quirks and drawbacks that begin
to grate over time but TiVo gets all the
little things right so it gets out of
your way and it just lets you watch TV
it's super reliable commercial skipping
is easy the interface feels snappy
over-the-air TV looks great it's all
enough to make you not really miss that
cable subscription at all and that's
really the best pitch for the TiVo Romeo
cutting the cord definitely has its
compromises but the Romeo makes it as
seamless of a transition as you could
hope for which makes you a lot less
likely to go back to that pricey cable
subscription I wish there was a cheaper
alternative that's nearly as good but
for now the TiVo Romeo is the best
over-the-air DVR solution there is if
you're willing to pay for it
I'm Matthew Muscovy ak from CNET and
this is the TiVo Romeo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
