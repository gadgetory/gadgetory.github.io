with this Santa Cruz concept bringing in
sort of equal parts of Subaru Brat Chevy
Avalanche and transformers what they're
looking at here is trying to blend the
utility of something with a bed with the
popularity of a crossover SUV and aim it
at Millennials of course that's where
your growth market is especially for a
popularly priced vehicle line now what's
interesting about the bed is that it's
very short as you can see but it extends
there's a drawer like apparatus that
kind of gives it momentary extra length
when you need to pick up something large
but normally don't need even a midsize
pickup truck inside of course you see
the cab is a two row apparatus you've
got a crew cab if you will and there are
little stubby mini doors behind the main
doors that are quite large those little
side rear doors are actually rear hinged
we used to call those suicide doors but
car makers don't like that up in the
very front we're looking at a 2-liter
turbo diesel engine nothing too
cutting-edge about that though it's not
that common in the US but it seems like
a very smart choice for a vehicle that
could really benefit from that kind of
torque but also that kind of small
displacement efficiency now noting
production about this they're putting
this out as a feeler to see what the
industry and of course the market thinks
about it but they seem to have struck a
very interesting note between crossover
and pickup this probably won't make it
to production but notice around the
wheel arches in particular they've got
anchor points where you can strap on
various sorts of things that will hold
your gear down seems like it would raise
hell with the paint but we'll see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
