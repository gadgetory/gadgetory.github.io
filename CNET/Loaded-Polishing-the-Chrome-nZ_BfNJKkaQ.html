Morris coming to you from San Francisco
this week it's time to get loaded google
took the wraps off its Chrome operating
system and Chrome App Store on Tuesday
the app store or marketplace is a place
where web applications live in the web
inside the Chrome browser and operating
systems so it's kind of like a website
that's customized for a web site a few
examples are NPR and Amazon's Kindle for
web that lets you read your books in
your web browser this will launch in the
chrome marketplace and in other browser
ecosystems as well the chrome
marketplace is open today in the u.s.
only and where do you run these apps in
the Chrome browser of course and where
can you find a computer with the Chrome
operating system well you can't just yet
the chrome powered laptops are coming
soon but not as soon as we thought
google says they're delayed due to a few
bugs due to be worked out Google is also
teasing us with a new android tablet the
company showed up a motorola tablet
running the next version of android
called gingerbread this was shown at a
conference here in San Francisco but
there are no real details about when or
how much the next version of internet
explorer will let you specify which
websites are not allowed to track you
the feature will allow users to
subscribe to Tracking Protection lists
which lists web addresses that you do
not want to access your information this
will prevent online tracking companies
from snooping on your browsing habits it
will be a feature on the up coming
internet explorer 9 sprint may be
looking to shut down Nextel in order to
save some cash these are of course hard
times for everyone sprint estimates that
closing down nextel would save them
about 11 billion dollars sprint
purchased next tale in 2005 for 35
billion dollars and be careful clicking
links in your Twitter feed a new virus
was spreading in tweets with the URL
shortener goo GL the virus tries to
redirect you to a malicious site that
tries to steal your passwords so if you
click something that looks fishy in your
twitter feed do not enter your password
close that window and move on quickly
three is out the new game has new
graphics sound and eight new minigames
it also has four new game modes it costs
twenty dollars and finally youporn is
involved in a lawsuit accusing the
company of tracking user behavior to men
in California have filed a class-action
suit against the porn sites parent
company for allegedly tracking their
online behavior via a JavaScript code
these men not only allege that you porn
did this but also that they are still
doing this so if you are on these adult
sites and you think you're alone you're
not you've been warned those are your
headlines for today I will see you
tomorrow I'm Natali Morris for cnet.com
and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
