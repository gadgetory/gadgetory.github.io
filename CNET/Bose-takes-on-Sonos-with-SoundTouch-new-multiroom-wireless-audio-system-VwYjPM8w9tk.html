cnet.com and I'm here at a townhouse in
Greenwich Village where bose is
demonstrating its new sound touch system
this is a Wi-Fi based multi-room audio
system and it has introduced three new
speakers the sound touch 30 which is the
largest system is designed for bigger
rooms that's $700 and there's the sound
touch 20 which is a little bit smaller
speaker that retails for $400 and then
there's an even smaller portable unit
the sound touch portable which is also
foreign dollars and that is designed to
be taken from room to room you can
unplug it and it does have a
rechargeable battery inside it the key
to the system is that bose has tried to
make it ultra simple thus the sound
touch name there are six buttons on top
of these units they correspond to six
presets in the app so you can set any
radio station or Pandora it will launch
with Pandora and in future software
upgrades they'll add additional services
next year you can also obviously stream
your music library from your computer
and map one of those presets to your
music library all the speakers are
designed to work with the apps and you
can add various rooms by adding various
speakers they're also airplay compatible
so if you want to go straight to one of
the speakers using airplay from your
smart your iOS device you could also do
that the units also come with a IR
remote with those same corresponding six
buttons so if you don't want to use the
app you can use that little remote
additionally Bose is going to be selling
a special sound touch controller it's a
little bit fancier remote that is also
designed with to work with all the
systems so look for more Bose soundTouch
products later this year and next year a
couple other things worth mentioning on
the two non portable speakers there is
an Ethernet connection so you can use
these as a wired speaker and add them to
your network
there's also an auxilary input so you
can play other audio sources through the
speaker without going wireless in terms
of streaming from room to room you can
stream to one single speaker and have a
play in just in that room or you can
combine various rooms and join them up
and have the music play everywhere
throughout your home the Bose soundTouch
app which is free will be available for
iOS Android and both Mac and Windows PCs
so all in all an interesting move by
Bose until now Sonos has really own this
multi-room audio in the consumer space
but with Bose going into it obviously
it's going to put a lot of marketing
dollars behind this
so I'd say son√≠s will have its first
big competitor here
and we'll look forward to testing these
products further I'm David karna and
that's the new Bose soundTouch
multi-room audio system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
