camera the 360 fly 4k it's a single lens
360-degree camera that's water-resistant
to 10 meters shockproof and dustproof
that's tougher than other 360 cams and
some design improvements from the
original such as a standard tripod mount
and a bigger brightly lit power and
record button make it much easier to use
it can record 360 by 240 degree video
and photos which isn't spherical but it
still captures a lot of the scene and
there's no stitching necessary it can
also do flat widescreen Clips for when
you don't want 360 you control it all
with its mobile app and it's the app
that really sells the camera because it
makes it simple to view and edit and
share you can also install the live
streaming app from limit and use the 360
fly to livestream straight to live its
site using your phone's mobile
connection there's a good desktop app
too if you'd rather do your editing
there what's unfortunate is the video
quality is sort of a mixed bag it looks
really good on a small screen like a
smartphone or tablet which is the best
way to experience it anyway however it's
noticeably soft toward the bottom and
there is heavy purple fringing in high
contrast areas almost to the point of
distraction otherwise this $500 camera
is a pretty great option to let viewers
immerse themselves in your experiences
whether they're recorded or live</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
