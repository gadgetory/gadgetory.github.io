a MacBook a new report from analysts at
Goldman Sachs predicts that the iPhone
eight will cost more than $1,000 it may
sound crazy to say that a phone is going
to cost the same as a laptop but it's
not that far-fetched just look at
Apple's current top align iPhone 7 plus
the most expensive model is 970 dollars
this year marks the 10th anniversary of
the iPhone Apple wants it to be
something special and there have been
numerous reports that the company's
patent it with more features and a
different design to make it really stand
out from past iPhones that means Apple
could charge more for a premium model
right now the 128 gig version of the
iPhone 7 is about $750 goldman sachs
says the same storage on the iphone 8
could start at 1 grand and not just
because it'll have a larger 5.8 inch
screen but that it may have something
really compelling like a camera with 3d
sensing augmented reality abilities
Goldman Sachs is recommending investors
buy Apple shares because this more
expensive iPhone will drive earnings
above expectations and you the consumer
who must have the new iPhone a show-off
won't mind it's just a few more payments
on your installment plan right I'm
Bridget Carey and if you can't wait to
speculate about the iPhone 8 which won't
even come out for another 4 months you
