and you're looking to invest in a high
quality wireless speaker this is your
guy
I'm just new editor at C net this is a
quick review of the Altec Lansing in err
5000 airplay speaker so what is airplay
well it's Apple's wireless standard that
connects all of their products using the
touch of a button
now the draw of using airplay over other
wireless audio standards like bluetooth
for example is that you're not going to
suffer a cut in sound quality as it
sends the signal through the air so
basically you're gonna enjoy that same
fidelity as you would through a hard
wired connection in fact if you're
looking at blast music throughout your
entire home a Bluetooth speaker really
isn't gonna cut it this one is it has
two two-inch drivers and two tweeters in
the front that handle the mid-range and
treble signals while a rear firing four
inch subwoofer sits in the back to add a
rumbling sensation to whatever surface
you put the speaker on and thankfully
unlike most hi-fi speakers in the home
this one's not going to take up much
room at all it's oblong shape and
low-profile chassis has a tapered
teardrop style design that's gonna fit
well into style centric homes and all
the controls you need to play music and
connect all your iOS devices sit cleanly
on either side on the left you'll find a
button to put it in sleep mode an
auxiliary button for playing music out
of any media with a three-and-a-half
millimeter jack and ports for headphones
and that external audio source flip it
around and the other side has a couple
more buttons for adjusting volume and
another that meets the sound entirely
the rest of the controls are on the back
panel and include a power port and
Ethernet port if your home has a weak
wireless signal a Wi-Fi connect button
that you'll use during the setup process
and a reset button so the real beauty of
airplay is a simple pairing process you
can connect to any iOS device including
iPhones iPads and even iTunes powered
desktop computers just use the USB
charging cable that came with your iPad
or iPhone to plug it in and the speaker
will automatically prompt you to
download the in-air 5000 app from here
all you have to do is specify which
wireless network you want to use and
it'll shake hands right away and after
all set up you'll never need to enter in
that network ID information again to
play music through the speaker just
press the up arrow button to the right
of your phone's music player and select
it to play now retailing at five hundred
bucks it's true that this speaker costs
just as much as your iPad but it does
earn high points in sound quality and
performance so with its modest design
simple installation and booming sound I
definitely recommend the speaker for
Audio lovers without the constraints of
a budget you can read all the details
with more pictures in my full review on
CNET com but that's gonna do it for me
I'm Justin you this is the altec lansing
in air 5,000 and that sounds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
