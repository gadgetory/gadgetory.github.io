your CDs anymore between iTunes and
Spotify and about a hundred other
services anything you've listened to can
be downloaded again or stream to your
convenience but there are some
exceptions you're probably holding on to
a box full of rare sentimental mix CDs
that you haven't yet gotten onto your
computer and let go of I'm gonna show
you how to do that quickly and
painlessly so here's what you're going
to need you're going to need a computer
with the CD Drive and itunes on it could
be any version of itunes you're gonna
need your CDs and you're gonna need a
smartphone the first step is to take a
picture of your CD now this one is a
great example this is a CD I got from a
friend in Japan this cover this is what
I'm sentimental about so I'm gonna take
a picture of this and if you can put
this into square mode that's gonna
really save yourself some time and some
cropping take the picture boom and then
email it to yourself so now the next
step is to get the CD into your computer
now once the cds in itunes is gonna
automatically try to pull down any
information that it might have about the
CD it's gonna try it's best to identify
the tracks and the titles but in this
case because this is a one-of-a-kind CD
itunes is gonna draw a blank it's gonna
give me a generic listing called audio
CD and generic tracks called track 13 14
so the trick is we need to identify all
this information ourselves to do that
hit the CD info button i'm just going to
put my friend's name on here the artist
album is going to be CD from japan
that's probably how I'll remember it
alright the next step here is to import
the CD you go and hit the import CD
button in the top right corner you're
gonna get a box that will let you change
how you're gonna import the CD for me
there's more about sentimentality than
about audio quality I'll go with an AAC
at about 128 kilobits per second it's
gonna give you better quality than mp3
at about the exact same amount of time
if you're really gonna go crazy with the
steps can go all the way up to lossless
audio quality but after you do a few of
these you're gonna realize that speed is
much more important than audio file
quality
all right now I've got the CD in our
library with album artwork one more tip
though if you want to add more images
than just that one to your album you can
go track by track hit get info and add a
separate image you get creative alright
so that's the entire process for
digitizing your CDs into your iTunes
library now for an extra added value you
can take advantage of Apple's iTunes Mac
service where for 2499 a year you can
upload all the stuff to the cloud and
have it backed up and be able to stream
it back to any of your Apple devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
