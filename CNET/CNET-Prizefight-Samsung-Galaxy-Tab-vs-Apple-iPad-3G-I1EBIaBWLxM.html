and this is the first-ever prizefight
tablet work that you've been asking for
it's a prize five points out between the
Samsung Galaxy Tab and apple's ipad 3g
our judges for this fight are senior
editor donald Saved by the Bell
senior associate editor Jessica dish in
mount dole Court and Bryant
ring-a-ling a ding dong now we'll take
all three judges blind scores and
average them out to the nearest tenth
each round the final price white score
be an average of all rounds using the
same decimal system let's get ready to
rumble round one is design Samsung's
Galaxy Tab has a solid design with its
seven inch screen and curved corners
that's less than half the size of the
iPad it's lighter and more comfortable
to hold the tabs 1024 by 600 resolution
on a smaller screen brings a slightly
crisper image button left us wanting
more and buy more we mean screen size
the iPad brings apples highest level of
design and it's nine point seven inch
screen is big but its design is if bulky
the metal finish and curved edges are
gorgeous and it's 1024 by 768 display
just pops it might be heavier than you
like but it feels like it's worth every
penny Apple's iPad gets a perfect 5 and
Samsung's Galaxy Tab gets a 4 next
rounds controls and user interface the
Galaxy Tab is pure Android and if you've
used it before you'll feel right at home
one issue is that it's the exact same
experience you would get on a phone
there's nothing that makes it unique for
a tablet you'll still get the same
customization but widgets don't align
with icons hitting the Menu button to
access app features on the Android OS
bug Donald the swipe input method is
here but at the end of the day newcomers
to tablets might feel intimidated by its
learning curve now it doesn't matter if
you've used an iPhone or iPod the iPads
user interface is so simple that several
judges mentioned how our nieces and
nephews one and a half years and older
can all use the iPad we keep saying it
but it's still amazing how easy it is to
use the keyboard is more spacious and
comfortable for typing and the iPad was
snapping or navigating overall the iPad
strikes hard with it
second perfect routes and the Galaxy Tab
gets up to three point three this after
averaging two rounds Apple leads by more
than a point but there's plenty of fight
to go round three of speeches and
performance the tab has everything that
iPad users have been craving for with
front and rear facing cameras with a
flash a micro SD card slot wireless
hotspot capability and flash 10.1
support it also comes packed with
Google's goodies like voice search and
commands Google navigation and access to
key services in the notifications
pulldown apps from the marketplace are
still built for phones and just don't
take full advantage of the screen real
estate they're just bigger the tab is
also a step behind performance wise with
a few laggy moments and it's battery
life is shorter by three hours now the
iPad can't match up with the hardware
features but it's still the snappiest
tablet on the market with significantly
better battery life the new control
strip is a nice addition but changing
the orientation button to a mute button
is idiotic
it also has plenty of apps built
specifically to use the larger form
factor and it makes for a better user
experience but it's not enough as the
tab finally takes its first round with a
four and the iPad gets a 3.3 next round
is web browsing a multimedia the tabs
web browser is a solid offering but it's
frustrating how it goes directly to most
of the mobile versions of websites by
default even with the seven-inch screen
the experience can be a little cramped
now flash playback can be hit or miss
and it has locking moments when you're
pinching and zooming into websites
Samsung's media hub is a nice way to get
media content but it still has a long
ways to go the three megapixel rear
camera is mediocre but one advantage is
that it's easier to hold and use as an
e-book reader now the iPads web browser
is a full-screen multi-touch version of
Safari that actually makes web browsing
more fun and takes advantage of its
space even though it doesn't have flash
the multimedia experience is
one-of-a-kind with its deep library of
content from iTunes it has a polished
media player multimedia app sets add
more access to content and a large
screen that enhances the experience
the iPad gets a 4.7 and the tab gets a 4
so after averaging four rounds Apple's
lead has been trimmed down to seven
tenths of a point the final round that
decides it all is value the Samsung
Galaxy Tab can be purchased with a
two-year contract on t-mobile or Sprint
for 399 or without a contract on all
four carriers for around $5.99 data
plans vary but at that price you're
almost paying the same price of an ipad
3g for half the screen size apple's ipad
3g starts at six hundred and twenty nine
dollars with no contract an apple broke
new ground with affordable data plans
the Wi-Fi only model gives you even
lower pricing but if you're looking for
the best bang for your buck it's the
iPad tablet prices are still a little
high overall but in the final round the
iPad gets of four and Samsung's Galaxy
Tab gets a three so let's average out
all five rounds and enterprise buy where
Apple came out swinging with
back-to-back perfect rounds the Galaxy
Tab closed the gap but it was just too
much to overcome and the apple ipad 3g
takes this first-time tablet face off
four point four to three point seven and
is your prize fight winner both of these
tablets are great picks and will fit
different needs but this young market
will constantly be flooded with new
contenders and the war for prize fight
supremacy rages on
i'm brian tom thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time on another
prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
