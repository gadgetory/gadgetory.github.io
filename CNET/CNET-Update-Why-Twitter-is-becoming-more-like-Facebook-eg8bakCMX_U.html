Twitter wants to be like Facebook and
Google+ can't get any respect I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update your Twitter profile will start
to look just like your facebook profile
in the coming weeks Twitter users will
see a new layout that moves the profile
photo to the side and stretches the
header image all the way across and
would you look at that it reminds you of
Facebook doesn't it say goodbye to the
twitter background image because now
it's white previously on Twitter the
header and the profile pictures were in
one column with your little square photo
in the center but it's not just a layout
change you'll be able to pin a tweet to
the top of your page so if you sent
something out in the middle of the night
it won't go on scene just pin it to your
profile so visitors can be reminded of
your witty tweets and when browsing
other profiles you can choose to see
just tweets or tweets with photos or
replies basically twitter is on a
mission to make it easier to sort
through the clutter and they hope a new
profile layout can grow the user base
and get more people tweeting samsung's
new as smart watches are not even in
stores yet but already there are rumors
about a new model the Korea Herald
reports samsung is working on a
standalone SmartWatch that doesn't
require a smartphone to work no
bluetooth necessary it would be called
the gear solo but in the meantime check
out cnet's full review of the gear fit
SmartWatch and the Samsung Galaxy s5
both hitting stores april eleventh it's
time to bid farewell to windows XP
microsoft will no longer offer support
to windows XP so if there's a new
security flaw or a major bug discovered
too bad Microsoft will not be sending
out a patch to fix any problems windows
XP has been around for 12 years and even
though it's over a decade old tons of
computers still a running windows XP and
that's especially so for small
businesses and doctors offices it's
estimated that around twenty to thirty
percent of all Windows PCs run XP and
ninety-five percent of ATM machines use
it as the operating system it doesn't
mean that all these computers will get
hacked overnight
but they are an easy target for those
looking to spread malware or steal
personal information Windows XP is more
vulnerable than other systems and
everyone has known for several years
that april eighth would be the day that
XP would no longer be protected so if
you were a hacker and you knew of a
security hole wouldn't you strike now
when Microsoft drops his defense but for
those of you that do have a new Windows
8 computer the latest 8.1 upgrade is
available now which adds familiar
features like a taskbar close buttons
and easier to find settings that's your
