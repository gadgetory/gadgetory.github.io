in your kitchen and now that mercury
trapped inside is exposed into your home
how do you safely clean that up how do
you get rid of that broken bulb I'm
seeing that's right Chris don't worry
I'm going to show you how right away
after breaking that bulb the first thing
you're going to want to do is to air out
that part of your home that means
opening up the windows closing doors off
to other parts of the home getting pets
out of there all of that and then just
taking about 15 minutes to let things
air out you also want to be sure you
turn off your central air conditioning
you don't want that system pulling the
mercury up into your house and
distributing it everywhere that's just
not good after the rooms been airing out
for 15 minutes it's safe to go back in
and clean the mess up now keep in mind
the amount of mercury in a CFL bulb is
only about 1% what you'll find in a
thermometer so it's not that much of a
safety hazard still you want to be
careful you want to take it seriously if
you have a mask it might be a good idea
to wear one I'd probably wear one if I
had one now keep in mind as you're
cleaning up that everything that touches
that broken mess is going to be
contaminated with the mercury so you
don't want to use a broom you don't want
to use your vacuum cleaner either
because like the AC system that's going
to kick the particles up into the air
what you want to do is scoop that mess
up with a piece of paper or a piece of
cardboard and get it into a sealable
container a glass jar with a metal lid
is your best bet but if you don't have
that you can use Tupperware you can use
a plastic bag less ideal but they'll
work you also want to make sure that you
throw that piece of paper or cardboard
away in that container you want to seal
all that contaminated stuff up together
after you've gotten the big chunks up
you can use a piece of duct tape just to
get the rest of the powder in the glass
up and like the piece of paper make sure
you throw that used tape into your
contaminated bag once you've got mostly
everything up the final step to cleaning
it is to take a damp paper towel or a
wet wipe and just go over the area just
make sure it's nice and clean looking
that you've got every particle that you
can see up and under your towel and into
that bag congratulations you have
cleaned up that broken bulb and gotten
it into a sealed container and at this
point you're going to want to wash your
hands but you've got this sealed
container now filled with mercury
contaminated glass water and tape what
do you do with that well you can take it
to a recycling center in your town and
they'll probably take it off your
at the appropriate place here in
Louisville we can only recycle a broken
bulb on Wednesdays and Saturdays which
isn't terribly convenient if you break a
bulb on a Sunday so there you have next
time you break a CFL in your home you'll
know how to clean it up safely and how
to get rid of those broken pieces
responsibly that sounds like too much
work
I recommend replacing that CFL with a
bulb it doesn't have mercury like an LED
CNET I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
