unveiled its cloud connected
voice-activated smart speaker now Amazon
echo has come quite a long way adding
all sorts of features and integrations
and extra tricks up its sleeve to help
make your smart home smarter at its core
it pitches itself as a music streamer
you can ask Alexa to stream any type of
music or any specific song or band you
want to hear and it's in the Amazon
Prime music library it'll play it now
echo worked with even more services
including Pandora and Spotify so you
have access to a lot more music but echo
is more than that this is not just a
music streamer with cloud connected
smarts this is a connected home
experience this is a product that gives
you the smart home you didn't know you
wanted what Amazon figured out is that
we interact with our homes more than
anything
an echo can serve as a better user
interface for your home think about all
the things you might do in your daily
routine
listening to music listening to a
podcast setting a kitchen timer as you
cook turning your lights on and off echo
can make all those things easier and
more convenient and more futuristic in a
way that's also accessible that's a
pretty impressive accomplishment for a
single product now for all those smart
home integrations everything from Belkin
Wemo switches to philips hue bulbs to
smart things controlled setups there's
still more we wish echo could do I'd
love to see echo integrate with Smart TV
sets we could ask the LexA to turn a TV
onto CNN or whatever channel you want to
watch and on the sound quality front
while HECO provides a good experience in
general for most environments the base
is a little bit weak at high volumes it
would be great if echo could let you add
additional speakers you know interface
with other subwoofers and systems in
your home to pipe the audio through and
make it more of a control point all of
that said echos potential is very clear
at this point Amazon has done an
admirable job of rolling out different
third-party integrations and all sorts
of cool tricks through if tour through
other products that work with it all of
that keeps making an already smart
product a lot smarter and more useful in
your home and that's only going to
continue as time goes forward
