with a new interface big enhancements to
our most popular apps and something all
new we call continuity now I want to
start with design OS 10 of course
started with a bold design of aqua and
over the years it's evolved to the
refined look we all love today in
Mavericks what with Yosemite we continue
this evolution you know we started with
the most fundamental controls focused
always on clarity as well as utility we
refined the toolbars and the window
materials and the window constructions
if you look at the window title bar
you'll see how the use of translucent
materials gives you a sense of place as
you scroll your content now the same
carefully crafted translucent materials
are used in the sidebars so now your
windows take on the personality of your
desktop as you change your desktop
picture your window adapts to reflect
that personality in that temperature and
that translucency also helps maintain a
sense of depth and place as you move
your windows over one another now we
also use the same gorgeous translucent
material for the dock and check out
these beautifully crafted new icons so
clean and yet so fundamentally still Mac
and check out that trash can that is a
gorgeous trash can you wouldn't believe
how much time we spent crafting a trash
can so we also focused on precise and
consistent typography throughout so from
the menus to the window chrome to
application controls consistent and
clear type now we know for our Pro users
often they really want to focus on the
center of the screen and not be
distracted by bright menus and bright
docks so we also introduced a dark mode
so spotlight has always been super fast
way to launch applications and find
content local on your Mac and Yosemite
is a great new interface so when you
click on the magnifying glass and the
toolbar you get a big field right in the
middle of the display and if you just
type a few characters you can launch an
app just like that or type the name of a
document and you get great search
results in an inline preview it's really
awesome now in addition to these sources
local to your Mac we also tap into
sources of information on the internet
so for instance type a few characters in
like Yosemite you can get news feed
information from Wikipedia and even maps
all at your fingertips let's launch an
app I'm going to start here with mats
and I want you to observe that as I
scroll the content of the map the way
that the title bar actually reacts its
translucency in color to the content
beneath its just really gorgeous I'm
going to launch now another app calendar
so calendar has a new look for a week
view but also an all-new debut and you
notice here on debut I have all of my
meetings in the day right here on the
left and on the right I get details
about my appointments so for instance
here two o'clock we have our executive
karaoke outing that's going to be a big
blast so it it's right there you you
want to probably drop in on that if you
get the chance so let's take a look now
at messages so messages you see this use
of the translucent sidebar material how
it reacts subtly to the background it's
really nice and how the contents of the
title bar react as I scroll content
underneath it's really cool I never next
take a look at Notification Center so
course i have my notifications here but
i also have two day view so i can see my
calendar at a glance my whether these
are interacted so i can click get hourly
weather clock interact with stocks for
instance or even reminders so here I'm
supposed to practice for a demo and I
forgot to do that but it's too late now
so we'll send that one on its way now of
course I can edit these widgets as well
just click the edit button down here and
you see widgets available to me right
here on the side
these are all from apps that can export
widgets so I'm just going to drag out
calculator add that in here just like
that or even a third-party widget let's
drag one of those in ESPN sportscenter
so right there I get all my information
right at a glance so next spotlight so
I'm going to click here on the
magnifying glass and boom got a search
field right in the middle of the screen
can type just a couple of characters to
launch an app like our new reminders
there it is it's that easy but of course
spotlight is great for looking at people
too so I'm going to look up phil
schiller here there's Phil and you see I
have all of his contact information here
but i also have matches on mail from
Phil Phil and I are planning a camping
trip he's a bit of a gear nut and has
something he wants to try out on our
trip we also have events and reminders
so we have here that are meeting at the
campsite and good i see that a jeff and
johnny are both in on the trip as well
and i'll tell you you you just have not
had chili by the campfire till you've
eaten it with one of Johnny's custom
crafted aluminium spoons it's uh it's
the diamond-cut chamfered edges that
really make the experience so ah so i'm
working on a document as well to help a
plan our trip now there are a lot of
waste of course to find documents but
one way now is by app so this is a
numbers document I type numbers and you
see in addition to the app I get all my
recent documents that I've opened with
that app and I can access them right
here so let's open up my hiking trip and
here we see that the trip is planned to
involve a 16-point four mile hike and
you know being an operations
professional jeff is a big stickler for
the metric system and so fortunately
spotlight has my back I can just type in
16.4 miles here and I get an instant
conversion to kilometers so that's
awfully handy we do all kinds of
conversions I drop that in fix that
document right
well you know i'm looking to plan a
dinner and maybe a movie out and now
without even launching an app i can just
do a look up for sushi for instance and
we see i have maps results right here
right inside of spotlight and of course
in addition the map information we've
got pictures great information from yelp
so all right there and to wrap it up i
want to go out to a movie you can just
type in Godzilla here oh there we go
Godzilla and you see I have showtimes
for the where it's playing near me right
here in spotlight as well as content I
can stream from the itunes store all in
spotlight that's a quick look at the new
UI of Yosemite</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
