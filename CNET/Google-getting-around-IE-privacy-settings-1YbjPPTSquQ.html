Richard carrion Cena calm and it's time
to get loaded microsoft says google is
not playing nice with privacy
preferences and is finding ways to avoid
following a user's privacy settings in
Internet Explorer browsers this reveal
comes days after the wall street journal
reported that Google found a way to get
around privacy settings in Apple Safari
web browsers so it can make money off ad
tracking cookies days after that report
microsoft said that google was also
skirting its browser rules and using
code to continue to track users web
habits with cookies even if the user
specified in settings that they did not
want to be tracked Google responded
saying that it wasn't practical to
comply with Microsoft's request while
providing modern web functionality
pinterest a virtual pinboard website is
the hot new social network but as it
grows with record speed it's making
adjustments to iron out potential kinks
kinks like copyright laws the site which
allows users to post cool photos and
articles they find across the web has
been criticized as possibly violating
copyright laws because users can share
images they don't have the rights to so
this week websites can now avoid having
their links shared on pinterest if they
so wish of course many websites will
want to continue to ride that Pinterest
traffic wave pinterest drives so much
traffic to other websites one analyst
group says it brings in the same amount
of traffic as twitter every day our tech
lifestyle seems to get more cloudy when
it comes to online storage that is
microsoft is evolving its cloud storage
service called SkyDrive to be a desktop
app within the new windows 8 operating
system SkyDrive is Microsoft's answer to
Apple's iCloud service SkyDrive will
fetch remote files from the web so users
can access files while moving between
computers Barnes &amp;amp; Noble is heating up
the competition between amazon's kindle
fire tablet Barnes &amp;amp; Noble introduced a
cheaper version of its new nook tablet
with less memory putting it at the same
price as the fire 199 dollars the
showdown between these reader tablets is
now on an even battleground for Hardware
both of the same size both have eight
gigs of storage the same RAM even the
same processing power what it comes down
to now for consumers is preference to
the case
design screen display software features
and media content but if you're one of
the few that invested in the other 7
inch tablet last year the blackberry
playbook and update is finally available
the playbook OS two point O includes
features like a standalone email client
with a unified inbox a built-in calendar
and an application for contacts the only
way to access email calendars and
contacts in that previous version was to
link it with an existing blackberry
phone if ahead standalone email feature
to begin with the PlayBook would have
likely seen more success those are your
headlines for today I'm Bridget Carey
