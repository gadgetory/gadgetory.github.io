Logitech c920 driving force wheel that
they design for Xbox one it also works
on PC there's a few games that works
with right now I think project cars is
one game Forza Motorsport 6 which is the
game I'm going to be trying out with
this now is also compatible and this
thing is kind of amazing
now the gear shift is sold separately
for $60 so that doesn't come with the
wheel but the wheel and the pedals go
for $400 but this is some high quality
stuff I mean we're talking about a
leather-wrapped steering wheel this
gives you force feedback and vibrates it
auto turns to get you straightened out
on the road it is fully featured it's
got stainless steel features the pedals
it's got a gas brake and a clutch
everything's adjustable if you had we
don't obviously have a gaming chair here
but if you had a gaming chair you could
actually mount this and the pedals into
the frame of the chair so I'm going to
start this race I have not been playing
this game for a while so you're probably
going to laugh a little bit at my skills
or lack thereof but let's start while
I'm using this for the first time in 4
to 6 I'm noticing the wheel is super
sensitive like the amount of resistance
on this wheel as you can see is crazy it
feels like the car is really struggling
to turn and the wheel is letting you
know just how tight these turns can be
as I skid off the road and into the
grass but that's fine so the wheel will
automatically adjust itself to 12
o'clock aside from my apparently awful
racecar driving skills this thing feels
awesome this product along with its $400
price tag is probably best suited for
somebody who is a hardcore racecar
driving simulator gamer man I'm really
frustrated with the controls on the
maybe it's I'm just not I'm not good at
this but it seems like I'm doing it okay
oh and I just got left I really do think
this is a high-quality product from
Logitech I'm just not very good at it
but if you love racing and racing is
your passion you're gonna love it
it's a lot of money though so just keep
that in mind and it only really works
with a couple game what it works for PC
as well so there you have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
