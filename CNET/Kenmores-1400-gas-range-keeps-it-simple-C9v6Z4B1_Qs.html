enforcing an appliances looking at the
Kenmore seven four three four three a
$1400 gas range I wasn't particularly
blown away by this range when I first
looked at it it doesn't have a
remarkable design it doesn't come with a
griddle pan or any other advanced
features but it's really really
versatile and a really really
well-rounded model so take performance
we boiled water we broiled burgers we
cooked hamburgers we made chicken all
kinds of stuff on the cooktop and in the
oven and it did pretty well overall
that's kind of the general theme for
this model it's not spectacular at
anything but it's really really good all
around especially when you factor in
that $1400 value specifically for
performance it got kind of a
middle-of-the-road score for its small
burner boil test and for its hamburger
boil test but for the large burner boil
test it was the fastest out of any of
the gas ranges we've tested today it
actually got the job done in nine
minutes and 45 seconds the others are 11
minutes plus I also really liked the
touchpad on this model a lot of them are
either too sensitive or not sensitive
enough but this one sits right in the
middle
this $1400 range may not look like much
to begin with but I was really taken by
its understated competence it's really
really well-rounded and it's an
excellent value and I highly recommend
it thanks for watching this review of
the Kenmore seven four three four three
