welcome to geek pop this is the show
where we keep you up to date on the
latest movies TV DVDs books and more
anything that's hot news in the geek
world because we are nothing if not
experts on being total dorks let's get
started this week with movies new in
theaters this week is 21 which is based
on the book bringing down the house the
inside story of 6 MIT students who took
Vegas for millions it's a movie about
counting cards in order to beat the game
of blackjack see but what we liked about
the book was the actual geekiness and
kind of the cool math factor of counting
cards and this movie looks like it's got
some suspiciously hot math nerds and a
little too much action
also coming out this week superhero
movie starring Drake Bell and sara
paxton em who you know drinking Sara you
love me Rick also Leslie Nielsen now
you're talking it's your basic movie
genre spoof this time it takes off
spider-man you've totally seen this
movie and finally in limited release
starting March 28 American zombie it's a
documentary about the zombie experience
in America Nina Tommy doesn't exclude me
being human actually that's a
mockumentary Tom I can't believe the
bravery of the zombies who came forward
to speak on camera it's truly a
groundbreaking piece of documentary
filmmaking I mean it's about time
zombies finally get their day uh-huh and
on that note let's turn our attention to
television there's really only one topic
in television between now and april
fourth and possibly beyond Battlestar
Galactica who you have Battlestar
Galactica fever right now the final
season of BSG premieres on April fourth
but this may not be the end zone oh
that's right sci fi has green-lighted a
two-hour pilot of Caprica a prequel to
battlestar galactica Caprica starts 50
years before Battlestar and focuses on
the two families who created the Cylons
one of those families clan Adama ah
dishy of course it sounds like Caprica
will be very soap opera like and focused
on the relationships which probably
translates into a lower budget and a lot
less space porn probably more Caprica
porn though leading up to the premiere
sci-fi will air to half our BSG specials
March 28th you'll have Battlestar
Galactica revealed and Battlestar
Galactica the phenomenon we also have a
one lone piece of naan BSG TV news
Jericho has been cancelled again this
week's episode was the series finale
they tried to wrap the whole thing up in
one short hour which is why I am hoping
that the rumors of sci-fi or FX picking
it up are going to come true I mean come
on the internet loves Jericho we'll all
watch it enough non Battlestar news
let's wrap things up with DVDs season 3
of battlestar is finally available on
DVD as of March 18th so if you're not
caught up no excuse now and don't forget
to watch razor indeed also i am legend
came out on DVD on the 80s as well and
promised to include bonus scenes like
maybe this scenes where they didn't
change the ending from the book we
actually recommend you go around one of
the other movies based on the IM legend
book Oh Megaman Charlton Heston or the
last man on earth starring Vincent Price
which is probably the closest to the
original book in fact the book's author
Richard Matheson actually wrote the
screenplay for last man on earth under a
pseudonym you know the original book and
movies were actually considered vampire
stories not zombie stories that came
later we'll trivia for you and that will
do it for us we're gonna wander off into
a dark corner and snack on some tasty
human treats like candy or brains thanks
for joining us on geek pop we'll be back
next time with a new list of the fresh
releases and dishy news delicious
