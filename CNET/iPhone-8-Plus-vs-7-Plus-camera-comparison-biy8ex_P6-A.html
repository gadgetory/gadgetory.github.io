video but now it has a younger sibling
the iPhone 8 plus with larger camera
sensors a faster processor and a new
software trick called portrait lighting
mode but just how much better is the 8
plus to find out
I took them around San Francisco for a
good old fashioned iPhone camera
shootout first stop was Dolores Park in
the mission over all photos and videos
from the 8 plus had a touch more detail
saturation and dynamic range than those
from the 7 plus here's a panning view of
Dolores Park the video from the 8 plus
handles the highlights of the palm trees
better and has a tad more saturation in
the Greens of the grass and the Blues of
the sky the same is true with photos
look at this picture of Stella the cat
taken with the 7 plus now here she has
taken with the 8 plus both photos are
good but the one from the 8 plus has a
bit more detail in her fur and a
slightly wider dynamic range of colors
and then there's portrait mode it was
first introduced on the 7 plus and uses
the two rear cameras to simulate an
artistic blurry background the 8 plus
improves on this by adding new lighting
effects which are currently in beta
portrait mode photos taken the 8 plus
pop a bit more than those from the 7
plus some of the new lighting effects
are better than others with natural
light studio light and contour light
working the best stage light and stage
light mono which completely black out
the background weren't consistent they
often looked a bit Picasa like and not
in a good way but when a stage light
effect shot did work pictures looked
stunning my next stop was a top twin
piece to watch the sunset over the city
look I don't like using a flash on any
phone it's distracting and your subject
turns into a glowing white light zombie
against a dark background but Apple
address this on the 8 and 8 plus with a
new feature called slow sync flash
basically the cameras shutter stays open
longer making the background look less
dark and this is hands-down my favorite
feature on the A+ and it works really
well
but there are times where a flash is not
an option
low-light photos and video from both the
7 + + 8 + were noisy especially when
shot on the telephoto lens but the 8 +
seem to apply noise reduction smarter
cleaning up textures and patterns better
than the 7 + next
I stopped by nourished cafe for an
espresso and to test out some slow
motion video the 8 + triumphs here being
able to shoot 240 frames per second in
1080p compared to the 7 + a--'s 120
frames per second the results look
sharper and the motion more dramatic
especially when someone's struggling
potatoes if you want the best iPhone for
photos and video it is definitely the
iPhone 8 + but if you're trying to
decide between buying the 8 + and the 7
+ I recommend giving the 7 + some
serious consideration image quality is
really close to that of the 8 + and if
you can live with less storage the 7 +
is cheaper of course in November
everything changes the iPhone 10 will be
available giving us a chance to do
another camera shoot out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
