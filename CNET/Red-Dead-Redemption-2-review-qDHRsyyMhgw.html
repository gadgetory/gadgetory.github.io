if I look weird it's cuz I've spent the
last eight days plowing through Red Dead
Redemption - I don't know what year it
is I've forgotten who I am and
occasionally I speak like a cowboy this
game is massive while I was writing my
review I was dreading how I'd make a
video to go along with it so I decided
that the best way to explain this game
was to have a conversation about it
so joining me today is Scott Stein
someone who has not played the game but
is as eager as anyone to know about this
so Scott let's get right into it yes I'm
excited to debrief you on this yeah I
know very little about the game on
purpose because I'm excited about diving
in myself sure it's smart it's a smart
way to approach it tell me about this
game compared to Red Dead Redemption 1
this game feels like much more of a an
evolution of what Rockstar is trying to
do with you know their ambitions of like
storytelling an open-world kind of stuff
you'll see some like Rockstar hallmarks
like you know the characters you'll meet
along the way and some of those side
missions but their intentions it feels
like for this game is to sort of blur
the line of like what's campaign what
side stuff and everything just feels
like a little bit more important Red
Dead 2 is a much different game than Red
Dead one I mean that's it in the same
time period or so like so it's a prequel
to Red Dead one it takes place about ten
years before the events I've read dead
one
and in Red Dead one you're sort of like
breaking apart from this gang in Red
Dead one in Red Dead - the prequel you
are a member of the gang and you're sort
of like making your way through an
America that is slowly but surely losing
its outlaws and falling into more
lawfulness so why are you feel so
traumatized you've been talking about
how you how did this break you
so I spent saying that this game has
broken me because of like the paradox of
like having to marathon
a game like this in eight days and be
able to write a review that is not the
way you should be playing this game so
let me just put that out there this game
is insanely big on a level that I've
kind of never seen before the only thing
that I think comes close to it is
something like The Witcher 3 where
you're just presented with so much stuff
at the outset that it's kind of daunting
to just wrap your head around it I mean
I played the game for over 40 hours and
I'm only roughly 35 percent through the
way the game kind of like tracks your
progress so I think the marathon pace at
which I attempted to kind of like not
blaze through it but just like keep on
going and keep a solid pace as much as I
enjoyed this game and enjoy playing it
and will continue to enjoy that is not
how anyone should play this game and I
think it's sort of like you know it
shows just how impossible it is to like
summarize this massive massive game in
just like an 8 day play session well do
you feel it's like a pretty solitary
experience or are you running into a lot
of people or is it everything in Red
Dead 2 seems unique from like the
bounties that you might collect to debts
you might reclaim from people that the
the brilliance of this game is that
everything is so varied and unique and
things that you things that you think
are insignificant in the story could
wind up being this wild chase for hours
this games like a cowboy simulator like
a moment-to-moment life in America in
1899 where like you essentially have to
do everything but breathe for this guy I
mean you have to consider so many things
your clothing the weather will you be
hot will you be cold will you be hungry
will you will your horse be okay that's
a lot of variables okay there's a lot is
it kind of like a GTA 5 with horses no
read it one was was in my opinion much
more of a GTA game with horses Red Dead
2 is a life simulator mixed peppered
with like outlaw gang life
and you know the way you play this game
directly impacts how people think about
you how towns consider you how how long
police officers look at you like you
make your own way in this game and you
kind of have this storyline of you being
a member of this gang to kind of carry
it through the chapters see do you have
like regrets then or do you feel like
there are moments where you want to go
back and play it a different way or at
some point in videogames I was like you
know what I can't live like this I just
have to play the game and see what
happens to me I can't go back and
perfect life I can't go back and like
change the way this goes so I think that
is that is ultimately the right way to
play this game is to sort of just let it
happen
yeah how much of the game is like travel
and you mentioned like that it you know
you're moving around in some places and
what's really cool is they introduced
this thing called cinematic mode which
is in a lot of rockstar games but they
kind of encourage you to use it when
you're traveling great distances on
horseback because the camera will shift
away from third-person and sort of just
show you like these prairie these like
beautiful sweeping like jib shots and
and you're able to kind of like pass the
time
you know the wildlife and the weather
there's amazing weather effects in this
game where you're just like you know the
line of like photo realism and video
game is blurred there was one time where
I came across these two rival gang
members and they were just like keep
moving like you don't want any of this
crap no need for threats
all right Klaus keep going and now I'm
gonna like kill them and take that
because I'm an outlaw that's that's what
laws do this is a game that will make
you sort of have to live with choices on
a level like this game is deliberately
slow at times to make you feel like this
character there is so much stuff that's
bit like the weight of it everything
carries so much weight
the game will tell you if you are
underweight you will begin to you know
lose health quicker if you are
underweight and malnourished you have to
eat like what do you what do you eat
like what are you grabbing well you you
are part of a campsite and this gang has
a campsite and everyone this it's sort
of like a little bit of communism there
and like everyone kind of like pitches
in and and you know they all you have to
keep the camp fed and stocked with
supplies and and if you don't go hunting
at some point and provide the camp with
food people are like oh we used to eat
more you know we're hungry now well
don't necessarily want to get spoilers
or other things like that but it seems
like the type of game where you're just
gonna encounter weird things on your own
like things that may no one else might
see it sure what's like the weird thing
you've seen the most bizarre moment
you've had I've seen like real weird
stuff we're like I stopped once to like
help a guy who who whose horse looked
like he needed like a horseshoe
replacement and the guys like talking to
me is like oh thanks so much for
stopping by and then all of a sudden the
horse kicks him because he would like
was like holding the horse's leg
improperly the horse I kicked back
killed the guy and the horse was like
trotted away into the wilderness and I'm
just sitting there I'm like it's a
strange feeling that this game is able
to create and I think that's what's been
like the most kind of like emotional
part of it is like this game has made me
feel stuff probably more more so than a
lot of stuff I applied it sound like
you're saying the silences or the the
question of like judgment in these
moments I mean GTA I feel like a lot of
times you're moving fast so like you you
get the thing to get to the next thing
yeah you need the money or whatever else
but like it or yeah there's moments
where like if it's just you and the dead
dead guy what happens and it's just know
nothing for miles no one's around and
you look around a lot because it's a you
know you have to think of like you know
technology is obviously much different
new to 99 you
Oh someone's gonna take a picture of
this and I'm screwed
it's more like was there a witness oh
there was one witness there they go I
have to chase them down and either
convince them to not say anything or
deal with them a different way you know
that the game lets you kind of interact
in a more seamless you don't engage in
like sort of like a dialogue tree
everything they've gone for like a more
seamless interaction with people so
you're just kind of like hold a trigger
thank you sure not strong enough to work
is this reminding you of other things
that are out there I think every time a
rockstar game comes out I think it's
very bold to push the needle move the
needle rather push the envelope and kind
of be a milestone in what games are
perceived as and and I think the GTA
games have done a good job of like you
know telling a narrative story through
missions and then side stuff and you
know this game to me tries to like I
said before bring everything to the same
level and not you know have you discount
things that are just like side icon on a
map I think like a lot of games now
suffer from Matt barf or like there's
all these just dots all over a map and
you just have to like check all these
boxes it is much less a box checking
game and more of like a story that can
really go on for a long time and you
kind of make your way through it and
your experience is likely almost a
hundred percent guaranteed to be vastly
different from the next person the
multiplayer is that's not available
that's not yeah but yet they're gonna do
that I believe the plan is to launch it
in November whether or not it hits that
date we'll see but don't get me wrong
you can play you can spend months with
this game I have not finished it I don't
know anyone who has I mean I'm sure
there's readers ever finish this game
but yeah the people I've talked with no
one's close to it it is a seemingly
never ending game and I'm gonna start to
take my time with it after this like how
much of my life do you think I'm gonna
have to sacrifice to play this I mean I
this is a game that you can play two
hours a day or like let's say like six
hours a week for six months what are the
horses like they're serious about their
amazing there's so many different kinds
I mean like that is essentially like the
you know the vehicle of the game but you
can you know you have to treat them well
you have to bond with them the more you
bond with them the more you can do like
special maneuvers with them you can do
these like skid maneuvers if you really
have to feed them have to brush them you
have to maintain them you have to make
sure they have you know everyone's got
like little meters that you sort of have
to keep an eye on and it's detailed are
there like other animals - there there's
everything you interact with there with
you a lot of it is just for skinning and
eating and hunting but just I mean
there's there's like legendary animals
that are like these you know almost like
mythical creatures or like a legendary
grizzly bear that you know you have to
skin and it's there's a lot there is a
lot a lot of animals did you feel
Redemption this is all done and I can go
back and start enjoying this game at a
much slower pace I'm happy I was I was
not have to be a real cowboy yeah I
think that's gonna do it I thank you for
for this opportunity it was very
cathartic and I'm happy to provide your
exit interview from leaving the world of
Red Dead I feel much better now coming
out the other side if you want to read
the full review it's over at CNET and
