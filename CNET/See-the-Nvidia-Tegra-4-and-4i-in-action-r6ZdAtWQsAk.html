cnet.com at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona Spain and I'm currently
getting a demo of the Tegra 4 now these
are reference tablets these are three
identical reference tablets all running
at 1080p you currently there this one's
running GL benchmark and these are
running a full on Tegra 4 CPUs with
their 72 GPU core you can't run too much
on them right now we're just running
this benchmark we run we ran a couple
other benchmarks and they seem to be as
fast as we'd expect them can't say for
sure how good they're gonna be when I
actually come out but they look good so
far right now we're looking at the Tegra
4 version of zombie driver the game was
released for Tegra 3 but now this is the
Tegra 4 version obviously it's not out
yet but here you can get an idea of what
to expect the according to the video
there will be some enhancements over the
Tegra 3 version but I don't have a I
don't have a Tegra 3 version in front of
me to compare but so far it looks pretty
good this is a low-power demo of the
Tegra 4 not really showing off the
performance but more of its low power
capabilities I'm going to play a movie
right here start a trailer and according
to Nvidia it should pull maybe 25% less
power than your typical smartphone this
is running on a reference smartphone
right here as you can see it's running
movie and then as you can see here is
pulling about 0.9 watts according to
video this is about 25% less than your
average smartphone now we're gonna
taking a look at the Tegra 4 I Phoenix
reference platform this is running real
boxing on the Tegra 4 I on it's on
NVIDIA Phoenix reference smartphone it's
not a real smartphones on an actual
product that's coming out but it does
give you an idea of what to expect from
Tegra 4 I in terms of performance I mean
the animation seems pretty smooth frame
rate seems decent and the models seem to
be pretty well detailed you can see here
some of the like detail in the skin
textures
the lighting I wouldn't say necessarily
console-quality I wouldn't say that
personally but I mean it definitely
looks better than what I've seen on
other smartphones look for Tegra 4
devices a hit in quarter two and four
Tegra 4 I devices a hit around quarter
four this is Eric Franklin again from
what World Congress in Barcelona Spain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
