console like a ps3 or computer and the
software like a disk or cartridge but
what if you could skip all that and
stream your games to any device with
cloud gaming the games are streamed from
a server to your device in real time
that means you'll never need any special
hardware to play the games you love and
the games are never stored on your
computer or mobile device game saves
settings and even updates all those
things happen in the chi let's take a
look at one of the leaders in cloud
gaming on live after downloading the
online software on your computer and
mobile devices like this android tablet
you can instantly demo games or purchase
and play the complete versions controls
happen on screen and considering the app
has to send these motions to a server
somewhere and back to my device it's
surprisingly fast especially now these
on-screen controls do take some getting
used to so if you're a gamepad kind of
person online does have a universal
controller that's compatible with a few
Android devices and some computers you
can plug it into your computer or parent
with your tablet over Bluetooth it does
get laggy sometimes but it's the next
best thing to a gaming console when
you're on the go sky-high which means
open ocean in Japanese is also playing
the cloud game but instead of offering
full games it only offers demos the idea
is that you can try a game by playing it
online before buying the full version
that's a big deal when the price of
popular games usually starts somewhere
around 50 bucks you can see the showcase
of game demos on guy Kai's website and
play them on your computer but the tech
isn't available for mobile devices just
yet gaikai and online are two examples
of platforms that bring high-quality pc
games to all of your devices and stream
them to you on the fly one well-known
company has been using the cloud to
drive gaming and they've become the
one-stop portal for dedicated gamers
steam which is created by the company
valve lets you download full games but
it uses minimal drm or digital rights
management so you can redownload that
game on multiple machines with steam
installed mobile gaming not yet but with
steams mobile app you can chat with
gamer friends and purchase games on the
go so if you want pc games on any device
give cloud gaming a tribe but don't get
rid of your consoles just yet if you
have any questions or comments hit me up
on Twitter or always on at cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
