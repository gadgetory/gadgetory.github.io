phone it's the LG G flex and it's one of
the first along with the samsung galaxy
round that has a curved OLED display
this is not available in the united
states yet this is in south korea we
have one here that we've been playing
around with and you can see that it's
curved top to bottom sort of like a
banana or like a wallet that's been
stuck in the sea deer pants for a while
and it's actually flexible too LG
encourages you to push this down on the
table with all your might and it is
meant to take force if you're sitting on
it or if you happen to flatten it now
how well will this work overtime who
knows it's a little bit distressing but
you can try it and speaking of extra
protection the back has a self-healing
paint coating that's borrowed from the
automotive industry you could put
scratches in this and it's supposed to
heal up because the polymer on the back
that sounds insane stay tuned for us
testing that out more as well it's a six
inch display and the curved OLED seems
best suited for horizontal videos
because it throws off glare a little
more if you hold it like this seems like
there's a little more glare although it
also cups your face nicely if you're
making a call and it's supposed to have
some audio enhancing capabilities
because of the curvature stay tuned for
more on the LG G flex that's a quick
look here i'm scott stein</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
