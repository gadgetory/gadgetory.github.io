I'm Bridget Carey and this is your see
net update the juggernaut of social
media known as Facebook rolled out a new
feature called place tips it's basically
four squares worst nightmare if you have
GPS on when you're out around town
you'll start to see these pop-ups on
your Facebook newsfeed that tell you
information about the place you're at
it'll show what your friends posted
about that location along with things
like a menu or upcoming events this goes
beyond Wi-Fi and GPS Facebook is also
putting Bluetooth beacons in some areas
like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and
some other New York businesses it sends
Bluetooth signals to nearby phones so
the app can be more exact and knowing
where you are and which tips to show for
now these tips only show up on the
iPhone Facebook app and you can disable
it in Facebook settings the whole
concept was for squares big vision to
have fax and friend ratings about a
place pop up when you walk inside but
people are not using Foursquare as often
or even that new spin-off swarm which is
messy to jump back and forth between
Facebook however is another story
everyone has that app on their phone and
speaking of apps spongebob squarepants
is bringing his pineapple under the sea
to your smartphone Nickelodeon is
planning to create a standalone video
service for watching on a phone or
tablet the channels parent company
Viacom is going to unveil the new
Nickelodeon subscription service next
month it's not clear if this would be
live programming or on demand or even if
it's going to feature older shows like
Rocko's Modern Life but people are
shifting away from watching TV on
traditional ways on cable and moving
towards streaming on the go from any
device a standalone service means Viacom
joins CBS and HBO and offering something
straight to consumers bypassing cable
and satellite providers you're going to
need a fast internet connection to watch
this new form of streaming live
television and if you think you have
broadband well I have some bad news for
you the Federal Communications
Commission says your broadband internet
isn't good enough to be called broadband
anymore the FCC which oversees rules
the Internet has raised the standard for
broadband to mean download speeds of 25
megabits per second up from 4 megabits
and to be called broadband the upload
speeds need to be three megabits instead
of one this new definition means that
millions of Americans are suddenly no
longer considered broadband subscribers
because the average speed in the u.s. is
10 megabits a second not 25 that your
tech news update you can stay updated at
