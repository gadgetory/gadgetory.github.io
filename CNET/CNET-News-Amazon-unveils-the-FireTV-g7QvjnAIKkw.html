introducing amazon fire TV the
obligatory fake swap of cameras when i
try listen this thing's tiny it's
incredibly powerful and it's
unbelievably simple it's the best place
to watch the most popular TV shows and
movies in the comfort of their own home
okay
that's their right into it bio TV has a
quad-core processor its best in class 4a
products of this time it also has a
dedicated epu of the kind you sleep on
in high-end smartphones and it processes
fifty seven billion floating-point
operations per second this is going to
be important in a few minutes when I
show you some of the features the second
performance bottleneck visa was rapid
fire TV has two gigs of RAM that's two
to four times more than these other
products on the market now and this is
really important because applications
start more quickly video starts more
quickly and then user interface is
smooth and easy to navigate so that the
device disappears into the background
the third thing we saw in terms of our
performance bottleneck was the network
itself biog vs new band dual antenna
Wi-Fi with my mom this is
state-of-the-art for a product like this
so that videos starts training
immediately applications start
downloading immediately and quickly this
thing really screams I can't wait to get
subtract if you add it all up fire TV
has three times the performance and
power of apple TV of Roku 3 of
chromecast this is a powerful device
it is thinner than a dime fits
underneath your TV behind your TV
seamless and fades of the background you
lose yourself at high def content up to
1080p it's got the only digital surround
sorry dolby digital plus surround sound
out via either hdmi or via optical the
remote control redeveloped is small
elegant and very simple to use stop
moving them which is a future that for
me is I've been using fire TV over the
past few months really makes it into a
great experience because I no longer
have to fumble around pointing my remote
at a tiny area at the begin at the front
of my living room I can click the remote
from whatever position I happen in the
aim and fire TV response and as you can
see on the left hand side I can scroll
from home the movies TV to my watch list
I'm going to scroll back up here to
movies I'm going to pop over to the
content on the right hand side and
you'll see that we're using big
beautiful images throughout fire TV the
content isn't hidden behind an
application that you have to
their way through to get the content you
want to watch its front and center watch
this I'm going too fast scroll through
this new release movies list this is
where the performance the specs I talked
about a little bit earlier really come
into play just like all amazon devices
by our tvs comes director so i have to
contact your watchlist movies and TV
shows that you happen to own earlier
it's already there ready and waiting for
you open the box you plug it in you turn
it on and we waiting to go super simple
startup experience and you use it over
time we have a recently list here the
top a home so i can conflict the jab can
we watch them right now is only a couple
clicks away this is what you do on fire
TV john malkovich pops up I go straight
to all the movies that John Malkovich is
in I can watch them I can also scroll
down here to add to my watch list it's
that fast by next month we'll have
thousands of names bill we want to make
it easy for customers to play games you
give me a few different options you can
use the fire TV remote play games it's a
brave and play we've also created an app
that allows you to use the phones and
tablets that you already own to play
games this will be 0 this one will be
available next month some customers are
going to play a lot of these and they're
going to flake are many hours they're a
lot a dedicated
angel to complete the gains experience
on fire TV we built the fire game
controller this controller is
comfortable as familiar so if you've
used a game controller in the past to go
to pick it up and use it right away for
customers it's available for 39 99 and
it also comes with a thousand amazon
coins allows you to load up on some
games play CJ's kind of built-ins up a
cool little shaft and turns out building
things and mine perhaps a lot of fun and
blowing things up kind of fun too so
that doesn't get old for me okay just
remember this is all being played on
this tiny little box because we could
have brought this game to fire TV and if
want to look so beautiful without the
specs that Peter talked about earlier
quad-core processor dedicated GPU two
gigs of ram it is aptly incredible price
append I know we're so excited to get
this in the hands of customers and
