studios in San Frisco California it's
the apple byte extra crunchy podcast
with your host mr. brian Tong what up
what up everybody welcome it's the apple
byte extra crunchy extra munchy i
believe we're in episode 57 57 57 here
going strong again this is the show all
about Apple everything you could think
about that's Apple we want you all to be
a part of the show we love hearing your
calls we've got some representation from
the ladies today as well with the phone
call we love so call us at one eight
hundred 61 62 63 eight this is
voicemails we are not taking live calls
we are not in our studio that can handle
live calls so you just won't get that
right now but this is where you leave
your name where you're from your
comments we even have people now giving
us feedback when we don't know things
because we don't know everything yes
they're telling us what's up so we
appreciate it all we need that you guys
and gals all make the show what it is so
let's just get into it right now top
story of the week really top story
overall is the latest update people
continue to ask me all the time what's
going on with new macbooks when are they
coming and we've expected them to come
out in October there is no official date
for any announcements at the moment but
going to MacRumors they have learned
that Apple is rapidly moving towards a
launch of the new macbook pro models
they're currently working and tweaking
out macos Michaels Michaels 10-point
12.1 it's really focused specifically on
getting the operating system up to date
to support the new hardware features on
these new MacBook Pros and for those of
you that don't know just to catch you up
to speed some of these MacBook Pro
features include this new OLED touch bar
that's going to take over where you
normally see like the function keys it's
supposed to be able to adapt based on
what type of apps are actually using so
it could be if it's a media app like
iTunes you would see controlling
controls at tracks on there if it maybe
change to something like a messaging app
you would see different things there as
well or even photo editing apps or a
browser like safari
get some hot keys there so that's really
the big key thing and again we have seen
a touch bar like LED bar on actual
computers of the razor line has them but
this is going to be apples
implementation of it we'll see how it
all comes together now they're finishing
tweaking Makos 10-12 one they are also a
hardware and additionally in addition
that is touch ID support so you can do
payments on the laptop directly as well
as a shifting over to the Polaris
graphics chip family that that's from
AMD on the higher end 15 inch models the
goal is that there'll be public beta
testing 10 12 10 next week the with the
goal of finalizing it and then being
able to roll this out actually install
that on the hardware and to make an
announcement as in late October most
likely the SEC second to last week or
the last week of October which is
typically what is described as late
October yes just a just a Philly
pre-halloween pre pre pre November
before Thanksgiving around Halloween so
um that's all we know right now there
have also been many rumors that not only
the new macbook pros will get updated
MacBook Air will get new USB seaports
and imax will get a new AMD graphics
chips before the end of the year I think
the biggest thing that everyone is also
still asking me about is when will we
actually see Mac minis and Mac Pro's
getting updates because they haven't
seen them in years as in two to three
years depending on the product a long
time to wait a long time to wait we had
someone ask about it last week there
still are no rumblings whatsoever that
we're gonna see anything like that I'm
so it'll be interesting that they've got
it at least give us a little bump but
for now that's where we stand with the
new macbook pros are you are you in the
market at all I am NOT no no I'm happy
with my pc that's my acer aspire touch
screens right that's right Windows 10
but if you asked sleek little laptop
fast don't lie I know you're you're so I
the thing is that I wish Apple made a
dang touchscreen laptop I know serious
seems like it's no-brainer and something
that they can easily do and do it
beautifully and amazing like look at
this I locked up right here and I know
that's what I kinda you guys just touch
it and you know this is not this is not
right this is not right um what else
could be coming at least from a
touchscreen standpoint let's talk about
the ipad pros we just recently revealed
from patently Apple that apple is
planning to utilize and invent a
magnetic array system within the ipad
family that's going to allow it to do
multiple things now the first thing this
is a no-brainer and everyone thought
they should have had this from the start
because if you have a surface you know
that the pen can magnetically attached
to the surface tablet well apples pencil
will be able to securely attached to the
ipad pro based on this patent diagram
drawing showing that the Apple pencil
can cling on have you heard of that a
song um um pineap-- Apple was it
pineapple PAP pineapple pen Apple pen no
okay can you look at all i'm talking yes
yes just look it up on youtube while I'm
talking okay if you find it we're gonna
have to play is it pineapple just type
in like pineapple pen apple pen this is
sign Apple it's it's a guy with a white
background with a oh I have I have heard
about this I just want people to listen
to this and then it's plenty after the
ad then they can look it up just boost
it up whenever you feel like it I will
talk about other ways that um this thing
goes let's see if this is okay I don't
know if the sound is working on this
it's alright honest oh it's not dang it
it's ok we will revisit in another time
rooms like come on play it play it I'll
just give you my enough sugar in this
adorable man been okay all right it's
it's ridiculous um other ways that the
magnetic array can help out with the
ipad is that they're using it to hold a
pencil but also they're talking about
how they can implement it with an actual
ipad case oh here we go that's the
perfect beat that you need for this song
pineapple okay okay okay with it I could
listen to it all day people on periscope
like I can't hear it I can't hear this
song by never been so anyways magnets in
an iPad protective case so the case
would have magnets the iPad itself would
have magnets and when it detects that
it's falling the sensors along the lines
of the accelerometers and gyroscopes
would be able to detect this and
basically using these electromagnetics
they could like they're trying to hope
that it could essentially like helped
shift the ipad within the case a little
bit to protect it what like I'm solely
in that light glowing I don't want to
say like slide the ipad with another
case but kind of like this I don't think
this is coming anytime soon but think
about if there was an ipad with like a
rubberized case and it was there's a gap
kind of around it and when you drop your
case the mat or drop the ipad the
magnets would then kind of activate on
the side that wouldn't take the impact
of the damage ice to sauce the ipad
that's weird it's weird I me again this
is all this is all a I love to throw
ideas out there is some guy has a patent
idea and they're like yes I'm fungal on
it just for fun right so that could be
one way and then the other one that
we've been waiting forever how about
connecting two ipads together to make
like a bomb screen right that's dope
right gimme edge-to-edge glass on an
iPad magnetics a double screen up come
on come on son it's cool i would i would
take that in a second so those are some
of the pads if you look them up on
patently Apple in regards to their new
magnetic array system these are ideas we
don't know if this is actually going to
happen but this is definitely what
they're talking about what if you can
just connect like as many ipads together
as you wanted but i would do that the
possibilities are endless i was having a
ray dad's you could get some cool like
visual display like you know like an
interactive display it like a retail
spot or something like that it'd be cool
if you're wondering what else Apple
might be up to Apple has submitted a
mystery wireless device with Bluetooth
and NFC to the FCC so this was an apple
filing it was for a nondescript wireless
device uh character characteristically
they don't tell us what the name of this
thing is
is because they're trying to keep it a
mystery the model number has been
identified as a 1844 but why is that
important is because it doesn't line up
with any current existing Apple products
um the actual regulatory label shows
that the device has two Torx screws it
doesn't seem to be very big some people
are under the impression that this is
not anything related to an apple TV this
could be a while ago Apple had talked
about these things called ibeacons that
would basically could be placed in
retail locations if you're walking into
a store you're near a beacon it
transmits to your phone and shows you
those you likely sale or like you're
near yeah you're like near a promotion
that's things like that so it could be
the ibeacon technology that this actual
devices it's nothing else we it's other
than a wireless it's a wireless as a
mystery wireless device see my first
thought when i heard it was a mystery
wireless device was that it was that
wearable that people gonna wear in the
hospital to keep track of your
biometrics whatever i don't know that
was just like the Apple watch yeah
that's the first thought that came with
yeah you're like what could it be what
could it be see I like this because
Beecham doesn't necessarily know oh are
you gonna give me more of that believe
it or not it's just miss me sorry
believe it not total tangent this is
great song hahahaha so um before we go
to our break which will not include more
singing this video came out I think
pretty much today or is at least put out
today online I love it it's an angry
customer in a france or at least in a
french apple store we don't know exactly
which store who basically goes on like a
tirade yeah and starts razy smashing
like somewhere around 16 iphones bash
down on this to back to back to back
here you can every time he hears the
sorrel armed security listen carefully
you'll hear a smash boom ivo boom boom
iphone broken but he's literally pulling
them out of like the charging docks
laying them on the counter and then
smashing each one
it's painful painful to watch I don't I
don't necessarily think he's like
breaking everyone he's just breaking the
screen y'all he's smashing the screen
yeah so we would you say oh he's talking
in French yeah so he said he's basically
saying that Apple is a company that
violated European consumer rights they
refused to reimburse me he doesn't
explain why he wants his money back so
you know what's happening this is
happening that's what he said and then
he smashed another phone it walks away
like the boss later on there's videos
security is like kind of chess Oh get a
laptop right there he got a laptop on
that way yeah that hurts daddy ouch
anyways there you go a man in an apple
store just going cray-cray what we were
talking about this before the show like
the security guards they restrain him
and I'm just like I'm just like if
there's a guy running around like
destroying things like I'm not going to
touch him I'm gonna call the police yeah
stay far away from it i am I gonna do
there like risking their lives to save
you know an iphone or something this guy
is dangerous so that's that's the tough
thing now with security guards at mall
shopping centers period I mean these are
there it's not like there aren't there's
a lot of threats out there now and it's
dangerous women a skirt it's dangerous
you know and these people are just
trying to maintain order and peace
they're not even you know armed with
anything and they've got to deal with
clowns like that like I've got mad love
for all you guys here so let's let's
let's lighten the mood real quick
lighten the mood rope fast okay okay
that's also better you're gonna you're
gonna you're gonna thank me later for
pineapple pineapple pen I'm already
thinking you I'm like I love it don't
worry you know you know you know we're
gonna we you know we're gonna go revisit
that on the apple byte I gotta stop I'm
dying all right let's get to our
sponsors at idevices calm we have talked
about them all the time really we're not
going to read the same things that you
have heard every time but I'm going to
talk about it so basically I devices
they have a line of connected home
products if you aren't familiar with
them they include like smart plugs a
Wi-Fi thermostat a rain tight outdoor
smart plug even a socket adapter that
takes your dumb light bulb that typical
one that you have
and turns it into a smart one I have
used I devices it's hooked up into Siri
and Alexa what time is it see I know
there's at least five guys those guys
made that have an echo and a Alexa way
you guys you guys got to get on board
this connected house think is all about
to like explode summary and the home kit
come out everything's gonna go crazy i
have like lights in my house i can turn
them on and off I know if my lights are
on and off i have scheduled lighting at
my house now that scheduled by have mr.
else I schedule my life like when like
in the morning or what I don't know I
make sure my lights go off at midnight
and oh there we go out at 8 45 f we
leave the house enough to worry about it
it's actually really you guys got to get
it yeah i-i've only I live in an
apartment so I can't and I have
roommates and I can't like completely
let it take over the household or
apartment so I have it in my bedroom and
i'll have like i have two smart bulbs
above the bed and i have this little
mini hallway to get to my bedroom so I
technically have a hallway and a bedroom
and a bathroom so it's like so I you
know I've torqued it out so that it it's
completely smart and I'm laughing
because I imagine you like walking in a
room like putting your arms up in me
like I'm home and then every day like
turns on your Apple you're mad turns on
it works so I'll be lie ve opens up i'll
straight up I'll straight up say stuff
like Alexa turn on my bedroom or alexa
turn on my hallway and then when I leave
I say turn off my room and everything
goes off and you feel like a boss like
you don't get tired of doing that what
happens you say Alexa turn me on well
then something else lights up oh hey you

it's like intimate for a moment it's one
of my favorite parts of the week lock
holy cow holy cow all right let me
unlock my computer screen so we can
continue with the issue with the actual
show but you know if ever if ever we get
stuck there's always one place we can go
to my friend with the pineapple pen all
right let's check this out latest update
a new study by JD power they have
they're always they have their kind of
like consumer satisfaction survey has
ranked Apple the highest in overall
Apple music the highest and overall
customer satisfaction based on competing
against seven streaming music brands and
based on these different key areas
performance and reliability ease of use
cost of service content communication
and customer service so they have this
based on a 1000 point scale 4500 about
4,500 people responded to this survey
that have paid for a subscription
service in the last six months Apple
music ranked the highest with a score of
8 34 out of 1000 Rhapsody was 826
Pandora was 8 25 and Spotify wasn't 824
I'm shocked that Spotify is in fourth
place on that but this is all based on
you know someone who might have just
purchased it and then just made a
decision I I find these to be kind of I
wouldn't think this was reflective like
for example Rhapsody was at number two
well Rhapsody is like I know you've
cornered a market a long time ago I know
but I was surprised that I would think
that they would be like mine Apple music
yeah but at the same time look Rhapsody
Pandora Spotify ER or 826 825 824 that's
basically even that's basically a second
place so yeah what is the what do they
call it percentage of error here when I
don't know that but though they're
they're basically saying those rankings
are essentially the same I the biggest
omission to me as they used they had
seven streaming music brands title
wasn't included on this title did not
even make it didn't even register that
that's a new industry average made the
cut I don't know what that is is that
title but nothing is the title announce
that there around four to five million
paid subscribers apples somewhere
round I think 16 million right now and i
believe spot if I just hit 40 million
I've one timeout paid subscribers um
from that standpoint but these are
here's the thing it makes sense if these
are new subscribers within the six
months that Apple is the highest in
general just because Apple can has the
most buzz it recently came out in the
last year and that a lot of people look
if you already have 40 million Spotify
subscribers that means you've had a lock
on those customers for long oh yeah yeah
so yeah plus I mean just brand cachet
Apple music Apple iTunes like just just
that alone it's like a juggernaut look
people don't forget that they may not
always make the best product but just
because they're the apple machine and
the apple ecosystem people are gonna buy
their stuff like it happens to me for
example i love my echo I don't want
anything to replace my echo but I could
see this Apple echo like device that we
talked about last week could be hotter
it could replace it if it can read your
text messages read you know like read
your emails like just stuff like that
just totally that are already part of
your iOS ecosystem if it can actually
work somehow with Apple TV like they
there's there's ways that it can do
things that if you're in the ecosystem
there's advantage tell me my calendar
you know yeah tell me my missed calls
are say I don't pay attention my missed
calls yeah tell me am I you know I do
like the new Apple music app then I o is
the redesigned version yeah it's bigger
buttons yeah it's a little easier than
it looks its way clean its way cleaner
navigate I like how it looks like the
album covers like popping off the screen
that's that was one of the focuses on
album art it's true they call it drop
the drop shot yeah yeah just just like
the the transparencies in the drop
shadow yes good job Apple thank you for
fixing that hooyah do you subscribe
Apple music yet I was almost going to do
it now I was one of the you know when
they give it to you for money I did I do
I didn't renew it so but i like how
Apple music is laid out better now then
I was be firm and try so it encourages
me more to give Apple music a shot
another thing I thought was cool was now
you can like share your music right
there to your uh what is it what is the
serve it like the myspace kind of I
forget what it's good
which one memorable the item and the
apple thing why I'm forgetting it we're
just gonna talk about how I like that
you could share it so easily you mean
just just being able to share it what
share with others you mean through I
message no it's like it's like you know
it's like the myspace that for apple for
for itunes or what do they call it every
chat room help me up please it what what
is Apple's out their social but nets
connect I stopped told I'm completely
ignored connect I know but like if
you're an artist or you have like album
on iTunes it's cool just to be able to
bun just share to connect to share yeah
so alright that's cool uh other music
information that's kind of fun drake's
album views has exceeded 1 billion
streams on Apple music Apple awarded him
with this cool like plaque and
everything to kind of show thanks for
him he's looking tough drizzy drake
views as a dope album let me tell ya
that's a new you know that's the new
gold record now yeah we also honored
this album last year yeah yeah I don't
have a little low end on this app on
this uh oh it's ok yours laptop there's
not a below ender sorry if you don't
know I phone at five se then you see you
got you got to watch that thing you
gotta watch this for me screens how can
I remember this phone in see our yeah we
can't see ok it was stop it people like
what are you guys talking about search
it up and he just take a poo right there
yeah the just just look up what is it
hotline bling iphone we're dealing just
there yeah it's it's all it's pretty
epic I don't know why we had a fun time
making that alright so drizzy drake 1
billion streams on Apple music this one
talking about just like apples media
services I was surprised by this and I
love this because I actually watched a
lot of shows on the CW network don't
judge CW's new Apple TV app does not
require a cable subscription to watch
this is not a common ladies and
gentlemen is that for a limited time not
the we know I doesn't look like it no
login no subscription
just free this is for this fall CW's
Apple TV app okay shows that you might
recognize that you might watch Supergirl
yeah the flash the flash is one of the
best shows on TV right now sorry it's
huge holy crap that shows amazing jane
the virgin arrow arrow another good one
but flash kinda like destroyed the arrow
now so you know just I zombie dc's
legends of tomorrow and like show fell
flat I was like trying to do too much
I'm sorry I'm like a hardco i watch all
the comic book stuff right it's like
that's that's what it's all about so um
anyways check it out the CW app you can
watch those shows I haven't downloaded
the actual app so I don't know if it'll
give you access to the past shows but it
is ad-supported a flash I things going
into season three and arrow would be
going into season is it yeah season
three in season four so um we'll see how
that all shakes out but that's a pretty
pretty killer app and I think other
company should start doing that right no
yeah no barrier to enjoy when I'm trying
to watch something on like Roku or
Amazon and have to go log in and then
get on my phone and like typing it's a
pain and it's a pain in the butt okay
that's great so we have that also on
black hat security company zero diem has
increased their bounty to 1.5 million
dollars to encourage people to try and
find in zero zero-day vulnerability in
iOS 10 which they claim is much harder
to exploit a zero-day vulnerability is
pretty much think of it as one there the
company Apple themselves doesn't know
about it and so because they don't know
about it they have 0 days to basically
react and prepare for them so this is
like find an exploit that no one knows
about and if you do they will be
rewarded 1.5 million dollars and like I
said it's extremely harder versus iOS 9
to be able to do this at the moment so
um that's why the raise in the bounty
they're trying to challenge they're
trying to a never challenge a hacker
like let's I don't know how because
she's 1.5 million if I wow if I even had
remotely had any skills I would totally
try that I just I know totally failed
dedicate my next six months to see
better fast
if you guys want to check out a lot of
talk about iphone stuff we just kind of
have a little bit of batch of iphone use
the iphone 7 camera test from dxo labs
they publish like this in depth iphone 7
camera review they've called it a solid
evolution over the 6s the single lens
smartphone achieved an overall dxomark
mobile score of 86 topping the iphone 6s
by just two points but trailing the
count samsung galaxy s edge and five
other devices so you know there's always
a debate of who really has the best
camera on the market iphones in that
conversation but yeah it's not
necessarily the best which one which
iphone was this this is a iphone 7
they're just comparing yeah not not the
plus they're just specifically talking
about the single lens I'm jet black I
phones also face a global shortage as
new colors provide difficult to
manufacture this is actually crazy so
hmm check this out jet black right the
the cool color that Apple is like yo you
got to get this I mean look this is a
jet black iphone right here you can you
tell dirty though it looks dirty well I
have it in a case because I don't want
to get a rat face is dirty okay it's
well it's silly because you have this
great looking phone it's gonna scratch
super easy super easy little scratch
scratch test was like bruises brutal
right so get this the yield rate so
meaning like they put this case that
this case is made through specific
treatment it goes through this 9 step
anodization process but according to
reports the yield the production yield
rate of 60 / sets at seventy percent of
cases are accepted meaning that thirty
to forty percent of the units that they
make do not even pass apples quality
standards and have to be retooled ooh so
if you make a million cases only 600 700
thousand those are going to be usable
because this case is so hard to process
and manufacture that's actually pretty
crappy that is crappy haha it's a lot of
waste man and I've got to imagine it's
because it's so scratch friendly that
you know like
you can literally rub the jet black
iphone on a regular desk surface a
smooth surface yeah and it's gonna
scratch you know I remember gonna scrap
I have that iphone 5 for like two years
and I never took it out of the case I
mean yeah okay never never maybe just
like clean it or sometimes you're like
hellas I don't totally like scratch down
inside the cave by the case yet like
little things get in between the case
and the phone yeah little debris
scratchy scratch bums me out okay it's
okay keep your head up also look I've
been people have been ripping on me
about the fact like on Twitter I talk
about my struggles with the iphone 7 and
the lack of a headphone jack and then I
go just get bluetooth wireless just um
you know yeah just use my pear-pod yeah
it's like just buy a new headset you'll
be fine but this is the problem here
right okay Kickstarter's all these like
IndieGoGo there's a lot of people that
are trying to make a solution and guess
what because Apple helped us out with
that everyone's looking for some sort of
a dongle right so this company I el doc
lets you use a wired headphone get it
get check out this novel idea a wired
headphone while charging your iphone 7
because you can't charge it and listen
to it at the same time right now I gotta
say the doc is pretty it is very sleek
and pretty but it's funny that Apple
works so hard to make our phones so
small that now we have to like hang all
kinds of crap off of them Mina I'm like
they wind up being bigger looking bigger
and uglier in the end so I get what
they're doing this this whole wireless
Bluetooth iphone thing they're ahead of
the transition it'll be worth it in like
two years 223 should like then really
people will all start getting it but
here's my issue everyone says why i use
the dongle adapter and i use standard
headphones okay everyone's like why
don't you just use apple's lightning
headphones with your iphone 7 right well
here's the problem those freakin
lightning earbuds only work with the
iphone 7 so if I'm traveling if I need a
plug in my headphones to like another
like let's say let's say you want to
plug in your headphones into an airplane
I travel a lot airplanes don't have
lightning port know so I use the old
school 3.5 millimeter head
Jack with the dongle all the time one
time when I was walking on the airport I
pulled my phone out of my pocket with my
headphones the dongle separated from the
headphones I didn't realize it and then
I tried to plug in my 3.5 millimeter
jack headphone into the iphone 7 it
didn't work and so I walked back maybe
20 yards and then found my dongle on the
ground I'm like this is this is what
we're dealing with yeah this is like
this is what we're this is what they
gave me that is that is that's the
nightmare that everyone has like I'm
gonna lose this dongle and you lost
yours but you got like you found is
you'll have multiple headphones that
need dongles uh like at work you know
like I said sure I phone uses lightning
laptop doesn't have a lightning port on
it yet a for audio so what are you gonna
do right I you switched between I
members like buy new headphones I'm like
dude brah yeah so it's like I gots an
older pair of headphones that I just
plugged into my laptop at work but it's
like this is stuff that we never had to
deal with before I know right a whole
new world haha look I haven't had to
deal with it yet because I'm still on
the 66 s so I'm rush straight headband
but you know I do walk around I have my
headphones and I'm like I hate this wire
I want to get rid of this wire you like
to do it okay my my advice to anyone who
wants wireless headphones my favorite I
mean I've been a fan of their brand for
god knows how long at least 10 years the
bose quietcomfort bluetooth the whatever
i think to the QC 35s now think of the
35 is not the 25's there they're my
favorite headphones hands down Bose is
the bomb for traveling the noise
cancellation is sick oh yes if you want
noisy data later blame dude for sure
you're gonna knock out with those things
so that's I would just I know they're
like 350 bucks ah they're really
expensive but and when I first tried
them on I was like there's no way any
pair of headphones is worth three
hundred dollars those headphones were
three hundred dollars to me like those
things are totally worth it some people
I dude you don't got to spend like that
on bose I'm like I just let they're
really soft too dude really yeah comfort
you need to come from yeah for the
record bows is not a sponsor of this
show oh yes
a song XO want to get those holla holla
in the market we're looking we're
looking holla a sketchy report this is a
report that we don't that we talked
about way later because it makes us want
to throw up a report from Apple offices
in Israel an employee that does not want
to identify themselves as the iphone is
being referred to as the iphone 8 and is
has actual hardware pieces um they're
actually developing or building some of
the pieces of the iphone 8 in israel
that's all the phone eh that's all I'm
gonna talk about this the story already
happening starting want to make me throw
up I'm like really come on guys it looks
cool look at that that's just a fake
render marinade okay it's fine fine but
we we've been on our show we've been
continuously calling the iphone future
but we probably know that they're not
gonna go with that Yeah right before the
show you were like iphone x iphone annex
10th anniversary dog the marketing
material would look Oh marketing up the
loser of the zoo at the owl zoo and then
this story is probably the one that is
most disturbing to me about the iphone
we've brought it up multiple times on
the show motherboard a the website
published an article that says geniuses
say Apple knows about iphone 6 touch
disease this is where when you touch
your screen it stops responding it
becomes pretty much like useless you it
doesn't recognize finger swipes at all
but Apple won't admit it publicly hmm I
this to me I will continue to bring this
story up every few weeks I hope more
developments happen from because it's
wrong it's literally wrong they need to
come out and say there's something wrong
and we have a fix maybe they're waiting
till till they have a fix for it you
know no therefore they announce versa
who knows i but uh yeah that's a problem
you know when apple does apple doesn't
like to make it look like their products
are faulty or they'll do everything
possible well yeah I mean they hadn't we
had antenna gain antenna the image the
answer was a bio here's a freaky okay so
here's a free case I think thanks guys
thanks yeah it was the one phone that I
didn't want a case on from the heppell
product a long time ago like
it was good enough to not use a case but
that was the coolest designed iphone
that I remember for a while that
unfortunately to the case yes but you
can't deny look these phones are out of
warranty now so no matter what some
people get lucky and they have a genius
rep that's tight that's cool with them
most people you're gonna have to pay
three hundred twenty-nine dollars to get
this swapped out to get this fixed you
might as well buy a new iphone but Apple
is not acknowledging the issue until
they do this holt I had a couple friends
say hey my iphone 6s is having problems
and I described exactly what this issue
was to them and both of them said oh
yeah that's what most of them said
that's exactly what it is I'm like yeah
it's not covered by warranty and they
were like what so well we have that
problem in the hissing phone so you know
which one I I you know what I haven't
i've heard a couple iphone 7s and I mean
I'm not saying it it's not good but it's
not a deal breaker I mean it's it's a
sound thing right it's like coming from
the speaker so it's not like the phone
like hardware is causing a hiss it's not
like it's gonna blow up her yeah not
gonna catch fire no you should be okay
with that so um anyways Apple not happy
about this whole touch disease thing
really not happy about that at all well
let's let's let's pick up the mood real
quick alright yeah it helps me about I
have a pin yeah that's the best part
okay sorry it's all right no you don't i
love my asians they're so dope they're
so dope alright so we get to some
voicemails yeah let's do it okay okay we
put up the high shot here voicemail hi
shot okay first voicemail here we go
loja BTW how's everything going hey i
just want to say something i know oh
sorry there's a troop from Salt Lake
City true formerly from Hawaii life I
know that Apple invents everything and
is the best company ever
but they were not the first phone
company to take the courageous quotes
step to lose the three-and-a-half
millimeter jack who is actually the Moto
Z my coworker has one he got one months
ago and it doesn't have a phone jack
either I'm just tired of hearing that
Apple is the first one to take that
courageous steps thanks for the show you
guys are awesome cool Shaka brah Shaka
brah uh true I think you should call
like every week this is such a such a
dramatic delivery was dramatic it was
very dramatic and it made me smile you
are absolutely right the Moto's he was
the first no one really talked about it
but like many things I mean people
talked about it people up in arms were
they like oh my god well she does have a
headphone jacks not know like it didn't
even register on most people's radar and
because let's be honest not too many
people are buying the Moto Z so they're
not going to be mad there you're just
not going to hear people complain about
it's a pure numbers thing right like
anything the Internet can Oh like
magnify something that may not be that
big of a deal or it can really blow
something up yeah and so that that's why
but yeah motos II didn't take courage to
do that they just did it i bet you
there's some pretty smug moto z owners
out there like yeah my did it first nope
I'm ahead of the curve yeah we did I'm
ahead of the curve we did it first okay
next comes true guys hi this is Bryan
from Boston my question is is it cool to
double dongle I got a crutchfield
catalog where they highlighted this
cool-looking dragonfly digital audio
converter I was curious about the
improved sound I want to get it but
thought a dongle look too weird now with
the iphone 7 many people use dongles
anyway so I was about to buy the
Dragonfly digital audio converter but
then I realized it actually need a
lightning to USB adapter as well then
the Senate back then the headphone true
dongles so is it acceptable to double
dongle thanks no he has a there's a
funny there's a funny little clip in
there like in the beginning of his call
you can almost take some as always I
hey guys is it okay to double dongle is
like he was reading that I loved it I
loved our sound is like I could just
imagine you just throwing that in there
randomly in the show like and I double
dongle I'm like what of course you get
double double dot you can double dong as
much as you want please if that's your
thing is this I think nothing wrong with
that I think this is the dragonfly thing
is that any time out I think so but it's
yeah it has like a little analog input
on one side look I'm not going to judge
I will not judge anyone for double dong
gleam no it's equal opportunities it's
like I think its base the hairs thing
you're not probably going to be walking
around with it all the time you're using
it for a specific task so yeah double
dongle sure sure if it fits in your
pocket all right hi this is sheri from
Tennessee just wondering when carplay 2
is coming out car play too well Pixar
are they making a car too only they
already made car play two cars are you
played three coming out Lightning
McQueen was in trouble and Kerr played
20 chery chery first of all shout out to
all the ladies out there listen the
Apple white extra crunchy also shot out
two guys who have their significant
others that are ladies uh that watch the
show as well because i can't tell you
i've had people come up and say my
husband loves your show but the husband
isn't there so we'll take a picture with
the lady to send it of the husband i was
like oh so jealous I'm like I'll
whatever's just mean nothing big but um
they the car play Reese car play app
recently was updated there's not a car
play two per se but car plays
technically kind of hooked into iOS and
with the latest iOS 10 update they did a
couple things like making it easier to
reorganize your like the Apple layout I
believe like the actual Maps
functionality was improved as well car
play doesn't have you know major stuff
and I have not used I don't have a car
that could use car play my biggest thing
is that I still I still cuz i've i've
even tried testing it out recently just
with walking around the san francisco
area I still don't trust Apple maps as
much as I trust Google Maps oh yeah
better that's what it comes down to for
me yeah
the iOS 10 update that just happened
recently I've deleted Apple maps off my
phone yeah it's gone heck yeah that's
what I'm talking a so you know they have
improved Apple music on the new carplay
that's been hooked into iOS 10 as well
so it's very subtle there's it's not
like they're doing a complete interface
revamp so just you can check it out
little tweaks nothing nothing crazy cool
we got an Apple watch question good
morning gentlemen big fans of the show
this is dan calling from Orlando Florida
so I've got the original edition of the
Apple watch of a letter is Colin EOG
edition they're not series one but the
very original edition and I've got
applecare on it so I wondered what
happens if you take it to apple to be
replaced because again I've got
applecare applecare+ or whatever it's
called do they have like refurb or old
editions of the original Apple watch or
do they replace it with series one my
guess is that they probably have refurb
editions of the original but just a
curious question it I love the show guys
thank you so I used people that don't
know I used to work at the apple retail
stores years ago the very second store
in the entire chain it was the Palo Alto
store that Tyson this heist corny I was
the second one in second retail store it
was Steve Jobs his store because he
lived blocks away so he'd right into
this bike with his kids or just scoping
out it was funny because whenever Steve
Jobs came into the store it was very
tense like everyone's like a junt man
it's like his store yeah I've got some
great stories that i should say for
another time from from when he would
come in but anyways uh the they'll never
give you a like if your thing broke down
the the replacement is an actual service
part they'll give you the same exact
piece they will never give you like oh
my ipad gen1 broke here we only have
ipad threes in stock taking it take it
take a 3rd gen ipad so they will give
you an iowa Apple watch ooh I will set
it then Apple watch oh gee I like that
instead of a series 1 and definitely not
a series too but it was worth crossing
your fingers yeah totally I like that
okay last call out the devil last call
for
oh this is kareem absent from Louisville
Kentucky just calling to respond on your
sonos question it is 5.11 capability of
the front speaker when three speakers
and then you would add the to play fives
over the play ones for your 5.1 of
course you have to add us up as well
thanks love your show right cool the
cream right Kareem creates the dream
baby that's exactly why would you know
we do the show or do it on the fly we
don't know we guess what we don't know
everything actually a lot of you're like
yeah he definitely doesn't know
everything answer my question thank you
very much out yeah that that's pretty
bomb so it's basically assembling
multiple so no speakers to then build
the 5 1 i'm all about that i want that
you know and i'm only that you know what
I'm all about for them for my next
whenever it is next home theater system
dolby atmos dolby dolby atmos yeah they
have these us you have your typical like
seven now 7.1 surround sound but some of
the speakers are a speaker in the front
like normal and then a speaker on the
top that fires up to the ceiling oh cool
bounces up the ceiling down to so it it
creates even more some more like an
aversive yeah there's more space
happening like you hear the sound
bounces up the top down on you as well
as on the sides in the middle like
that's that's crazy like I love home
theater stuff but you gotta spend a lot
of money for it I know I have I like a
THX system I give you it's getting a
little dated right right I igg I have
like a five wired the thing is like my
apartment my living room is in that big
so you don't need anything like crazy
