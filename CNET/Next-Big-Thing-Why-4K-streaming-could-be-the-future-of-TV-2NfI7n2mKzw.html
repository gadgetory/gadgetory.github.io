in our very first episode of this show
back in September of 2013 and back then
we were talking about the 4k TVs
themselves now as always the
conversation turns from the gear to what
you're going to get on it to the content
welcome back
well the new LG TPS will be able to
watch 4k television from Netflix with a
great user interface on webOS and it's
just amazing set of progress play
ladies and gentlemen feast your eyes
when I'm calling the reference standard
for 4k going into video is really
important to Amazon right now they've
been focusing a lot on it lately because
it means Britney viewers back into their
ecosystem I don't know whether to be
proud or terrified Netflix is first out
with 4k streaming they've got their own
show house of cards out an unlimited
release to just some of their streaming
plugins not all of them and they're
showing a variety of those kind of lush
nature porn films which is ironic is
that's how HDTV got started - almost 20
years ago
samsung continues to build their Smart
TV platform which is built into their
televisions and their blu-ray players as
a place to come to get the content they
have deals with Fox DirecTV Comcast and
Amazon for future 4k streaming and of
course they'll also pull in Netflix 4k
speaking of Amazon that'll be the next
big shoe that drops because they've
commissioned at least four new series to
be shot in 4k and of course streamed
that way look for that to coincide with
a new version of their fire TV streaming
box that'll have the ability to pull in
and decode that 4k signal and then spin
it out on a cable to your 4k television
and I expect they're going to tie that
with a certain level of Prime membership
owning that box and maybe getting
special access to their in-house
produced shows at this point I bet
you're cringing thinking wait a minute
what's all this 4k continents coming out
I'm going to do to my poor old home
broadband connection which struggles
today to deliver an HD stream well
that's where the good news comes in from
the codec side of the story most these
providers with their new content are
using the h.265 codec it's related to
h.264 not trying to glaze your eyes over
with numbers here but that latter one is
probably already on your home HD
camcorder so it's a cousin of that the
dark horse is Google's vp9 codec this of
course will be used to create 4k streams
coming off of YouTube but they've also
got LG Panasonic and Sony promising to
use it in their televisions as well we
don't expect those products or a lot of
YouTube 4k streaming to be taking
until about 2015 now if you're wondering
where the disks are in all this so is
the rest of the world the folks that run
the blu-ray technology say they have an
extension coming that will allow the
blu-ray format to stretch if you will to
carry and then decode 4k content I don't
think it's going to be a major player
we've moved too far past the physical
media era and it's clear right now the
Internet can do at least a credible job
of delivering 4k streams by the way a
benefit to all this codec stuff that
you're not going to hear as much about
is the possibility of getting near
bufferless streaming at standard HD
levels because when you apply h.265 or
vp9
to what we're already looking at it gets
a lot smaller and with the vp9 codec in
particular google says it could be
instant start for standard HD not too
far in the future that'd be nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
