app alo is available for download on
Android and iOS
though many messaging services already
exists like Facebook Messenger and
Google's more collaborative
communication platform hangouts allo
stands out because of its integration
with Google assistants assistant is
basically a bot you can chat with that
uses Google's vast search database to
answer questions like what are the
coffee shops nearby and how do you say
hi in French you can also bring up
assistant in group chats to get details
on restaurant plans movie times or just
settle a debate alo also has smart
replies which generate a number of
generic replies during a chat these
phrases get pretty a name if you expect
to form a full thoughtful conversation
with them but they're useful when you're
on the go and have to quickly respond
Allah doesn't just recognize text either
when you send over a photo it can
recognize the subject matter and call it
responses for that image too now it's
the idea of Google services continually
keeping an ear out during your chats
creeped you out
there's incognito mode you won't get any
of the services like assistant or smart
reply but Incognito's end-to-end
encryption which aren't accessible by
Google servers will give you user
privacy
other features include chat stickers
casual image notations and the ability
to increase or decrease text size to
reflect the intensity of your action
whether you're shouting like this art
