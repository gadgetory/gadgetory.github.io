in more apple news the wall street
journal is also reporting that apple
will begin 99-cent television show
rentals with titles coming from disney's
ABC and news corp's fox other networks
seem to be wary of apples plans fearing
that they will cannibalize lucrative DVD
sales and finally bloomberg is reporting
that the highly anticipated next
generation apple TV will feature netflix
streaming service users will need to pay
netflix subscription fees but the new
apple TV may retail for just ninety nine
dollars what's left of tom at HP seems
to be determined to yet again be
overshadowed by apple HP demoed webos

together the universal search is now
just called just type and contacts
energy syncing is now open to third
parties and phones will also have an

microsoft announced plans to release an
updated xbox 360 controller that

controller will be released on November
9th and sell exclusively with
Microsoft's play and charge kit for 64
99 finally images of the t-mobile g2
phone have leaked on the web the g2 will
be the first hspa+ phone in the US and
