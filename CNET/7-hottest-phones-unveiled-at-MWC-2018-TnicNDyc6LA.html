show off their latest designs at Mobile
World Congress in Barcelona and this
year was no exception these were some of
our favorites from the show
first up Samsung's Galaxy s 9 and s 9
plus the 5.8 inch s 9 and 6 point 2 inch
s 9 plus may look a lot like their
predecessors but they have some
important upgrades for starters they fix
the position of the fingerprint scanner
they now have a faster processor and
software upgrades and a new way to
unlock but the biggest improvement is in
the camera which now has a variable
aperture that adapts to different
lighting conditions the plus also got a
second lens for better portraits and
zoom Nokia also delivered a premium
flagship phone with a Nokia 8 Scirocco a
phone that may share the same name as
last year's model but raises the bar
everywhere else the curved edges and
barely-there bezels make the look a lot
like the s9 but the screen is slightly
smaller and it has a dual and setup like
the s 9 plus but the showstopper for
Nokia may have been the 8110 or G Nokia
brought back its popular slider phone
from the 90s and gave it a refresh it
got a banana makeover a color screen and
a battery petal goal for 20 days
straight and yes it does have snake it's
the second revival of a classic Nokia
phone
next up Sony with the xperia x z2 and XE
to compact both phones have been given a
much needed design upgrade with slimmer
bezels and a sleeker form factor both
share the same specs but the X z2 has a
5.7 inch screen while the compact has a
5-inch display that's easier to maneuver
with one hand the rear camera on both
phones can shoot HDR video in 4k a first
for a phone and super slow-mo in full HD
oh yeah and if selfies are your thing
you
create one in 3d worried about security
the android-powered seeker phone could
protect your Bitcoin fortune there's a
built-in cryptocurrency wallet inside
the encrypted phone that the company
says is hack proof and if you love the
iPhone 10 but don't love the price
the Asus zenfone 5 is pretty close it's
the spitting image of Apple's 10th
anniversary phone notch and all it's
running Android and doesn't have
wireless charging but you'll pay about
half of what you would for an iPhone and
finally there's the vivo apex it has an
edge to edge display a dual fingerprint
scanner that's embedded inside the
screen for added security and a selfie
camera that pops up like a piece of
toast and while this one is still a
concept it gives us a glimpse into
what's coming to the next generation of
phones and for more details on these
newcomers and all the latest news for
Mobile World Congress make sure to check
