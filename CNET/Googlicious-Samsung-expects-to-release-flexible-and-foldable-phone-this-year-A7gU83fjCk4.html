welcome to Google issues for everything
Google that we can pack inside of a show
onto the show
and we know Google has been working on
plenty of amazing projects but check
this one out
a recent post from the big G's research
blog revealed that they are developing
photo recognition technology that can
describe a complex scene in a few words
so take this picture for example by
merging computer vision object detection
and classification and natural language
models it would be able to see this
image and automatically caption it with
two pizzas sitting on top of a stove
oven suite now that's pretty awesome the
tech could also help the visually
impaired understand pictures provide
alternate text for images in parts of
the world with slow mobile connections
and make searching on Google for Images
a lot easier now here's an example of
the system at work where it succeeded on
the left-hand column and as you go
towards the right there's instances
where it still really needs some work
it's not a finished product but another
piece of awesome stuff the goop's is
working on and just an update on
Google's Project loon it's there a
balloon based internet project to bring
connectivity to two-thirds of the
world's population that doesn't have it
yet they are starting its first real
live test with Australian carrier
Telstra project loons team will carry
out the test with 20 balloons that have
been given access to Telstra's radio
spectrum solar panels for power will
allow the balloons to remain in the air
for about three months and each balloon
will provide a signal covering up to 600
square miles
alright the Nexus 6 is out and it's
getting great reviews over all the
pluses it's amazing large and crisp quad
HD display a Snapdragon 805 processor a
great 13 megapixel camera with optical
image stabilization and that fresh coat
of lollipop that has really transformed
Android it's the most expensive Nexus to
date starting at 6:49 for a 32gb model
without contract but also the best Nexus
even if it's a little beefier in size
and weight so really if you're looking
for the best pure Android experience on
a smartphone this is it
and for everyone waiting to get their
hands on lollipop on earlier devices
google has started slowly rolling out
that update for the nexus 4 5 7 and 10
over the air all right after recently
reporting a massive 74% drop for mobile
profits in the third quarter of the year
Samsung is doing some soul-searching and
The Wall Street Journal reports that
Sammy will sell fewer smartphone models
next year as part of a cost-cutting
measure and will cut the number of
models it sells by 25 to 30% now
according to our sister site ZDNet that
won't hold them back in 2014 after
Samsung's VP of strategic business
recently claimed that they will release
a smartphone with a flexible and
foldable design that hasn't been
finalized yet but we will see by the end
of the year so yeah that's only about 6
weeks left in 2014 so I think we'll see
you at CES now they also say imitation
is the best form of flattery we've seen
every company followed the lead of
others in different areas
well Nokia is the latest with their new
Android powered and one tablet that has
more than just a slight resemblance to
Apple's iPad Mini 3 with holes for the
speaker grilles rounded volume buttons
and a metal body but on the positive
side it's one of the first devices to
support the reversible USBC connector
and it's boasts slimmer and lighter than
the current iPad Mini 3 now the enones
tagline is thinking ahead because let's
be honest the word similar was taken and
there's no way they could use the word
different all right that's gonna do it
for this week's show you can always
email us at Google issues at sea Netcom
or tweet me at brian tong pay so much
for watching it we'll see you all next
time for some more of that google ishes
