nineteenth it's episode 213 we got noisy
neighbors in the studio yeah let's get
rowdy welcome to the 359 podcast I'm BBG
joining us say we have Roger Cheng Ben
Fox Rubin and Aaron Carson all the way
from Louisville yeah mmm thanks for
joining us yeah thanks for having me
Thanks to everyone on the chat already
yes second and so on their way we're
gonna be talking about Facebook's
developer conference i'm gonna try not
to make any facet various jokes I'm just
dead did I you've already the records
also a joke trying not to make any jokes
they they made many terrible jokes for
us so know if you saw the beginning of
that conference but it was it was pretty
awkward I didn't see it when when geeks
try to be funny on stage scripted that's
the entire point of this show yeah right
and it's a bad show yeah but we're not
being funny we're being competent it's
two different things speaking of
speaking of i know will be talking about
Facebook I they're pushed for AR
augmented reality and we have Aaron on
to talk about the logged out series it
is a package of stories that deals with
death and the did your way death and
estate planning so very it's a bit of a
grim subject but also very useful very
useful very important in speaking of
Facebook what to do with your facebook
profile so as always if you have any
questions Brian will pick out the best
ones we will get to them in three
minutes and 59 seconds from 32
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day now if the
crap we want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng
I'm Ben Fox Rubin and with us a special
guest and Carson our star reporter from
Louisville she's here to talk about
logged out seen that serious about how
to deal with death in the social network
age but before we get to that we want to
talk about that other social network
Facebook and it's f8 developer
conference a big story from yesterday
was Facebook's push in augmented reality
rather than a set of glasses like
microsoft's hololens though it really
wants to give your phone the power to
create and share a our experiences you
guys had a chance to kind of look at
that france today what did you think of
the the demonstrations there the demos
some of these ideas seem just kind of
like either gimmicky or creepy to me i
don't really like them in some ways like
the AR and the vr stuff that they were
presenting were solutions without
problems i don't know if you agree with
me on that but still in the gimmicky
phase i would say a lot of it was
frankly was just copying snapchat and
connectors which are insanely popular if
you're a snapchat user you're loving
those filters and a lot of it the first
step for AR i think any Facebook kind of
tassili did that on stage was like
basically copying snapchat like we're
gonna that's our business plan right but
then you know their big push their their
second act as nukka brooke says is
really to to push a are in a way that
makes it useful that doesn't get like
gimmicky like you said like it's an
actual legit thing so Aaron what do you
think about it so Zuckerberg on stage at
least reference the idea of having like
augmented reality glasses so you're kind
of walking around in vh1's pop-up video
or something like would you wear those
it seems like a really horrible idea to
me but maybe it's just me yeah i mean i
think that there's still kind of like a
psychological barrier for a lot of
people in terms of thinking do I want to
have this piece of hardware yep on my
face Google glass is the best example
right the glass whole term came out
because of that exactly and so you know
you have a couple different battles
there's the one that says is this even
possible in terms of technology and how
far along are we but also can you get
people on board with just the concept
you're still work to do there I think
technically it's possible but I think
the bigger challenge is the call
how do you get people into wearing
glasses like this all right so next up
we want to hit a more serious note with
logged out and you wrote a couple pieces
for this package including how to get
your digital affairs in order before you
pass what did you find what are some of
the tips that like we need to be doing
if we're preparing ourselves for our own
demise sure so main idea is that once
upon a time if you died your estate
executives would maybe go into your
house and look through your bills and
figure out what accounts you had and be
able to take care of them that way but
with the proliferation of online
accounts it's very possible that they're
not going to know what exactly you have
yeah all your different obligations and
exactly what if the Month Club I think
you mentioned story exactly right you
know if there's pairs turning up on your
doorstep that was not a new year hey you
know um and so you know a good place to
start is just to inventory what you have
there's an estimate that says that the
average person has about 90 accounts Wow
yeah once you sit down and you actually
start figuring listing yeah all of a
sudden you buy that number real quick
and you need to kind of make a
determination what you want to happen to
those accounts do you want it to be
memorialized you want it to be deleted
who handles this is the same person as
the person who takes care of your estate
for example is that from a social
network perspective is there anything
you need to do is or get your affairs
settled there like you have to create a
craft a plan for someone like a look
after what happens in that situation
sure so a good thing to do is if you are
working with an estate planner you're
going to want to leave the proper
documentation so that your executives
can actually go to these social networks
with whatever the documents they need
are right and and be able to say like
yes what we want to do is in line with
what this person wanted so you're really
just trying to make it easier for the
folks who have to deal with you after
you're gone yes very helpful stuff for
more on that I check us out on cnet i'm
roger cheng i'm done fox rubin not marin
Carson thanks for listening
alright so let's jump right back in the
chat will start taking your questions
now and hangs David is very impatient he
wants to know how exactly AR is going to
work for facebook so let's give him like
a laundry list of some of the examples
that we saw at the keynote I think one
of the examples was a basically this all
works through your phone the facebook
app has a camera I think most of the
apps now have some sort of camera
function to it and the idea is that
they're reaching out developers today
yesterday to really try to build these
kinds of filters or otherwise augment
what you're seeing on the camera so it's
not just the selfie but also the rear
camera so you you know you paint sure
you you point your camera at you know a
sign or restaurant and the idea is like
the information we come up or you'll be
able to manipulate images manipulate
your face by adding filters you know
like you puking rainbows or whatever and
that's snapchat that snapchat one of the
ideas that was also mentioned as like
your you're kind of bored of the
doctor's office you can use your phone
to look at a blank table and then play
some version of like whack-a-mole right
that you can you know kind of play like
a silly little game using a are so
you're you're integrating you know the
world around you and overlaying it with
some sort of like gamification well
you're like sitting around and bored
yeah I think one thing they mentions the
idea of taking a 2d image and adding
some depth to it like basically take a
view of a foot of a room and you can
sort of manipulate it like left and
right so there's some depth to it you
can add like official balls or skittle
that make you fill a room with skittles
and so through so the importance Diana
very important yes this is rather this
is all very early days for augmented
reality sure sort of shows off what you
can do I think the idea is by reaching
out to developers you actually find more
useful applications for this stuff down
the line right it isn't necessarily you
know all about filling room skittles or
so you think so to try to qualify this
how would a r be the future of
communication that's a really good
question I mean it kind of hard to
second
kind of communication is how we
communicate now right with snapchat
especially if you're a youngin yeah uh
where's Alfred I know I know he's on
vacation he's gotta take a break every
once na no he doesn't he's a child we
can't say that on there can I say that
oh wait he's over 18 wait to find out if
he actually watches the show that he's
on when he's not on it of course not uh
but no it the idea is like we already
communicate with filters right we we
alter the way we look to show our
emotion show how we're feeling we send
off to other people this is just sort of
taking a next progression to it
absolutely Matthew dacher in in the chat
he wants to switch gears over to to
death because we're having a solid
laughing time here today speaking of
death is there a good Deadman switch in
other words services to send my
passwords and other information to
trusted parties you've you wrote about a
couple of these idea if i don't respond
to prompts after several days though yes
so there's a few options out there a one
person i interviewed used a service
called houses directive communication
systems and that's kind of this like
one-stop shop where it Corral's every
account you have every wish that you
have for that account and kinda helps
helps get all of that settled once you
are gone well the important thing to
remember because there are multiple
services out there that do different
things like you know if someone contacts
them and is like hey Bob died this week
let's shut it all down what you really
have to be careful of is all of your
accounts don't get wiped before the
people that need info in those counts
get the info right right so you can have
have to ask decision is there like that
what the questioner with the common room
asked like is there is that that actual
Deadman switch were like if you don't
check in every 30 days like they'll shut
it all down is that option doesn't that
sounds dangerous though like I don't
know totally dangers in their time out
in facebook though I thought
there was where if like you just ignored
your account they might just you know on
the other side over to Lee they don't
know but you don't actively delete
gotcha yeah the google account manager
has sort of like an in a period of
inactivity that you can specify if you
don't know log into your account in like
a year or something like that you can
set up a function to have it deleted for
example but as far as I've seen so if I
don't think there's just one switch that
I'll just take everything down no it's
totally impractical but like I imagined
for folks out there there's some
interest in something like that you're
not a bad idea I mean it's definitely
becoming something what was the the
statistic were here the other day
there's more dead people on Facebook
than alive or something like that I
really well not now Black Knight now so
but in the near like in the next 20
years or something Oh it'll completely
shift oh I mean that's yeah that's I'm
sure there'll be a point where are a
battery oh yeah we're not there yet but
that is a black bear hands look you're
just interacting with dead people all
the time like some bizarre Grim Reaper
whose job it is to go out and just start
eradicated old accounts or something
like that way Wow is so sad right I like
I like Mike Shaw a suggestion just
scheduled tweets so you can tweet from
the grave mmm pretty good that is
something I would do that's what money
service Oh wasn't there one service that
you mentioned where you can have like
recorded messages sent to people like
after you die and arguably you can do it
like a year or ten years or whatever
afterward which sounds kind of cool yeah
um is called dead social and you can
leave messages or videos they're kind of
whatever you want um the way that you
kind of kick it off is somebody has to
inform them that you've died but you can
kind of leave as many messages as you
want so I guess theoretically you could
decide that it's not at all creepy to
wish family members happy birthday
heiser or something like that or like
leave like a treasure somewhere you know
I'm cold breath I married a million
dollars ago bullied here's a map to a
great way to mess with people
right yes you got like a really wicked
sense of humor that is slightly yeah
yeah nubs also points out that while the
dead man switch is a great theory I tend
to go offline for months at a time ya be
dead pretty frequent no that's that that
would be the real week I went well you
should be i would like to manually set
that though it's like I probably won't
check facebook for like three to four or
five six months or something like that I
know that don't erase me for like a year
i think my probably i forget about it
yeah right like after like yeah after
both of it like uh did I what happened
all my accounts why are the only a
future in the future people will
actually think you had died and when you
come back on Twitter they'd be like
Roger you were dead we had a funeral let
me eyes it won't be Twitter let's go but
certainly won't be Twitter sorry at jack
yeah alright swinging back over to AR
does the AR stuff work with any phone or
specific phone with two or more cameras
specifically citing lenovo project tango
that's from our friend yahoo that's a
great question i mean he wasn't really
clear i think the idea is that they want
to create a platform for his many people
as possible so logically that would be
every phone and he will any phone
basically that has a facebook yeah dog
material the the project tango phone
that he's referring to i think it was
the lenovo fab to pro is which is a
giant monster of a phone that no one
owns it has multiple cameras for depth
sensing and it definitely AR to the next
level its way it's way more advanced
than your typical phone but i don't
think that's what facebook is going for
here they're starting little bit more
kind of a rudimentary level that's
because they want to get as many people
as possible to use this stuff and a fab
to pro is not gonna be it and this isn't
going to result in fab to pro sales
skyrocket obviously has anybody got any
prospective compare and contrasting
facebook AR experience versus hololens i
think they're pretty different I mean
this is faisal through these folks
variances to the phone so with like
Pokemon go whereas hololens like you
wear this heavy headset and it's a
katani screen that floats in front of
you you could sort of see what's going
on there's a minimal interaction to it
but it it's the same principle but it's
done in a very different way by the way
we didn't talk about Facebook spacing
right we there we are talking so much
about AR yeah this is the VR hangouts
where you can basically like we could be
doing the podcast in VR we're like bvg
is I don't know like in Jamaica and you
just by poured in and we're all like in
a virtual reality space doing something
that was also another demos like I think
they showed a demo where we're all one
space one woman's brag about this new
apartment she just got just like clicked
a button like the VR space turned into
the apartment so they could all share
that experience to see what it's like
that's what I want is a better way to
for somebody to brag yes yeah and that's
what technology is all about right
you're not wrong oh you could also like
take selfies while in the VR right you
take facebook video calls so Lexus
someone who doesn't have a VR headset
they could still join in the
conversation via the video feed my
problem with all this is like you need
to have like a super expensive oculus
set with a nice computer to run all this
yeah and so the social elements a little
damaged by the fact that you not
everyone can take part in this I mean
eventually like everything that will
become a little more consumer it's
cheaper to the line for sure bread but
it goes back to what I was thinking is
that what exactly is the solution like
what is what is it solving their that
you're actually going to spend
potentially thousands of dollars or like
let's say even a thousand dollars like
why is it how is it making my life that
much better how is it actually improving
things beyond a Skype phone call or a
regular phone call or like texting
somebody that's why like I have a bit of
skepticism about this because there's a
there's definitely like a high like
there's there's a big expense attached
to it at this point yeah yeah be
interested to call out to the chat see
if anybody is kind of on board to the
arv are trained who's excited about it
who's auntie MMA rvr who things like i
haven't used facebook in years what the
hell you guys talking about we got to
wrap it up soon that we apologize for
all the regulars that we're going a
little early today and cut a little
short today we've got a big project this
afternoon we had to work on a special
guest coming in I'm not going to
you about but I'm going to teach you to
keep an eye on cnet to learn more very
sunny so one more to close it out with
and this is kind of a fascinating idea
Assad remarks that he recalls Mark
Zuckerberg saying something about being
able to write a comment just by thinking
about it uh I hate this idea oh yeah no
no that's gonna happen I think there's
been working on I hate decide they're
all working on it Google Facebook
they're all working on like brains all
right so knowledge an attached to tell
me I'm gonna demonstrate what that's
going to be like without the technology
this afternoon just check my facebook
around four o'clock there'll be 67 posts
about pizza and here's here's what I
think about that idea I'm doing all
right now that was that was illuminating
smooth very smartly the both disciple
