desktop to be as big and as huge and as
powerful as humanly possible if that's
you then you should take a look at the
new asus rog GT 5 one you can of course
inside this massive tower fit in you
know k-series current gen intel core i7
cpu you can put two graphics cards if
we're gonna want to max it out that's
gonna be two Nvidia Titan X cards and of
course a couple of SSD drives the huge
design here actually serves a purpose
this gigantic thing right here is not
just lit up for show it's part of the
it's part of the airflow system air
comes in here and goes out through the
top and through the back a couple of
hidden secrets here as well I really
love that it comes with this band that
actually has an NFC chip in it and if
you wear it and you go right here near
the front of the system that will open
up a shadow drive basically a hidden
hard drive partition in case you want to
keep some files private and you have to
wear this band you go just like that and
then you can open up your your Shanno
partition this can also activate
overclocking on the system if you only
want that to be active when you want it
to be when you just want to wave your
hand there instead of actually opening
up a software utility to do that well
this is not gonna come cheap
depending on how you configure it I can
get to many many thousands of dollars
and if you want the full experience you
should add in some of the new gaming
peripherals including these very
powerful keyboards and mice at CES 2016
that is the Asuza rog GT 5 one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
