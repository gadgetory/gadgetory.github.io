Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update it seems Google's flagship
Motorola phone the Moto X will not be
sold at every carrier store when it
rolls out at the end of August a
t-mobile executive told the blog All
Things D now the company will not be
stocking the Moto X in stores
immediately but people will be able to
go to Motorola's website to purchase a
model that works on the t-mobile network
this phone is supposed to be sold at all
major carriers but if it takes a while
for it to get into t-mobile stores
that's not good for the fate of the
phone it'll be harder to make a dent in
sales against Samsung if the Moto X
isn't all over the place but then again
one of the big selling features of this
phone is being able to customize the
color design and storage and to do that
it would have to be purchased online
anyway Motorola is also hoping it can
get customers attention with its
touchless controls like being able to
always listen to your voice commands to
turn it on and give it a command you
don't have to touch it you just need to
pick magic words
okay Google now to set it up I had to
teach the phone my voice so it won't
respond to a man's voice but other women
in the office were able to turn it on ok
Google now if you use a password on your
phone and you should it'll still let you
use the ok Google now command to call
someone without entering in your
password which is nice for drivers for
every other hands-free trick like
playing a song sending a text or setting
a reminder it won't grant your wish
without a password Amazon is copying
Pinterest with a new feature called
Amazon collections where members can
save share and discover new products by
browsing and following other people's
collections Amazon users can make
separate lists for different things you
can find the collection section in the
drop down menu when hovering over your
account and to add a product to your
collection you just click the Add button
below a product image but these add
buttons are still being rolled out so
you may not see it everywhere at first
and Pinterest is taking on online
shopping by adding price drop
notifications to the items that you've
pinned so it's not just a wish list it
can be a sale tracker as well
if you have Netflix keep an eye out for
new digital profiles for different
family members Netflix did have profiles
before with DVD rental subscribers but
now there are profiles for the streaming
side to help keep settings personal so
dad doesn't get kids shows in his
recommendations when account gets up to
five profiles and these profiles can be
set up on the Netflix website or on the
PlayStation 3 the profiles will be
rolling out to devices over the next two
weeks that your tech news update and you
can dive into more details at cnet.com
