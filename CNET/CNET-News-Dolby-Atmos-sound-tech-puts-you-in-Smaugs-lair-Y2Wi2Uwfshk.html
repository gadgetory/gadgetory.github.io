especially when moviegoers experiences
scenes from the hobbit the desolation of
smaug in a theater with a dolby atmos
sound system we would have smaug's voice
and his growls do this interesting thing
where they would emanate from his from
his mouth but then they would flow
through the room and then bounce off the
back wall the Atmos system is the first
to put individually controllable
speakers in the ceiling in addition to
the standard front back and side walls
of a theater essentially increasing the
audience in a bubble of sound that way
we can actually make sound more
naturalistic more lifelike so when
something moves through the room it
basically goes from speaker to speaker
to speaker to speaker instead of the way
it does normally it hits every speaker
then fades surround sound is a loud
powerful tool but not very precise with
Dolby Atmos every sound can be isolated
so the audience contracts a the
individual flutter belief around the
room or the buds of the helicopter
across the sky
the Atmos technology gives sound mixers
like Academy award-nominated Christopher
Boyce precision control over sound
effects placing individual sounds around
the room if I took a specific wind and
put it up in the ceiling and then took
different winds and moved them in
different places of the the room that I
got this very expansive feeling and you
felt like you were up on top looking at
this huge Vista around you in the movie
gravity sound mixers used Atmos to
manipulate the position of voices like
Edie Harris's and Mission Control to
talk to astronauts played by George
Clooney and Sandra Bullock Explorer this
is Houston I have a mission abort this
sound is actually being positioned into
the ceiling so you're kind of hearing it
as if you're as like as George and
Sandra Bullock are in that space
hallways which gives the overall feeling
to the audience that they're along for
the ride really helps focus you in the
moment as to what's going on and really
pushes you into the screen of the story
normally when you go to the movies you
want to sit in a very center to get the
best sound experience the sweet spot but
now with Dolby Atmos you get that same
great sound experience whether you sit
here or here or even here right now only
450 theaters are equipped with the Dolby
Atmos system expansion plans are in the
works so more movie goers can experience
alongside their favorite characters do
not think I won't killing walls in San
Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
