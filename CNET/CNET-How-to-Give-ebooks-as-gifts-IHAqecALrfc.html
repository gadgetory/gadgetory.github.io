gifts for just about any occasion but
chances are your friends or mom or dad
are now using an e-reader and you can't
exactly put a bow on a digital file I'm
Sharon Vaknin and today I'll show you
how you can gift an e-book to anyone who
prefers eating over paper bag before you
do anything find out what kind of
ereader the gift recipient has it might
be the Nook the Kindle I books for iOS
devices or even the Sony Reader get that
info first and then pesco if your
recipient has a nug you'll need to find
out what their email addresses then find
the nook book you want to purchase on
the barnes a noble website and click buy
as gift you'll have to register for an
account which is kind of annoying and
then you'll fill out a form before
completing the purchase what's neat is
that you can set a delivery date so you
can set it so that your friend receives
your gifts on his birthday or other
special occasion when they receive the
ebook gift they'll have the option to
redeem the book or trade it in for a
gift card or nook app if they want
something else kindle gifting works the
same way on amazon.com find the kindle
version of the book you want to gift
then click the give as gift button over
here on the right if you don't have
their email address you can choose to
email the gift to yourself and then
forward it to your recipient or give
them a printed version on a real piece
of paper which is cool if you want to
put it in a greeting card but if you
choose to email it to the recipient
directly you'll have the option to set a
delivery date here at the top if your
recipient reads using the iBooks app on
their iPhone iPad or iPod touch it's a
little trickier you can't gift books
from the iBookstore in iTunes because of
licensing issues but you can purchase a
gift card and add a note to suggest a
book title the other option is to buy
them a nuke or camel book and suggest
they read the book with one of the free
iOS apps the other option is to buy them
a book from the nook or kindle book
stores then use the telephone feature to
point them to the appropriate free app
they can use to read the book if you
don't know which ereading device your
recipe you
uses but you still want to give them
with a book there is one other option
Kobo sells millions of ebooks an ePub
format which is universal and works with
almost any device just head to kobo
ebooks calm find the book you want and
choose to download it in epub format
then you can put it on a thumb drive or
email it to the lucky person who gets it
so even though paper books are on their
way out there are still lots of ways to
give gifts to the bookworms in your life

process send me a tweet and subscribe to
