TVs its flagship televisions for 2017
the Q stands for quantum dot which has
been improved from previous years
according to Samsung the new quantum
displays are brighter they have 1500 mm
niche which is extremely bright they
also have improved color reproduction so
all told Samsung says these are the best
picture quality TVs they've ever
produced unlike last year the flagship Q
9 series is flat and not curved of
course on the flip side it doesn't have
the full array local dimming that we've
liked on previous models instead it's an
edge local dimming design we'll wait to
see how that affects picture quality
there's also a curve series shown here
it's the q8 this is a 78 inch size that
set is again edgelet local dimming but
instead of the flat screen it's curved
like a lot of Samsung TVs in the past
beyond the picture quality sets have a
few new features one is a larger one
connect box it's an external box into
which you connect all your HDMI devices
new for this year that box has an IR
blaster so it can control your cable box
so you can close up the cabinet so
everything can be operated without
line-of-sight from the remote that's
pretty cool another feature is the
umbilical between the one connect box
the TV itself it's made of fiber optics
extremely thin designed to kind of hide
out on the wall without having to go
through the wall itself the TV comes
with a five meter cable length and you
can also get a 15 meter one as an option
Samsung is also in a couple new things
with installation it's compatible with a
new very flush wall mount bracket that
clings to the wall a lot more closely
than previous models you can also buy
some new stands with this TV to add to
the aesthetics of the model one of those
stands as an easel design and another is
a squat little base that could rotate
very nicely all told the samsung q LED
tvs focus on picture quality and will
being among the more expensive LED tvs
on the market compete directly against
LG's OLED z' we'll see how they do in
that competition 2017 I'm David Kazmaier
