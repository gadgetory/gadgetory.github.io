like trees and nuts and implants and so
forth extract carbon from the sky and
embed it in themselves that's known as
biomass the process of gasification
takes this biomass and then extracts
energy out of it and the only thing left
over is pure carbon or charcoal which
can then be put back in the ground this
is the only form of carbon negative
energy in the world how it works is this
we take biomass like this and put it in
the hopper it's heated up in a low
oxygen environment that breaks down the
long-chain hydrocarbons and releases a
vapor that's full of hydrogen that
hydrogen goes directly into an irregular
car engine turn it on and it works
anything that's dense and organic we can
extract energy out of to make to run an
engine so there's there's four main
pieces there's the hopper that holds the
fuel the reactor where it's burned or
smolder to get the energy a filter to
make sure it's clean and then an engine
so you're basically looking at kind of a
fuel refinery and then an engine side by
side one of these is strong enough to
run about three or four households in
the united states i need to have to fill
it every couple every four hours or so
palm kernel shells from West Africa
stone fruit like peach pits corn cobs
wood chips like pine peanut shells and
wood pellets they all work and we have a
lot of them go after we're done turning
this into energy what we have left is
this kind of charcoal so you can
physically put this in the ground you've
done two things one you've taken carbon
out of the sky and put it back
underground where it belongs and to this
is kind of like plant crack plants will
grow up to twenty percent more if they
have this as a soil supplement this
isn't our dwie niall controller which
allows us to control all the process of
moving the fuel temperature sensors
everything we need to know to micro
control the reaction process inside the
reactor so we know how much fuel were
making and what its content is the
ability to make renewable energy
anywhere you want whenever you want for
a dime is unprecedented our goal is to
make them easier we want to get to the
point and we know we can get to the
point where you can take any organic
thing a tree chunk a coconut a burrito
anything and put it in a device and
outcomes electricity we know the steps
to get there these are some of the first
steps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
