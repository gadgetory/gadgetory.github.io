almost as big as the original x5 did BMW
make it better or just bigger let's
drive the 2011 bmw x3 xdrive35i and
check the tech this is only the first
major redo of the x3 a compact sports
activity vehicle in BMW speak and it
speaks with a different accent than the
first generation x3 because it's now
made in South Carolina at a BMW plant
instead of in Austria by a contract
partner of BMW for what it's worth now
I'll say this I Drive a lot of cars
every year and this one got more
comments than 90% of them a lot of folks
either knew there was a new x3 on the
market or they just took one look at it
and said that must be a new x3 it's a
very different looking vehicle this
one's got all kinds of contour lines
stuff going on here is pure fashion the
front end the headlights are much more
stylized in keeping with the rest of
BMWs line so they've clearly moved the
whole vehicle upmarket in terms of what
it says as it drives by let's get on to
what's really new in this car it's quite
a few things actually
first of all BMW Assist that has always
been there telematics platform but
there's a lot more to it now you can
drop down here to BMW search hit the ok
and now even with my phone not connected
I'll prove it battery out I'm gonna get
online it'll take all damn day but I'm
gonna get online the car has a built-in
wireless radio a cellular data radio
once a few bits of data make it into the
car here's what you've got you've got
some business quotes on the top that's
Bloomberg powered you've got business
search this will let you do a free-form
search powered by Google for a business
you might want to navigate to or call
but as you can see with all this stuff
slow does matter it's not just a matter
of degree it's a matter of impatient
beyond my level
distraction comfort well it takes that
long I'm not going to use it and here my
results notice this stuff's all Pio I
our point of interest oriented it's not
a wide open Google search if I put Lady
Gaga in there it's going to go find
local concert dates not pull up pictures
of her this is one of the first beamers
to offer BMW apps that means support for
Facebook Twitter and web radio right in
the iDrive interface under the hood of
this technology is also iPod out support
which should mean your iPod or iPhone
can stream video to the dash and in the
future even echo its interface there as
well should BMW let it new x3 is with
nav also supports some blackberries for
email integration the emails displayed
on the screen and/or read to you with
text-to-speech I would have tried it but
nobody I know carries a blackberry
anymore now for your audio choices a lot
of things are familiar here you've got
am/fm and HD radio BMW has been pretty
warm that technology even if consumers
aren't under our CD multimedia category
we of course have CD or DVD playback
when you're parked through our single
slot right here in the console music
collection takes us to our hard drive
external devices I've got my iPod
plugged in right now to the USB port
here in the console and new ish for BMWs
Bluetooth audio not just bluetooth for
hands-free calling these guys we're kind
of late to the game on this compared to
some of their competitors particularly
the Asian ones and we have a rear-view
camera on this car as you can see I've
got trajectory lines I've also got zone
markings see those yellow boxes right
there they're telling you where there's
something in the way I've also got sonar
on the right-hand panel so you see it's
picking up things like garbage cans and
that and that pole over there and that
totally tech more mechanical tech is
this panoramic roof it's all a cart not
part of a package you don't have to get
this but I love these when they're done
well and this one is it's pretty wide
and you've got a fixed panel in the
second row moving panel here although
like all of these when you move the
front panel back it kind of parks it a
convoluted mess of dividers and bars
over the second panel someone's gonna
crack that code it's gonna be a
breakthrough
all right because we had the xdrive35i
we get the hotter motor same size
displacement as the 28 but this guy's
got the twin stage turbo 1 turbo but
it's a twin scroll internally so you can
operate efficiently at different rpm
ranges bottom line you've got 300
horsepower 300 foot pounds of torque
very even easy to remember gets this guy
up to 16 about five and a half seconds
while delivering 1926 mpg now all X 3s
are all-wheel drive which is the X Drive
part of the name and one choice on the
transmission 8-speed automatic highly
electronic even from the controller
which is this paddle that just moves
switches around no mechanical linkage
there now driving the x3 is a more
refined proposition that it used to be
again everything's been smoothed out
made a little more luxurious a little
more sophisticated feeling I did find
tossing this thing around on little nice
country roads like this it felt a little
Jhansi and or a little tippy not you
know in a really incompetent way but I
don't know more than I expected
other than that you've got the 8-speed
automatic here as I mentioned the
paddles here it's up shifting the right
downshift on the left there on the wheel
so they're basically a gimmick you got
your rocker switch here for sport normal
and Sport Plus no comfort mode this car
doesn't go there to a really soft cushy
situation with the amount of suspension
travel it has I'm not sure it needs that
as I said this thing's got a lot of give
already the power generally comes on
well as it always does in these n55 BMW
motors although I seem to find this
one's a little more a little more
flat-footed than some of the other cars
like the 3-series with this it's always
hunting it's Top Gear I'm detecting more
either downshift delay or turbo spooling
lag or both so it was not a fun car to
cut and thrust in city traffic with
unless you had it down here in the sport
gate and we're running your own gears
then you're in good shape it's really
quite manual then
but in any of the sport modes of
automatic I don't know it's a car that
feels a little bit disconnected
sometimes not horribly just more than
you might expect from a car that says
it's this sporty but you may have
noticed all that efficiency dynamics
stuff on the car on an x3 that means it
has electric power steering and brake
regeneration both techniques reduce
parasitic drag on the engine by
eliminating one rotating accessory
steering pump and lessening the load on
the other the alternator that in turn
increases mpg okay let's price this guy
may take a while to BMW after all
starting off at 42,000 base for a 35 I
the turbo motor to go seen that style
you got to add thirty two hundred bucks
for the tech package that'll get your
hard drive GPS hard drive space for
audio the rear camera the panoramic
roofs not included by the way that's
thirteen fifty more the tech package
also rolls in the blackberry stuff and
also the Google search but not the apps
those are 250 extra I'm measly 250 and
an insulting all a cart move by BMW ad
1,300 bucks for the head-up display it's
pricey but it's the best of the business
and finally a lot of folks like the M
Sport Package which includes that
performance handling stuff and some
fancy wheels and some different trim at
3,000 more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
