Friday februari fifth you're doing good
it's friday who feels bad on a friday
not rush rush nope not me I feel great
how are you dude i'm good i woke up with
a snowy world around me and then i
walked here and it was like weirdly like
spring so it's been a very odd day
weather-wise is warm out now yeah it's
like nice it's like 50 degrees something
bad is happening what the world is not
in great shape this should have been
ghostbusters 3 yeah this is how it
starts exactly that's weird yeah brief
Segway the best way that they come up
with to get into the museum and
ghostbusters 2 is to reanimate the
Statue of Liberty fill it with happy
ooze play music and bash the ceiling
open with the torch of the Statue of
Liberty I think you're overlooking the
fact that the Ghostbusters realized they
needed something the city could stand
behind and it's the overwhelming
positive message yeah that the Statue of
Liberty decrees that helped the ghost
bust because that was the problem and
ghostbusters to write the problem was
that negativity and it was just a bunch
of assholes yeah if you remember the
quote from the mayor treating everyone
like dirt is what something is every the
New Yorkers god-given right right you
want me to go on TV and tell them
otherwise or something exactly yes okay
but Lenny I mean come on so so what you
think yeah do you think in this post
9-11 world if someone saw the Statue of
Liberty walking down the street they
feel filled with pride and happiness or
they'd be terrified and the evil whose
would win out well and viggo would suck
the so little baby ghostbusters 2 took
did not take place in that world as we
don't know that's true that's why it's a
work of art from its time it is there's
no way you know look what I never really
understood was like the way they start
that movie off yeah where they're like
oh
forgot about how we saved the city right
how do you forget that like I know there
weren't cell phone cameras back how many
years have passed is it like it's like
four yeah it's not like it at 10 it's
like four years and you know they're
talking about like how no one
appreciates them how they got sued by
every you know a city governing body in
the whole entire state and they're like
oh we totally ate for that right
and then people are like oh this that's
that gigantic marshmallow man you did
that yeah that's your fault oh so they
blame them right it kind of blamed them
photo/lee I think that's reasonable no
they figured it was their fault I mean
the thing did explode well like ghosts
containing thing Walter Peck did that
Walter peckville granted but like no one
was in there to Walter Peck some credit
man the guys passion about the
environment that's sure like he did his
job either I defy the head of the EPA in
New York to have that kind of of due
diligence yeah i defied I I would be
sure I don't think he imagined the
output no I don't think I go to the
output I think if he knew the end result
he would have said okay may take a
minute maybe let's work this through
yeah I love that guy by the way he is
like such a great which is really what's
his young asian tired one awesome it's
so good it's such a sleaze ball he is he
plays a great he's also in bio dome yes
I'm system biodome lepidoptera hahaha
lovely wow so that was a little tail
spin that I freaking love yep um yeah so
that's what's happening today in New
York indeed avi go it's coming back the
carpathian yes so yeah it's a weird
weird day in New York weather-wise uh
there's like this crane accident was
challenged to I'm sure you might have
heard about it on your local news
channel because that's like you guys
listen to whatever happens kinda weird
but you know it was like on CNN news
video it's weird I guess that crane
accidents tend to make national news I
think because they're of how like really
scary they look yeah I think you have a
really powerful visual and I'm not
trying to downplay it someone
die sure but like if there's like like
for example a bunch of people fall in
front of trains in new york city every
year according to the ads in the subway
and we know according to those ads in
the subway that wait don't do never
national news no yeah this is more
dramatic yeah more of it i hate to just
water it down and over something you
have a crane falling on buildings that's
crazy that's scary yeah and that's a bit
something to look at yeah grim it's grim
but i don't want to stay grim for long I
want to get into what what more do they
on the show again you're getting two
shows this week that's a that's a
special okay has that ever happened yeah
well there was a tall one is a least 25
days a week really I remember you
remember that I do but then we don't
know people people we spake as a child
and we grew up we put away childish
things right that's precisely accurate
not that the 44 is a child I should know
it's very mature you know seen it's
gonna start doing some more podcasts
yeah yeah i think i can say that okay do
you want to do another podcast for sure
was never coming no I'm not gonna do it
but I know they're doing like a daily
one soon they haven't like a daily
quickie thing okay where it's like news
yeah yes sooner dish called the nooner
they should we do a an auto one I think
it's called all an autoerotic
Association no not no not all right not
in the vein of that I mean of
automobiles got cars and could have
been short for anything good literally
could have been anything weird that's
called autocomplete okay it sounds a
little dirty us a little bit hey Otto to
full completion yeah a lot of the
roadshow guys are doing that fun I think
we're ready up to Episode four on that
so check that out if you're into cars is
that weekly I want to see that's weekly
and then I think we're doing other stuff
yeah yeah someone had seen it was like
hey we should do podcasts again when
they were like well you know you've had
a show that's that's got almost 1,700
episodes right and they're like never
heard of what was a call oh what the
hell is a cat some numbers it's just
much numbers oh I don't get it screw
that all right let's get into the
stories of the
day kids what do we got cooking here
kids I want to talk about uber okay I
don't talk about ubers new logo cuz it's
the ugliest goddamn thing I've ever seen
in my entire life it's awful it doesn't
even make sense have you people seen it
do you even know what waiting to logo is
it is it the is it the one on the left
or the one on the right one of them it's
one in the middle so so I'll give
everyone a chance to pull this up if
you're not driving a car or hopefully
you have to paint a visual picture yeah
I'll try and do the extra I'll try and
do that um so you're giving people a
second to load this up on their phones
or wherever they're doing just make sure
you're not driving while you're doing
this that's super unsafe ah the new logo
for uber is what I can only describe is
what looks like a little circuit board
oh well let's okay so if you don't
remember though the old logo is
essentially a you with like some extra
little limbs it's like a cup yeah a
little bit of a seraph looks like a
situation come up with a hole in the top
it was very classy very distinguished I
thought I think it was fine I think it
looks a little cheap but that's just my
general take um but they went in a
completely different I don't understand
yeah so the new logo at its core is just
like a circle with a square in the
center of the circle almost like a
subway token yeah in a line coming out
of the left of the square so it's not
even a you anymore no it's not a letter
it's what is it is it like an asshole is
it like a GPS on the side it's an
asshole yeah if you tilted your head to
the side I guess it's a but um is it
supposed to be a GPS indicator that's
what I thought and I read a little more
about it and they're sort of saying it
represents like something on an atomic
level oh right yeah so so when you stare
this befuddling piece of artwork even
longer you can kind of make out that
there's these sort of symmetrical
mathematically you know drawn circular
lines that are in each corner of the
bigger square
that the circle and square reside in oh
it's a destination is know it but is it
I think that's what the idea is what it
does is getting to a destination but
it's not but that is there's a driver
one as well and the driver 1 is a square
with two lines going into it implying
that you've done a pain side a hexagon
yeah inside hexagon so you've done a
pickup and now you're driving to other
place no it's not good I don't I agree
these are very ugly pieces of clip and
what's gonna end up happening is like I
feel like a lot of people were like
might have uber on their phone and like
wouldn't be able to spot it like
obviously you can read uber underneath
the icon but I know I'll tell you by the
icon I'll tell you if they changed I'll
bet they haven't you they did oh really
it's a it's different look it on my
phone here I can't even find it oh I
mean it does say uber says uber says the
word uber blow it but that's just
because androids I hang your never
you're never gonna you know what's even
more horrifying than the logo which I
really hate is how much they probably
paid for this logo like you do you think
people at uber are so far up their own
asses that they don't realize that this
logo would piss every single person
attached to the company off yes that's
what it is yeah cuz they've been living
in a world of like pure profit for the
last five you have just been eating
money yeah just been like swimming in it
using it to brush their teeth using it
in their fireplace using it to warm
their home yeah I don't like I'd be
curious I mean I agree that like the old
logo was not the best but I thought the
old one was fine it was fine it was fine
and identifiable if it like rope don't
like when you get an uber driver and
they drive up and they have the little
thing in their window to indicate their
that's a really looked good right it
looks fine now it's not even a letter
it's yours this sideways butthole
driving everything what is this all
coming at me from the side I don't want
that in it and and the article i'm
reading here from the Washington Post is
like yeah some drivers are pissed
including the guy this article talked to
this guy aunt sue sarin he's like yeah
this is confusing I don't you know he
said he didn't like it he said I don't
think it works doesn't represent uber
they should be working on something
better than that
I agree yeah it through a band sue
you're right yeah what are you gonna
have this little like light up butthole
in your in your windshield it might be
because there was this tradition in
Silicon Valley that was very popular
which is just like you have a letter as
your icon like you look at Facebook's
icon and various other things like that
was the cliche so maybe they wanted to
like do something a little bit different
this is different this is different it's
just stupid say one thing nice about it
I kind of liked the you can't say it's
different gritted background like the
little like artsy mosaic background
that's about it are they different color
I can't tell the ones blue and ones red
yeah I can't the blue the blue is the
normal uber the Rose a green it's like a
teal it's like a dark turquoise one uh
yeah this is fun it's not it's not good
and the UH and the other one is like a
dark magenta like a dark it is weird
that they have to like two icons for
drivers and well I get that like it's
always been linked and it's a different
app it's always been a two sided thing
yeah we talked about this a while ago
I'll bring it up again I'm trying to get
over drivers like straight up telling me
my rating when I get in the car uh is it
a positive rating yeah I have like a 48
so don't you think they're saying it as
like except five your rating is really
good I'm good you know rate me well and
I'll rate you well there's a lot of that
going on yeah but the guy I had the
other day come back from CBS said he's
like Jeff you're he's like I don't
usually he's like they'll they'll always
preface it with like I don't usually
tell people I am i but they don't my
butt aka the new eber logo no um yeah
he's like you got a four point eight men
yeah most New Yorkers have four or below
right I was like wow that makes me
special I'm like and then we got into
the show so I bring this up because I
got a very candid conversation about
tipping without with you / dryer okay so
like I said I was like hey do you
realize you know like we got I forget
how it it got into it but he's like some
you know he's like and people tip me and
I'm like you know
that's a weird way to ask me for a tip
right by talking about how people tip
you right and then I said you understand
like part of uber early success was the
the the peace of mind knowing that I
kept them you're just not supposed like
uber without saying it right Uber's
basically implied and and don't tip
because we're taking care right not of
tipping but other way men enough to not
require a tip yeah and it's like oh
that's you know that's all propaganda
I'm like I don't know they do like a
boots on the ground grassroots yeah
paint it's like he's trying to hurt her
I was trying to swindle some try me
and well well uber is trying to swindle
stuff by the rates plummeting which they
have in recent years because like
they've become the norm so like they can
lower their rates more dramatically so I
get why he's doing that but yeah I mean
I'm not gonna tip over drivers I'm sorry
like even after this great conversation
we had yeah I'm just not gonna give you
know so so I got so so then I was like
okay it's on this rhetoric conversation
having it's on right and I basically got
him to say if someone gives me a five
that's just as good as tipping so like
really yeah I guess it cuz you get
higher priority right i mean i give
fives you I throw five out like it's
nothing yeah pretty pretty much I mean
you don't have to do much you don't have
to offer me water or anything to get a
5c I think everyone starts at four and
you either go up or you go down from
four okay or you got it because you know
what they say about what you know how
you do those poor those ratings of like
customer service people where they're
like please stay on the line to do a
review of me oh you know what are you
kidding but you know it it depends you
son of a bitch if I ever how much
goddamn time do you have if I have a
really good person and they were really
helpful I will stay on the line but the
important thing is for those your the
word as I understand it they only look
at two reviews the five star reviews and
the one star reviews if you give a three
or a four or to see ignore and
completely ignored right because what
kind of although I don't know yeah I
guess what kind of like amazing
constructive criticism right you
shouldn't even be
they're at that point I even pay
attention it should just be awful or
great right I'm fine with that thumbs up
thumbs down what do you need variance
for well then if it's thumbs up thumbs
down then then you're gonna get a lot
more coming through where's like you
know saying like a kid it can't be that
binary yeah I don't know anyway thanks
to what the hell was his name rich
thanks to rich my uber driver hooking it
up but you didn't tip him know it in tip
of and I gave him five sec I gave him
five stars cuz I said I would and he
said he'd give me five stars yeah and
then you know we shook hands and went on
our way there is nothing better than
sitting silently in the back of her like
a really bad uber driver and being
miserable and then yes the second you
get out of the car you're like BAM one
star why would you do that if he's a
tear like I've had drivers getting like
Oh accident all a bad drivers wait
you've been in an uber accident like a
fender be like no no no like he clipped
the side of a toll booth with his mirror
my generation yeah yeah you get a 1 or
like he's making he's like a bad driver
there's like various other things that
can go wrong that i will once star
people i think uber is on the cusp of
having to deal with a lot of these
little minutiae sorta things were like
they're all like some of them are idiots
with the phone and they just use their
phone on their lap like oh look
horrified if it's if it's mounted sure
and then and they only use it like when
they're stopped yeah I'm okay with it
not okay with it if you're in like
suburbia where you're driving like but
when you're in New York and you're like
stopped at a light yeah you tap stuff
Ryan care sure but these morons using it
while they're driving i'm just like
that's not cool I was coming back from
the airport and some guy he had it
mounted against this here and then the
phone overheated and he liked unplugged
it and then is like trying to fix on his
lap trying to fix the phone I'm like can
you just like not to worry about I'll
plug in the address and you can use my
gps and he's like no no I got it yeah
one star in one storm getting one star
for that yeah exactly you deserve one
star ver man bad new new york
city taxes just need better software get
with it so and you'll file a little bit
of Vince
on that I know are they have an app
called arrow okay that nobody knows is
that and knowing is it but it connects
the like that's crazy it apparently it's
uber yeah and then the price I don't
know how prices are comparable I don't
know how it works yeah they were share
that's the problem is like you can't
beat overshares prices there no wicked
crazy ad and in New Jersey uberx dropped
by fifteen percent i mean i'm trapped
i'm going i'm coming back from devil
games like I'm going from Newark to
hoboken for eight dollars crazy it's
crazy that it's just you're just not
people use it in San Francisco is like a
commuting tool yeah like they don't use
it as like a special when it's that
cheap it should seven bucks right where
it should replace your car it's not all
right that's enough about uber let us
know what you think god dammit Hoover I
want to talk about something called
error 53 yeah I guess I didn't know
about this until I read the link you
posted in here and it's pretty
interesting yeah it's real interesting
and scary air 53 is a specific apple
iphone software error that basically
threatens to kill your iphone because it
only appears when the phone knows it's
been repaired by a non apple authorized
repair person yeah I don't think that's
fully accurate okay it's just picked
apart a little bit yeah so I read the
article and the idea is all these people
essentially their phone breaks or ever
they bring it there one guy was in like
like Jakarta or flourish like in the
middle of nowhere and he brings it to
some guy to fix the iphone they fix the
iphone it works great and then he
updated the iOS 9 and the second he did
that he got this error 53 brought it to
an apple store and essentially they were
like yeah it's toast it's done like it
won't work anymore and the people are
saying essentially it's a way to
discourage people from going to third
party retail places to get their phones
fixed and it's a way to encourage people
to just go to apple and pay apple to get
their phones so that's the one
side of it and let me start by saying i
don't necessarily have a side but these
are both sides from a consumer of a
consumer standpoint that sound
like apples take on it or their
opinion what they've said is essentially
touch ID is the little circle home
button that reads your fingerprint and
it's like the security device so what
they're saying or this girl is that the
phone can't discern they didn't say this
specifically but essentially the phone
can't discern the difference between a
third party person fixing your phone
cracking your phone open fix your phone
and like a nefarious guy that's trying
to hack into your touch ID oh you know
what I say to that what make your phone
better don't don't make yeah like work
that into it yeah why me to do that
right I'm Apple they put a man on the
moon totally I agree with you I think it
was probably an unforeseen consequence
like I don't think they were like oh and
this is also going to nail bunch of
people they have got their phones fixed
so and I I understand where that train
of thought the fingerprint scanning
stuff is super super sensitive material
right yeah like it's essentially your
password they're like if it's more it's
more than that it's like it's like
biological information it's like it's
it's important that it's a password it's
your key to your bank and wallet and
money and yeah I mean that's a it's a
big deal yeah so I get it I get it but
there's got to be a way to and I
understand like I understand their say
there the whole thing is like oh you
crack your screen yeah you're gonna go
back to Apple for three hundred dollars
you're gonna go to Jimmy who give you do
it for twenty bucks right exactly um but
there's there's got to be a finer sort
of like line there yeah I mean whatever
they activated in 99 point 0 iOS 9 that
is increasing that sensitivity it
probably needs to be dialed back the
problem is Apple wants their phone to be
the like yeah you can use this phone if
you own a bet if you run a bank or
you're the secretary of state or
something and you don't have to worry
about it like falling is wrong hands
because secure so what they can't have
is like oh yeah there's this thing where
you just crack it open you connect these
two diodes and you get right around
touch ID yeah
that can't have that so it's a weird
situation but if it's impacting I don't
know who knows how many people it's
impacting but if it's impacting a
crapload of people I think he needs a
dog back and figure out another way to
like secure it and then address it in
the next hardware refresh or just like
there are more like you could have like
three stage security if you're really
concerned about that level of security
like or like or like maybe instead of
error 53 three-stage security wait guess
it should look of it if it's smart
enough to activate here if it smart up
to act my error 53 it's smart enough to
add third yes fixed we fixed it I was
entering what's-his-face oh the Johnny
I've een yeah Johnny I've in yo the Oh
Johnny I've you mean the Irish dude
Johnny Johnny I fear we've made a
decision aluminium bowls I was trying to
answer speaking of security I was trying
to answer any obtained security
questions the other day and that i
entered probably 10 years ago and two of
the questions were like easy to remember
and one of the questions was what was
your first concert and i'll i'll say
that's fine because i've never used it
again and i changed it so my first
concert was Billy Joel the problem is
it's like a password so you need to get
the caps right in the spacing right and
I'm trying every option did you make it
one word I couldn't forget like is Joel
capitalized is it two words yes but it
was taught me nuts I don't do that
always make it one word are they always
case sensitive I don't know I feel like
they're not always phillies my bank
doesn't do this is part of a new york
government gotcha site and it was
driving me nuts real quick before we hit
the brake uh there's like there's
there's still those rumors we you
brought up in the pre-show hear about
the next iphone oh yeah is that so that
so the room the rumor the weirdest rumor
of all is that the iphone 7 will not
have a standard threw up um headset jack
eighth inch yeah headphone jack yes in
december's were like mid-january they've
been around for a while they've
definitely been around for a while I
they've they're older than a couple
and yeah I mean I'd be pretty bummed
about that would you be bummed as much
as like I would be more bummed than
surprised do you mean like I would not
be surprised would not be special you
have would do that well after the the
last Mac update which has had one port
in it um the US one USB a seaport 3 port
whatever it is yeah so I would not be
surprised but yeah I'd be bummed it'd be
a drag I I do wonder how much space that
takes up and whether it it really
increases the thickness like if you have
to support an eighth inch jack there's
no way let's see how much thinner how
much thinner could the phone get you can
shave off like this you want to be
holding a credit card thick phone that'd
be pretty cool you just hold in your
wallet you could shave off probably i
would say three millimeters on each side
of the headphone jack and still have
room right so again my point being how
goddamn thin is his phone and i want to
be able to like I want this family this
fall through my finger cracks at the or
LSD tabs just like that yeah I want it I
want to be able to slide my phone into a
vending machine dollar slot yeah that's
what I want to be able to do well
because once it gets that then you could
just put it under your skin it's like a
sub there yeah anyway I mean that'd be
awesome there are really good headphones
out there that people spend hundreds and
hundreds maybe even thousands of dollars
on and you're gonna come out and be like
nah well theoretically I there would be
a an identity which doesn't make me
happy but like that would be the answer
to a lot of people she's napped adapter
I don't know it's a direct it's a direct
we're gonna take a break before that I
want to tease next week next week
Vladimir duty A's will be here he said
count apparently he says duty a you ever
hear him say his name now so Vlad say
CBS correspondent he's on he sits in for
some of the hosts on CBS this morning
sometimes he's one of the main account
why what is the count about the name
sound he sounds like a count no that
doesn't he like a vampire not well I
mean they're not all counts are vamp
they're not now surprisingly enough

and 19th jordan hoffman is back to talk
oscars joho that's what they call them
that's upsetting Joho George often all
right back with more 404 after a word
from our sponsor I don't have time Russ
is never enough time I'll have the time
to read somebody's 4000 word
dissertation those those long reads this
long play journalistic endeavors their
times thanks the problem is that I want
to consume the content want a knowledge
I want that yeah if you're like Russ and
I you're well aware of all the good
stuff out there on the internet you want
to read as much as you can you want to
consume content but there's not enough
time thankfully there's a new app out
there called what's it called colony FM
yep colony FM is filled with real voice
actors real people reading these pieces
of content and that's the key there's no
sirree robot voice craziness going on
it's not like they just ran it through
some machine these are real live actors
real life people the people reading
colony FM stories they are warm-blooded
and a sound like they are invested
emotionally into what they're reading
and that's the best part it's like
having your own secretary pretty great
doesn't matter where you are the car
the office if you're washing dishes your
secretary you just have them read
articles to you is that what you do is
that what you would do like get any rust
I want you to read this read this to me
now and colony FM is the app that I am
pretty excited about this week because
I've used it and I actually I've
listened to a few articles I won't lie i
have enjoyed what I've been able to do

enjoyment go to colony dot FM /c net

completely free it's available on the
web on the App Store and in the google
play store that's colony dot FM / seen

Bowl Sunday is upon us Super Bowl L is
it to rural I totally didn't realize
that no it's 50 that I know but they're
not i doing l oh they're not doing now
they try oh well even all admit they did
XL they did because XL is like a thing
you want to look at yeah it's cool we're
like the letter L after the word l like
a mobile phone it like iteration yeah
it's like I get it I was making fun of
the branding for a while being like
Americans they can handle the fact that
the Roman numeral 50 is l yeah but no
it's the right move and they won't do it
next year either yeah it's gonna be l
know I Long Island Super Bowl Long
Island yeah baby they're gonna have it
at Nassau Coliseum anyway uh so Super
Bowl 50 is Sunday arm who is playing
Jeff you know uh don't wanna do not tell
me I know it's definitely the Bronco
good so I thought it was the Cardinals
but it's not it's the Carolina Panther
correct well done oh yeah that nice i
nailed it and you name one player on
both teams obviously peyton manning work
that's all i can name you can't okay on
the broncos yes and I know the
quarterback on the on the UH this some
 um
snow not I know I'm looking at him ok
and see his face Stacey Hanuman fantasy
ok cnet is very interested in his first
name Apple nope his name is Apple Google
Apple Tesla uber ago I Cena is
interested in both names because both
names are potentially tech inspired is
there woods no I don't know why some
woods uh CN this is initials oh damn it
CN ya Curtis know Colin let's just stop
kamla Oh Kemp Kim oh my god you don't
know the West Newton Cam yeah it's a
camera and Newton which is a nap
forgotten Apple product that is a
stretch I news I knew I know the name
Cam Newton good work at least I got
Newton there you I did you said cam yeah
great okay fine come on up should i say
fig next time would that be easier oh
boy uh yeah so obviously you don't care
all you don't care about football no
it's the worst okay I care somewhat
about football I get anything on it no I
don't like I care I would like to bet on
it if someone if someone in this office
had a box pool out there I would give
you money for numbers they don't there's
no one doing a box pool it I'm seeing it
loud enough so somebody can hear me yeah
so I guess not not even you the guys
always betting on stuff Oh Jake Oh
typical Jake yeah I yeah why so you
would do a bottom like I guess so it's
something to watch and you're sort of
invested in it yeah I won't I like
gambling a little bit I don't like
gambling and gambling at that point it's
like the boxing the lottery yeah okay no
but like if you get scale the numbers
one and seven or like 4am been random
I'm not picking those get it but like
it's fun to be like all I need
safety in three touchdowns yeah I agree
it makes the game more its makes it way
more interesting especially be careful
is mostly uninteresting I like it on
paper but I agree there's a lot of dead
time there's so much dead time there's
commercials after every goddamn thing
they do yeah they flip the coin will be
right back it's like it they kick off
KITT most kick officer touchbacks and
they go to commercial after they show a
guy kick a ball into the green yeah and
then they sell your burger get out for
now it's a bummer I like what the
what am i watching that look capitalism
man i get it and i get it and football's
not even a sport anymore it's like this
religion the whole store like an
infrastructure but the core of the sport
i think is interesting the like offense
defense like the very planned offense
defense all right except there's like
Claire I students every play and every
guy's freaking brain bashing his head
yeah it's been so so and then they're
like oh we're gonna have all these and
look catch the Super Bowl on CBS this
Sunday's oh yes Super Bowl 50 on our own
CBS network and is premiering right
afterwards LL Cool J will be hosted know
uh so yeah I so find they're talking
about all we're gonna have 98 different
they're doing like a new a new instant
replay thing okay that's gonna look like
bullet time feel like they've done that
before yeah I think it's just a matter
of degree where they do matrix sorta oh
so they're taking like a ton of photos
and the circular motion I've seen that
but not with like a ton of it's like 45
jagged right yeah so maybe this will be
better so you can see at what point
exactly he was paralyzed so are though
cuz it's like really is that gonna make
people more excited for the year that
CBS has two Super Bowl no it doesn't
matter so advice doesn't mat and got
Coldplay oh that's who's playing that
really cool by coldplay man have they
done anything the last five years yeah
they have a new album 01 the song says
Beyonce oh good for Beyonce guess is
gonna show up in the halftime show yeah
I'd say probably Beyonce she was in what
last year two years ago I don't know i
don't i don't really care for the
the way I look at the Super Bowl
generally if I'm not engaged with that
thing is like a social event you have
people over you drink beer eat bad food
when you just hang out for a couple
hours and you half watch the game but
you just shoot the and that's kind
of what I wanted to bring this up for
how to survive the Super Bowl if you
don't care right nachos and Puppy Bowl
no it's all about the seven-layer bean
dip oh yeah i mean i'm sure you can I
don't like beans is the thing I just
don't like them they're mushy do I bite
do I just swallow son of a bitch I like
it's sort of okay if it's with like a
burrito cuz you need the burrito and you
know how it what to do with like meat
and rice I can't even share this podcast
but like beans like my fiance has like
baked beans sometimes I'm like I don't
it's not appetizing I don't know how to
eat you sound like Andy Rooney I'm not
sure how to eat baked beans do I put
them up my nose it's just very I don't
like the texture they don't look
appetizing so but in the seven-layer dip
yeah what else is in there you got
lettuce tomato cheese sour cream do you
mix leaf no it's layered you dude I
understand it's layered but after its
lair do you that well when you pop in
the household Tia chip how long is this
tortilla chip that it's a it's a
restaurant style thick you need a thick
chip how much depth are we talking I
think you're talking two inches it's
like yeah that's it so you need inches
so you need a very wide yeah wide tray
Gary wide track I will take a photo of
it stays is making it for the party
we're going it must be hard to maintain
the equilibrium no later no no no thick
to wipe them from dipping it's not that
complement it tastes essentially
essentially the same if it was mixed no
you don't know oh no why because you
can't have certain layers touching each
other like the lettuce can't touch the
beans yeah I'm making I'm it's like Nazi
Germany where you can't have like
Germany runarounds exactly it right that
the seven-layer bean dip was a culinary
metaphor I knew it for World War two no
but like so you have so you have olives
on the top maybe like I'm
sure a blackout they crushed jobs
another likes full light slot no sliced
black olives I've sliced okay okay sure
tomato one two fought refried bean three
sour cream for cheese five we say
tomatoes I don't think so sex uh and
then whatever we throw throw in whatever
okay maybe guacamole no luck charms not
gonna do it guac a freaking moly yeah I
like guacamole yeah but I don't like
avocado what the hell same with me i
love i love pickles I hate cucumbers go
figure yeah but how bad do you want this
dip right now I can't anymore I just
can't someone invited me to what's wrong
rusty poo you silly dallas BBQ the night
after i went inside the coen brothers
movie would talk about in a second and I
was just like I can't man this is what
you turn whatever 30 plus no that's not
it just made me it's just me like I eat
everything and the next day you're not
paying the price I I think it's even
gotten better for me like I used to not
be able to have like ice cream at
midnight I can do that now what
happened before when he had eyes it
would just be a freaking sludge factory
like it was the I don't need that it
would just be bad news bad you have a
very sense it's very sensitive my mom
wants to take me to take probiotic pills
just you think just don't make me feel
or just eat that yogurt that Scott I
whenever I take fiber supplement a
little very I put a lot of leg work into
making my stomach not awful I want to
see you gain some weight I need to gain
way it's been look I'm 32 I've been this
wait for 20 years I'm not you even weigh
more than 150 I know probably oh my god
and it's just and you're taller than me
I'm yeah maybe an inch taller maybe
you're what can I like granted I
understand why people think up to change
it load of protein I i do i love protein
i can't not have much start having three
thousand calorie days 3,500 it doesn't
advertise me like that's not like I
tried the like post you would your
favorite vice to eat
cinnamon rolls so I thought at the super
bowl party on sun boar or buffalo wings
those are two things I you know but I
feel like buffalo wings are not as bad I
mean they're fried chips fried chicken
 well it depends on like the quality
of the chicken and stuff like that but I
will I a hundred percent if I absolutely
annihilate like 20 of them oh I'll go to
town and it's not because I don't have
an appetite like I eat it just and there
you like blue cheese it's fattening yeah
but I can't have cheese oh that's right
so I have rain stress we're at an
impasse branches fairy tale get that
buttery buttery creamy ranch I i have a
very quick transversal period there was
something so funny about like a heavier
fat Russ fresh today I got to imagine
one of these days it's gonna hit me by
40 and it's something do you drink a lot
of beer I can't drink beer anymore i
just-i can't-- beers gone beers gone
beers I years vanish in the dash for the
high drink tequila when did that happen
like the last few years several years
and I had one Heineken the other day and
I felt sick i didn't feel nauseous I
didn't feel drunk I just felt like gross
like oh my stomach I wonder if there's
people is any whores like what is I
won't this again gastroenterologist
listening and he's like oh he's gonna
die in here no why would this be because
your tip it's that IBS doesn't kill
anybody I you think it's IBS no I
whatever it is gore Crohn's doesn't
really i don't think it's crying people
the thing is i like have this list of
things in my head that i can eat and be
fun like i have an egg sandwich every
morning and i can have bacon on that
although I Alex does not want me to have
bacon every day anymore because she
thinks she read that article that gives
me buck cancer which turned out to be BS
but I'm still have weaned myself off
having bacon every day I just haven't
once a week now it's so damn good I love
a turkey bacon yeah well it's process
anyone any good anything cured yes bad
news but apparently it's not what else
can I put on an egg sandwich that's not
like that is protein but not cured me
that's purchase more X right tastes like
the United sandwich every day alright if
you know if you know a way to get rust
fat yeah let's uh let's have that I've
had so many people you got to work out
every day you go
eat 19 raw eggs like Rocky you so many
people you could have more eggs or more
egg whites if you don't want the
cholesterol and just just eat like 10
egg whites a day I like that yellow part
though that's the best part it's pretty
fattening and cholesterol II clearly not
it is what's up for me cholesterol ester
alright well the mission to get you fat
continues I am so yeah like for me you
know i'm going to my buddy's house in
Jersey uh you know I haven't seen him in
a while so we'll get to catch up and 19
he's got a beautiful house but I don't
when you walk in the door they all go oh
oh it's just like Jersey Jersey guys oh
oh oh oh is that a little Dylan a bed
buddy yeah no it's not like I know I've
hung out with your friends you're
terrible uh so that'll be cool but yeah
it's a struggle for me like Stacy's like
I'll probably leaves in the third
quarter how far is it from your place
odds me like 40 45 minutes yeah she's a
go probably during the third quarter I'm
like dawn to tell me twice right exactly
cuz that's the best time to drive home
oh yeah no was no one's on the road that
is I mean we're having people over our
place and it's nice because I have no
interest in like it's like nine o'clock
ten o'clock at night I don't want to be
coming over to Sunday night it's the
worst Oh it'll be great it'll be like so
by the time the third quarter starts
it's almost like eight nine o'clock like
walking around the garbage bag okay guys
like do the scheme's time what are you
doing was last year that big blow uh no
last year was the good game with the
Seahawks in the patriot yeah when that
last section at a year before was I
think local out with Peyton got right
now right by you don't even know your
call yes oh come on well both two years
ago I don't remember san fran school yes
was it for sure sure yeah anyway uh
super bowl I'll catch it on CBS this
sunday and i guess the commercials are
exciting but they're not because you see
them all before yeah and I guess you
just wait to laugh it was exciting at
one point I remember getting really
excited there was a time when Lexi
commercial right but there was a time
when the commercials worse
though such a mystery yeah and you had a
lot of products debuting so you're
saying let's make a few predictions
we're gonna see a lot you mean brands
that I'm gonna see a big Batman for
Superman oh you mean trailer why yeah
yeah the only movie thing I don't yeah
probably by over superman and i would
say a marvel what's the next Marvel
movie a Deadpool Captain America oh
that's the schedule is not a Disney
Marvel that's the other Marvel oh really
yeah but there probably will be maybe a
Deadpool add is that the Sony more we
don't have a lot of money though dead
yeah then they made their move for like
30 million very cheap movie but they are
spending on marketing are they really
doing like the rom-com fake ad for it
I've seen some of the marketing
materials are like bring your girlfriend
on Valentine's are like human great I
think the markings for this movie yeah
it's kind of low it's not it just plays
into the whole thing I wish I could talk
about it I just saw last night I can't
talk about it yet um so what about I'm
trying to think what else what other
sort of brand surprises I feel like
Squarespace is gonna do I know
Squarespace is like new branding I
wonder if they'll do it maybe I could
see oh I saw that ad for the contest
tiny coffee shop did you see they won
like a contest with I forget the larger
company but there was a contest
essentially like hey what's your small
business it was like into it had a
contest it was like getting one small
business a Subaru ahead and so there's
this tiny upstate New York coffee place
that like won a Super Bowl ad that's
kind of like cool it's like cute little
ad and now they're going to be forced to
go to business because they can't keep
up with the demand yeah uh it's the
groupon effect um what about like um no
because you seen at it CBS is rocking
the Super Bowl although I know they
would want to pay me on the center of
the field they paid for some brand maybe
the coin they flip on one side is seen
it on the other side gamespot okay and
it's my face and whoever wins gets
bigger bonus and Daniel Dwyer on the
other one could be maybe you are the
face of seeing it that's what I'm told
okay
will end things today with a quick and
dirty review of the latest coen brothers
movie what is it called its called Hail
Caesar I love it have you seen
commercials for it all doesn't matter i
have i seen the commercials but it
wouldn't matter because I will follow
those two guys through the gates of hell
yeah I like the movie quick and dirty
I'm not going to spoil anything I I
would say if you're looking I would say
it falls in the line of hudsucker proxy
which is a movie that is not that's like
one of their first ones right but that's
one of the earlier ones with tim robbins
i love hudsucker proxy it's not known as
like one of the best Coen Brothers
movies but it's good it's like very this
movie's very camp seems very stylized
very stylized and like over the top
that's show hudsucker is the one you
would compare it to yes it's definitely
close to stop what about if you have to
compare to a second coen brothers movie
ah cuz no cuz I feel like not a lot of
people have seen hudsucker proxy yeah
it's not like Lebowski I mean it's like
a campy or more of the top Lebowski and
so far as like a lot of crazy characters
in one central character I revolt by
then right of all them they wrote it and
directed where do they come up with this
stuff they're geniuses there's no
question like it's amazing how talented
they are and they have like great people
that work around them like their 7th
ographers great and everyone wants to
work with them so they get amazing
actors and this sort of movie it's like
an ensemble movie so you have huge
actors but they might only appear for
like a minute and it's just very weird
and silly I don't know that it's going
to be like universally praised the ver-
the release time of it is strange like
what do you mean in February yeah like
don't I feel like if I'm a coen brothers
movie I want to come out in november i
know they're not like a blockbuster let
know but they I feel like those guys get
Oscar buzz every now and then this is
not gonna win an Oscar okay well I think
they probably knew I think a Martian
would do anything yet here we are how's
that movie nominee will talk to Jordan
about yeah yeah but I like it overall I
don't think it's there
best stuff but if you like the comb
brothers like sillier stuff I love this
um I think you'll enjoy it and Brolin
who's the lead and this is excellent
like really really how long is it it's
not crazy i think it's like an hour 45
if i had to guess it's perfect maybe
yeah it feels very quick like it moves
I'm really looking forward to seeing it
I uh I'm just obsessed with those guys
they're amazing they're fantastic uh
yeah I just want to party with them
right you just want to have a couple
drinks and talk it over talk it all over
with them yeah it's great all right well
thanks for that quick dirty Hail Caesar
is that out it comes out today what do
you know if you ever want to take
somebody to all these screenings you go
to the problem is I'm not getting the
screenings there I'm the plus one if
someone else because I don't do moving

whoever wakes up I was like oh this guy

invited all right but until then I'll
send letters to with whoever have to do
