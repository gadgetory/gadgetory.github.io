the last few years there's something
that could still use a little
improvement is actually it's zooming in
we're taking a look now at something
that hopes to improve that so this is a
dual camera system it's part of a
collaboration between an Israeli startup
called core photonics and Qualcomm
here's how it works this module itself
has two camera lenses they're both 13
megapixel cameras however one is a
standard wide-angle lens like you get in
most smartphones and one is a special
telephoto lens
now when the images from those two
lenses are combined what you get is an
image that's capable of up to 3 times
optical zoom in stills what's cool is
that it achieves that even though there
are no moving parts in here in normal
cameras the chunkier kind when you zoom
in their actual moving parts but here
everything's fixed we've been looking at
some demos and I have to say it looks
like by combining those two lenses you
get a really crisp photo you can see in
the difference here not only is there
less noise but there's just so much more
clarity to it uses Qualcomm Snapdragon
800 chip and this could potentially be
good as well for low-light photography
and that's because there are two lenses
so you just get more light taken in it's
really interesting tech hopefully it'll
appear in some real smart phones that we
can actually buy before too long so that
we can really put it to the test
