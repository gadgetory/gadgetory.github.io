small cheap car is to try not make it
look like a small cheap car on that
front I think Maz is off to a pretty
darn good start let's drive this 2014
mazda3 5-door ass Grand Touring and
check the tech the first thing I love
about this Mazda 3 is the look and the
quality of the cabin materials this is
kind of out es on a much better budget
nice looking understated trim this is
the new Mazda look it's tack centric a
little digital speedo in the corner and
everything else is pushed out as a
periphery now of course the next thing
that grabs your eye is this this is an
all new look and feel for them it's the
now in vogue in the industry toaster
slot tablet-style head unit screen
you've got apps your media luckily all
in one place thank you Mazda no one else
seems to do that communication
navigation in your overall settings and
here's your source list it's all the
hits that you need am/fm with HD radio
satellite aha
Pandora and stitcher apps are built in
but you have to launch them on your
phone to get this to talk bluetooth
streaming USB optical disk of course
everything is done from a controller
down here with home buttons for major
functions little Audi like volume knob
to the right unfortunately it's kind of
surrounded by other knobs it's really
kind of hard to operate I wish they'd
make it taller or wider or something
when you're driving you see the speed
limits show up here in the left corner
of the screen that's really good and if
you exceed the speed limit it turns red
and yellow to remind you that's
something very cool I don't think I've
seen that before
navigation entries pretty easily done
via the controller or via the voice
button over here unfortunately we hit
the voice button you'll get really clear
prompts on the screen what you can or
should say on the other hand you can
enter the destination as one blurp from
street number to state without having to
go bucket by bucket that's commendable
on the other hand when you want to turn
down the voice guidance which I often
don't use get this the voice stops
talking it's muted but it still mutes
the left side of the audio system when
it would have been talking that makes no
sense I can't believe that actually made
it out of production it's infuriating as
hell one thing I am missing here is
there is no live internet search to
destination like you'll find in a BMW
Mercedes Audi no Google in other words
you'd have to know the address or use
the PIO eye database
are never very good and as you're going
to start to notice here there are an
incredible number of settings I haven't
seen on most other cars that spooks the
average driver I'm not a big fan of
things like calling focus of the HUD
calibration just call it focus an
incredible number of traffic settings
including something called detour
sensitivity I do this for a living and I
have no idea what that is
traffic is forked in two sessions
there's online traffic which requires a
Wi-Fi hotspot device look up to the car
and then under apps you've got HD radio
delivered traffic which is a separate
traffic map that's not part of the
navigation screen so this is kind of a
scattered mess of too many choices too
much gobbledygook and jargon and not
enough unifications fuel economy
monitors interesting the cars that have
ie loop the dumbest trade name in the
auto business actually have regenerative
braking which is not uncommon but in
this case they use an alternator that
can run at 12 or even higher volts to
charge a capacitor not the battery
that's really high-tech stuff we'll
explain the use of capacitors versus
batteries in a future car tech 101 on
CNET on cars we have the optional Bose
Centerpoint with audio pilot noise
cancelling I got to say this system did
a really good job with tortured signals
like satellite radio brought them up
clean without a lot of that artifacting
sibilance so big up on that now you may
have noticed we've got a little
projection screen that winks up off the
dash when you start the car and this
sort of a blue electro fluorescent
camera under there giving us a pretty
rudimentary display the problem we had
was the thing is very uneven sometimes
it works sometimes it doesn't sometimes
the height control actually does
something sometimes it doesn't and
sometimes the image just goes up and out
and I couldn't get it back we've also
got blind spot detection like the Lane
Departure it's passive little indicators
light up in the mirrors adaptive cruise
control on this car that means it'll
maintain speed and distance ahead there
is no assisted parking on this car you
do get a rear-view camera sensors though
oddly enough are optional
now one of the hood this mazda3 because
it's an asus port model has a two and a
half litre inline-four the I cars will
have a 2 litre inline-four what they
have in common is something called
SKYACTIV technology in a nutshell that
means it's a really high compression
engine almost at diesel levels of
compression 184 horsepower 185
foot-pounds of torque 0 to 60 for this
3,000 pound car is a respectable seven
and a half seconds notice that three
thousand pounds is pretty light by
today's standards mpg is twenty seven
thirty seven transmission and drivetrain
are straightforward six-speed automatic
only and a real automatic not a CVT and
front-wheel drive the thing feels like
it's put together like a drum there's
not a rattle in the car and I'm on a
crappy waterfront road right now so
that's saying sorry
now here's the odd thing the engine does
not feel as good to me as it looks on
paper I don't get a lot in that 20 to 80
percent of petal travel it just kind of
gets stuck in unbearably tall gears in
fact I'll tell you I thought it was a
CVT when I first drove the car you know
I never look at the spec sheet so I've
driven the car for a while and I would
not have bet it wasn't automatic the
head-up display is kind of badly
positioned because it puts the data the
Texas on it right over the arm of the
wiper which is a busy background and
it's not my famous is a shame for a HUD
it's actually kind of out of my line of
sight you can put that stuff in the dash
and it would be just as good
okay this price our Mazda 3 this is
pretty much top of the line loaded so
looking at 27 3/4 an S 2 and a half
litre Grand Touring trim that brings in
and having a bunch of other tech then on
top of that we're going to add twenty
six hundred bucks for the Grand Touring
tech package that adds the ie loop
capacitor based regeneration system kind
of high-tech stuff lane departure
warning blind spot warning adaptive
cruise control
other options include rear sensors oddly
enough for Alucard at 450 and remote
start is 575 you're a little over
$30,000 this guy loaded up and the cabin
tech as I showed you is kind of getting
out in front of its skis and definitely
has some bugs that need to be worked out
overall though they've got a serious
contender in the second
