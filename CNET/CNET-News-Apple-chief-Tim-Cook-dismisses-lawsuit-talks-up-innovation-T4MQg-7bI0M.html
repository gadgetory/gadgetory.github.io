Sumi das and joining me is Josh
Lowensohn senior writer for Cena Josh
thanks for being with us my pleasure I
can't help but notice that you're more
dressed up than you normally are that's
true you got dressed up because you were
attending this conference this
technology conference that Goldman Sachs
has every year and there was a kind of
special speaker of somebody we don't
hear from very often there was it was
Apple CEO Tim Cook who you know short of
Apple events really only appears at two
things and this is one of the one of
them you gotta go yeah you gotta go
because because it's kind of interesting
it's unlike something where it's
rehearsed they were introducing products
it's a it's a sit-down with Tim Cook and
in kind of a QA and you get some of
these interesting questions that you
normally wouldn't get during earnings
call or obviously any sort of thing with
their launching a new product right so
what did he say cuz he made it a little
bit of news this morning sure so I mean
the real gist of the talk is that
Apple's doing great everything's fine
don't worry about anything yeah seemed
like he was kind of saying don't count
us out yeah I mean a lot of people have
thought hey this company can't really
grow maybe they're done making these
kind of really popular products and he
said you know what that's not the way we
work that's not in our DNA we have
really good people working here and we
don't believe in limits which is kind of
an interesting way to look at a business
where there really are a lot of limits I
mean you see these companies really rise
but oftentimes they fall at some point
right and they're they're they're
maintaining too so to speak I mean they
had great success with the iphone 5 even
though people are saying that it fell
short of expectations let's talk about
some of the things that he touched upon
stores the retail stores that Apple has
sure so he give us a quick update on
stores basically he said that they're
actually closing 20 of them but it's not
a bad thing that's they're actually
closing them down because they got so
popular or they just needed renovation
so they're actually moving to bigger
facilities or changing the layouts of
these stores which is kind of
interesting and he really thinks that
their stores are the first experience
people have with Apple as a company and
the first way they see their products he
said he'll actually go to an apple store
and it's like his prozac okay so people
of the world stop taking Prozac and go
to see Tim Cook handed an apple store
lake he's not a good day
okay so there was also this lawsuit that
was discussed at today's conference
basically this was filed by green light
tell us more about that it's it's filed
by the shareholders right so I mean
they're not a huge shareholder but they
do own a pretty decent chunk and ahead
of the shareholders meeting which is
later this month they're really kind of
they sued apple to try and convince them
to pay out more money to shareholders
and comes down to money of me it does
and of course they paid a dividend and
they're doing the stock repurchase plan
but some people think they need to get
more so cook today said that they are
considering those kinds of options but
the lawsuit was silly and that he wished
that you know both companies could spend
any money that they would do for that
and give it to charity which is you know
that's trying to take the high road for
sure but it's also like totally
dismissing with it yeah it was very
dismissive the way he handled that
discussion I thought yeah and the focus
going forward for Apple is it did he
talk about the iWatch no there was no
charge I talked about yours no talk that
I watch uh but he really did kind of lay
out that their strategies all that
phones and tablets and he thinks that
both those markets are really going to
grow a lot for instance he said that
they're still like half the world
subscribers they're really looking at
other places in the world rights beyond
the u.s. exactly so I mean there's
there's always potential for that but he
didn't talking new products okay and he
had this talk very early because he had
an invitation from FLOTUS one Michelle
Obama sure and that's that's where he's
off to now right he's off to Washington
DC yeah he's got a busy day so I guess
you know Tim Cook from Apple stores and
prozac to sitting with michelle obama at
the State of the Union dude it's all
right for some Josh thank you very much
I poser you didn't have to get dressed
up for us next time thanks for watching
for inside scoop I'm seam gas
