Jeff Bakalar with a list of what's free

of these services starting off with Xbox

dear God which is a 3d pixel art game
where you play yes as a dear and then

play Tomb Raider the definitive edition
absolutely free this is the one to check
out on xbox 360 battlestations pacific
the real-time tactics game will be free
September first to the 15th and then
Crysis 3 which is a mostly solid first
person shooter opens up for the rest of
the month shifting gears to the
PlayStation line of products PlayStation

platformer grow home for the entire
month speaking of platformers super time
force ultra which is a pixel game that
lets you manipulate time will also be
available on PlayStation 4 all month
long hitting both the playstation 4 and
ps3 is Tesla grad a puzzle platformer
game that plays around with magnets
electricity and other fun stuff in a
beautifully hand drawn steampunk world
for PlayStation 4 as well as the Vita zo
drifter a classic side scroller in the
vein of something like blaster master is
going to be available as well also on
the Vita is la mulana IX a 2d platformer
adventure title that has you fighting
monsters and uncovering clues and
finally PlayStation 3 owners will get
access to twisted metal the reboot of
the most popular car Kombat series of
all time this one was a bit of a sleeper
hit on the ps3 but it's totally worth
downloading if you're still rocking that
console that will do it for September as
always a small caveat you do of course
need to be a member of PlayStation Plus
and Xbox Live Gold to access these free
games and those memberships do cost
money but as you can see they're totally
worth it
