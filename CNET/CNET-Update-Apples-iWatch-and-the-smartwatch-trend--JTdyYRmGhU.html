Carey and this is your CNET update more
rumors are flying in about Apple working
on a smart wristwatch possibly called an
eye watch bloomberg reports that there's
a hundred person team at Apple dedicated
to this project so that's true this has
gone beyond tinkering with an idea phase
this news comes after the New York Times
said Apple is working on a wrist device
that uses curved glass with the increase
of wearable devices like the Nike
FuelBand and the buzz around
smartwatches like the Pebble watch it
wouldn't surprise me to see Apple jump
into this territory the wrist is the one
place on your body where we're all
comfortable about wearing a screen and
it was interesting how Apple stopped
making the square Nano which people were
using as a SmartWatch this could be the
relaunch of that concept and speaking of
wearable tech the fitness brand Under
Armour is taking on Nike and just
unveils its own fitness monitoring
system called the armor 39 it's got a
sensor on a strap that you wear around
the chest which is something that was
already being done by wahoo fitness the
chest piece stores Fitness data and
sends it to the cloud via bluetooth you
can see how you did by going on a
website but if you want to check it
while you're working out you'll need an
iPhone app or the special $200 watch
accessory which cost more than $150
chest strap sensor if you're familiar
with a Nike FuelBand system it measures
activity with a fuel score but the armor
39 uses a willpower score measuring the
intensity of your workout it'll be
coming out on March 20th in other news
we're watching Apple just drop the price
of its MacBook Pro laptops with Retina
display and it boosted the processor
speeds the entry-level 13-inch pro model
is $200 cheaper and Apple also cut the
price at the high-end MacBook Air by a
hundred bucks several music apps are in
the news Amazon's Cloud Player will now
be available in cars that have Ford's
