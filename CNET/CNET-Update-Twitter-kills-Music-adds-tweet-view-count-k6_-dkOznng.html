tweet goes on I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your scene that update twitter has
given up on its failed music service and
pulled the Twitter music app from itunes
for the three people that actually use
twitter music you should take note that
it will stop working on april eighteenth
that's one year after its launch the
website music twitter com will also stop
working twitter music was designed as a
place to discover new tunes based on
what other people were tweeting about
but it was a flop frankly navigation was
messy and most folks just wanted to
stick with the simple streaming services
like Spotify and Pandora but it seems
Twitter's adding a new feature that
you'll find more useful twitter is
showing some folks how many people have
read their tweets now i don't personally
see these changes but several twitter
users are reporting that they see view
numbers on the iOS twitter app so
twitter could be testing this with just
a small group if you can finally see how
many people read your messages you may
be more encouraged to post or it could
give you more anxiety when you realize
no one cares about your carefully
crafted tweets LG has created a new type
of light bulb that you can control from
your smartphone or tablet you can turn
the light on and off through a special
app and you can also use it to control
the brightness aside from showing off to
friends you may actually find this
useful for scheduling a light to be on
and off at specific times you can have a
light turn on when it's time to wake up
in the morning or perhaps keep the light
on when no one's home to avoid being
target for burglary LG didn't say when
this would go on sale the price was
about $32 however you don't have to buy
a special LG bulb to control your lamp
from afar you can use a belkin wemo
switch to control any device that's
plugged into a particular outlet you can
find one for about fifty dollars the
google chromecast TV stick has a new
party trick google released an app
called photo wall for chromecast and it
turns your TV into an interactive photo
frame Google calls it a chrome
experiment that lets people collaborate
with images on the TV you
the app anyone can take a photo and send
it to the photo wall you can even doodle
on it and at the end a YouTube video of
the photo wall is automatically created
I guess the video makes it easy to brag
on social media about how much fun your
party was if you're not familiar with
the chromecast it's a $35 stick that
plugs into the HDMI port on the back of
your TV and it's an easy way to watch
online videos on your big screen that's
your tech news update and you can find
more details on these stories at CNN com
