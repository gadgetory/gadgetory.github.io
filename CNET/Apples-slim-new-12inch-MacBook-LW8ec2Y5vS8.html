question is can you live with only one
port I'm Dan Ackerman and this is the
new 12-inch MacBook from Apple it's
their first new laptop design in a long
time it's not the airline it's not the
Pro line it's just the MacBook kind of
like those original black and white
polycarbonate MacBooks everybody loved
from the mid 2000s this is the smallest
laptop that Apple makes it's got a 12.5
inch Retina display it is very thin and
very light it is just a hair over two
pounds and unlike a lot of the other mac
books which use Intel's Core i5 or Core
i7 CPU this uses Intel's
new core and processor and that's very
important because that processor is
designed for laptops that are very thin
very light and that can run very
efficiently without even fans this is a
family's design we've seen that a few of
the core M systems this guy's not going
to be as quick as a standard core i5
MacBook Air or pro although in everyday
use it still felt fine especially if you
stick to apps that are very optimized
for the OS 10 experience like Safari and
battery wise it ran for about 11 hours
on our video test which is a lot better
than the other Core M systems that we've
tested but nowhere near what you get
with a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro those
are still the longest lasting laptops
and really that we you know ever use in
order to get this new MacBook down to a
size this small they've had to change a
bunch of things the keyboard has been
redesigned it's not a very flat keyboard
it's very shallow however the key faces
are wider and they don't wiggle because
of the way the keys are constructed so
is actually very stable and I found even
though the keys we're a little on the
shallow side I actually like typing on
it a lot the trackpad is another big
change it looks and feels the same
however it doesn't click down it uses a
little bit of force feedback to trick
your finger into thinking you're
clicking down on the button and you can
actually do a deeper click again it's
not a real click it just feels like it
that gives you some contextual
information like looking at Wikipedia
entries on words or a map location if
you click on an address
now the biggest thing you're going to
have to get used to it using this new
MacBook is the fact that there are no
regular sized USB ports it's a video
bout though isn't it jack - no SD card
slot it has been boiled down to a single
port and that port is right here it is
USB see and this is one of the first
laptops that were seeing this in its a
new version of USB you can do
accessories through here you can do
adapters you can do video output you can
also do power which means that if you
have it plugged in and charging and you
want to plug in let's say a USB key or a
USB dongle for a mouse you've got to
unplug that get your adapter plug in
here and then plug in your accessory you
can do both at the same time unless you
have some sort of extent you know
external docking station or connection
block and of course Apple will be more
than happy to sell you one of those for
about $80 or about $20 for a standard
USB see to traditional USB plug in a
short cable that's kind of like this
there's actually one other sneaky port
on there they have not managed yet to
get rid of the headphone jack it's a bit
on the expensive side it starts at
$12.99 but that gets you a gigs a ramp
and a big 256 gig solid state hard drive
it's really flash memory that's just
sort of built into the motherboard it's
not a removable hard drive - because the
actual motherboard is very tiny the
entire interior of this is pretty much
all battery and that gets you up to
about that 10 or 11 hours which should
be enough to at least get you through a
day or two without recharging I'm Dan
Ahmed and that is Apple's new 12 inch
MacBook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
