2d s 2017 at the scene that stage I'm
Maya's Akhtar alongside Roger float like
a butterfly sting like a bumble bee
Cheng and Ben Fox Ruben for a bigger
than usual episode of her excellent bite
size news podcast at 3:59 if you're new
to the show you should really watch the
show Roger and Ben break down the most
important tech stories in about four
minutes hence the title of the show
actually we're gonna start off with a
guest
we've got MQ Wang CEO and founder of
zero zero robotics to talk about his
flying camera the hover passport camera
it's called the remote so this is the
first flying drone all on the market
actually recognized its owner and allows
you to interact with the completely
phone free without any controller so the
way it works is I'll fired up the app
and I'm gonna record a new owner so what
it does is it's gonna let me turn my
face around and then just take a few
shots on my face and then send it to
this device from then on I don't need my
phone anymore I could just you know
press a button and let go of it you know
as it's gonna spin in the scan
environment to look for me there you go
once it locks on to me if I move it just
moves with me
so it's a completely autonomously
following camera and the cool part is if
I want to stop feet I want to follow to
be taken all I need to do is to hold out
my palm and the light will blink in the
signal to me it's basically doing like a
countdown on your at the timer oh the
old school timer on your phone and it
will just never photo if I wanted to
stop a hold on my hand again and give
the okay sign and they'll just stay
there waiting for me to retriever and I
can just grab a like this the facial
recognition account how does that
scanning work how reliable is that it's
actually pretty reliable right so the
reason we would ask you to turn around a
little bit is because the camera the
flying camera will look at you not just
from the front but from the side and
from behind as well but once they lost
unto you is not just relying on the
features that extracts from your face is
actually trying to separate separate you
away from the their environment and
people have standing next to you
so it is that contrasts our algorithm
which makes it even more robust so
that's a new software upgrade that's
coming in about two to three weeks
exactly yeah so since we launched the
product in late October we were are the
entry introduced three upgrades each of
them gives you better experience new
features and this is the beauty of you
know this generation of flying robots
right because you can do what we call
OTA over-the-air upgrades of the
firmware and the software at all times
what are some of the other hand gestures
that people can expect yeah so these
seven hand gestures altogether when we
release this to our users it's gonna
allow hover camera to do things like 360
orbit orbit around you so sort of like
self spinning or spinning around you and
and you can actually control this
position as well so up and down left and
right
I saw a demo yesterday at the booth it
seems really like kind of crazy to
believe that that exists at all I know
that's been out since you said October
so so it's $5.99 correct that's correct
and it's this software upgrade three to
three weeks I'll use this and you'll be
able to be followed around by a flying
camera essentially then I was talking to
somebody they're like don't call it a
drone yes cuz you're not racing this
thing it's really meant to be a camera
he's got about what a 10 to 15 minute
battery life that's right each battery
gives you 10 minutes of flight time and
we ship two batteries with the standard
package we were actually just running
around so yes yesterday was hover camera
following us and it was kind of fun we
think of it as your personal
photographer right not so much as a
troll yes so it's a 13 megapixel camera
that gives us 13 megapixel photos and it
shoots up to 4k videos yay photos you
can show off come and take some photos
of us on the stage we can maybe shout
the camera so that gives us a 720 life
view of where we are and let it go and
there you go that's the three of us
right Hey oh yeah just now the photo you
just do that that's is that easy I'm
gonna bring it up a little more well and
then point it downwards so the camera
actually tilts you know 30 degree
downwards and I'm sorry 90 degrees I
would answer it
ports right I can move it back a little
bit sweetie just like that and today
once you take that modem can I show okay
grab that problem show up the camera
yeah can we look at it one two three
there you go
yeah and I'm going to show you the cabin
through the phone it's instantly
transmit it beautiful this is the the
shot that we just took live on the stage
nice it's ridiculous that actually just
happened that's real that's like that
drone that actually made me look good
that's impressive beautification
function that we build into identifying
you know the best-looking people yeah
and not do anything with them like I
mentioned it's 13 yeah yeah it's just 4k
videos actually yeah so I know it does
optical sorry does electronic assist in
ATP correct that's right but it doesn't
do 4k
yeah it's 4k you know like it's too
large and the processing time that
requires to process a video stream is
too long so you won't get a life
yeah but where do offline video
stabilization of 4k videos though yeah
well we haven't built into the app yet
we could totally do that okay so these
days you know it's all about short
content that you instantly share with
your friends and family nobody really
shares that much 4k videos ready to go
you know not a Facebook but yeah as the
network gets faster I'm sure people will
be seeing a lot more 4k videos floating
around price and availability again I
know it's five it's five hundred nine
nine US dollars but you get a whole
package there's an extra battery there's
a carry case there's spare propellers
everything and you can get it from get
hover calm and real quick is really
light do you have to register with a
ship very important so this is 242 grams
to be exact so that's under half a pound
and it's under the weight limit
regulation imposed by FA so you don't
need a license to operate it and all
carbon fiber right exactly freaking
light actually you can press on that
it's very sturdy so
if if this is built out of plastic when
you apply that much pressure it would
just break but because it's common fiber
is so sturdy and this light all right
we're gonna take a quick break and come
back with more 359 all right thank you
guys thank you thank you 59 last day of
coverage of CES 2017 you know one of the
things we've seen in a lot of booths
Intel Qualcomm Ericsson even a lot of 5g
talk yeah
Wireless crazy fast speeds I know even
Roger I was reading on your articles a
long time ago well long time ago a
couple months ago you know tech time is
weird so I think we rising like 3.7
gigabits per second for their 5g
wireless what did you see out there you
know what what 5g it's not I don't think
people are publicly talking about that
much but it's sort of this undercover
trend this undercurrent what it is right
a 5g is so fast and so responsive that
it's really the network that everyone's
looking at to power all the other trends
that we're seeing self-driving cars
Internet of Things high quality 4k
streaming video all that stuff needs to
have a wireless connection if we're
gonna be mobile and right now 4G and LTE
not really cutting it's not as
responsive enough there everyone's sort
of looking at 5g it's a really holy
grail for getting everything connected
in a real responsive way one 5 G's gonna
roll out with these networks is I think
18 t is testing it out somewhere
I'm completely blank of where it was
with it they started trials that are
going to start trials with in terms of
like a de as a home broadband
replacement right like taking out all
the wires are just going full 5g we're
not really gonna see 5g you know in a
real way like we CLT it's more gonna be
like 2018 2020 if they're still kind of
working out that's why there's it's why
people really talking about it behind
closed doors it's not really super
public you're not seeing a lot of 5g
devices here at the show fact is
Ericsson is got a giant booth and then
all it's all about 5 G's in the location
of where dish used to be just got pushed
aside yeah and they're right across and
this is this little pavilion Pavilion
essentially of Intel Qualcomm Ericsson
and 5 G's plastered everywhere yep and
that's that speed I'm waiting for that
one day like it's it's once we were 300
times faster than LTE right now yeah
it's uh it's a
times faster than the fastest possible
home connection you can get broadband
not even the wireless like it's
amazingly fast isn't the type of thing
where you're gonna end up with a
bottleneck if you don't get 5g soon
enough like some of the concepts or like
live streaming VR autonomous cars like
do we need 5g as an ingredient in those
recipes that actually make those things
happen too so what the carrots are doing
or they're upgrading LT at the same time
they're trying to get LT to the point
where it's fast enough like so it's an
OK experience but 5g really unlocks
things like self-driving cars like there
was the responsiveness the latency of
the 5g Network is almost real-time LTE
there's always a little bit of lag when
you ping something and you know when
you're in a self-driving car and it's
about to go to an accident like you need
to have that zero latency like it's
gotta be super responsive that's where
5g unlocks or the full potential of a
self-driving car there's crazy speeds
even if it's lagging and slow a slow
fire G connection is way faster than the
fastest LTE right that's one of the
things I always look when this is so
nerdy night now
I build my home network and I'm working
on those things I check on my qualia
it's gonna be slow here but it's still
fast enough for me because you want to
be able to pull 4k video that'd be great
if you could do that on the phone you
try that now it's gonna just stutter and
it's gonna die out there so what they
did have kind of a prototype 5g network
at the Erickson booth what they were
doing is pulling live 360 feet from the
Intel booth and streaming into an oculus
rift like in real time the quality was
pretty damn good this is a this is
through a wireless network yeah this is
through 5g like this is like the
simulated 5g network that they put up so
speaking of VR and AR right so we VR
last year was actually pretty big last
year here cuz yet oculus had a booth
noctus does not have a booth this year
but there's still a VR section and
augmented reality while I didn't say VR
virtual reality and augmented reality
section what did you guys think of what
we saw this year you know I I was a
little disappointed I mean there's some
hardware that's great but you know the
problem right now VR is there's not a
lot of watch and stuff I saw mounted to
teasers and commercials so it was a
little disappointing underwhelming for
me the Intel one at the Intel event
there were a lot of different
demonstrations I definitely liked the
concept of live sports in
Villar you know you get you get a better
appreciation of like what it's actually
like to be there but at the same time
yeah I agree with you that I think it's
still gonna take a little bit longer for
us to get the amount of content that we
really need the content I was on the
floor checking out a lot of the hardware
I liked a lot of the hardware when it
came to ODG they have these awesome
glasses they're essentially like an
Android phone on your face it's had a
snapdragon 835 in there which is anyone
out yet and it had a great picture
quality so I thought the hard work is
actually getting there because I have a
daydream view at home and it just kind
of Falls pulls forward the OTG you can
see it right now
it's got a lot of cool things that's a
nose pad right there they can actually
adjust you can bring it up or down if
you have different shaped nose they can
actually change that out for you they
also have a little snap ins for your
prescription lenses they were super
comfortable image quality was great it
cost about $1000 coming out later this
year whoa whoa whoa
a thousand bucks thousand dollar 720p
images though and the other thing is
they've really modified Android so you
can have the image either on your left
eye your right eye or both so whatever
you're doing you can see what you're
doing
they've also change notifications I'm
like this is actually a really good
implementation of how it should be
because I was I was so surprised at how
light it was because it felt like all
right I'm gonna put this thing on it's
got all the electronics in the actual
device put it on and it just felt like
my glasses so we tried it onstage
actually earlier this week and one of
things that really impressed me they
showed me a demonstration live sports on
display but sort of underneath it was
this 3d rendering of the field and the
players in 3d kind of moving around and
you could sort of manipulate it with
with the glasses it was it was actually
really stunning and Paul I was I came
away impressed but again great hardware
not a lot of content I mean I go back to
that Qualcomm Power Rangers experience I
would try yesterday I loved it because
you don't like fire rains apparently
look you get on the Zord and like 10
seconds later the whole thing's over
when you're about to get to the cool
stuff it's like oh and you're
complaining because they don't have
enough content in the actual adventure
as it was but I'm just saying if you if
you enjoy Power Rangers and you get to
see the actual Megazords around you it's
awesome Roger well they are also doing
some stuff where they're trying to
improve the hardware where they're at
additional enablement slike for instance
we saw the high pursuit at CES unveiled
which is basically like this ridiculous
looking metal rig that you get on top of
and it simulates flying you know those
are armed controls right there
it looks pretty ridiculous but at the
same time it's like how do we make this
even more immersive like when I said I
look like the back of the old arcade
games super hang on he's kind of kind of
on its motorcycle kind of thing but yeah
it it doesn't it looks way more
ridiculous there's Scott Stein taking a
bullet for us all right there he was at
the trying this out and there you have
to lay on it looks like a massage table
or something when you're moving your
arms you supposed to have a real
experience as if you're flying I don't
know if that's necessary but I thought
it was a really cool idea so you gotta
figure how look you got VR you can't
walk around everywhere lastly we have
that 360 kind of treadmill little
plastic thing you can kind of run around
in you got to figure out how can you not
bump into stuff the high pursuit as
ridiculous as it looks you're not going
to run into people but let me let me ask
you who's gonna get this it's like first
casinos theme parks you're not supposed
to buy it okay so where is this gonna be
like it like back from the old surface
table existed same kind of thing this
idea that I believe it belongs in
arcades like where you are what our VR
belongs in arcades flat-out because it
only belongs in the 80s basically yeah I
guess so you know things come back Roger
I don't know if you're old enough to
know this but there's there cycles to
things and things come back you know
bell-bottoms will be back again in 20
years you're like oh and why it was back
in the 90s and it shouldn't be there our
cage will be back okay I promise there
might be in bowling alleys I don't know
all right so now we've we've killed this
to this horse it's gone now what's your
favorite thing you've seen at CES been
about you bumblebee oh geez I would
probably say it would be the the hush me
which is this it's this kind of
crazy-looking muzzle type of situation
where if you're in an open office space
what you can do is have private
conversations even if folks are sitting
next to you so yeah it's in it looks
pretty strange this is an actual device
and it's a muzzle for humans right but
you know this guy could be having a
private conversation
you'd be calling his doctor his wife or
whatever even if he's in the office or
he's out and about whatever what are the
other aspects of it is is that it adds
like voice filters so you can sound like
Darth Vader if you want to obviously
they it's not even gonna hit crowd
sourcing platforms until a little bit
while longer so this thing I don't know
I thought it was kind of fun we have an
open office in the New York office and
it's very very loud when you have some
very loud people everyone's gonna look
like Bane from Batman you know and talk
like him apparently right is that an
option you can do Bane in the dark
videos just said wait yeah not been yet
but maybe they gotta have Bane right
like that's exactly what Bane looks like
without the glasses I don't I don't know
about this and whether it should exist
or not but you know what one of my
favorite things about see that's the
fact that you see crazy stuff like that
because you got it throw everything at
the wall and see what sticks and this it
might work in an open office environment
we might see an investment I believe in
our our office you think so especially
for you I don't know I don't know it's
it's another one of those things like
the hyper suit that looks strange and
you kind of have to convince people that
you're not gonna look like an idiot
actually buying this thing and using it
I was just I was wowed by the LG w7 TV
like that's a super-thin TV it's 2.5 7
millimeters thin and I have this weird
cognitive dissonance I'm like it's so
thin it's awesome why would you spend
$8,000 that's actually the price they
told us that yesterday $8,000 is
available to pre-order right now I'm
like this it's it's really cool they
keep saying like you can't distinguish
it from the wall it's it's less than
four millimeters away from the wall with
its new mount it's got these you screw
in two points and you have two magnets
on the bottom it's 18 pounds so you'd
have to worry about studs you don't to
worry about actually mounting this is
something sturdy you can just put it up
on anything I was just amazed by that
actually this is so thin to attach an
HDMI cable and stuff you couldn't do
that so they decided to put a ribbon
cable proprietary ribbon cable to the
sound bar you can see it it's this giant
sound bar dolby atmos and when you turn
it on these two speakers actually rise
out of it because why not just spend a
thousand dollars on the TV I don't need
it but I want it oh it's
don't eat it wine is so nice too it's
really gorgeous oled screen do you
imagine that it's all that's it like
it's pure black you're getting real
awesome color there
did you see Saad on the floor oh yeah
yeah yeah no and Katz Meyer our TV
expert loves OLED really sort of the
high end in terms of video yeah I have
to grid some awesome stuff so Roger what
was your favorite thing mine was a 1
actually I found at the Erickson booth
it was the tact I touch platform was
this little accessory to your VR headset
like an oculus rift revived and attaches
to your finger it's got a little haptic
feedback so whenever you're when you're
in the virtual world if you're touching
something it'll actually push back so
it'll feel like you're actually pressing
a button remote control or at one point
I was like patting a teddy bear and I
actually was able to grab a Pepsi can
and throw it and it's I mean after a
while starting to get convinced that I
was actually touching felt that natural
it felt pretty natural it's a look it's
a little early I feel like a little
janky that kind of came off sometimes a
little loose but it took the promise of
it that I mean that's a real useful
thing right when you're the virtual
world you are a little disconnected
right like you've got you can see
everything but you can't really touch
and this actually adds a new element or
dimension to the VR experience yeah that
seems like a really good idea because
you know it's one thing to be immersed
in it it's another thing to be able to
actually interact with it so that's like
we said the high pursuit you try to
figure out how do you actually then make
these things feel real so I'm this is a
pretty cool product I don't try to find
it later
I didn't sort of wrap it up for us you
think so guys you can find it 359 we did
it because my 359 on iTunes SoundCloud
Google Play and of course cnet.com for
the 359 podcast I'm Maya's actor I'm
Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox Mervin thanks
for watching up next the laptop reviews
team is here with all their favorite
laptops they've seen at the show stay
