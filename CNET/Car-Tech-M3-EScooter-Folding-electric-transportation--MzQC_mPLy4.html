batteries that are powering your
smartphones and tablets you're enabling
a whole new segment of a mobility
devices things like electric bicycles
electric scooters I'm riding the m3e
scooter from the company eco Rico I'm
really impressed by the sturdy
construction of this this is all
aluminum fairly thick aluminum
throughout up here on the handlebars
we've got our brake lever we've got our
accelerator that's this little thing
right here and we have a gauge you got
our start switch here to turn the whole
thing on and this gauge shows our speed
the charging level and total miles I've
traveled now down on the deck here we've
got our two wheels front and back of
course and these are actually solid
rubber tires so you won't get flats and
they're fairly wide to handle the rigors
of an urban environment we've got little
shocks here do too much that notice the
rides got a rough if you're unreal a
rough pavement we have a kickstand
that's really convenient and on this
rear wheel we have a 250 watt electric
hub motor that's integrated back in here
along the side here we've got a charging
port this battery pack on here can be
charged from zero to full in four and a
half hours or zero to 80% in two and
half hours according to the company eco
Rico also says this lithium Ferro
phosphate battery chemistry means this
battery can go through a thousand
charging cycles so it's pretty long lib
compared to a lot of other batteries on
the market all right to get this thing
started you actually have to run it by
foot a little bit that's a safety
measure once it's rolling that I can
push the accelerator and I'm under power
one convenient safety measure too is
that if i push this brake lever while
the accelerator is going it'll actually
feet the accelerators I can break even
with my hand fully depressed on the
accelerator thing feels pretty stable at
speed like this but I gotta admit the
ride isn't all that smooth it's a little
bit rough it's these hard tires and the
suspension isn't all that soft this
gauge here is also little bit hard to
monitor when you're under way I'm
thinking maybe a set amount of gauge
would be easier I'd also like to see
some lights on this thing for riding at
night now one of the key features of the
m3 II scooter is its foldable so I can
fold it down just like this
I can pick it up and carry it on a train
or a bus except well it weighs 34 pounds
so I'm going to get that workout I
missed a while riding instead of walking
the m3 lisper 999 dollars you can find a
lot of other East scooters on the market
but the m3 is lighter than the others
has more range higher speed and it's
battery will last longer it's a bit more
expensive than the competition - but if
it gets you to work on time it might be
worth it
