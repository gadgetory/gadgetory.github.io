South by Southwest and I'm about to take
you on a tour at the fictional town of
Sweetwater from the HBO show West world
if you haven't seen Westworld the
premise is it's a theme park that's a
western themed and very rich people with
a lot of money can kind of pay to play
cowboy and interact with androids or
hosts so let's go take a look alright
folks so our first stop is the Mariposa
hotel and saloon if you've seen the show
this is where the town madam Maeve kind
of sets up shop so we're gonna go in
here and you can see that there's kind
of like a commingling we're also gonna
have playing along here looks like we've
got a corner and also here the player
piano that sort of prominently featured
in the show it's kind of always
interesting to to look at and in this
case it looks like there's a little bit
of blood splatter let's take a look at
the keys
we also have our bar up here because I
mean how could you not
and what I've noticed so far is that
every time I walked walked past the host
they actually are having that
conversations and have characters and
names and whatnot so think hi what's
your name
what do you name nice nice to meet you
how long have you been in Sweetwater is
that so really do you get a lot of
newcomers kind of passing through here
yeah look good look at that thanks for
chatting oh thank you so much let's see
what else is going to live outside of
somebody getting excited about a poker
game okay so across the street here it
looks like we have a photographic studio
let's go see what's happening in there
three seconds oh man how can I pass that
maybe I'll just watch let's see what's
the ask gun in here so it looks like
there's a couple of clothing options if
you're like me and you're wearing a hat
but also like a North Face jacket which
is not exactly authentic to the time
there we go let's see what else is going
on so this little dark tonight but we've
got a blacksmith shop kind of over here
to the left which you can't really see
very well it looks like there's some
stuff going on at the Coronado which is
the hotel from the show looks like
they've converted it into an opening
their situation
also got some live music over here got
Sweetwater plugged into an electric
after all right looks like we've got
another section of the coronado just
over here
another bar because again how could you
not food looks like you can eat beans
out of a Tanner get a shot up through
the wall
seeing but sad this way so I've also
seen a bunch of horses kind of milling
around so hopefully we'll run into some
of those because horses are nice all
right
some townspeople out late at night and
over here we have a bank it doesn't look
like the sturdiest thing it looks like
there's some type of a serious
conversation going on here
see what else and over here looks like a
barber salon
I suppose a good shave was hard to come
by in the Old West see yeah I think I
see a horse let's see if we can get
around to it
yep run there we go
a horse oh look her name is Gracie Oh
nice to meet you Gracie what kind of
horse is she a paint very beautiful
Thanks
so as you can see it's it's pretty
free-range there's a lot of people
milling around kind of checking out all
the little buildings that have folks
inside doing stuff
and just a little while ago I wish I
could find him but I saw a Shogun
samurai guy if you've seen that looks
like we got a fight over here let's see
how well you can see but there's
definitely
here's another horse near it
and here's a lady with a shotgun looks
like there's a post office over there
we're just about back to the Coronado
and a few steps away the Mariposa and
there you have it folks
Sweetwater after dark if you want to see
