September Twitter said that it would
test out a 280 character limit for
tweets with a limited amount of users
this would double Twitter's original
limit of 140 characters when the company
announced the test and mentioned that
with languages like Japanese Korean and
Chinese more information could be
conveyed in less characters Twitter said
the languages outside of those three
were impacted by cramming the company
cited data showing 9% of tweets in
English reached the limit only 0.4% of
tweets sent in Japanese reached a
hundred and forty characters now the
company is rolling out the 280 character
limit for pretty much everybody Twitter
said it kept a close eye on how many
long tweets arose out of the test two
percent were over 190 characters five
percent were over 140 characters the
company claims that your timeline
reading experience should not
substantially change and you'll see
about the same amount of tweets in your
timeline Twitter also said users who had
the 280 character limits during the
experimental period received more
engagement and gained more followers
tweets written in Japanese Korean and
Chinese will retain the older 140
character limit will this change cause a
backlash probably for more coverage
