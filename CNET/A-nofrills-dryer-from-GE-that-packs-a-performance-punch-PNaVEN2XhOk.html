dryers
all mechanical controls this machines
control panel is decidedly analog
there's no display there's no LEDs
there's not even a light on this thing
it's also back mounted which means this
dryer cannot support pedestal upgrades
or be stackable so that you can save
some space in your laundry room you also
don't get any steam modes like you do on
other dryers and there really aren't any
fancy dryer cycles for specific types of
fabric or types of garments that you
would find on more expensive or better
equipped machines one of the biggest
selling points though of this machine is
that it is affordable it costs only $650
it's also a great performer this dryer
actually has more drying power than most
of the machines we've looked at recently
but keep in mind the capacity on this
dryer is only seven point two cubic feet
which is not that big considering other
dryers on the market and you also get
moisture sensors inside this machine
that will help you avoid over drying or
using too much energy so in the end this
dryer doesn't have a lot of crazy
features or cycles but it does offer
lots of drying performance for the price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
