of these if it's covered in Gorilla
Glass six Corning has just announced its
next-generation Gorilla Glass and it's
supposed to withstand drops of up to one
meter about hip height 15 times that's
about two years worth of drops for the
average consumer making it twice as
durable as the previous Gorilla Glass
five at least according to Corning as
good as it was guerrilla glass six is
better it drops at higher Heights but
more importantly for repeated drops at
one meter the company showed us how they
torture their glass to get it ready for
primetime in their labs in Silicon
Valley first your traditional drop test
with this machine that's able to drop it
at an angle no surprise that the curve
is the weakest link on the glass the
company said they tested Gorilla Glass 6
up to 2 meters as high as this machine
goes they also have the tumble test to
mimic the most hazardous environment of
all the purse the phone gets put in with
cosmetics keys and coins to see just how
scratch-resistant the glasses and my
personal favorite the super slapper this
pendulum mimics the impact and is
measured in joules of impact energy but
even Corning admits that the design of a
phone can play a huge part in how fast
that phone breaks so we'll have to
conduct some tests of our own once they
hit the market which could be very soon
we've been sampling them for for some
time now and they're actually designing
Gorilla Glass 6 into their products that
will launch later this year does that
mean the note 9 I phone 10 plus pixel 3
maybe and it's not just about making
glass durable Corning is also changing
the look of Gorilla Glass beyond this
year's devices this is matte glass and
it makes fingerprints significantly
harder to see because Matt is the new
black and this one even has texture
which mimics the design that it's on and
for wearables they've made something
called a DX plus composite which can be
applied to Gorilla Glass to reduce
reflections and help prevent scratching
beyond that even flexible screens which
Corning is already testing out as well
we have done glasses down to a hundred
microns which is 0.1 millimeter
about the thickness of a sheet of paper
and can go thinner than that and these
glasses can bend within 5 millimeter
radius so about 1/4 inch radius so as
you talk about foldable flexible
displays that's about the range of fold
or and that people are interested</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
