the PlayStation 2 proves that's just not
the case
place your brain in the nostalgia
position as adventures in tech reminds
you why Sony's second console was the
most popular games machine ever
by the turn of the millennium it was
clear that a thousand years of human
endeavor had been leading to just one
thing Sony's sequel to the 1995
PlayStation console the first
PlayStation had been a huge hit but
dominating two consecutive console
generations was unheard of Sony needed
something special and in September 1999
that's exactly what it showed off the
ps2 had style gone was the office
equipment gray of the PlayStation 1 in
favor of stealth bomber black this was a
fashion conscious living room accessory
right down to its swiveling logo while
inside the emotion CPU built by Sony and
Toshiba promised to provide gorgeous
visuals that wasn't all the ps2 had to
offer however apart from a new look and
swanky new hardware Sony's machine had
two secret weapons to help it win the
console war firstly it was backwards
compatible so the millions of
PlayStation 1 owners could keep playing
their old games that gave it an edge
over the Gamecube an Xbox whose
predecessors were the incompatible n64
and nothing respectively the ps2 could
also play DVDs but as time when the
format which was co-developed by Sony
was just becoming popular it's hard to
imagine anyone could have doubted the
ps2 s powers but at the time its
position as future gaming champion
didn't feel quite so assured one concern
was the lineup of launch games the
excellent SSX and timesplitters would
eventually prove to be winners but with
Grand Theft Auto 3 still a year away
early shoppers were understandably
cautious about a smattering of sports
titles or fireworks puzzler fanta vision
meanwhile hardware shortages meant that
only half of the planned 1 million
consoles made it to the US in time for
launch while international game has been
moaned the comparatively high price of
Sony's machine especially in the UK how
much these things were obstacles for
Sony but there was one thing beyond
Hardware beyond games that bolstered the
system's success the ps2 was really
really cool Sony had a machine that
could appeal to a more mature crowd and
it pursued this idea relentless
cooking up bizarre edgy promotion for
the console including a series of
unsettling ads from surrealist director
David Lynch place savvy marketing made
PlayStation part of millennial pop
culture as essential as the matrix
Napster all those Budweiser ads in
October 2000 it all fell into place when
Sony's cool console games and
accessories raked in two hundred and
fifty million dollars on launch day hits
games followed as did quirky accessories
and a slim version while rivals fell by
the wayside the ps2 sold more than 150
million units before it was discontinued
in January 2013 a phenomenal achievement
but even if the ps4 or Xbox one somehow
sells more nothing can outstrip the
importance of the PlayStation 2 Sony's
second console is more than just a great
piece of tech it's a cultural artifact
the machine that was at the forefront
when gaming grew up and the medium began
to entered the mainstream for services
to video games PlayStation 2 we salute
you
what are your ps2 memories did you have
a favorite game or did you prefer the
GameCube or Xbox let me know and check
back next time for another adventure in
tech
