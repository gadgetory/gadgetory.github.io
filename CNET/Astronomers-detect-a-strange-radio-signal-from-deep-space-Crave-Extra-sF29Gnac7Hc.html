investigating a strange radio signal
coming from deep space the signal was
intercepted by the Russian ratan 600
radio telescope in Zelan chuck's kya
Russia back in May 2015 the SETI
Institute which is an organization
devoted to searching for
extraterrestrial intelligence announced
that they were examining the signal
which seems to be coming from a solar
system
called HD one six four five nine five
which is 94 light-years away according
to a blog post by a senior astronomer at
SETI seth shostack the system contains a
star much like our own Sun which is
similar in size and brightness and is
known to have a planet the size of
Neptune orbiting it this planet is not
considered hospitable to life but there
could be other nearby planets
astronomers simply have not yet
discovered on August 28th the Allen
telescope array was turned towards the
system HD one sixty four five nine five
in hopes of finding the same signal that
was previously detected back in May of
last year but astronomers have not had
any luck locating the signal szostak
went on to say in his post the
discoverers didn't alert the SETI
community to this find until now which
is not as expected according to both
practice and protocol if the signal
seems to be of deliberate and
extraterrestrial origin one of the first
things to do is get others to attempt
confirming observations that was not
done in this case for more space related
