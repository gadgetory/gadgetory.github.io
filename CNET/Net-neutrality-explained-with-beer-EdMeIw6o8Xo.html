neutrality but they don't really
understand what it means so what better
way to explain it then over beer let's
say the bartender is your internet
service provider like Comcast or Verizon
and these beers on tap those are the
websites hey can you pour me a Netflix
you would expect every website to be
served up to you at the same speed each
poured the same that's net neutrality
and some believe there should be
regulations to make sure our internet
bartenders treat all web services and
traffic equally they serve that up
pretty quick but what if they didn't you
see without rules people fear these
internet bartenders may start acting
like jerks they could slow down the flow
of one web site that they don't like or
block certain sites altogether oh yeah
and there's the idea that some websites
will pay more to get to you faster call
it an express spout I'll have a oh that
was zippy what do they pay you more for
this some people don't think you need
net neutrality rules because the market
will self-regulate the bartender's will
play nice because they don't want to
annoy their customers and lose business
others say you do need the rules after
all why does a bartender have to play
fair if he's the only bar in town
and there's another issue those who
control the pipes have incentive to her
competitors Comcast owns NBC Verizon
owns Yahoo the bar would rather serve
its own brew so what can you do the fate
of the Internet is in the hands of our
government and it's up to you to decide
how you feel about that there we go down
so smooth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
