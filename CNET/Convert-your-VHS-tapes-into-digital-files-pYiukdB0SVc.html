run in the 90s but they're certainly not
making a comeback so if you're still
holding on to a box full in your
basement it's time to put the VHS tapes
to rest once and for all
and put those memories into a digital
drawers Costco Walgreens or Walmart
offer the service or you can mail it
into an online service but you'll have
to spend around $15 a tape depending on
where you go and they may not always
give them back in the most user friendly
formats
oh yeah and sensitive material may be
off limits so if you're more comfortable
doing it yourself here's what you need
there's no way of playing these anywhere
so you're gonna have to get that old VHS
player out of storage too or order use
one off eBay or Amazon you'll also need
one of these converters there's a ton of
options out there for Mac or PC users at
different price ranges I'll be using
this one I bought on Amazon for about
$40 next you'll need a Mac or PC with a
DVD player to install the software so if
it's a newer device you'll also need one
of these or check to see if you can
download the software online if it's an
older computer and you have a big pile
of VHS tapes to get through I'd also
recommend an external hard drive to
store all the footage on start by
plugging everything in and make sure to
match the colors on the VHS outputs then
insert the CD and download all the
necessary software in my case the drive
in the editing software for later now
dust off that old VHS tape and put it in
the player
and I'm talking about the whole movies
not the copy of Braveheart you never
return to Blockbuster before you hit
play though open the software that came
with a converter and make sure you
adjust your capture settings to a format
that's easy to store an edit MPEG MOV or
mp4 work great if you have the option
now make sure you're cued up to the part
you actually want to save because
chances are not all of your tape is
worth saving
finally you can start recording on the
computer and press play on the VHS
player now let it roll for as long as
you want the clip to be once you're done
you should have a file waiting for you
in the folder you selected you can end
here or put it on a USB or hard drive to
collect us somewhere else or upload to a
cloud-based storage service depending on
the number of videos and the weight of
the file I would recommend Google
drive's iCloud for Apple users or
Dropbox if you don't have a Google or
Apple account or if you're really
adventurous you could edit a sweet home
movie with all your footage and even add
some throwback transitions just for fun
the analog converter comes with its own
editing tool but there are plenty of
free programs out there like iMovie for
Macs or moviemaker for Windows and if
you're ready to go public with your
popstar past you can even upload to
Vimeo or YouTube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
