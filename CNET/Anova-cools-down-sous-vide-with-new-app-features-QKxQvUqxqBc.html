precision cooker with Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi I really liked the machines
ability to keep a nice even temperature
when you do water bath cooking with a
method that we call sous-vide cooking
but the one thing I didn't like about
this immersion circulator was it's at
the Wi-Fi version of the Innova app was
really measly when I first got my hands
on it recently a nova updated the Wi-Fi
version of its app this app has really
great cooking gods and even a setup that
will teach you how to cook your food
first by putting it in an ice water bath
to keep it at a safe temperature all day
and then let you start your sous vide
cooking so you can have a nice let's say
steak by the time you get home now not
much has changed with the Innova itself
you still have the same precision cooker
that's really great at keeping good
temperatures but this app really changes
the game
it makes connecting with this device and
cooking with the device a lot easier and
a lot more enjoyable it's just a really
flexible tool to add to your kitchen the
another precision cooker with Wi-Fi is
$200 which is a pretty good investment
if you want to add something new to your
kitchen but I find that with the apps
updates and the company's province to
keep updating the app and making it as
good as the original that this is a
purchase that might be worthwhile for a
lot of folks who are interested in
precision cooking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
