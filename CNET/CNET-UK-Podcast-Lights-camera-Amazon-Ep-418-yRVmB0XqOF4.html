seen at UK podcast in this episode 418
for friday the twenty-third of january
2015 amazon is getting into the movie
business but can anyone really challenge
netflix plus we meet Apple's latest
purchase charge our phones by magic in
starbucks and things are getting strange
I'm starting to worry could it be a case
for Mulder and Scully I'm rich shown
home and joining me on a high-tech long
studio this week is luke westaway did it
earlier did it it it it done dandan do I
want to believe I can say that's all
that's been away for a bit finicky
babies and also with us is Andy oil
hello hello that's how you say hello
talking about the word from the front
speaking bent hang on let me give it
another go say hi to me I do didand and
keep working on that keep away from that
we are back filming this podcast so if
you've missed our ugly mug Scalia but
only being audio recently you can still
enjoy the rest of our videos on sina com
or youtube com / seen it we do look good
actually he did a girl had a new haircut
everything love you yeah it's like the
old were a smaller yeah let's start
listen I use
gonna start by telling you what apple
has been up to I hope it up to well what
it's done guys yeah it's bought music
metric now if the name didn't give the
game away just a little bit there music
metric is a UK company actually and that
basically gives all kinds of analysis
I'm on music downloads so download
amounts and things like reviews and also
actually about piracy like we're in
person yeah that's true so it's kind of
it so it's very modern phenomenon i
guess it's them they not only look at
sales and streaming things but sort of
things that would have been measured by
the charts previously the sort of things
I've actually bring in cash bribes of
music they also look at a pirate
activity if people are torrenting
certain songs or artists they look at
reviews that have comments look at other
social buzz on social networks so which
doesn't bring in cash but it seems to
have currency in these this day and age
so it's been bought by Apple anyway so
that could be like a good way of giving
like actual proper music charts instead
of just on sales it's on everything i
miss all-encompassing what is like the
UK top 40 we will endow mouth well yeah
but you know be including all these
things that really mattered about music
yeah and maybe that'd be cool I guess
which is in the run up cuz Apple's
having bought beats and beats what was
going to be there streaming service
music beats music yeah bitches children
run up to upper launching that and I was
in ages ago they bought beats I
completely forgotten to happen yeah yeah
millions and moons dolls are they gonna
do spinning with it but their biggest of
purchase take well they I think they
work together is they're going to fold
beach music into itunes in some way and
see me music metrics will be a path that
but we will find out so yeah well from
ingesting the fruit of lovely beans
through your ears we're ingesting the
fruit of lovely beans through your mouth
I'm glad mouth via coffee well
specifically starbucks a steel a 50
screenwriters Oh Oscar really earning
their money this week yes well that was
good great obviously everyone knew what
I was doing there basically starbucks is
bringing its wireless charging via
powermat from San Francisco into London
in some of starbucks stores actually
Luke you were at the launch with his yes
why don't you tell them more yes it was
your all caffeined up or i went to a
starbucks in London to see how this
works it's actually bit so basically
what happens is that the the tables in
starbucks have these these these glossy
pad things about size of coasters but
they're embedded in the in the tables
and just as ladi Dadi once you're
forcing many coasters no rings on mine
how do we anyway um yeah and then you
say you need it like a wireless charging
dongle thing which of these colorful
little hoops which have a little
connector on them and I let me win new
image yeah so you basically go to the
till and you borrow one of those you lug
it into the bottom of your phone and
they just rest it over the pad set the
hoops on the pad and it charges your
phone wirelessly okay so hang on let me
get this straight right yes wireless
charging which is supposed to be a
technology that does away with the need
for wires in charge of sodium UNK your
phone down to make years and you have to
borrow a charger okay well starbucks
nailed it all right well we will get to
all the reasons why why you're wrong to
be unexcited okay but first i will
concede that commenters do agree with
you they're not impressed the dud right
commented the duck of death is on your
side you can always a powerful allies to
have says that might be the dumbest
invention yet in all the history of
registers a wireless charger that you
connect to the charger port meanwhile
general stuff I carries you messes
military record be honest if I can't use
my phone comfortably while it is
charging which I can't if it has to sit
flat against the table I would rather
have a wire that's a good point okay
right is the reason why it's stupid to
criticizes first of all wireless
charging only does only promises to do
away with the need for wires which this
does so I can't accuse it of being
misleading secondly it's not like there
was an alternative is not that they've
taken away all of the wired charges they
had in starbucks okay springing out at
the tables and now this is all you've
got so now instead of like one power
point you could have plasma yeah four or
five phones doctor table yeah exactly
that people don't have their phone
charges with them there are only a few
wall sockets and everything and these
this is something that's like there's
loads of them all through that all
through the shop kind of loads on the
desk and also like there's no fee for
borrowing one from starbucks if you if
you want to save time on repeat visits
you can pay a tenner
and then it's yours to keep like why
don't just walk out with it definitely
don't just walk out with it I mean who
would do that's awful you did mention
yolk and you know they're not doing away
with all the wires coming at a table
themselves yes why is this better than
having wires Graham tables I'll tell you
could put it in and actually keep using
your phone you don't have to leave you
but then there's only a limited number
of sockets and that's basically going to
a starbucks is always one person who's
turned up and bought like arguing it's a
half a green tea and is saying there for
75 hours working also like things like
cables punking out of the marriage table
is kind of ugly no I think yeah exactly
okay no you taught yeah I taught me
around actually and also we have the
endorsement from mark our producer you
will never see you just come back from
San Francisco yes in actual incidence
they're already rolling us out to 2000
San Francisco starbucks i believe it's
gonna be in every starbucks in britain
doing um no it's only 10 starbucks in
London but it's like the first wave so
they started in the US and it's like
it's now spreading pretty rapidly okay
so that it seems to have worked over
there and if people take to it in these
tens topics in London for the record I
think this is completely the most stupid
way of doing this that I've possibly
ever heard let me give you one whole
reason why it why it isn't so wireless
charging is fraught with drama at the
moment you wouldn't believe it because
it's so uninteresting but there's all
these different standards there's like
the Qi standard Qi yes spell and then
there's the PMA and then there's a
there's another one I think these use
the PM a standard who isn't that the
rubbish one that no one uses but it
doesn't matter what they use because you
plug in this sort of day again gotcha
yeah and then and then everything works
with it so so it doesn't matter what
kind of you don't have to like iPhones
work which don't have any sort of
wireless charging capability and let's
face it at the ones probably loads of
people in starbucks want to charges for
that's true so it's a really quick is
there a phone that can you thought up
you can think many phones that do have
wireless charging you can use with this
um no I can think is charging they have
they use they use cheaper the ACP yeah
yes others LG's yeah cheers bees by far
the most popular one could have gone
with Starbucks any of it and actually
had it done properly but neither kuna
don't like no one no one who has a
wireless charging phone uses their phone
what like uses that capability or like I
don't I think almost but that's because
they have to buy separate wireless
but if y'all started building it into
tables and things which is what they
need to do in order to make wireless
charging a thing as does that you have a
few theorists well I think yeah I think
that um that sometimes we always always
complaining about battery life being so
poor on phones but I think wireless
charging is actually going to make that
the arguments a bit a bit null really
because you won't if you have wireless
charging built into everywhere you go so
when you go to starbucks if your phone
number table automatically charges
you'll buy desks or the office so that's
already built in and for library and
schools and whatever so wherever you go
you put your phone down it will
discharge constantly in small bursts
throughout the day so you don't need
your battery to last more than a day or
even more than half a day because it
will always be charging all right so you
don't ever have to do like one big
charge overnight and it's fun to yeah
you're getting other day yeah okay what
that's quite enough about Wireless John
no i think i have to say i don't care
don't let them time there's like stub on
a practical level no one currently uses
wireless charging even though it's a
very cool technology it has been around
for years nobody uses it yeah starbucks
sort of basically made Wi-Fi in cafes a
thing and that was that was something
that i believe they pioneered okay so
they are mr. Starbucks yeahhh mister
mister starbucks himself can come with
his big big uncle sam top oxygen tension
score seven years ago we invented Wi-Fi
in coffee shops that's i'm saying
they've got the clout to sort of make
something right then okay okay so what I
to be fair actually it was good that
someone's kind of getting out getting
ahead of the curve and doing anything
really making a mess of it but he go
good on your stomach alright how many
score and seven years ago was it
actually Oh some some anyway since this
podcast following out control already
Andy what is happening in the world of
google glass well bad news in the world
of google glass as Google is going to
stop selling it oh dear yes so is it
dead no it's not dead what it's doing is
just not having it for sale anymore is
not dead is just not the same it's not
the sale it will be continuing working
on it and working developers and
hopefully this will be for future
editions of or using the technology for
other things well this is it so you're
kind of a fan of the concept of
kind of the principle behind glass if
not necessarily teton to hardware so I
am yes I think that Google glass as it
as an idea the idea of having this sort
of weird futuristic concept and giving
out to all these developers try and
crowdsources ideas and crowdsource the
development is a really good idea if you
have public beta test exactly yeah and
it means that they can filter down some
of the cool ideas with and the
technology and voice control and voice
recognition into things like Android
wear which is on sale but I do think
that charging 1,500 pounds per glass is
a bad idea and I don't think people
should buy that I think it should have
been used for testing only absolutely
and I think readers agree with you on
the bad idea yes they do Jane's
underscore garden says if a stranger
walked up to you photographed filmed you
then walked away how would you like it
how about doing the same to your
children I'm glad Google glass is gone
and the idiot who invented them just
start looking for more worthwhile ways
to spend his time coming from Jones
Gardner Empire says I'm a technophile in
love all things technological but google
group but google glass crosses a line
that shouldn't be crossed I'm glad when
we won't have to say the words google
glass because it is quite difficult your
glass is good i mean you know even if I
was sober right now I would probably
struggle with it frankly yeah I mean I
can't say it's over um J FCP says Google
already owns all yours of look at these
days he's fine he's angry Google already
owns all your personal files if you use
that email with Google glass they don't
every minute of your day and every move
you made big brother and Skynet rolled
into one that's absolutely not
overstating it if you visit and well
even the people who like Google glass
have their reservations so shy a night
says I love the idea of google glass and
would definitely use it however no one
wants a Borg sitting opposite them so it
needs to be made much more discreet
right well the good news is it's not
going to be very much more discreet or
indeed made a torso well they're gonna
keep working at it so well I don't think
the city and I gently wasn't acidic
really you think well Google can't say
like we're scrapping it because actually
it turns out so you know like not
selling it anymore and longer definitely
no technology
definitely it's a today we'll see
something similar and I certainly think
the technology will and if they be
filtered down into we do have Android
wear watches I have one right now and
that's using a lot of the voice
recognition technology that Google's
been developing and glasses part of that
because it obviously relies on voice
control and stuff so yeah well let's
move on to a bit technology that is a
bit more popular yes we're going to talk
about space probe news bass pro if I'm
rich actually you have some good space
proteins absolutely well it's kind of is
good news and bad news in a way to
understand so the good news is that the
the beagle to probe has been found and
not only did it make it to Mars just
like it was planned it is bang on target
so it had this cert disturb it's a space
probe that was built by the European
Space Agency backed by it was a british
news team and their target area was 500
kilometers by 100 kilometers and they
were a mere five kilometers away from
the center so that's a lot of space
terms that's a proper bullseye he's a
bad news obviously is that um they lost
touch with it about 10 years ago when he
actually landed and it's basically nakid
and there's no way they learn that in
exactly the right place but term but it
looks like it's mostly intact but they
basically the antenna doesn't it didn't
unfold properly so the space antenna
hasn't popped out which seems like a
little bit of a design flaw counter no
rocket scientists trying to send out
eagle 3 the repair beagle absolutely
whatever thorough room there is 30
tokyo's Reese agency people 3 the Klumps
eagle 3 beagle harder beagle three
cruise control loaded so yeah so there
is going to be another probe sent out in
i believe 2019 by the european space
agency and there are a couple of other
progs already wandering around the
surface of Mars so there's also the
european space agency that did the whole
comet london as well so did what a year
for Space Exploration it has guys who
has been speaking of space exploration
in a very tan gentle way but my mom her
mom or flaker than my alien the x-files
let's talk i expelled because that is
digitally it may be going to be hitting
our TVs again in 2015 yes it is
apparently Fox executives have been in
conversations with Chris Carter the
producer and writer to to bring it back
such good news right absolutely and
stars Gillian Anderson David Duchovny
alive okay
yeah yeah if you like yeah which is
which is pretty cool i'll actually cuz
it was weird because gillian anderson
was on the Nerdist podcast yeah last
week so before work sr before this came
out i think actually this other news and
she was saying that should be really
keen on doing it and thinks that David
dick off news would be so yeah I think
that's really really cool knee like to
see the story continue winning I would
love to Steve story continue our big fan
of x-files is a great show and yeah I
like the movies as well where because
they progress the story line a bit in
the movie during the last one and it
turned out that Mulder and Scully or
actually got married and so it wasn't in
there in two series so be good to see
what position they are whether they're
still in the FBI and whether they're
like maybe mold is in charge of it or
something who knows and I miss ya Luke
I'm not not sure I think the first thing
to say is that the x-files is finished
but but its spirit definitely lives on
like there are there are shows like a
warehouse 13 or fringe springs to mind
which do feel like sorts of modern
reimagining of of the x-files I kind of
deal with similar themes but it's a muck
them more modern fresher TV shows and
actually i think that the x-files was
very much of its time and if you tried
to do it in a sort of modern modern way
like it it just wouldn't work I mean I
do remember watching I'd recently
watched the first season against I only
watched a couple them at the time when
it was all I know actually seen the
whole thing so I thought I'll go back to
netflix and i'll watch it and i was
watching a few of the early episodes i
was thinking to know what this show
would be over if Mulder just had a
mobile phone yeah digital camera well
every time he breaks into some sort of
see top secret government base it ends
with someone stamping on his camera it's
like oh well never mind next time we'll
get the proof this I'd just be
snapchatting it but there'll be no point
snapchatting it because like the NSA
would be an intercepting that and it's
like the x-files what that was like was
this fun kind of all imagine if there
was like a government behind the
government and now we know that there is
and they're not doing fun things like
hiding aliens and stuff like that and
like like dirt like downing crazy
submarines full of weird space diseases
and stuff like that they're just like
looking at your snapchats they're spying
on us and torturing people yeah exactly
nice pretty grim yeah so keep it in the
90s I say
I mean we look back fondly absolutely
yeah yeah okay well I mean other things
go to Twin Peaks coming back in a year
so and that feels up to me unlike
another show that kind of belongs with
its time and I think belong in the
modern age but who knows maybe I don't
think Twin Peaks belongs in any ages so
weird it could be you know it could be
set in like 60 it could canonically be
set in the 16th century and everything
happens exactly the same and you'd be
like this isn't any weirder than Twin
Peaks is a new fan theory I like that in
life and here it all happens in a
medieval monitor well yeah I mean
speaking of TV has been kind of a big
week for original programming on on
various different services like Netflix
Amazon that kind of thing what you're
going to talk about their more about
right now lights camera amazon amazon is
getting into the movie business amazon
instant video service has already
started funding and showing TV shows to
tempt viewers away from netflix and next
it's planning as many as 12 movies a
year that will appear in cinemas first
then go online as little as a month
later now 2015 is going to be a bumper
year for original content produced by
amazon netflix and the like netflix has
hits with house of cards and orange is
the new black it's also launching its
most ambitious project yet four
interconnected series and a mini series
featuring marvel superheroes amazon just
one load of awards are transparent and
even playstation network is getting in
on the action with a show called powers
is this an exciting new frontier in the
golden age of television or is TV as we
know it fracturing into a million pieces
denying us access to our new favorite
shows before they even start it's
certainly an interesting time to get
square eyes now Luke are you a fan of
original content I am a fan of original
content what's horrible word your TV
shows is what we miss ya content um yeah
yeah I mean I am I think it's really
cool i really enjoy loads of them
especially house of cards which and
things been fantastic how much orange is
the new black but i know that everyone
it's universally adored so you know i
haven't seen it but Bojack horseman is
another netflix one which i know much
pretty good and and just it's you know
it's cool after years of these streaming
service sort of services sorts of being
a place where really really old rubbish
movies go to die you know it feels like
now there's a proper reason to get
involved and there are some other
advantages too so for example if you are
Netflix and you put out a TV show this
way you get loads more data on who's
watching and when they're watching how
much they're watching which episodes
they stop watching and stucture way more
than traditional TV or movie makers make
it sound so sexy yes I do so much sexy
data and there's also like the potential
for more interesting stuff so like
networks might not have taken a risk on
something my house of cards that's true
they didn't originate a pilot episode
but Netflix just said no yeah no it was
all shot yeah netflix was crazy enough
to feel like no we have all the money in
the world have all the given Spacey's
you need the netflix came down with this
job back well how many Kevin Spacey's
will it take to get this off the ground
and they said only one and he said only
one have him immediately so that's what
happened to end and things like the
Marvel collaboration like that's
unprecedented you just can't imagine you
still can't imagine that happening on
traditional TV yeah that's it Ford well
that's four different series of 13
episodes plus a miniseries combining
them all together so it's a huge huge
undertaking it's cool it's got not all
of this sort of specially made for
streaming services stuff is good and
also it like it slightly annoying if
you've got an Amazon subscription and
all you want to watch all the stuff is
on netflix but that's an engine time
absolutely i mean there are some some
drawbacks writers yeah it's not yeah
something great I mean it's talking
great time in asaba noisy sums out the
last five years of television yeah it's
been great well yeah it's get over there
it's great seats on netflix and so doing
this but even even microsoft because it
launch Microsoft Studios which which is
going to create orbits original content
for the Xbox one stepping you think
someone as big and as Microsoft could
really sort of climbers behind but then
Microsoft Studios did they just canned
it last year so you know it's kind of a
big blow that you'd think so yeah why
can't it be done like what what is the
formula it needs to happen that's
changing and also i mean there's these
other new end
get on netflix kind of paving the way
and they're very big on binge watching
and because that will they do is they
they put the news the new shows i am on
it's available right at the same time so
yeah every episode of the new series of
house of cards is there on the same day
so you can binge watch the whole thing
and it that's really kind of like the
kind of gold standard i guess and some
of the other people that they haven't
really some of the other entrance into
this kind of market they haven't quite
figured that out so PSN for examples
which is fun that its own show for the
first time called powers superior show
and they are bringing their own march
but they're only showing 1 episode a
week like as if it's on Nelly I mean
coming through that that doesn't take
advantage of the medium that's the cool
thing about about it being online
exactly they're trying to sort of mimic
broadcast so maybe it's been more
collaborated you'll watch it is it is it
that if we put it on just any time of
the day or is it is the idea that they
actually do like an actual she so it's
not as a looking once a week and then
you can watch whatever you like so they
could put it could put on any time and
they could bench what he'll thing which
would make more sense you think and the
other thing is like so Amazon does
something similar a.m. they have
something called pilot season where they
basically make a bunch of pilots which
is very old TV kind of model and make a
bunch of kind of first episodes of new
shows and then they put them online and
you get to vote on the ones you like
which is you know a great idea in theory
it's kind of democratic and it takes
advantage of the fact that you're that
is the internet and you can have that
feedback in that interaction yeah the
problem is because their pilots if you
like one you then gotta wait four months
or it made and I the fact that the
netflix goes well we've got this data
that says people like Kevin Spacey and
David Fincher if you put them together
people are going to watch this show and
it gives it this kind of like a
conviction like an authorial conviction
to say okay here's this show and we know
it's good and so here it is a block and
that has a bit more weight to it than
then kind of the sort like pop idol kind
of method of doing of getting your like
one episode of a shower and going here
jus like it how you like it I'm not sure
that will work based on netflix is
current a logarithm to this cuz i go on
it said like oh because you watch planet
earth maybe you're like RuPaul's Drag
Race like well I really SME like this is
the Alan do great lover is impossible
well tonight RuPaul's Drag Race I'm sure
I see the jeans but I mean did you first
record yeah so yeah I mean yeah I it is
interesting but there is a lot of a lot
of data behind it i mean this om we've
got some reader feedback about this is
yes we have
so sip sippin ricordo CIP n RK o our vos
these 90 sipping our covo you decide how
it's pronounced this is awesome it's
nice to see movies come from elsewhere
than Hollywood Mario c3 says amazon
seems to be bringing out some good
original stuff but i already have
netflix i just can't see myself
subscribing to another company taking
eight dollars or so out of my account
every week it's getting crazy with all
these streaming sites satellite radio
and now even programs like adobe it all
adds up that's true I do kind of want to
watch transparent but I don't want to
sign up to Anderson because I'm already
watching house of cards and all the
other stuff yes I'm you know it's an all
side you've do you feel like you cuz I I
actually have an account with both nod
he does and if it when I sent home with
my feet up on a coaster but i do feel
weirdly loyal to Netflix because it was
the one I got into first yes I'm always
a little suspicious if farmers ends up
dude well I think that's why it's
transparent has been such a big deal of
them they want a couple of golden globes
for that they won best yes own band best
active Josh was a huge huge Eon se um
guitar day I should up speaking their
pilot season when dropping the man in
the high castle might mention this lest
we be the man in the high castle very
very good okay so hopefully i'll get
series like a year guitar kid 55 says i
might be the only one but i still really
enjoy going to the theater to see a
movie i have a nice big TV and surround
sound but it still isn't the same I
don't really care how much it costs
either i live in a smaller town and have
very rarely had a bad experience at a
theater yeah well that's always good to
know that singer is still alive kicking
alright well let us know what you think
about the new kind of golden age of
television whether it is moving online
and for now we're going to move on and
talk a bit more about TV in this week's
quiz
yes the quiz is back and the leaderboard
stands Andy has five yeah you can Jason
are tied for the number one spot on six
yeah a leaderboard breaker Oh Luke sound
like this of course topical absolutely
and Andy sounds like this Andy sounds
like this is there we go that's what I
understand i was like okay so fingers on
the buzzers fastest thing at first what
i want you to do is I'm going to
describe to you some new TV shows that
are coming along some sci-fi fantasy
geek for any TV shows that are starting
in 2015 you don't know anything about
the show all you need to know is that
you need to be able to tell me from this
description is it based on a comic is it
a remake is it based on a true story it
was it rescued from another network is
it a spin off or was it that rare beast
was an original idea so what was it
based on basically can't remake spin-off
true story what it was a based on okay
all right so here's question number one
a girl solves crime by eating brains
Luke sounds like a comic book to me it
was a comic that's iZombie coming to the
CW and that was based on a comic by
Michael red among other people okay
question 2 and these fingers on the
buzzers oh yeah two teenagers take
shelter from nuclear war then emerge 10
years later with a child in tow and II
want my options again what's it based on
cremation comic novel spin-off idea true
story it could be at rooster novel it's
based on the novel it's not the right
answer ralink yes what was it it's just
how I say was it something that another
network didn't want and they're doing it
is not the right answer dashing original
story that's cockroaches on ITV
yesterday go before that's called
cockroaches cockroaches oh it's a
post-apocalyptic british comedy
apparently it's all right my dead set
another most of knock elliptic british
comedy dead set wasn't a zombie thing
post-apocalyptic zombie zombie isn't
apocalypse oh yeah that's right he's
like so many big brother wasn't like
bigger Dibley yeah
post buckle yeah well it didn't come up
with actually set in the year 5,000 that
was the Christmas elimination of
reference in it yeah it was when she
falls in a puddle that's like a puddle
of future time travel gook let's just go
through a portal there's the Christmas
episode where she has to go and eat to
rotting corpses it's yeah Christian
please owasso looked on one and that's
that's that's it that's it button that's
all we've managed I guess we are slick
carnival it is a good now these you
both got chances because there are two
possible answers this remember comment
remake not all original idea risk from
the network and the question is what was
this show about two cops investigate
crimes rated superheroes what's that
based on Andy the two cops do what
investigate crimes related superhero
later two superheroes that is a one-take
advance to come on a trick question it
is a comic yes yay and there is another
option as well drew I got that it's also
pastor and buy another network oh very
good ah do I get to buy you think it too
funny I'll take that one Dwayne Sam it
is like not them ah no that's powers
which is that's what I've done the PSI
yeah exactly yeah so I did mention
earlier which can be a bit of a clue but
they didn't finish my plaintiff buzzing
oh yeah that's not how it works okay
line so that means it's six all that's
exciting and yr a question would have
been too honestly on the subject of
online streaming and that kind of thing
to the nearest million how much has the
controversial movie the interview made
online any ideas how much money i mean
bothers i think it may lead us I thought
it made something like 15 or 20 million
dollars which everyone held as a massive
success but I don't think actually is i
think that's way less by think it was
440 it was exactly 14 million I there
was a little help from my co-produced
even know he definitely is not mine 42
miles 40 miles between 9 40 mark just do
it again I'm not mad I'm just curious
actually I was a really good mind for 40
well there's a camera on me he held up
his first life is like this shows age
yes or no 0 with his hands I mean so
what else would it turn I just
I was a thought I was elegant so they
interview is Phil it was rented or
purchased online more than 5.8 million
times it made 14 million dollars but
that is obviously a special case because
of you know the year controversy around
it and all that kind of thing okay so
yeah let's move on now on to the
feedback
a beautifully concise edition of the
feedback this week Sylvia Ortega El Faro
says hola buenas tardes hola when I
stutter Sylvia um that's nice does the
end of the end of the message no recibo
porfavor that's just that's getting
special now I do apologize don't serve a
sus um Phillip Thompson says bourbon or
custard creams hmm I got for Custer
kindling I've got screams also i think
custard creams are underrated i think
they're let down by a really really
horrible name cast custer cream uh yeah
no notice of that custody and they both
are good but no there are as good as a
party ring yeah that's true one coming
to the tap room or Phillip Thompson also
says supermarket brand TVs IE technica
and polaroid this is a prop question
okay right is a proper place in the
attention Kevin focus up guys are they
worth it or a waste of money good
question is a really good question she
so and unfortunately doesn't really have
a very easy answer so it depends on the
TV so in years past we've reviewed
technica TVs some are ok yeah some are
less so so obviously this lightly
depends on the actual but the model it's
easy to say go for a bigger brand like
Samsung or LG but but that's okay that
is if that's really easy today that but
I'm put like that it's not I don't think
it's that much more expensive to go for
a recognized brand and their eyes women
with your coasters and yeah exactly my
guys over shall i watch Netflix or
Amazon Prime drinking golden tee out the
doily yeah but Dooley yeah just fine I
don't know what you play people to
adjoin me to put one over my mouth and
have it poured through a doily would be
a useless filter with its big holes I
can't really see properly when my nose
is pressed up against the glass 60 he's
back get rid of every step out yeah
yeah so but there are some good reasons
to go for a bigger brand because
actually you can get you can get a
really good TV for not very much money
these days you don't have to there's
certainly a lot of Smart TV features
that come yes that's the other thing so
like there's it's Samsung or LG would be
kind of that if I was buying a TV that's
a decision I would be making and I'd be
weighing up what the Smart TV features
are of each so and I think I'm not
hundred percent familiar with the Smart
TV features of Polaroid tactical I'm
willing to bet that they are not as that
you don't get as much so as if you care
about smart features which of course I
don't yes but but but I think people do
do though I didn't when I I didn't when
I got my smart TV right now like i'll
use the netflix up everything that's
ever done did for you you've already
probably gone xbox plug a or bugs 360 is
gotten anything yet like but the TV has
it and that's quicker okay so sorry my
conclusion we've come to is the term if
you can afford this you know a sort of
be a brand that's definitely worth it
but as you were saying earlier like is a
TVs and investment you'll have it for
years and years and years it's worth as
well sort of shopping around dutch
