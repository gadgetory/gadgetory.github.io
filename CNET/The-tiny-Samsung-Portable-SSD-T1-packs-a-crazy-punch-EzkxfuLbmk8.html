Samsung portable SSD t1 drive now it's
basically the external mini version of
this Samsung 850 Evo driver i have here
now mini beaker is super small take a
look at this is actually smaller in my
name card right here and external
because it actually worked outside
computer and connect to a computer using
this micro standard USB through finger
port right here the dry is also super
light in fact at one ounce about the
same weight as this included short USB
cable the t1 work with both windows and
mac computer and it support an
description that means you can easily
serve a password to protect the content
a store in case you lose it remember
though if you sell the password and you
forget it you will lose all the data on
its too so that's a very nice feature
but that's not for those who are absent
minded the best thing about this t1
drive here is the performance in testing
is registered the real world speed of
some 160 megabyte per second for writing
and close to 300 megabytes per second
for reading as a facet I've seen among
all purple drives that is non rape the
question is how much well the t1 is
available in three capacity 250 gigabyte
fighter gigabyte and one terabyte that
cost 180 dollars $300 and six hundred
dollars respectively not exactly cheap
but in this case I believe is totally
worth investment to find out more check
out my phone with us cnet com basically
a puff of the pricing the t1 is what any
portable rice should be and that's mean
where I'm holding this I am what any man
should be the thing is sometime I think
so even when tell me nothing that's
because i'm dumb go and this has been
the first look at the samsung porbo SSD
t1 drive this feels good to think that
way you know that's not anybody
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
