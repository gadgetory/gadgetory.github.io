1000 megabits per second Wireless
extender kit from Isaiah now instead of
spending hundreds of dollars on a Wi-Fi
system we can spend just $85 on this kit
here it might just do the same thing
extend Wi-Fi to that far far corner of
your galaxy I'm in your home that's true
and the kid comes in to hardwire units
you take the first unit here which is a
powerline adapter you connect it to your
existing network using one of these two
network ports right here and then plug
it directly into a wall socket and then
you take the second unit here bring it
to the far corner and then plug it into
another world socket and then the magic
happens the two we connect to each other
using the electrical wiring in between
them allowing you to extend your network
further that means you can connect up to
two Y devices to the network using is
two-port here of the second unit and
because this is here also have a
built-in access point you now can also
add many Wi-Fi devices to your network
that's pretty cool No
well not entirely cool because the kid
here is not perfect now first it has
character on key web interface which by
the way doesn't work very well with
Firefox particularly what are these
secondly the performance is much lower
than what the vendor claims now
supposedly the two of them can connect
at 1,000 megabit per second or a gigabit
connection now in testing that topic
says about 250 megabits per second not
super slow but hey gigabit per second
come on as for Wi-Fi you have a three
option you can make this one work as a
dual band access point for both 2.4
gigahertz and 5 gigahertz clients or as
a single ban for range or high
performance but here's the deal doesn't
matter what option you choose in my
testing I got at best hundred megabit
per second when I'm close to it and when
I walked away some 60 feet away it's
it's about 40 megabit per second so if
you want to share the internet that
window but if you want to do something
heavier like local file sharing or
backing up is they're gonna cut it and
finally keep in mind that the kid only
works in home
a single wiring system meaning the
wiring is continuous with no breakers in
between also appliances life with fridge
Raider and ceiling fan whine operation
my adversely affects performance but
then again for $85 is still quite a good
deal so try it out one thing though
just because I'm talking about right now
doesn't mean you should have a high
expectation about so don't and that's
because I'm don't know and this is the
power like something something from his
eyes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
