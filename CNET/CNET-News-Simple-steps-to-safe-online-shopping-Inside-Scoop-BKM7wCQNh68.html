I'm cnet's Cairo tsuboi joined by senior
editor Seth Rosenblatt hi Cara hey Seth
so now that thanksgiving is over in the
holiday shopping season has officially
begun a lot of us will be online
shopping of course yes I understand that
you've got some tips on how to shop
safely online absolutely or at least
more safely sure first tip is with your
passwords change them if you haven't
most people don't change their passwords
regularly enough yeah I recommend
choosing a password that is at least
four random words with spaces in between
I'd never even knew you could have
spaces between your words and your
password it turns out that you can and
what that allows you to do is have a
more secure password that you can
remember more easily computer logic has
a more difficult time discerning what
those spaces are and so you don't really
need all these you know characters like
! sore at marks or whatever just choose
something that's easy to remember and
has spaces in it so there's at least
four words or so good to change
passwords for email bank account
shopping site absolutely another tip VPN
a lot of people will have a work
provided VPN you can use that if you
don't have one of those you can use a
free VPN like hotspot shield or logmein
hamachi and what that does is that
encrypt your network traffic in a tunnel
so that's more secure mmm that's a good
tip and what about when we're browsing
various shopping sites what should we
look for or not look for absolutely two
things I recommend when it comes to
browsing is one used two different
browsers keep your mission critical
information in one browser keep your
shopping in another browser I like to
use Firefox and Chrome for that doesn't
matter which one you use for which as
long as they're separate and the second
tip is to make sure that you have HTTPS
in the URL bar in the location bar and
that you also see a green badge when
you're on a shopping site like Amazon
right just to know it's legit and secure
absolutely and finally when it comes to
payment one method is far better than
another absolutely I prefer using a
credit card for my online payments
because if anything goes wrong I can
always get some redress from the credit
card company right it's not like the
money just are already disappeared from
your bank account absolutely
yeah yeah thank you so much thank you
appreciate the tips Happy Holidays Happy
Holidays this is Seth Rosenblatt I'm car
