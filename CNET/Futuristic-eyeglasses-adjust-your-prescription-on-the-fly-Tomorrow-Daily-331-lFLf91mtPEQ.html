welcome to tomorrow daily at the bestie
talk show in the known universe
I'm Ashley together Jeff kanata is up at
GDC probably checking out the
PlayStation VR event right about now but
for now let's hit some headlights all
right so there is a German developer who
is doing some incredible things with
virtual reality that you have to see
realities IO showed off a stunning demo
of various interior spaces in virtual
reality that utilizes photogrammetry the
technique uses pictures from a digital
camera and in this particular demo a
realities dot IO employee spent a little
time stitching the images together and
cleaning up the finished product
specular lighting software added a great
finishing touch making the rooms come to
life as if you were actually their
realities IO says they want to use this
software mainly for virtual tourism so
that they can give people the chance to
visit and walk around places that were
previously not possible for them to do
so this is a beautiful example of
photogrammetry and honestly I can't wait
to see this used in a horror game
because it's gonna be so realistic but
maybe I'll wait to play that horror game
until day time if you have glasses like
me you might find this next story very
very interesting Israeli company deep
optics is working on some high-tech
glasses that would be considered
OmniFocus they would be able to change
their focus in real time a layer of
liquid crystal resides in the frames and
sensors track the wearer's pupils when
the frames calculate the depth of the
object the wearer's looking at a small
electrical current changes the liquid
crystal effectively adjusting the
wearer's prescription in real time
deep optics says it wants to start human
trials in a couple of years but until
then they're gonna work on making the
technology smaller and smaller so that
they can fit a standard pair of frames
so that's it for our headlines I think
we should talk about deep optics but I
have a feeling Jeff is gonna want to
hear a little bit about the
photogrammetry he's gonna want to talk a
little bit about that so maybe we'll
roll both of them in if you want to get
in on the discussion you can tweet at us
with the hashtag hey TD
and if we like your tweets we will
incorporate them on our Thursday long
show when Jeff comes back that being
said let's check out our phone talker
for the day our phone talk over the day
today is Brennan who took this picture
with his iPhone 6s plus Renaud writes to
us and says my name is Renan and I am
originally from Israel but now live in
San Diego this is from last night with
my iPhone 6s plus on my street in San
Diego and I give you permission to use
it in the show by the way I love the
show and like to watch it with my 10
year old girl she likes your glasses and
how you change your hair thanks Renaud
uh Vernon way to capture a perfect
rainbow in the streets of San Diego
although I think that is one of the
places you can actually get a picture of
a rainbow on a pretty regular basis
because that city sometimes is perfect
that is it for our show today if you
want to send in your phone tog Rafi you
can email us tomorrow at cnet.com gamers
permission tell us a story and also tell
us what device you use take your picture
with of course we are always on the
Internet you can share the show with a
friend
tomorrow daily comm Jeff we'll be back
on Thursday like I said and we will be
deep diving into all the news from this
week but until then be good humans bye
