because the last Jedi is coming on
December 15 the news of the official
title was published on the Star Wars
comm website with no other hint of what
the sequel will be about we have the
greatest fans in this or any other
galaxy the announcement reads in
appreciation of the fans we wanted them
to be the first to know the title of the
next chapter in the Skywalker saga Star
Wars the last Jedi by this time in 2015
Disney had already released a couple of
trailers of the force awakens movie
along with some other sneak peeks so
it's about time what we know beyond the
title is that the movie will pick up
right where the previous left off the
scene where ray finds Luke Skywalker and
hands him his original lightsaber so he
is the last Jedi the title could be
referring to unless there are multiple
because Jedi is vaguely plural or
singular in form and much like The
Return of the Jedi it could be in
reference to the order as a whole what
it does mean for the movie is that we
will be seeing a lot of Mark Hamill
along with the late Carrie Fisher who
returns as general Organa the actress
had already finished filming at the time
of her death which means Lucas Films has
no plans to bring her back in CGI farm
as they did in row 1
the film was directed by Rian Johnson
not JJ Abrams although he will be
executive producer so let the countdown
begin
and for more of your tech news make sure
