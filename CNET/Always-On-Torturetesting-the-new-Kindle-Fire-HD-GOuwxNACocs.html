Kindle Fire HD 7 inch tablet and it's
going through the torture testing or
starting with the cold test two hours in
the freezer
all righty
as a big 7-inch tablet
see ya
time to rescue the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch
from the freezer
lady how are you doing nice and cold the
real trick here is for me to remember
where the power button is someone I
always get wrong I end up doing the drop
test by accident there we go
let's see oh oh no immediate response to
power kind of nothing happened in here
so far so we will let it thaw for a
little while and charge maybe the
battery died in there we know that can
happen and see if it recovers Kindle
Fire HD gave us a little bit of a scare
but after I thought it and charged it
for just a few minutes a little less
than five minutes it came back on I
think though that it just didn't like
the cold because it is not all the way
to at the bottom of a charge and I only
charged it for maybe three minutes think
it just want it to be warm but it's okay
it up a little bit here
my Kindle Fire is done I definitely have
some plastic smell here is hot
the smell of burning components this
show is gonna kill me I would think I
could sue somebody but it was all my
idea
okay let's see here we have no obvious
damage so unlike some of our recent
gadgets well it looks like it is pulling
away a tiny bit so we do have a little
bit of separation at the seams here from
that heat it's not very dramatic but it
is there just on that one side
especially compared to this side you can
see it looks a little bit different who
comes on oh you know it changed it to my
good idea I will let this cool for a
little bit see how it's doing the Kindle
Fire HD is all cooled off let's see how
it's feeling it looks like it actually
shut itself all the way down after I
tried to turn it on while it was still
really hot
ah okay back to life seems to be okay
Kindle seems to be okay it's okay all
right
I'm just gonna head outside and do a
little reading I've got my hands kind of
falling Oh Oh Kindle hand cramp too big
to hold though let's see how we're doing
here I might as well scrape it along the
pavement when I pick it up - just to add
insult to injury actually though this
thing is in good shape I don't really
see any scratches or anything major on
the back the front is fine a little
scuffing here some kind of Nick's but I
gotta say that that's not major damage
it's pretty tough maybe we should just
try the concrete so heavy it's really
dramatic
although once again even despite some
skidding we do have a little bit more
scratch egde on the back here
scratch Ã¤j-- that's an official
always-on term one more Nick but overall
I gotta say this thing is pretty tough
I'm surprised it's still fine after the
drop do I need some cookie
oh no oh what a mess that's terrible
what am I gonna do I know I have an idea
there's stuff Oh
it's gonna be okay Kindle okay it's
clean
phew probably stri this off a little now
I guess oh wait the back still has some
soda on it okay all better
oh my screen still on let's see here
oh look at that
Oh
the cookies ruined but the Kindle seems
okay I'll give it the rice treatment
just in case time to check on our Kindle
Fire HD it's been in this bag of rice
for 36 hours since we spilled soda on it
and hosed it down that was a fun day
let's see how it's doing though okay
moment of truth ah it comes right on I
mean it came right on wow screen seems
totally fine
carousel moving books gone still pretty
responsive huh alright I'm gonna have to
call that one a pass now the Kindle Fire
HD sailed through our regular battery of
torture tests but we just couldn't come
up with the perfect wild-card idea so
please email me some ideas always on @c
Netcom and we will revisit this at a
later date in the meantime maybe I'll
use it try to get used to holding it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
