got a new TV and this time gonna do it
right I'm gonna wall mount my television
instead of having it sitting on a you
know console so I bought this one on
Amazon it's the cheetah flush tilt wall
mount $30 rave reviews it sounds like a
good deal I've got the wall knob that's
gonna go on the wall and then I've got
the brackets if you're gonna go on the
back of my TV and attach to the mount
alright so the first thing I got to do
is find the studs in my wall I hope they
exist to locate them I'm going to use
the stud finder this is a magnetic stud
finder which is convenient because it's
no batteries to replace studs are
typically around 16 to 24 inches apart
all right line them up with the stud
marks I made on the wall looks pretty
good now we're attaching the right size
drill bit for our screws here goes
now we're going to put the frame up on
the wall and use the bolts to actually
get that thing into the studs hopefully
nice and secure
so now I've got all my bolts in is
looking pretty good I'm double-checking
against that level the bubbles right in
the center all right now this thing's
rated to hold 165 pounds that means I
should be confident enough to give this
thing a tug I feel like it's not going
to come right out of the wall now for
the next step we're gonna want to put
the braces on the back of the TV before
we do that though I'm gonna need to take
the band off the bottom here give it a
new life as a wall-mounted TV you're
free so here are the two braces here
where they're gonna go the main thing
you want to be able to do is be able to
conceal the braces behind the TV so if
you have a smaller TV and these are
poking out the top you have some wiggle
room here to get the right fit
solid it's still solid confident so the
idea is that these hooks on the back on
the braces are gonna hook right over the
lip and hang down from there and that
can use a little security screws to
really lock it into place down below
time let's put this sucker up on the
wall oh yeah here we go let's check it
out on the back the hooks over the frame
now the cool thing is that this can
slide on the track so I can scoot it
over if I want to get the perfect
placement it's on we're almost done last
thing I want make sure it's right that
Center and then I'm gonna screw in the
security bolts and lock it in place
beautiful it's on the wall looks like an
art piece
all right I am considering this a
success everything looks great let's
play some video nice all right
now the kid assembled really easily it
only cost me 30 bucks and I did it all
by myself
