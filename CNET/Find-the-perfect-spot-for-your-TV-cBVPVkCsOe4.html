home theater the first thing you want to
do is find the optimal position for your
TV since all the other components will
surround it first let's talk about
distance this number or formula has
changed over the years as we've gone
from standard of TV's to high def wide
screens see back in the olden days you
wanted to sit pretty far away from your
screen so that you wouldn't notice how
bad the picture was but now we've got
content in 720 and 1080 P which means we
can get bigger screens and sit a lot
closer lots of manufacturers recommend
that you take the diagonal size of your
screen and multiply it by two and a half
to get the distance and inches you
should sit from your screen well at cnet
we say that even with big screens the
closer you sit the better so take your
screen size and multiply it by one and a
half and that's the distance in inches
you should sit from your TV so for
example a 40 inch screen x 1.5 gives you
60 inches or 5 feet sitting that close
will give you a more immersive
experience and you'll be able to
appreciate all those crisp HD pixels
then comes height there are a lot of
opinions here but the bottom line is
that the TV shouldn't be so high that
you're craning your neck or so low that
you're looking down at it a good
starting point is to position the center
of the TV at about eye level most times
that means placing your TV on a
relatively low stand but if you're
hell-bent on placing it above something
like a fireplace then go with an
articulating mount which will allow you
to tilt the TV down toward you and
finally placement the biggest takeaway
here is that you shouldn't place your GV
opposite of any bright light sources not
only will it ruin the appearance of
whatever you're watching but it'll also
give you ice train now lights can be
turned off but if you have any windows
you can
would consider getting blackout curtains
now you've got a real home theater so
that's your basic setup but remember
none of these tips are hard and fast
rules so go ahead and play around with
them and remember that really the best
setup is the one that's most comfortable
