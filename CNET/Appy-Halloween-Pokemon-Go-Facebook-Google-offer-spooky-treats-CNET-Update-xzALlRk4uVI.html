Halloween there are plenty of apps to
get you in the spooky spirit Facebook is
mimicking snapchat lenses and it added
digital masks to its live video
broadcast tool but you'll only be able
to find it on the iphone facebook app

for some reason not everyone has the
feature it's superimposes silly and
scary characters on your face facebook
hopes this is going to encourage more
people to engage in its live broadcast
tool the masks will eventually be coming
to the android facebook app in the
coming months in the meantime there are
stranger things to discover in google's
a low messenger app and by stranger
things I mean the popular Netflix show

upside down the Google a low app now has
stickers which show references if you're
brave enough to go out tonight and face
the demo Gorgon fire up the Pokemon Go
app for a special halloween-themed game

and players can earn more candy during
this special event which runs until
November first not only does each
Pokemon come with six candies but the
professor will also give you an extra
candy for trade ins and if you're
staying inside answer the door for
trick-or-treaters with a creepy creaky
door sound effect app wd-40 the brand
that keeps those hinges oiled and squeak
free has launched the haunted door app
as a funny marketing stunt Google is
having a little fun this halloween by
turning it's google doodle into a game
with a little black cat named momo that
needs your help to stop the scary
spirits from invading her magic school
you score points by vanquishing the
ghouls from five different levels of the
school perhaps the real scary part is
when you realize you spent too much time
at work playing a pointless doodle game
