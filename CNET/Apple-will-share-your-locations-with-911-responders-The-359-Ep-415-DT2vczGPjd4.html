Ben Fox ribbon making a 9-1-1 call on
your iPhone Apple will automatically
share your location with emergency
responders and this is a case where you
don't actually mind that Apple is
sharing your information it's also
throwing a bone to authorities after the
company last week said that would close
a loophole that had allowed law
enforcement to hack into your iPhone so
it's Apple you know take it away giving
now I think that's your opinion that you
won't mind having the location shared
especially with everything that's been
going on this year with Cambridge
analytic and Facebook I feel like people
would even look at something like this
skeptically where even if you're in an
emergency how would this be used against
me how could this be hacked what's Apple
doing with this information and I think
Apple tends to have a better reputation
yeah it comes to security and privacy
and even that kind of shows what 2018
has turned into as far as like being
really attentive to privacy from a
consumer perspective to be fair Apple
has been doing this since 2015 in some
format what they're doing with this iOS
12 update is really bringing across the
board and adding a new technology that
allows for the iPhone to securely share
your location data so you know it in
Apple's can in Apple's defense it seems
like they're working to well share your
information do it in a way that's secure
yeah and as far as like sharing your
private information in your location
this to me seems like a much more useful
thing like I'm in an emergency and
emergency responders need to know where
I am
that's much more relevant in my mind to
I don't know what Foursquare you would
do or that's warm or whatever those
things are where it's just sharing your
location right for the hello good all
right next up JPEG turns 25 this year oh
my god happy birthday way to go Jake for
your present you will likely get pushed
off as a successor comes in to take your
place there are a number of different
formats
Aseema Shanklin profile JPEG Excel this
is a format that promises it to be what
50 to 60 percent more efficient
basically on file size by 60% 80% which
means that it will
prove your cloud storage you'll have
more data space on your phone I didn't
think I cared about JPEGs until I read
Stevens story so you should check it out
well look I think everyone who runs in a
situation where their phone runs out of
space because they've got all these
photos jammed into them is gonna want to
relate to this this basically doubles
the capacity of your phone for the same
quality of photos right now it's not all
just pure benefit unfortunately there's
gonna be a lot of confusion I think
Apple Google Microsoft Mozilla a bunch
of other companies are working on rival
standards beyond JPEG Excel there's
there's one there's a offshoot of the
high format that Apple has already put
into their iPhones there's another one
by Mozilla there's just there are tons
of different ones that really can cause
some confusion if if folks don't
actually support all these different
format yeah and and it's a good point
that JPEGs do need an overhaul they're
25 years old I mean what sort of other
than the headphone jack what sort of
technology ends up living that long but
at the same time I think consumers
really hate standards Wars oh yeah
all right last week's merger of 18 T
Time Warner have net neutrality
proponents freaking out obviously came a
few days after the net neutrality rules
came off the books so a lot of folks are
a lot or concerned about what a company
with his combined power can do let's
talk about zero rating yeah tell me tell
me a little bit about that and with the
time we have there already is a practice
of offering you a service without it
eating into your data plan and so that
sounds great on surface but if you're a
company like 18t you've got a service
called DIRECTV now and you push that as
a data free product it doesn't hurt your
data plan at all you're more likely to
use that then say Netflix or YouTube
which does eat into your data count so
the concern there is that because ATT
and unfair competition or unfair
advantage we're some of those other
services and in particular smaller
no-name services that are just getting
started right so again this is the idea
everything has to be treated equally and
in this case 18 T isn't and so it's
interesting to note the FCC under the
Obama administration actually looked at
this practice and really raised some
flags about it but once the the new FCC
administration under Trump came in with
I is chairman they basically did away
with that investigation thank you for
that info all right for these stories
check us out at CNM Roger Cheng I'm Ben
Fox ribbon thanks for listening I really
try to cram in a lot there you know a
lot about zero rating I think we were
like 30 seconds over get to my I didn't
even get to my complaint about the fact
that I don't actually think that on the
surface yeah that's a consumer benefit
absolutely totally appreciate the idea
that smaller services might be it might
be a little bit more competitive or a
little more difficult for them to break
in yep that was gonna be difficult to
begin with because they have to go up
yes you've got a another hurdle that
that's thrown it it's because of the
fact that it's 18 T's and Verizon's of
the world have so much power they own 10
plus the pipes connecting you yeah but
like what's what's next where you're
gonna tell Amazon to stop offering
different Prime perks like that that's
that's a good enough service stop doing
it you being too good to your customers
that's unfortunate
well if I think yes if it doesn't no way
that they take the vent of your power to
put other companies trying to offer
similar services at a disadvantage
mm-hmm because of the infrastructure you
know I think the conversation would
change if it owned the post office right
oh well wait until later this year Jeff
Bezos has a lot of money this true well
he is promising to to give it all away
maybe the idea of charity is to buy the
post office you know what not the crazy
thing bales free everybody that uh that
that could maybe have it
no absolutely not anyway we should get
to questions yeah I would also love to
hear from the chat as far as this Apple
911 service does this is this something
that you would use are you
excited about it does it give you pause
I'd love to hear people's opinions about
it because did my privacy issue but I
don't think it's something you could
switch off I think this is like no
choice you're like automatically
interesting so it's not like I don't
think there's a I'm not an optin thing
yeah yeah yeah I want to know if that
was something to Apple opted to do and
offer as a feature if you will or was
that something that the government kind
of got involved in and would like where
did the source from hmm that's a great
question we don't know I don't no idea I
know they started offering it three
years ago I just don't know if it was
done at the behest of loss of law
enforcement or if it was done as a
feature that Apple is promoting I know
there's certainly gonna be people who
are just in general opposed to the idea
of location sharing at large I think
this is one of the instances where there
is a positive outlook to it we do have
to be careful of course because having
an information available everything can
be abused and we are terrible species I
just said it before I'll say it again I
want that put on the t-shirt and I don't
know I think that there's a lot of
potential here but there is some
confusion in the chat about exactly what
this means I'm Matthew dad sure ask
wasn't sharing location and issue with
911 for a while now yeah I think that
was what an issue is in there was some
debate over it whether the sharing
location location sharing yes right I
you know what I I be honest I don't know
enough about I mean I know even what
inai one one is I didn't know that there
was a debate over location sharing I
thought that was one of the primary
features that needed to be put into
e-911 is the ability to share location
because cell towers aren't always
accurate and it's not as reliable as say
calling from a landline in which they
can pinpoint your location exactly but
that was the point of e 9-1-1 is to make
9-1-1 calls on your cell phone as
location-based as interesting we have
some really well-thought-out comments
here from Ned 669 I'm not sure if I've
seen you before in the chat sir do you
guys recognize them no I've never heard
of Ned
so if you're a newbie welcome it's great
to have you welcome fantastic comments
here he says I think this is a good
thing for safety it makes me wonder how
they'll know something is wrong without
already listening I think that YouTube
should branch into a security service
people could live stream to secure
servers that could also be connected to
first responders and trained moderate
and trained moderates watching these
moderators could be AI the video can be
extremely helpful with doctors and
problem-solving if they saw what was
happening as it unfolded kind of thing
like a gunshot wound to the who knows
where that's that's me riffing here with
training AI may be able to spot problems
most illnesses have some form of
external indicators weather change in
habits or visual indicators like color
for example this is incredibly well
thought out and I yeah we all just lost
our job to Ned Wow well I don't know
that anybody thinks of YouTube in that
way and I also I do like that I think
it'll izing AI to to recognize that I
automatically recognize certain
scenarios or certain medical issues yeah
I don't know if they probably do with
with the Amazon echo look they brought
up the idea that if you're gonna have a
camera that has certain AI functionality
and this one was to tell you whether
your outfit looked good or not you know
versus one of the other and people
started to freak out about that and they
said eventually this is going to be able
to tell if you're gonna have if you have
skin cancer or tell if you are depressed
or certain visual cues on your face
there were all these different types of
concepts that were being thrown out
there that weren't embedded into the
technology that we're not actually being
used so it goes back to the privacy
issue yeah we'd say yeah there's
definitely gonna be this constant push
and pull between what it can do and what
we're actually comfortable with right
and whether it does it automatically
like every single time you point a
camera at somebody or they notice that
uh-oh like Ben didn't eat his breakfast
this morning yeah I don't know if you do
want to get this just been disappointed
in you yeah that is that is too bad but
anyway Ned I'm gonna gives you a granola
bar I'll be right back Thank You Ned
thank you very much for the comment yeah
very interesting yeah definitely
well-thought-out really impressed thank
you
I think this is about the the 911 one
feature but I'm not entirely certain
since 911 one specifically implies the
american-based emergency service
although other nations have their own
different version of it's right dense
don't asks how many countries will this
feature be available and what will the
process time be this is just the US and
it's when iOS
12 gets released which is later this
year yeah usually in the fall yeah it
aligned with the new iPhone so yeah
definitely in the in the US we don't
know what happened I mean there are as
you mentioned as correctly mentioned
there are multiple thank you it's very
important there are multiple different
kinds of emergency services 9-1-1 so
right now I think it's just yeah
I think so don't ever leave service
Roger look if it if it saves like one
life hey then Apple Apple should I don't
know bring it to more countries and
there's no reason why they wouldn't
what would the u.s. just be like the
testing grounds for this as of as of yet
I don't know honest I don't know it's
just I know it's been integrated into
the system here in the US and I don't
know what apples I imagine they do
similar things in other countries but
it's just I'm not sure yeah the
announcement today was more US specific
but and definitely appreciate the
question we'll try to look into what
other global things there are like what
how it impacts globally and we'll have
much sharper answers now that Brian
through some food at us as always I love
it when we actually have like kind of
good news something that's actually
forward-thinking instead of just another
stupid app so for sure my perspective
from oh wait hold on a second actually I
wanted to talk a little bit about this
compression format because there are so
friggin many out there that are trying
to come down the pipeline this just
reminds me of a CH D DVD versus blu-ray
yeah the same kind of showdown here oh
yeah III can imagine we have got a bunch
of companies large companies all with
the vested interest in making sure like
that next standard is their standard and
so definitely why like why do they care
whether it's going to be JPEG Excel or a
F avi F or whatever there are a number
of reasons the techno the underlying
technology may work better with what
their systems handle you know they may
have vested interest because they've got
patents related to it there's one
there's at least one that's got
licensing revenue attached to it and so
there's there's definitely monetary
motive there so they're just a number
these factors it's yeah I think it's
gonna get pretty messy fortunately in
the meantime we do have JPEG to kind of
give us this universal standard but it
could be a little weird we're always
seeing some weirdness now with that htif
standard have a pollution on their
iPhones
and so they're they're not 100% edible
with other devices right they had like
they have to get formatted into into
like avi or in peg or unpack I believe
for it to work elsewhere so it's just
gonna be bumpy for a while yeah yeah
it's a transition but I feel like the
the end result is totally worth it like
having more space or having a more of
space-efficient format is really the
ultimate goal for a lot of these formats
I take so many more photos now that I
have a smartphone and it's not like I
just got a smartphone that's been going
on for years and you just end up with
like thousands and thousands of photos
yeah so there needs to be some sort of
solution where it does get properly
compressed I mean like having an Android
makes it easier it all gets pushed over
to Google Photos right with unlimited
storage but when I did have an iPhone
there was always that push and pull of
trying to I use Google photos to have an
iPhone and it pushes the Google photos
standard storage area for photos because
I can think of when searches on it it's
a lot more convenient to use them
Apple photos yeah Roger speak up the
mics losing you
sorry stop whispering it Ben you're on
her show yeah
voices starting to give out I'm trying
to push it for the last few minutes here
all right we are almost out of time sir
enjoy ask isn't PNG already trying too
hard to replace jpg how's that working
out for him oops sorry
PNG PNG ng has been around for a couple
years and it does crop up in my life
every now and then I can't say that I
know now who's behind PNG but I can't I
also don't believe that it's as new as
some of these other standards that are
yeah totally totally these standards are
coming out or like not even in they're
not playlet you can't use them yet so
PNG has been around for a while I don't
think even our systems I keep having to
reformat ng so sorry
no PNG missed you missed the boat man
I mean PNG preserves alpha channel so I
use it a lot here when we're doing
graphic work I don't even know what that
means
what does that mean that a good
transparency oh okay okay so well
transparency is one of the things that
some of these new formats are dealing
with as well so there uses blockchain
that's what you're telling me as well is
that the new Bitcoin it is yes that's as
PNG is Bitcoin base yeah which is why
it's so good
APEC is asking the question that's on
everybody's mind what will happen when
there is want more than one compression
protocol and the phones don't support it
are we gonna get into the same
proprietary BS that we see with a lot of
other different electronic formats and
different platforms these days yeah I
mean that I really possible that is the
big concern is I think that you know
Google well the Android could push one
format Apple will push another one
sending emails to each other with or
sending photo attached to each other
might might make for a mess part of me
thinks that they'll they'll figure out
like workarounds like though though
they'll convert the formats or whatever
so they're they're available or they're
accessible to everyone but it is gonna
be like I said it's gonna be messy and
it's gonna be kind of I don't clunky for
a while until they figure out like
everyone agrees to one universal
standard right and more than likely if
you're an Apple person and you're solely
in the Apple universe and you don't have
any Google or Android friends then you
might not notice because Andrew
friends that's just kind of sad like you
should make more friends I guess I don't
know sure
and is that why you never call cuz I'm
an angry text messages to you so true
you know but are they angry in the
professional context or a personal
context both yeah yeah Raj is really
good with uh with with layering his
anger we are really getting into some
deep deep cuts here that's right David
shirts what about gif when are they
going to update that and yes I said gif
you know what I wish anklet was here I
don't know it's around for a while gifs
will be around for a while anyway
Jeff will be here for a while I just
don't know cuz Shanklin is our real
expert here and if he was on we would
totally ask him in fact the next time
he's visiting New York we'll have a want
to show to specifically talk about Jeb
like different like photo standards and
also ask him whatever questions you want
on input/output and really anything he
knows everything actually he does know
everything but I've always been really
impressed with his knowledge on
input/output like he will tell you the
entire history of you know like like the
Lightning jack or USB type-c and like
where it came from so that's true we
would we would love to have him on the
show and thank you very much for the
questions unfortunately yeah like he's
neither qualified to use very much the
expert when it comes to that all right
yeah
gif area I send a get send you a Jeff of
Mario how do you feel about that I I'm
not the one who mispronounced is Mario
right that's him alright yeah if there
are any question like so on the net
neutrality side Roger is the expert on
that so we can we can get real sorry any
net neutrality or 18 T Time Warner
questions or Comcast Disney both bidding
on Fox sorry is that sorry at her that's
better because I figured out how to make
make radio or many TV whatever the hell
this is
I miss the headphones I don't really
know how I sound now yeah yeah yeah that
was the problem
all right do we have more questions or
yeah oh my god oh that I think that's
pretty much it
alright we're gonna wrap it up for the
day I don't I don't I don't want to talk
about AT&amp;amp;T anymore I'm tired of him all
right
that's there sir will you talk about net
neutrality a lot last week really the
last few months and so we can take a
break it's gonna come up again
unfortunately will sorry Brian yeah
Brian well there's still more Nunda
Charlie needs to come you know good news
if you're not Natale supporter or bad
news if you're against net neutrality so
but there is definitely more to come
later this week we'll definitely talk
about on the podcast cool all right you
want me to do it do it go for it man
3:59 is available on iTunes tune in
stitch our feedburner google play music
