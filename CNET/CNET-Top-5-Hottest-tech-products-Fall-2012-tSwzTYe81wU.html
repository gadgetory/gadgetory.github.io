big names in tech to show us something
exciting to put on our holiday wish list
fall is always the busiest time around
here at cnet but 2012 is really outdone
itself there are so many great products
rolling through the doors these days I'm
having a hard time keeping track of it
all so I made a list here are the top 5
products with the highest traffic on
cnet that were added in September or
october a 2012 starting off at number 5
the sony vaio tap 20 the 20 inch
all-in-one Windows 8 PC that doubles as
a giant tablet seriously it's a whole
new concept for the home computer is
nine hundred ninety nine dollars it's
really kind of freaky you guys want to
know all about it I think I like you
guys at number for the samsung galaxy s3
mini that's right it's the mini version
of seen its highest rated android phone
sorta you get a smaller four-inch screen
with a lower resolution and what seems
like a step down in performance pretty
much across the board kind of sounds
like the diet coke of android phones to
me but i can't blame me for being
curious another windows machine comes in
at number three the toshiba portege zine
ein 35 p300 it's vaio tap 20 is your
exotic fling the portege is the marrying
type it's a straight-up ultrabook
running windows 7 is thin it's light
it's fast and surround eight hundred
fifty dollars I mean admit it wasn't
really gonna work out between you and
that giant tablet thing alright at
number two the apple ipad mini you know
the ipad that looks like it was left in
the dryer too long this is apple's
answered all those cheap 7-inch tablets
that have been getting a lot of
attention the only problem is it's three
hundred and twenty-nine dollars I'm sure
Apple sell a ton of these but I have to
think some of you guys are coming to
this review just to figure out what the
heck Apple was smoking now before we get
to number one let's take a look back at
the top five products for fall 2011 man
guys we're really crazy about your
phones back then and you still are
because the most popular new product for
september-october by a huge lead is the
apple iphone 5 remember how bummed out
you were about the iphone 4s last year
well the iphone 5 is benefit
from two years worth of pent-up longing
for a truly new iphone with a bigger
screen and 4g well now you have it and
it's all you guys want to read about so
there you go that's the fall tech
