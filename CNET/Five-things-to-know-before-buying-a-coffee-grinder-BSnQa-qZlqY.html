and with a quality bird grinder happens
to be the most effective and simplest
ways to improve what eventually lands in
your cup here are five things to keep in
mind before you buy a burr grinder first
the price what's your budget how much
can you spend you can spend as little as
$50 on a machine that's probably not
worth the price or you can spend as much
as $2,000 on a fancy machine that is
commercial-grade you're probably going
to end up spending about a hundred to
two hundred dollars that seems to be
pretty much a sweet spot for getting a
very good quality machine that is made
for home duty next is features how
complicated you want this thing to be
you want it to be something that is
gonna have a ton of different options
different settings different modes some
machines are just as basic as it gets
and just does one thing where others
have lots of ways to measure the coffee
time it etc next consider how course you
want this grinder to be able to grind
your coffee some grinders have ten to
fifteen coarseness levels while others
have as many as forty or even 200 scale
some coffee grinders have a scale built
right into it that way you know exactly
how much grinds you're going to use when
you brew whereas others don't they use a
timer or something like that you're
gonna have to really just use a scale by
yourself and that's an extra step it
might be a pain and finally controls how
simple you want these controls to be
some grinders are extremely simple to
operate they just have a on and off
switch and that's enough for a lot of
people some people want to have controls
over how much it's going to grind when
they press the button what the weight is
gonna be and that might be too confusing
or it might be exactly what you want
because you won't have as much control
as possible keep these things in mind
when you buy your grinder and you'll be
well on your way to that perfect cup of
coffee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
