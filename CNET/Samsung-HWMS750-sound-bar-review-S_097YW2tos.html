bar which tries to bridge the gap
between the company's high-end dolby
atmos speakers and it's more affordable
models however it doesn't quite get
there while the connectivity options are
pleasing it just doesn't offer sound
quality which justifies the price for
example the speaker has up firing
drivers that don't actually do Dolby
Atmos also the speaker sorely needs a
sub and there is an attractive 400
dollar model available but the setup
process is a lot harder than any other
competitive sub the sambar is dressed in
gunmetal and looks very similar to the
high-end canine 50 speaker it has a very
small display though and it's kind of
hard to read especially off access the
sound bar is 45 inches wide which means
it's particularly suited to 50 inch
televisions the MS 750 offers a good
degree of conductivity including two
HDMI ports optical bluetooth and Wi-Fi
the speaker offers the company's very
decent multi-room system for connecting
to other Samsung devices as well as
offering Spotify connect the Samsung
sounds fine with a very forward
signature as it lacks an onboard sub it
can sound a little thin especially with
music or action movies experimenting
with the different modes doesn't really
help and the movies mode isn't as
enveloping as competitors can muster the
Samsung hwm s 750 is OK HDMI switching
and multi room music help elevate it
from some of the other options but
son√≠s Bose and Sony all offer better
sound for the same money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
