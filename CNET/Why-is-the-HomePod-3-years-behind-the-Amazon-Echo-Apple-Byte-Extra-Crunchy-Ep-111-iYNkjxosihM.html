you it's not Thanksgiving yet but we are
recording this for a future episode
which will be which we're gonna post on
Friday oh we have to post on Friday yeah
we have to post on Friday so this is the
apple pie extra crunchy with your host
mr. Brian Tom keeping it extra Munchie
hopefully your tummies are full of
Thanksgiving turkey cranberry sauce and
all that good stuff but thanks so much
for joining us it's episode believe it
or not beach 110 oh that's kind of cool
it's actually 1 11 111 sori you're right
it is 111 I looked at the wrong number
I'm sorry I would be if you haven't
realized that everything I say is
literally like there's someone on the
side here hand typing things and then I
just say what they say I know episode
111 thanks so much for joining us this
is kind of our complimentary piece to
the Apple byte main show and again tons
of news drop so we kind of update you
with the latest also gives us a little
more time to talk and freestyle about
what is happening in the big stories the
thing is also you guys and gals are a
part of this show every week you keep on
bringing it for us so call us at
1-800-695-1418
mirrorless cameras ever made now um if
you ever played at the a7 this is
amazing
number nine check it out Apple watch
three LTE I'm you know that we've talked
about how it kind of really it's finally
a product worth getting that I can
wholeheartedly be behind because of its
evolution I love that number eight Xbox
one x 4k gaming the most powerful
console right now on the market but it's
not really being utilized because
developers have to get to it
number seven Amazon echo second
generation very cool kind of revamped in
more miniaturized number six the Super
Nintendo Entertainment System the SNES
classic that most people did not get
yeah did not get one that I could care
less could care less number five the
Samsung Galaxy s8 people are gonna
debate that one number four the DJI
spark they're palm-sized drone from the
Masters of drones DJI number three the
Microsoft Surface laptop Wow the hybrid
not a laptop not a notebook just a
little bit of everything love it the
number two what we all talk about here
every week the iPhone X or you know the
iPhone 10 tan-tan-tan-tan iPhone 10 made
it for number two and number one the
number one gadget according to time and
whatever how much relevance you put
behind time that's up to you the
Nintendo switch was the number one
gadget of the year hmm that's pretty
clear the only reason why I I kind of I
don't know if it's number one but I
think it's a top three the Nintendo
switches because although we've had the
PS Vita and the DS before this is like
at least quote unquote console level
gaming that's portable and the fact that
they have two ridiculous games this year
with Mario Odyssey and a Zelda it's
breath a wild I mean that it does
legitimize the fact I still think a
phone is gonna be a better gadget than a
game console yeah it's good yeah a lot
more uses with the phone definitely
Apple 10 yeah yeah totally but I've been
asking for my wife with a Nintendo
switch like is that you need that broke
so those are the top 10 best gadgets of
the year
one of them on that list was the Amazon
echo and who is chasing the echo right
now it's Apple Apple is chasing the echo
with the home pot now recently I know
you all probably heard or saw about the
home pod delay right do you remember
that yeah that's a big dropped I think
on Friday after our show and basically
Apple gave us the spiel that it's not
ready yet we want to give the best
product to our customers so we're gonna
hold it back until early March I did a
whole kind of eight minute rant about it
just to talk about the home pod Wyatt
why it's really a misstep we had the air
pods that were delayed last year for the
holiday season they came out really more
like December 13th but by the time they
were released they sold out they were on
a six-week waiting list if you ordered
them from Apple until July of this rear
so it was based on a waiting list for
seven seven months six seven months so
now they're doing the same thing right
they have this hey we're gonna have this
new holiday product out it's gonna be
the home pod but they're pushing it back
as well you can kind of see all the
things I said about it in our Apple bite
episode but it's not a good look for
Apple and they've done this two years
back-to-back and yeah it's a bad apple
it's a bad apple so then our buddies at
Bloomberg Mark Garmin the man right he
decided to kind of give it this whole
backstory of really why is Apple's home
pod three years behind the Amazon echo
and I think from day one we have always
talked about oh people say what is
Apple's next thing the Amazon echo is
the next thing right it's the it has
been the newest hottest consumer
platform and it's been that for at least
the past sure three years ago it wasn't
as understood but now I'd say going
strong for at least two years Google has
there a Google home product both of
these are stellar in different ways both
these do things that guess what the
whole pods not going to be able to do so
I'm gonna kind of paraphrase you can
check out this great article of some of
the things that happen with the home pot
so this is kind of where it starts Apple
had been working with their audio
engineers who wanted to create kind of a
superior audio device but they had five
years ago quite honestly
but they had been working on an early
version of the home pod speaker for
about two years in 2014 when they were
literally blindsided by the echo smart
speaker from Amazon the Apple engineers
even jokingly accused each other of
leaking the details to Amazon because it
was like how how could it be doing this
so they bought echoes to take them apart
right this is what other companies used
to do for Apple they buy their product
take it apart to see how they're put
together and what what Apple did in
classic Apple style they're like oh the
audio quality is totally inferior we're
gonna make a better speaker because at
the time Apple's focus was let's make an
amazing speaker that sounds better than
anything Sonos bose monster all these
companies they wanted to make again kind
of their own high-end speaker look if
you're a fan of audio and if you work
for a company that will let you pursue
these side projects I'm happy to hear
that they were able to pursue this but
here's the thing where they missed right
it says in more than two years had
passed right the echo took off became a
hit with customers integrated the voice
integrated new apps the accessibility to
it it made it a killer product like I
still use my echo today I used it first
I bought it first I have a home just to
kind of use it as comparison but the
echo is the center of my smart home
ecosystem and this is really where
things fell off because think about this
Apple had all the ingredients for to
make an echo like product they had Siri
like the first consumer assistant before
anyone else really did right I mean we
talked about how sir you were like oh my
gosh it's so cool right Siri is the
first first robot assistant I ever spoke
to and I was excited it was like it was
it was a future it felt like the future
I was telling my phone is set alarms you
know timers what's the weather like all
this kind of stuff and and now I'm
talking to alexa way more you know
unless you know my phone's right next to
me or something but yeah Alexa has
definitely come and taken over my house
you know
I'll use Siri to set like basic alarms
or timers but when I'm in the kitchen
you know I'm playing music through the
echo I'm asking it to set timers when
I'm cooking I'm turning on the lights
and off it's become in my brain the
assistant that I talk to and again Apple
had Siri Apple's at the app store they
could have tied all these things
together but they were focused because
you know I'm sure guess what there was
no vision for it they didn't know what
other people were thinking normally they
set the bar for what people are thinking
about so they never had someone say
let's make a smart speaker Amazon was
doing that right and again let's reflect
that Amazon didn't have at the time a
heritage or a history of being a
consumer electronics device sure they
have the tablet and the Amazon phone
they played with that at the fire
products they aren't runaway successes
but they used what they had they learned
from it they came up with the echo right
this is a company that's really an
e-commerce company at its core yeah and
they came out with the echo before Apple
well the thing that thing that's also
really great about the echo is that they
made it affordable it was like a hundred
dollars not three hundred and fifty
dollars like the echo dot is $50 or $40
now they're just making an affordable
and easy for people to get and set up
and use and you know the home pod feels
out of reach for me it's $350 that is
that is a lot of money you know that's
not that's not just like a $50 you know
you know that's that is a big investment
for something that who knew who knows
how long it's gonna last on your shelf
you know
so here's also you're absolutely right
and here's also kind of some of the
thinking that's detailed in the article
again the home pod was cooked up as a
side project for audio engineers that
worked inside of Apple alright they were
the Mac audio engineers they wanted to
create a speaker better than bose better
than JBL better than Harman Kardon and
others and that's that sounds great that
sounds wonderful you know like I'm all
for that but they totally missed the
boat on the AI personal assistant you
know and they had the lead by years it
wasn't even like oh they had a six-month
lead they had a one-year lead they had
the lead by years so this is the thing
they were so look they were looking at
this so much like an actual speaker they
even talked about how you know they want
as they were building this speaker they
didn't want it to be a direct sound
speaker their their strategy was
we use this kind of anticipated
technology at the time called
beamforming and basically a direct sound
in different areas of the room in
different ways by detecting where it's
at and then helps kind of create this 3d
sound that's what they were doing right
so again
guess who has this the Amazon echo uses
a little differently they use it they
use beamforming to listen to us talk to
it but things like the Google home max
that is expected to come out by the end
of this year so Knossos speaker smart
speaker that has Alexa integration is
also doing that as well using
beamforming
but now let's look right now at what
Apple has in the home pod and how it
stacks up apples home pod has access
natively to one service Apple music
apples home pod also does have not have
will not have at least out of the gates
any type of third-party support so for
example if you ever have fiddled with
Amazon's echo and you want to find
something I've talked about this before
I like to listen to like white noise
when I sleep like the sound of waves
crashing there's apps you can just look
on the Amazon echo app and be like uh
whites noise or waves crashing and
there's one called like smooth ocean
sounds or something like that I use that
every night you do I used to use an iPad
so I would I'd open up the iPad and I
turn on white noise and then play like
waves crashing yeah but now that was a
process I had to go to my iPad push a
button find the app turn it on find the
sound now I just go Alexa start ocean
sounds and then it's exactly you know
it's like like 10 times easier so so I'm
sorry I don't use my iPad I actually
deleted the sound effect off my iPad the
other day I don't need it anymore
yeah and so you have all these
third-party apps thousands of apps that
Amazon made accessible so they have a
better app community they have better
third-party support they have more music
services and let's say their flagship
product I can't remember the price on my
head it's around 170 right now okay yeah
you guys can correct me later but the
the whole pot isn't compelling enough
even if you're an Apple user it's like
it's only going to do some basic series
like yeah set reminders and timers but
it's so limited at 3:49 coming out of
the gate and all I'm gonna say is that
sound better blow me away I know it's
gonna be better than the echo I know
it's gonna have better sound than the
home and so people are really gonna be
buying this in today's day and age to
have a speaker that is really I'm sorry
I'm gonna say it the dumbest smart
speaker that's coming out on the market
it's not a good thing yeah let me read
you the music services that are on
Amazon's echo Amazon my music which you
have for free if you have a Amazon Prime
account Apple music is their Spotify
Pandora iHeartRadio tune in there so
knows audible Kindle it's like there's
just a massive list right here and like
three of them that I use regularly you
know and then I'm gonna get a home pod
and have Apple music only which I don't
subscribe to I'm sorry you lost me so
we'll wait you know this is not a dump
this is again real talk of what is
happening don't say we're hating on
Apple everything we've said is
completely factual it's just damn
disappointing it is disappointing it's
disappointing and again it's not they're
not Apple isn't one year behind are
tears behind they're legitimately three
years behind
they had another delay it's coming in
early 2018 look no one works during
December really it's like kind of like
in tech people they you have extended
vacation people aren't gonna be working
to try and get this home pod out in
January if I am wrong you can spank me
and give me a bad apple but I'm
expecting we're probably gonna see
something about the home pod in March of
2018 and then it also makes me wonder
like literally when we look at what the
home pot has inside of it I'm not saying
I can do this but it's not like it's a
super complex product compared to what
other smart speakers are doing out in
the market yeah it's not so in the sound
quality is there big selling point and
they should have definitely taken that
in a different direction you know
focused on the AI personal assistant
like I will tell you right now they do
have a chance to wow us and Wow me with
sound quality because I went to Google's
Google has
- pop-up shops in the u.s. one in New
York and one in Southern California off
of Melrose Avenue I went to that store
and I listened to the Google Mac home
max it was a big speaker it did not
sound as fool like it didn't have as
deep of a bass tone as I wanted in a
speaker that size also the touch
controls on it they were continuously
reminding me it was a prototype they're
like oh it's a little sensitive so don't
touch here don't do that it'll get
better when it's done I'm like okay but
you're showing this on a showroom floor
so I'm gonna take it for what it is a
from what I saw the Google home acts is
not good enough from what I saw to be
like okay it's gonna be better than the
home pod but again the whole pod still
hustle while the home pod celsa proved
to me that it's even worth 350 bucks I
mean quite honestly it's not gonna
replace my Amazon echo I don't even have
a second generation Amazon echo I
probably should just cuz I need to
compare to them eventually but the home
pod can win in sound quality but it's
not gonna win an app support third-party
support or assistant support and that's
those are really the key thing key
reasons to use a smart speaker yeah yeah
I agree
definitely so we're not pooping on it
we're just talking home pods if you guys
and gals listening live want to tweet us
at brian tong i'll take a look at that
and maybe we can throw in your tweets at
the end of show when we get to the calls
so before we do that though guess what
we keep the lights on because we have
these amazing sponsors so I'm just gonna
jump into it with our friends from or be

baby check it out alright let's keep on
jumping through the show other news that
dropped in here during this short week
and really towards the end of last week
new rumblings about the iMac pro like
honestly I'm not gonna lie to you I kind
of it was kind of an afterthought that
oh yeah the iMac Pro is still coming
this year like this was their $4,999
behemoth of an iMac and if you recall at
the time once they announced it I was
like okay that's really cool you're
making a super-powerful iMac and this
also happened you know after Apple had
revealed
oh we're gonna start working on a
modular desktop because that's what
professionals want and it also aligned
up with the fact that look the iMac Pro
is a reflection of how Apple completely
doesn't understand their customers as
much they put the iMac pro is going to
sell to a specific market because of its
form factor but and it's gonna have
server grade level processors but for it
showed where Apple's vision was was
wrong they're like oh we're gonna make a
crazy iPad III Mac Pro okay well here it
is I think people are going to buy it
but not it's not gonna be a consumer
devices for the pros but pros still
aren't gonna be happy with the iMac Pro
the pros are gonna be like alright this
is a stopgap because you missed the boat
and completely ignored the Mac Pro and
didn't know what you're doing and now we
have the iMac Pro that's supposed to
hold us over for a year maybe a year and
a half it's just a black it's a
reflection of just how poorly Apple had
thought out their professional strategy
and thought
this is really what pros wanted so there
are some cool news from the iMac pro for
people that aren't interested in it one
of them we have developers that really
kind of dig into code that kind of can
reveal nuggets of what's going on these
guys that revealed so much about the
iPhone when there was that leak of iOS
11 early on you know someone like
Stephen Chow Smith guilhom Rambo is
another guy they looked at some of the
code in it have been able to dig up that
this new iMac Pro is expected to have a
complimentary a10 fusion chip right the
same chip similarly that is in our OS
devices it will be supported with 512
Meg's of RAM and will give although we
don't know the full functionality of
what this a-10 ship will be capable of
it will at least appear that the chip
will enable support for hey Suri
functionality even interestingly enough
this is kind of interesting when the my
Mac Pro is turned off now whether that
means the iMac is asleep I don't think
it's when it's completely turned off but
maybe it is I mean in a weird way I
wonder if if it was active in the
background you can say hey Siri turn on
my iMac that would be kind of
interesting and kind of cool right that
would be cool so it's like it's it's
like in a standby mode like my ps4 does
this it goes standby mode yes which kind
of annoys me because then I know it's
drawing power you know it's like you see
that glow on it yeah but that that's
interesting so it's gonna be listening
to you all the time - so you got a like
a listening device in your house but
that's in serene you and I are you you
know we both use echo I think most
people now these days it's like if it
makes my life easier I don't care that
everyone's listening all the time
there's very few people that are now
there are people that are saying I don't
want listening devices in my home but I
think it's not it's a lot less now it
keep continues to get smaller and
smaller those group of people that don't
want listening devices our phone is a
listening device we have a yeah and a
pretty sure fate my Facebook app is
listening to me and serving me ads when
I talk about certain things oh yeah but
but yeah I mean that's that's
interesting like if you can wake up your
computer say wake up computer or
something like that and a turns
I'm I'm I'm all for that all right I
know you're down with that so yeah what
was cool is that there is a actual kind
of custom OS specific for the a-10 on
the iMac pro that has been revealed as
it will be called bridge OS so that's
what they were able to dig into and kind
of reveal some of this interesting
information I thought that was pretty
cool another thing iMac related is that
according to more reports the iMac Pro
could feature something like a Find My
iPhone type feature a cornea bloggers
Pyke's Universum that actually were some
of the first people to reveal the specs
for this reported iMac Pro before it was
officially announced by Apple they're
the ones that said look we expect to see
Intel next generation server grade
processors in an iMac Pro they were the
ones that called it out first but
they've also been able to find out that
it looks like there will be some sort of
advanced theft protection similar to the
Find My iPhone service where it will
know exactly
your computer so that's nice yeah just a
little nugget about the iMac Pro that is
again four thousand nine hundred and
ninety nine dollars starting I do start
out because I love mine here at work I
do love it I do as a work computer if
works gonna pay for it hell yeah yeah
yeah right like yeah you know if you're
the professional industry of video
editing you want your company buy you an
iMac Pro but you also still would rather
have your company buy you a Mac Pro
that's modular yeah all right that would
be nice so I could put some cards in it
do some other stuff all the types of
good stuff okay we'll just kind of go
through there was some also future
iPhone you know just we always get more
new stories and nuggets about what's
coming from the iPhone what's coming
next
a new report by maangchi quo and KGI
says that the 2018 iPhones again last
week we talked about how they're
expected to come in three sizes a
five-point eight and a six point five
which will be OLED based and a 6.1 inch
that will be LCD based with a lower
pixel per inch density that I jokingly
say blurry but people took me seriously
and said dude it's not gonna be a blurry
screen like there's a lot of like come
on yeah but they're just they're worried
they're too concerned the people that
get the joke or like that's funny
okay alright so this news story from et
quo and digit I'm just saying that the
2018 iPhones will feature an upgraded
antenna design specifically to boost LTE
transmission speeds it will feature an
upgraded liquid crystal polymer antenna
modules that will help to contribute to
faster LTE transmission speeds the new
phone models will use at least two LCP
antenna modules much like the iPhone 10
currently does but with improvements to
support the new 4x4 MIMO standards and
so I was like okay I've heard of 2x2
MIMO like what exactly is that well
thanks to the power of our friend at
Google
justgo we can all learn here about
though there's people that do know
everything 2x2 MIMO devices are devices
with dual antennas and radios so that
allows them to communicate via two
streams of transmission and reception of
data and information there are 3 by 3
MIMO devices but these new antennas that
are expect to be popped into the LTE are
starting the 2018 iPhones will support 4
by 4 MIMO so that's four streams of to
transmit and receive data which will
obviously help boost their effectiveness
and we've also heard there was a story
about Apple me talking with Intel and
potentially the 2018 iPhones only using
Intel modems and that instantly kind of
makes me cringe or like kind of a little
like squeamish because we know what kind
of the story in the background how in
the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 10 some
phones have Qualcomm modems some phones
have Intel modems it has literally been
tested and proven that the Qualcomm
modems perform better they support more
bands but also Apple and Qualcomm are
going into this legal back-and-forth
battle where Apple saying Qualcomm char
too much for the modems Qualcomm is
saying you throttled our modems so they
basically hate each other okay
and so therefore Apple is looking to
work with Intel exclusively from what we
have heard with the 2018 iPhones that
remains to be seen but to me that would
be that would hurt because really we
want the FASTA tech in there this is
such an inside baseball that's exactly
why people listen to this podcast but I
want to Kwak I wish I could still have a
Qualcomm modem in my iPhone 10 but I
don't have it because I got an Intel I'm
sorry an AT&amp;amp;T / t-mobile GSM phone which
is using the Intel modem where the
Verizon and Sprint phones do have access
to the Qualcomm modems so this is just
the picture right here of the I mean
that's just modem it's just a picture
it's you know the actual component it's
just kind of a fun marketing picture you
know like hey it's a square that says
the word until 5g modem so would this be
like a case of like a company biting the
hand that feeds them or something in
wait who's biting who though like is
Apple biting Qualcomm or is it Qualcomm
yeah they're biting Qualcomm I think
Qualcomm has every right to be mad but
at the same time apples a company can't
have two phones that are the same phone
on the exterior and one performs
significantly better than the other
right like there's a cop Apple is about
also guess what it's about margins about
costs I'm pretty sure the Qualcomm modem
is more expensive than the Intel modem
it also is a better-performing modem and
if you have hundreds of millions of
devices it's smart not to rely on one
single supplier but you still have to
pump out phones you still have to give
them to the people and so throttling
down one of the modems so that it can't
reach its full potential in order to
have a somewhat consistent result across
your entire product line is something
that they do have to do you know I just
wish it wasn't that way yeah yeah so
it's interesting anyway we'll see what
happens with that and then another small
story about the iPhone or at least Apple
in general working with new displays and
screens is that Apple is collaborate
with its Taiwanese supplier TSMC they
make plenty of displays for Apple in the
past but they're working to solve
manufacturing issues with kind of the
next generation of displays called micro
LED displays what's different is they do
have a lot of the same benefits as ol
Ed's
the cheap deep true blacks that are
optimized to be energy-efficient wide
color gamut as well the main thing about
a micro LED display is the fact that it
is actually thinner than the current ole
Ed's
it's a little it's even more energy
efficient but I got expect that we'll
see maybe the first indications and we
had heard rumors of micro LED displays
potentially being used in Apple watches
in the future but they're nowhere near
even getting enough factories to build
OLED screens other than Samsung at a
large size so I wouldn't see it coming
anytime soon for now like micro LEDs
coming to an iPhone next year now I mean
it's got to be at least a couple years
out so mmm so there you go um two other
little quick bullet just a couple other
quick bullet points Apple opened its
visitor center on campus our CNET proper
gotta check it out I have not yet been
able to see it but it has features like
an Apple Store it has this cool new
architecture you have like exclusive
goodies that you can only get from the
Apple Campus you know it's it's the new
place that you can go visit so they had
a lot of cool stuff going on with there
so just check it out we have a video up
and they had some neat stuff going with
that and then finally before we get to
our calls this has to be the executive
the Apple executive boo boo bad apple of
the week did you see the story Beach at
all I don't think I have okay so check
this out last week
Apple's Tim Cook tweeted a
congratulatory message to Australia on
its same-sex marriage vote so he tweeted
it out and then he tweeted out a flag
but that flag was actually the New
Zealand flag emoji and not the
Australian flag emoji oh man and you
know that he heard from people I am
obviously not a flag expert so I used a
amazing tool called Google and found
like the big difference
that there's a large star on the
Australian flag
it's the Commonwealth star it's
associated with Australia that is there
but is not existent on the New Zealand
flag also the New Zealand flag has four
stars on it that are five-point stars
they're red with white outlines whereas
the Australia as 45.0 for seven point
stars and one 5-point star on it I'm
just giving you guys Google the Google
you know you're gonna you know you're
gonna get a google it you're gonna
Google Australia versus New Zealand flag
and you're gonna learn everything I just
told you okay the Australian flag we're
looking at here and then New Zealand
people like I don't see anything bro
they're like I don't care well do I know
someone's missing right someone right
now is I literally know there's at least
five listeners who are typing in New
Zealand versus Australis like right now
I'm gonna have guarantee I'm gonna have
to forgive Tim Cook on this one cuz look
at how similar they are
look at that row come on everyone knows
what the Australian flag looks like
compared to Zealand flag that's common
sense oh man right that is common sense
shame on us just kidding
alright so we get to the comments do it
thank you guys all for calling we had a
lot of great phone calls we whittled it
down to five because that seems to be a
good number of calls to pop so here we
go here's caller number one hey what's
up guys this is in a gym I'm calling
from Miami I'm leaving a second message
because the first one got cut off but I
wanted to talk to you about augmented
reality and how I think Apple has
spending way too much time and money on
a alert and a arcade and all these
sensors that they want to put in the
phone for a hour I first saw a are maybe
like seven or eight years ago on the
Nintendo 3ds when it came out
and I thought it was the coolest thing
in the world but I got over it really
fast and ever since then the best
implementations of AR have been maybe
Pokemon go and snapchat filters and
neither of those two things really
required you know 3d sensors or things
like that they maybe use image
recognition and that
about it so I think Apple is a little
silly for spending so much time and on
the sensors and and a research and
whatnot to get AR into the iPhone when
in my opinion there are no big killer
apps for AR no real reasons to use it in
my opinion what do you guys think do you
think that there's a lot of potential in
AR and that's why we're focused on it so
are you in my board will you think it's
a little overrated and a little bit of
look in it let me know what you guys
think I love your show
I'll keep it up thank you thank you hey
Beach where you stand with this aye aye
aye
at first I agreed with him but after
thinking about it I disagree I think
gaming they're trying to corner the you
know the market on gaming so having
these 3d chips is gonna allow you to you
know sense like a wall or a door or a
piece of furniture or something so then
that will become an object in your AR
world you know I think I think they're
aiming towards that like I understand
like the snapchat thing is cool but that
just is modeling your face pokemons go
is kind of cool but those things are
just kind of randomly placed right so I
think Apple is going in a good direction
with this if they want to corner that
market but it's already you know there's
so many people already in that space
it's hard to say if they're gonna make
something really cool that's compelling
yeah I think you think we've been able
to get some hidden you know some lucky
gems from AR I don't know if it's gonna
be the the thing about it is if you
think of AR and you think about it like
in 10 years from now obviously to me
there's a lot of potential this is a
playground where you have to play in
because as we've seen just historically
there's gonna be technology platforms
whether it's hardware based or software
based that become the hot thing to do
and you have to try them and you have to
see if it sticks if it resonates and
sometimes a piece of technology is too
young and then we see a take off way
later for example like Microsoft had
tablets way before app like not even
year like a couple years like ten years
before Apple did the iPad and then all
of a sudden the right company at the
right time with the right software
happens to put it out there and then all
of a sudden it was like oh wow tablets
are actually worth like using and now
it's evolved where we're really starting
to
more of a tablet laptop hybrid I think
with a are we to your point I agree with
you we haven't seen many successes but I
think there's huge potential and when I
look at AR right now 10 hours to me it's
like being able to wear glasses that
show you information while you're or
even like your dashboard on your car
with cameras that sense things it's
partially is gaming that's probably
gonna be its easiest way to show how it
can be successful to a consumer audience
but when I go past that it could be
medical fields it can be driving it can
be heads-up displays clap some sort of
glasses that not everyone will wear but
people will wear and if it can become
useful and serve amazing information
that makes our life easier then it will
but I don't I don't even think we've
seen we see maybe like 10 percent of
what AR is capable right now just watch
Minority Report that's what I want to
see I would even my own I want to be the
Terminator and just like look around and
identify you know like see if a dude's
leather pants and glasses match you and
then take them off his body and then
wear them outside of a bar yeah I want
to be able to identify threats and like
it'll just say kill kill you know and
I'll have to kill this person now okay
we're gonna take that out of context cuz
then someone's gonna post a clip of you
beat up and say like Steven Beecham is
crazy terminator I'm the Terminator so
you know what I don't know what other
people think but I'm still excited about
but yeah we haven't seen anything that
says yes this is gonna revolution him
Routh Allah revolutionize my life it
hasn't yet it's not there yet but there
are small steps to get to that point
alright next call thank you very much
Miami I forget his name all right here
we go hey this is Brian from New Orleans
I've had my own tent since launch day
something I really like about it is
actually face ID really like just being
able to swipe up and I'm in my phone
don't even have to worry about
positioning my thumb the right way some
things I'm still getting used to is the
added weight I feel like my fingers are
getting stronger from holding the phone
yeah I know I guess that we'll see
fingers but still getting used to that
quick tip I downloaded the quick clips
app
and it would not work on my iPhone
actually called Apple support and I
kicked around to three different people
they had me backup restore my phone none
of that work so finally under system
privacy settings and location services
and system services if you have compass
calibration turned off the Eclipse app
will not work properly so I took a
couple phone calls and about Choppers
with Apple to get that figured out
so that's your if anybody else have
compass calibration turned off under
privacy settings but if you do turn it
back on
alright I mean I would have known I
would have probably tried to figure that
out like him but I don't use clips when
I first heard it I was like you spent
like two hours on the phone to like use
clips and he's planning to use it once
or twice you know be like okay but he
wants to use it because you know what
he's a fan of technology that's awesome
like that's awesome it's just one of
those things yeah like I stopped using
Clips after you know when Apple came up
this social minor social media app clips
I tried I'm like oh it's kind of fun but
I'll never use this and I I think they
updated it recently with and imma still
never gonna use it yeah okay next call
thank you for calling here we go
they tried though they tried hey beat
your tongue or possibly Brian and song
this is Dan Cohen from the great white
north I just wanted to call and let you
guys know that the iPhone 10 bug with
the cold weather before they just
patched it in the latest update here was
driving the absolutely bonkers like
minus 18 on the Reg up here and yeah
it's the phone just wasn't working we're
catching the bus and you're not even
able to change the volume on the phone
pretty not anyway actually calling it as
hope you guys might want to touch on why
Apple watch Series 3 has the limitation
of not being of the roam in other
countries so right now as that can't
take Apple watch series 3 abroad and use
roaming or if you're an American and you
use your phone or so your watch by it in
another country you can take it back
home and Sue's it so anyway long story
short I'm just curious if you could
touch on what you think technical
limitation is there so the watch doesn't
work while roaming anyway thanks so much
peach atong going strong yourself
by great call you know from what I
gather and this is off the top of my
head and I remember this even when Apple
announced it the Isom technology is very
new but what that what that's not really
the reason why it doesn't work overseas
roaming not all carriers are capable of
supporting isom yet and so because of
that you have specifically
internationally - you have if you even
look at which companies are sorry which
carriers and which countries are
supporting the Apple watch LTE version
to work it's it's pretty limited overall
it's not like every country is doing the
Apple watch Series three LTE that's the
LTE version we're talking about so with
the Isom technology not all chairs are
supporting it it's very limited outside
of I believe us and did Canada recently
there were only even with some of them
there's only one specific carrier that
would support it in other countries so
that's really why they will get up to
speed
but at the moment that's the biggest
reason why you don't see any roaming
with the Apple watch LTE specifically
just it's just not ready to roll and
carriers aren't on board with with
support for yet all right well thanks
for that call from our friend from
Kannada Canada got another call two more
here we go okay guys this is Marc in
Orange County California question I just
bought an egg plus and love it I'd like
to be able to use the lightning headset
on various audio devices and I'm having
a difficult time finding an adaptive so
I wanna know if you know of any adapter
that goes from a lightning female to
either 3.5 millimeter male a thunderbolt
male or USB male so that I can use my
headsets on more than just an iPhone I
love the show looking forward to the
answer and thank you shopping for him no
I thought I actually had his answer but
he said lightning female 2 3.5
millimeter jack male I thought he meant
like m'lady male 2 3.5 millimeter jack
male and I do not see anything like I
haven't I don't I don't I don't see
might not exist but yeah like a Google
search what would it be lightning female
female-to-male 3.5 yeah if you put that
in a Google search something will pop up
and then or not it is yeah or not so we
tried to help we thought we could help
but Pearson I can tell all right part of
the big part of the reason why that's
also probably tricky is because
typically unless you find like some
bootleg version Apple charges a
licensing for you to use any to use
their lightning connection in a third
party accessory Wow
just saying okay Ike what's not able to
help them my bad don't have this all
right here we go dongle problems last
call hi there just know what calling
from Canada I just want to share I found
a quick little trick on the Apple TV
that I don't know if it's new or didn't
seem to be a parent anyway if you double
click the button to the right of the
menu button the TV button or whatever
that is it pops into like a multitasking
scroll wheel anyway other people find
that useful thanks but cool I didn't
even know that honestly I'm gonna try
