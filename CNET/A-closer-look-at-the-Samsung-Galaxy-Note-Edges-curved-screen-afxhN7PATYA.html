here at Aoife 2014 in Berlin with this
the toast of the town is the Samsung
Galaxy edge a smart phone with a really
cool curved display but Samsung says
that this thing doesn't just look good
it's functional too so in this video
we're going to check out all the
different things you can do with that
curved portion of the display so the
first thing that that curved screen is
used for is to display your favorite
apps you can see them tile down here on
the side of the screen and that's an
interesting way of quickly getting to
the applications that you probably use
most often if you sweep around on this
you'll see that this curved bit of the
screen is also used for notifications a
lot the idea of notifications being on
this curved bit of the screen because it
gives them more real estate than they
would otherwise have if they were
popping up on the smaller bit of the
display at the top here that means that
hopefully when notifications do come in
you should be able to see a bit more
text so it's not just favorite apps and
notifications there's actually quite a
lot of other stuff that's being
displayed here and that's where that
custom apps and widgets so for example
this one shows you things that are
trending on Twitter and this one gives
you an idea of stocks if you're the
financially savvy type one thing I am
impressed with is how much Samsung is
letting you customize this side panel
and you do that by swiping up here you
can see the little arrow and hitting the
little settings cog so from this special
edge screen menu you can see all the
different apps that you have to scroll
through and you can customize them as
well so if you tap on manage panels that
gives you the option to move them around
select or deselect them and if you click
this little pencil here you can do
things like for example change which
apps are going to appear in that
favorite app menu an interesting bit of
personalization is this express me
option so if you tap this you can see
you can have pictures showing up as one
of the different screens you can swipe
through if I go to click the little plus
we can make a new one let's just use one
of the default pictures here and then
you can choose exactly which bit of it
you want displayed so let's choose this
guy's face hit save we can see his face
there on the curved screen one final
feature on this menu that I want to talk
about is night block because I think
this is really
interesting what it does is it turns the
side of the display into a clock so you
can leave it on your bedside table and
even when the phone is locked you'll be
able to see the time so to make it work
you set the duration like this you can
choose exactly when you want it to be
active then when the phone is locked you
can see that on that curved bit you can
see the time and the date useful if you
wake up in the middle of the night and
don't want to unlock your phone to check
the time so if you swipe down on the
curve bit you get this which is a
shortcut to a list of useful tools and
some of them are really really clever so
if I tap this one for example it turns
that curve bit into a ruler so you can
use the phone to measure things you've
also got things like a flashlight one
final thing that's quite nice is that
side bar plays nice with the other apps
on the phone so for example if I open
the camera you can see that the side bar
then changes to feature all the
different camera controls and that's
something that will also work in other
apps so lots of stuff to do then and
hopefully once developers get involved
they'll be able to dream up some
interesting new applications for the
curved screen as well is there anything
you can think of that this curved
display might be good for let me know
