is that we are now a global community of
a billion monthly actives on Instagram
it's incredible and it's something Mike
and I never thought would happen but
here we are eight years later and it
truly wouldn't have happened without all
of you thank you so much okay
so that's not the only news I have to
talk about today although that's a big
one let's talk about video so video is a
way we hang out with friends and we pass
the time but how we watch it is changing
teens are now watching 40% less TV than
they did five years ago an on Instagram
people are watching 60 percent more
video in just the last year so how he
watches changing quickly but what we
watch is changing to an entirely new
category of video and now exists and
it's being made by creators teens might
be watching less TV but they're watching
more creators online and the number of
creators has grown exponentially
combined these creators reach hundreds
of millions of followers and that makes
Instagram one of the largest and most
engaged audiences anywhere in the world
all of this change is super exciting but
we think there are a handful of problems
the tools we watch video are old and out
of date think about it today we still
watch videos formatted for a TV on a
vertical screen which means we either
have to rotate our phone awkwardly or
watch a tiny little version and that
doesn't make much sense does it but
that's not all video on mobile is also
clunky and unnatural current apps make
you search or browse the directory to
find things you like always the last
time you had to turn on a TV and then
had to type a search just to start
watching and even once you know what you
want to watch the results can be really
overwhelming how can you find all the
good stuff among all the cat videos and
everything else
where are the creators that you guys
love all of these problems made us think
that you deserve better and it's time
for video to move forward and to evolve
but how how can we make this better for
our community of a bill
whatever we do it has to be mobile first
this is on your phone so it should be
built with your phone in mind next it
has to be simple we have a sing an
Instagram which is to do one thing and
one thing really well
finally quality in a world of
overwhelming choice you want the best
videos not just all videos so we
followed these three principles and we
built something brand new do you guys
want to know what it is we call it a GTV
we've reimagined what video is on mobile
and we want to share it with you today
IG TV is an app for watching long-form
vertical video from your favorite
creators and now the fun part I'm gonna
ask Ashley the product manager on the
project to come up and show you what
we've made Ashley
thank you so much Kevin as Kevin
mentioned IG TV is a brand new
experience inside of the main Instagram
app and it's also a new dedicated
standalone app and I'm super excited I
get to give you all a deeper look into
how it works today
so the first thing you'll notice when
you first enter IG TV is that everything
is made for how you naturally hold your
phone videos play fullscreen and there's
no wasted space and they aren't
restricted to the same one minute limit
that you're used to on Instagram have
you ever come across one of those
30-second preview videos in your feed
and it kind of just leaves you wanting
more it sort of leaves you hanging no
more of that on IG TV because everything
is longer you get to see the full thing
another thing you'll notice with IG TV
is that it's dead simple the moment you
open the app you're already watching all
the content you love from all the
creators you love personally I really
love adventure so it's great for me that
I TV showed me this video of Alex Hayes
who's an Australian creator IG TV also
presents the highest quality content for
me when I want to discover new creators
I just swipe around to check out their
channels that's actually how I found
Clara Mars this French creator that I
never would have discovered without IG
TV you seen these Swiper on channels oh
wait for a second so you can see Clara
so this is Clara Mars a great French
grader I never would have found her
without ID TV how cute is her dog and
I'll go ahead and I'll interact with her
and her friends and her fans right there
and for example leave a comment and let
her know how cute I think her dog is and
I love this video from Clara so much
that I want to see more from her so I'll
go ahead and I'll check out her channel
rest of her videos are there and I can
actually also follow her from right
there so I can see more of her on IG TV
and also across the rest of Instagram so
as you can see I GTV really is just as
Kevin said one its mobile first which
means everything's made for how you
naturally hold your phone to it's super
simple and intuitive to
and lastly and most importantly we bring
the high quality content to you from the
creators you already know and love and
if you want to upload your own IG TV
videos you can do that also right from
within the app starting today anyone can
become the next I G TV creator I'm super
excited we have a little another
surprise for you I get to introduce one
in particular the IG TV team and I had a
great privilege of getting to meet this
creator Brice Xavier many months ago and
we were so inspired not only by his
creativity but by how naturally shooting
vertical video really came to him so it
was no surprise to us that he's already
amassed an audience of millions of fans
he's been cast by Disney Cartoon Network
he's even been featured in music videos
from stars like Cee Lo Green and Janelle
Monae please join me in giving a very
warm welcome to Brice Xavier
hello everyone how are you all doing
today good I hope
thank you so much Ashley I'm really
excited to be here with everyone I'm
Bryce Xavier if you guys don't know
Instagram creator actor model and singer
Instagram has really been the big part
of my life it was the reason why I
actually started doing there's a lot of
stuff that I do today
it gave me a place to take the little
ideas that I thought inside of my head
and make them into something bigger as
we can all see here today and using IG
TV I know that I will be able to expand
my horizons even further check out my
first three videos as you can see here
with my crazy friends I'm trying out a
few new things like motivational tips
random thoughts and just a sneak peek
into my everyday life whether fits on
set or just sitting in my room at home
I'm also excited to see how IG TV is
going to inspire people worldwide to
make all of their dreams into a reality
to no matter what their aspirations are
we've come a really long way in just
eight years and then thanks to this
incredible community and many of the
creators that you saw today that we've
been able to launch ITV G TV like
everything we've built IG TV is for you
guys
and this is really an evolution of our
mission from day one it started with
square photos and filters those were the
good old days right we helped people
share moments with our friends but then
people start capturing more video and in
2013 we launched video and did you know
that actually happened on this exact day
five years ago and since then video has
exploded we've continued to build video
experiences and in 2016 we launched
stories and man it's taken off hundreds
of millions of people now share stories
which brings us to today with IG TV our
latest addition to the evolution of
Instagram long-form vertical video from
the creators that you love it's mobile
first it's simple and its quality that's
IG TV the app will be available in the
coming days on Android and iOS and in
the meantime you can update your
Instagram app to start watching IG TV
today there's so much great content
being uploaded by creators from around
the
so we compiled a sneak peak to give you
a little teaser of what's to come let's
watch it
