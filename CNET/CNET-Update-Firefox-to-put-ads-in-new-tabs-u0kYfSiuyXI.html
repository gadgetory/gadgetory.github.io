am Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update Firefox is putting advertisements
on its new tab pages the browser maker
Mozilla announced that when users open
up a new tab the directory tiles will
show sponsored web sites along with
popular sites based on your location
currently when you open up a new tab the
slots are filled with recently visited
sites and bookmarks Mozilla did not say
when it would start putting ads on these
Firefox tabs it's still in development
but when it's ready the change will
first show up on the desktop version of
Firefox and eventually you'll see it on
mobile twitter could be testing ways to
become more like Facebook a few folks
are noticing changes to their layout of
their Twitter profile which has gone
from this to this and that screenshot
comes from a Mashable editor who spotted
the change on his page but it's not
viewable for most of us just yet as you
can see this looks a whole lot like
Facebook there's the photo and bio on
the left with a long header photo
stretching across the page and tweets
are huge and in different columns which
kind of look like how posts are
displayed on Google+ this is just
something Twitter's testing but it could
be a way to get more people interested
in trying the network you see twitter
has a problem with growing its members
and frankly the user experience isn't
easy to understand when you're new to
Twitter Toyota is recalling 1.9 million
Prius cars globally because of a problem
with the software that handles the
hybrid controls the defective software
could cause a car to power down while
it's being driven but no accidents have
been reported due to this glitchy system
the recall includes Prius cars made
since march of 2009 owners can fix this
with a software update and folks I know
some of you are upset that you missed
out on downloading flappy bird before it
was deleted from the App Store's but
don't go searching for flappy bird on
third-party Android app stores because
if you find something that's claiming to
be the game it's likely malware security
firms are finding several applications
in non google app marketplaces that
claim to be flappy bird but they have
code that is sending text messages to
premium numbers that cost money
seriously the game isn't worth seeking
out it's only popular because there's
been a hype about how hard it is and the
creator deleted it this week because he
didn't like how people were addicted to
it that's your tech news update we could
buy more details at cnet com / update
and you can also stay updated by
following along on Twitter from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
