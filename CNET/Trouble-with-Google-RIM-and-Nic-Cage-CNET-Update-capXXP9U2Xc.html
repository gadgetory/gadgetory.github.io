bunch of troublemakers in today's show
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update google may have to pay a record
22 and a half million dollar fine to the
Federal Trade Commission Google is
charged with exploiting a loophole
around user privacy settings and Apple
Safari web browser the wall street
journal reports that it's the largest
penalty the commission has demanded
against a single company now six months
ago it was brought to light that Google
used a special code to get around
privacy controls cookies were tracking
safari users even if tracking was
disabled now Google doesn't do this
anymore but it just can't seem to keep
out of trouble last year if they were in
heat with the Commission over google
buzz then it forked over 25 grand to the
FCC for obstructing a street view
investigation and there's the 500
million dollar settlement it paid to the
Justice Department because of the
promotion of drug ads so what point
doesn't start hurting Google's
credibility has it changed your feelings
about Google or do you just shrug your
shoulders over these things because all
you care about is buying a glass headset
share your thoughts with a 15 second
video using tout or right to update at
cnet com and this just in Canadians are
way too nice because at the Research In
Motion shareholders meeting all the
board members were reelected that's
right the leaders of the troubled
blackberry brand get to keep their
positions however there was talk of an
ongoing search for more qualified board
members xbox live users you can now
download the connect play fit it's a new
menu that will track your calories that
you burn while playing games that
require you to get off your keister like
dance central 2 and kinect Star Wars
that's right kids you can get fit and
play Star Wars at the same time next
issue is a netflix for magazines that's
been available on some android tablets
but now the app is available on the iPad
pay a monthly fee and get unlimited
reading access to about 40 magazines
there's really nothing else like this
for digital magazines if you're hunting
for a job you better spruce up that
LinkedIn profile because a recent survey
says 93% of recruiters are using
LinkedIn to find qualified candidate
also be keen to double check what you
attached in any emails you send to
recruiters one mistake made by a young
woman has become a viral lesson she
meant to attach your resume and cover
letter but accidentally attached Nicolas
Cage yeah oh it's good to slow down on
those important emails she was good
humoured about it to post it on her
tumblr see you know that's a good
quality you want in any employee someone
who downloads crazy Nick Cage headshots
I can run a popular tumblr as well
that's your tech news update for today
