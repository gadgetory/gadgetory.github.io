monitor vendors have been pushing
thinner and even thinner monitors onto
the market culminating what we have here
today the quote unquote slimmest monitor
ever I'm Eric Franke him from C net and
today we're taking a first look at the
LG e to 290 the Eid 90 is indeed the
thinnest volunteer we've yet seen
measuring a tad more than 1/4 of an inch
at its slimmest that's nearly half as
thick as a Samsung px 2 370 now looks
may not be everything but with something
billed as the slimmest ever they do
obviously account for something the e90
has a sleek chrome finish with smooth
somewhat rounded angles it's for Sana's
wide and provides a very stable base the
power button is also marked by an even
larger LED light ensuring you won't have
trouble finding it you may have trouble
finding a monitor though because it's
thin people match options include one
HDMI one DVI one VGA and the headphone
jack we've not yet had the chance to get
into performance tests but we did check
out a few movies and games they looked a
bit washed out but overall they were
good for our purposes and to be
perfectly fair we've yet to have a
chance to dive really deep into
calibration check out a full review
coming soon to see if the enon takes off
or if it's too thin to fly the thin
judge
you know this management is so thin it
has to stand in the same place twice to
cast a shadow this monitor is so thin
when it turns sideways it disappears
you know this monitor is so thin it uses
dental floss as toilet paper yeah
you know I've seen something mantras in
my time but this monitor is so thin it
has to run around the shower to get wet
all right I'll be here all week
you're the veal tip your waitress all
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
