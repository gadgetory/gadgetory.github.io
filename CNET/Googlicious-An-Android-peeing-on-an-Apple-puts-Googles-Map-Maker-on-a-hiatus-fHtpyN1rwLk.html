that Google Isha's for everything google
that we can pack inside of a show on to
the good stuff and we start with
Google's self-driving cars and the new
post from Chris erson the team head
revealed that Google's cars have been in
11 accidents in the past six years now
that's a pretty impressive track record
but even more impressive according to
google none of the accidents were caused
by their vehicles and eight of the 11
accidents were from other drivers rear
ending them plus you know most of those
people were just texting their bae i
just saw a google car if you're that guy
now the criticism is that it was only
google keeping track of these and not an
independent group but they can figure
out how accurate it really was when we
see these cars on the road in a few
years besides we can always trust google
right well that would be a big fat nope
when it comes to google hangouts after
the big g admitted on a reddit AMA that
it doesn't use end to end encryption on
hangouts meaning the company can tap
into those conversations in sessions if
it receives a required government court
order to do so totally awesome now
Google's transparency report reveals the
company has received 26 wiretap requests
from the US government since the middle
2013 but it did not identify if any of
them were for hangouts and you know what
I'm no longer using hangouts one almost
every other service I use is encrypting
my chats the right way all right new
hardware leaks thanks to on leaks in the
first look at what's believed to be the
9.7 inch samsung galaxy tab s to the
design is said to be inspired by the
galaxy s6 it's pretty basic looking like
almost every other tablet and we're
expecting a summer lunch plus we're just
about a year out since the original moto
360 s launched and the first SmartWatch
that really actually reminded me of a
watch now droid life has found a recent
filing from the Bluetooth special
interest group with a device named be
tmw 03 that they have confirmed is a
listing for new motorola android device
now the timing of this with google i/o
coming at the end of the month could
mean we might see it make an appearance
at the event
but whenever we see it let's just hope
they can use the entire watch face as a
screen this time around all right LG's
g4 is arriving at the end of this month
in the US and it's one of my top
anticipated phones this year in a new
nugget of info LG has confirmed that the
device will support Qualcomm quick
charge 2.0 in time for its release even
if it requires a software update but
we'll get you approximately zero to
sixty percent battery life in just 30
minutes and in another update to know
about almost every samsung galaxy s6 and
s6 edge can now be routed without
tripping the flash counter previous
methods would trip the flash counter
really this would let technicians know
if it had been modified but not anymore
thanks to the ping pong route from the
XDA developer site named after one of my
favorite sports and plus it rhymes with
my name now you can see if your s6 is
compatible but again doing anything like
this is at your own risk and in a story
that truly proves why we can't give
people nice things google map maker was
this cool platform that allowed people
to edit maps to be more accurate so you
could put places like businesses roads
railways and pass they could all be
edited if you're familiar with that area
but see that's where it went wrong
believing that all humans are good see
the program has now been suspended after
one of the submissions showed off an
android robot taking a leak on an apple
i know it's actually pretty funny but
it's also immature and yes I know what
immature looks like now Google's backlog
of submissions to review has become so
large that they decided to stop all
submissions while they improve the
process and there's no timetable when it
will be back up and really the moral of
the story here people are stupid all
right that's going to do it for this
week's show you can always email us at
google issues at cnet com or tweet me a
brian Tong and i'll respond when i can
thanks for watching we'll see you all
next time for some more of that Google
Isha's
