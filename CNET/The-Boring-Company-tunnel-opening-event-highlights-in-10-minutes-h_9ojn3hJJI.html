and traffic is gone from like just like
seventh level of hell to like the eighth
level of Hell and you know it's terrible
finally finally finally there's
something something that I think it's
solved goddamn traffic problem things
like want white tunnels you know
sometimes people say what about like
flying cars and all these other things
or to be clear we're not opposed to mass
transit we think mass transit is fine
like let's try every solution possible
but the thing about tunnels is that you
can go 3 D underground
the inherent problem with the way cities
are constructed is that you've got all
these tall buildings that are in 3d and
then a road network in 2d necessarily
this will result in traffic this is no
way our two ways right no way around it
you have to make Transport 3d you could
go with a flying car but there are some
drawbacks to flying cars they are
essentially it's a helicopter with
wheels and they they make a lot of noise
there's a lot of wind force and the
probability of suddenly falling on your
head if if they're a bunch of flying
cars around is much higher than if
they're or not the great thing about
tunnels is that there's there's no limit
to how deep you can go they're
weatherproof
that's the other thing about flying cars
if there's like snow or rain or
hurricane or something suddenly you
can't go anywhere but tunnels are immune
to weather it does not matter if there's
a tornado it doesn't matter if there's
like an ice storm it doesn't matter
what's going on above ground if you're a
tunnel you're safe and secure so you
will not hear see or feel the tunnels
being created you can weave at the
boring system tunnel network into the
fabric of a city without changing the
character of the city it can you'll have
this revolutionary transport system and
your city will still feel like your city
so what's the problem with tunnels but
there they usually take a very long time
to build and they're very expensive in
costs up to a billion dollars per my
in fact the LA subway extension that
just completed cost two billion dollars
for two and a half miles so clearly
something needs to be done to
revolutionize tunneling technology we
need to build tunnels way faster and for
help less money there's a snail this is
Gary Gary the sixth yeah it turns out
snails don't live that long
so this is Gary the sixth what are we
doing to increase the speed of tunneling
in a given hour of tunneling only about
10 minutes of the hour is spent actually
digging then the other 50 minutes are
spent erecting the the tunnel
reinforcements laying down tracks doing
logistics and a bunch of other stuff so
just just automating the segment
placement and solving the logistics
issues will actually give you about a
five-fold increase in tunneling speed
with our design we've also tripled the
power of the drone that that results in
in a theoretical net speed increase of
about 15 compared to the next best
tunneling machine so and hopefully we'll
beat our snail
so aspirationally we should be slightly
faster than a snail after doing those
things and and we have three three
tunnel products one is the loop that is
for transportation pods and you guys
will try it out later today and that's
that does transport tunnel we're also
seeing a lot of interest in just utility
tunnels where a municipality can get a
big tunnel and then put water mains and
electricity lines inside the tunnel and
then they can actually service like if
their water main break instead of it
flooding the main street in the city
they can actually go in and into the
boring company tunnel and fix the water
main this but this fundamentally is what
we're trying to solve
UOP we've all been there many many times
we must so solve the solve the soul
destroying traffic situation
so the the loop that we're talking about
it consists of autonomous electric
vehicles the combination of autonomous
electric vehicles with a deployable
guide wheels so that it braces itself
against the side of the tunnel so that
it's safe even if the car loses power or
even if somebody if somebody goes crazy
or there's like a mechanical failure
those guide wheels keep the car centered
in the tunnel and ensure that you can go
through the tunnel very fast and still
be safe but the thing about going 3-d is
that you could have like three you could
have six you can have sixteen tunnels
going in the same direction so you can
have as many tunnels as you want and I'm
pretty sure everyone in the United
States is not going to move to LA but
you could literally build enough tunnels
to transport everyone in the United
States in LA there is no limit the way
the loop would work is that you'd have
them get up main arteries that are
traveling at 150 miles an hour and only
when you want to go to an exit where you
have an off-ramp it's like a 3d highway
system underground basically
and and for the elevators the the way we
during the elevators is we construct
them off-site so the elevators are
prefabricated self-contained steel
structures and so the it went in order
to insert the elevator all you do is dig
a hole in the ground real fast then
bring the prefabricated elevator in
sections drop it down connect the
sections and you're done there's not
like some extended construction project
but I think that's also important so you
don't have these like construction
projects that disrupt the city all over
the place and and this it should say
also we will have continuously operating
cars in in the loop for those that do
not have a cars this will be will
actually give priority to pedestrians
and cyclists with with cars that are
continuously circulating in the loop so
even if you don't have a car you can
still use the system this is I really
wanna emphasize that it's small but very
important element is having retractable
wheels that's when when you're driving
down the road normally they retract and
go under the car you don't even see them
but when you get into the tunnel they
deploy and allow you to go through a
narrow tunnel very quickly and
effectively like like a little train so
this this even though it's like a small
thing it's a small but very important
element to the technology if this is not
intended to be some sort of walled
garden or just for Tesla's or something
like that
any autonomous PD can be outfitted with
these guide wheels yeah and why
autonomous well it means you can go very
very fast and brake very quickly like we
expect that you can probably do a one
vehicle per second through the tunnel
typically on a on a freeway you can do
without autonomous vehicles you can do
car every two seconds but with autonomy
we think you can do a car at least every
every second I mean you can think of
these like they're sort of like
wormholes and like it's just like you
drop down the worm like you're driving
around I need to get to the other side
of LA or New York whatever drop down the
worm will pop out the other side and
then you can just drive lonely the
elevator itself only takes as much as
two parking spaces on the street
so if you can just have a station in
exchange for two parking spaces and
that's what I mean that that's that's
basically the size of a station so you
can you can interleave these stations
throughout the city throughout cities
wherever there's you know a couple
parking spaces or a little patch or road
pretty much anywhere you can actually
even have them come up in underground
garages and then one day will connect to
the highfalutin other-- time and what I
think this really amounts to is is an
actual solution to the soul-crushing
burden of traffic this is just something
that I think what will actually work
it's scalable and we have a
demonstration tunnel here and we expect
to expand this over time to many cities
all around the world and and give people
more time for their friends and family
and that concludes our presentation
