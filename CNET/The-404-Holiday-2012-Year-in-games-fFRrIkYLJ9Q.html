Yuletide episode of the 404 show
covering all things gaming 2012 I'm Jeff
Bakalar I'm Ross rustic and i'm richard
peterson and today we're going to be
taking a long look back on the gaming
year that was 2012 it has become sort of
a tradition for russ and myself to
snuggle up get all cozy next to the fire
how many years as a snore oh i don't
think it's like three or four it's gotta
be yeah that's true it's a it's a
tradition that we I'm very happy to
share with you yep it's a treat and it's
time for you and I to really just let it
all hang out and really be honest about
what we thought the year in gaming said
did how well it performed and to give
our best and worst picks of the year
that was 2012 we're doing worse too I
mean I throw a few in here do not
prepare us maybe some disappoint oh
you'll see you'll see got some
disappointments i can think of how
quickly they all start popping up once
you just give it a little thought indeed
um so i guess to start lets you know
maybe take it back to january and and
sort of what the year had going for it
yeah um for me the first big game that I
was really psyched about was mass effect
3 oh yes that was back in March man I
cannot read right does that feel like
years and years and years ago it does um
so I mean if you can sort of like
transport yourself back to january 2012
have this whole branding this fresh
clean slate of games ahead of you what
were you most looking forward to uh well
it's funny because at that point i don't
think we had a really good sense is like
what was coming out yeah like infinite
had already been announced right
certainly very excited about bioshock
infinite but that eventually would get
pushed to next year you know we knew
that there was a call of duty game
coming out we knew as houses great
theory was going to come out at that
point we didn't know what it was going
to be
so you know in January was still sort of
up in the air but we did have a few of
these early games Mass Effect 3 being
one of them that you know we knew
exactly like all the top level details
and we knew what was coming out so you
know we sort of had those initial ideas
and but as it happens Mass Effect 3 was
not the best game that I played the
earliest best game that I played so what
was journey sure now when was journey
where was journey I don't remember the
exact release date but I played journey
about a week before I played mass effect
3 okay and journey because i have
journey as as early march okay so may I
mean I think release date wise yes
factory came out first well mass effect
was March as well as march six ebel ok
so that German was the weekend right but
I play a journey first and love that
game holy crap fight it I did I I
enjoyed it i think i'm sorry i don't
want to take away the ways that you were
gonna say i mean we talked about like
and it's corny but we talked about like
an emotional connection with games right
and for a game with no dialogue and
that's only about an hour and a half to
two hours long to like put me through
the ringer like journey did uh it is
really damn hard and it really you know
still sticks with me really uh it was
the very first ten that polygon ever
gave courtesy me but yeah i thought that
game was tremendous I I enjoyed it i I
just and don't get me wrong I I do I'll
just full disclosure I do have it in my
top 10 year I just think that's beaks of
the year that maybe wasn't as that maybe
didn't deliver as much as people thought
it would but i-i-i don't take anything
away from the game I enjoyed the game um
I just I just failed to like understand
why it was such a mind blowing at you
we've had these indie sort of games
before better three hours or whatever
they are and they're very artsy I don't
what was it about journey that made it
stand out of other so then like their
game flow or
okay so flow and flower weren't really
games I mean they were very interactive
screen saver right essentially and they
also weren't tremendously fun right um I
think a better comparison would be
journey to limbo because they're both
really Miller in the same you think
journey and limbo or similar and not in
terms of the gameplay terms of like how
you're feeling while you're playing them
okay um but but journey looked like I
don't know like in terms of the music
and in terms of the graphics looked
stunningly gorgeous to me and like
schooling you and the stuff they did
with co-op I thought was brilliant where
you can talk to people that you met as
you were playing right um the way I
think of it is if i set a game into
space and two to four people that had
never played a video game before this is
what i put on the i don't know a some
magic satellite and aliens pick it up
and what's so great about journey is
that it requires no like video game
prowess whatsoever to get through it
right and still you have like a hardcore
gamer like me has a really good time
casual gamers have a real good time
playing it it is one of those like great
equalizer games and anyone with ps3
absolutely should play it because it's
tremendous I i agree anyone with a ps3
should play it it's there's something
very it's very whimsical yeah very Airy
I mean obviously the games all sort
about like fabrics and stuff like that I
mean I I did enjoy I just failed to to
be at that level where some people write
that include yourself do not get me
wrong this is a top 10 game yep 2012 for
sure hey what I'm not saying it was my
top right not saying it was mine is your
top 10 easily that deficit op.10 will
you know maybe top 50 cuz the list said
that a little lower than he's a tough
tough year there's a few really really
good games um games you know we'll get
to a lot more games in the show today
games aren't the only big thing of 2012
hardware was a huge deal people don't
realize there were two consoles released
in 2012 yeah uh most recently the wii u
then back in February the world got
introduced to the PlayStation Vita yep
which feels like it was three years ago
yeah
know what that's about um so I think
PlayStation Vita februari 2012 and
PlayStation Vita December 2012 our night
and freaking day I think don't get me
wrong I I don't say I drank the kool-aid
yeah but I was in to this system when
it's a great piece of hardware it's a
great piece of hardware it provides it
can do some unbelievable visuals on a
very small screen yep a small screen
that is super responsive awesome to play
it where it also touches responsive in
terms of what you know look if you when
you play around in that and that OS on
board it's just as smooth as I that's a
lie that's what I'm going to say well
you're going to be wrong come on it's on
the on the OS it's pretty good it's
pretty responsive it's good it's not iOS
good yeah because nothing can touch that
it's richer nothing can touch um but you
know I'm impressed with that and when
when that touching functionality is
inserted into games I don't think it
really now did what they may be were
envisioning now it still feels like a
gimmick there's I've not played a touch
game on Vita where it doesn't feel like
jammed in there right just as soon use
the buttons the only good thing is a lot
of get that game developers realize this
and make the touch controls optional
right which is fine like that's the way
to handle it that is the way to handle
it um so that PlayStation Vita launches
with 25 games which I thought were
awesome I thought I mean a lot of those
were awesome i thought along is a very
very good one yeah even games that like
weren't even uh major titles franchises
that people are familiar even stuff like
tales from space that mutant blau that
game was tremendous really good way to
it they're a good five or six like
really really good vita games oiii I
won't argue more Raymond Super Stardust
Delta uncharted I mean that's just for
the first four right off the bat okay
okay you had the new wipeout ask a plan
I thought game wasn't good you didn't
think escape plan was good I enjoyed it
and I was a little let down but I
enjoyed it yeah um I think you also had
a great port
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom yep Mortal
Kombat was rather good poor I mean I
winded they were good ports but we'd
played this game sure it was not on when
necessary fair enough a handful of good
titles worth getting no one bought this
thing was like oh there's nothing to
play right like what happened with the
3ds sir odd last year for the Wii U or
the or the wii u couple months ago arm
so i mean i think coming out of the gate
it was it looked like okay there's a lot
of promise here the store seem to work
really well yep that whole ecosystem
they set up around the console seem to
work and perform really well all that
stuff still is the case but that hasn't
changed the only thing that has changed
is the amount of software and that is
where we are we are right now uh it's
just falling off it's it's a freakin
desert yeah on it's bad Assassin's Creed
was forgettable yeah call of duty the
classified is one of the worst things
I've ever played out an entire life
abysmal and that easily makes the worst
of prefer this year yeah for that list I
mean what happened essentially that is
the challenge of launching a console you
have all these deals that you make to
get like a bunch of games out at launch
and then there's a year or a year and a
half where you know you're developing
new games for the console and all those
people that worked with you before are
working on those new games or they're
waiting to see how well does and maybe
not make a new gaming right so that's I
mean we're in that I've every nuke at
the console suffers that like the xbox
360 the first year was awful yeah every
new consoles like that the question is
is that going to turn around based on
Sony's talking about it it doesn't sound
like they have grand plans for the veto
it's all coming next year it's a little
upsetting that they seem to have left it
out even from massive presentations like
III 2012 which was completely void of
any view to talk or significant view to
talk that I can remember save for saying
that there's going to be assassins creed
and call of duty you know they've sold
more than two and a half million copies
of this thing if you nuh to this thing
what are all those two and a half
million people going to do a year from
now yeah it's a good question I
hope they what I like to see is more of
this buy it on ps3 and you get a digital
copy on Vita right which they're
starting to do with some of these games
I think that's a really smart idea and I
know that they're putting on a focus on
sony Mobile which will allow any
developers to develop for Sony right I
station Vita and sell on the foot vita
store which is a good idea but it's you
know not a solution it's sort of a male
middle ground yeah and hoping like
Indies take that responsibility away
from you which could happen but probably
not it's it's a it's a difficult sort of
thing to to navigate I feel like a lot
of people do not realize how difficult
it is to sort of get momentum building
behind a freshly launched console it's
very very hard for sure um so let's take
a break from the hardware and we'll get
back to that with we you in a little bit
let's talk about some of the great games
that did get released in 2012 I have a
little list that I always like to
consult that I'm constantly making
throughout the entire year I think one
of the biggest surprises in my opinion
was the walking debt oh absolutely i
think the walking dead you know you have
telltale games behind that a company
that is is known for you know stuff like
Sam and Max um they're known for taking
franchises and maybe car tuning up a
little bit worse like they're
essentially known as a seven company
that seven I mean for years and years
they put out seven games yeah i'm at a
ten yeah and with walking dead I don't
know what happened but they got the
right the right writers for that they
got a really good like gameplay style
that like felt active will also like
looking cool and fitting with like
classic adventure games but feeling more
modern it was really like a perfect
storm and I don't think anyone expected
it I don't think anyone expected it and
you know the Walking Dead is easily one
of my best games of the year yeah um I
think people who would really won me
over and I know you are the same way
we're both pretty regimented readers of
The Walking Dead comic book yeah
and I think the reason that book works
so well is because it doesn't really
focus on the gore as much as you think
it would it's a black and white book so
obviously things like gore don't come
across as effectively as maybe they
wouldn't color their arm it's more about
the people and their human reaction than
it is the actual zombie outbreak the
video game is able to convey that
sentiment with such precision I would
say more so than episodes 1 and 2 of The
Walking Dead although I think season 3
happens to be pretty pretty damn good
and at the time when it first came out
when that first episode of the video
game came out I was like you know this
is better than the TV show yeah and I
don't know what it is there's not a lot
of game play in this game but if there's
something about it's sort of point and
click adventure yeah with a couple of
shooting elements may be tucked in here
and there it Sam it really is amazing
well the thing is I mean when you think
about adventure games you've never
really played too many adventure games
that are essentially choose your own
adventure right and that's what this is
every decision that you're making
granted they hide some of these
decisions where it's going to end up the
same matter what but for the most part
you're having a major impact on how the
story plays out so your mind sort of
shifts into this mode of how would I me
myself literally handle this situation
right and we've seen stuff like this and
games like from bioshock have bio air
and stuff like that but we've never seen
this sort of impact on a story like you
might get a different cut scene at the
end or green explosions or the right
effects a red exposure right oh yeah
like moments a moment you know you're
deciding who lives who dies yeah who
gets food who doesn't get food and those
decisions play out in the game and it
makes experience whether it was walking
dead weather was any franchise it makes
the experience so much more investing
relatable and so I think they're doing a
fantastic job I wouldn't be surprised of
a lot of companies follow suit with
different franchises doing this sort of
style of game for sure I'm actually
personally surprised that there stay
sort of stopped it after episode 5 what
done it's not done done but there this
is like season one yeah so it does make
sense that they would have a season two
and that sort of thing yeah I don't
think they would necessarily just keep
going every month or two months whatever
they were doing forever I think it's a
good idea to take a whatever six-month
break or so for sure that and it's a
great platform I mean they started in
April yep the last episode episode 54
season one came out uh you know like a
week ago yeah it really is a brilliant
way to get a game out that's not
expensive at all it's really the first
time I've seen the episodic nature of a
game release really work and in that it
did it just really work so i think
that's awesome and don't forget it's a
downloadable game so it's not one of
those $60 disk games I think you had a
lot of success with games like that this
year you had trials evolution which was
awesome breaking you had mark of the
ninja yep was on game awesome my name I
top five easily uh you talk to uh we
talked about journey earlier before I
thought Fez was okay I thought Fez was
bad at the feds was you know I did not
have high hopes for that game okay well
a lot of people do not I didn't a lot of
people did but other people did and I
was I'm like a little bit of a technical
snob sure and technically just in terms
of creativity and like the game design
is a very cool game but technically it's
a mess like slow down crashes all sorts
of stuff like that and if you watch
indie game the movie yeah you you you
don't you don't have any true compassion
for but you are you like know where it's
all coming out so apparently that fish
guy just might hope it just a disaster
with with the with the back into this
game even something like sound shapes of
sound shapes oh it was okay to Evita and
ps3 yep a sort of thing obviously we
have to talk about one downloadable game
yeah but I'm sure then this is the game
that I said it's doubly on your list
okay I thought you're talking about call
of duty say it spelunky spelunky
tremendous game you I've never seen real
freak out about a game more than
spelunky so much so that it's even on
the television in your freaking oh yeah
this is my host sort of thing in your
polygon
feature that they ran a couple weeks ago
yep so explain to us why and I
definitely agreed is in some okay for
everyone it's not absolutely admit it's
not for everyone spunky is essentially
like if you think of super mario
brothers but every time you play it is
randomized but you know how to handle so
essentially it's training you to handle
situations like oh I know what a Goomba
does he just walks from right to left
and I jump on him right but in sluggy
the levels are completely randomized so
essentially you're just every time you
play it's a new experience but you're
constantly learning how things interact
with one another how enemies interact
with one another and using items and you
know different equipment to survive
through the game and if you don't
survive you start from scratch which is
the point of contention that a lot of
people have it's very I mean it's one of
the most hardcore games ever played and
i'm pleased to admit as say that i beat
it and it was it's probably my proudest
gaming at you not only did you beat it
yeah you you did like the crazy yeah
crazy chief village it ending yeah this
is like a crazy super hidden ending that
requires like another extra four levels
at the end of the game and uh but it is
I've not played a game that was like
that rewarding in terms of just my skill
level increasing every time i played
comparing compare comparing it to mario
brothers is almost unfair it's the only
way people can understand that it's a
platform that it's a platformer that's
randomly generated yeah it's sort of
like a way to ground it because it
really does not feel like any other game
you've played yeah but it's terrific I
think it might be on sale now if you
haven't picked it up definitely worth
checking out other games that we sort of
dug over I guess we can sort of get away
from the the downloadable games right is
there any other downloadable game that
sort of stood out for you and one second
i'm pretty sure that's everything there
was a there was a you know that's pretty
much it you gotta respect the fact that
they they're still pushing that sort of
stuff and I think you know it's almost
it's the thing is is that you give you
know independent developers it's like
you can hit it you can really hit it big
if you have a game that Microsoft is
psyched about and they'll put it in your
summer of arcade thing you can really
stand to make a lot of money yeah of
something like that for sure oh I do
want to mention an iOS game that i
really like yeah its punch quest punch
quest tell me it does i have and tell me
about punch quest so punch quest is sort
of like canabalt you know the game where
you jump from rooftop through yeah yeah
totally Cannibal but you're punching
enemies and surviving for as long as you
can but instead of it just being like
temple run where it's like the grind and
it's the same every time there are
roguelike elements which is like
spelunky where there's a lot of
randomness and you know you're learning
how to deal with the enemies and you're
buying upgrades and you're buying new
hats which give you different powers and
stuff like that uh it was originally
launched as a free game I think they
increased it to add our okay but it's I
mean I put in dozens and dozens of hours
into that game so I think it's safe to
say the random generated stuff ask anna
is a theme that might be sticking around
yeah for sure I mean people like you're
essentially designing a game to be
played and replayed over and over again
for only like five minutes fans right
which is great for mobile um and if you
know even for like Vita it's really good
so I yeah I think it's here to stay
almost anything like what is spelunky on
iowa's spunky is not on iowa like why
well I think I i think the control
limitations would be the big problem
there oh right playing those games on
iphone suck um we want to go into pc
games real quick yeah this one
downloadable pc game that I really is it
the one seen one that I'm gonna say
possible let's see this is started with
a city it does not okay I was ok go
ahead five more years in FTL FTL did you
buy this game no oh my god FTL yep what
does that stand for faster than light
what kind of nerd are you FTL yeah I'm
writing it down litora on steam is a
once again randomly generated your
commanding a spaceship okay and you're
essentially ordering your little sort of
guys on the spaceship to like man guns
and man like the shields and stuff like
that and you come up against encounters
where your power
ring up shields and powering down guns
and trying to like take out other ships
and you're exploring the GAO it's really
tough to explain but you're exploring
the galaxy and you'll get a random
encounter where it's like oh you've
arrived at a planet with wasn't horse
shaped creatures yeah you go and pet
them or do you steal them on your ship
interest and it's random so depending on
what you do you might get you know a
bonus where new crew member joins you
might get a bunch of money or the horse
creatures might go insane and kill two
of your crew members it's really pretty
cool all right I'll check it out I was
talking about Miami haha oh ya allah
Miami is that it is a holla Miami right
I have a dyslexic sorta thing I deal
with yeah I really play it you didn't
play it's I've only played a little of
it yet but there was something there
that I that I just really I've dug the
whole retro sort of thing a lot of
people sort of chalk it up as like Miami
as like vice city right um but it's
definitely something worth checking out
if you don't have too much of a budget
and you're looking for something that
could provide a good amount of replay
value yeah FTL's the same way check it
out yeah so definitely those two games
um I'm just looking on a few sites that
sort of you know they they they ranked
all the top rated games i'm looking at
gamerankings calm right now for the top
game of 2012 yeah they have at 93.7 is
persona 4 golden you play this game no
I've never played any persona games yeah
we've one of my fellow staff members
griffin mcelroy is a huge persona fan
and recently tried to explain to me why
like what is going on in a persona game
feels weird that we don't know yeah and
I feel a little guilty and I I do I'm
gonna download this one because people
seem to love it but it's it's a weird
like universally loved game that I guess
I just need to experience I I just I'm
is on paper it sounds make a lame it
sounds beyond lame right it's just
something I just can't I can't hang with
ya I don't know I don't get it but
nevertheless it is it's like the highest
review game of 2012 so if you're going
just by the numbers that's the game yep
all right we got we got to make some
headway here in a couple of these lists
I'm just going to start rolling through
them
44 good stuff diablo 3 yeah pretty good
yeah not smiling not amazing not amazing
I don't think yeah I think some people
were a little disappointed but i liked
it i had fun with it but it wasn't a
game change with the diablo 2 you think
it's a top 10 may not be a top 10 I
kinda I'm kind of waiting I haven't
figured out my exact top 10 but yeah I
have seven on my list then Diablo is not
in that seven agreed max payne 3 good
game good game i really enjoyed it um
you know again uh i don't know i think
it was better than i was expecting it to
me um and I really liked it a lot but I
don't know that it necessarily stands
out like right now as like a year ending
game okay III think I know I feel like
it it was better for me as an overall
experience in LA noir oh yeah for sure I
liked it a lot more and i thought the
gump i felt really good I think there's
something about those games that they
they're able to do something with that
all the time effect i was just let down
by the story like i thought the gameplay
was good but this story just didn't
really go story was a little lacking
i'll definitely agree with you there we
talked about walking dead we talked
about trials uh uh here's one for you oh
boy we're on your list is borderlands 2
it's not on my leg it's not on your list
really yeah Wow because polar ends to is
personally yeah one of my top four of
the year I like Borderlands 2 i'm
obsessed with that game yeah i think the
issue that i have with borderlands 2 and
the writing is tremendous and i have fun
playing it especially in coop it's one
of the best co-op games around uh it's
so mindless like so in love with how
mindless it is mmm that when i play that
and then i play a game like well we
haven't gotten to it yet but far cry 3
or dishonored even mark of the ninja
like games with that like are so deep in
with like really cool gameplay mechanics
whereas this essentially just doesn't
have that level of depth to it it's so
service but don't you think there's
something to be said for having such an
unbelievable formula that is that
resonates with everyone
is so addictive and so yes it's very its
inception formula sure right but I'm
just saying they've / fav Dave and even
coming from the first Borderlands that
this is in my opinion such an
improvement to also i don't think that
it was that much of a jumble okay
obviously there were improvements sure
but i was expecting more uh more
character development options more
variety uh you know the guns continue to
be cool but in the end it just it felt
like a lot more of four lines one I
thought it was written better this time
really write a really really likable
character yet the writing was excellent
um yeah it's just there's something
about borderlands they just did it for
me this yeah um obviously dishonored
yeah needs to be talked about that's
definitely my top five dishonored is
good for me the sounds going to have a
tough time being beat for number one
I'll be honest it's it's a it's a
definite possibility for me as you know
this honor is an amazing game I a
perfect game for people that like are so
so on stealth games this is like a great
game till I get you into the donger yeah
awesome world really cool like look of
the game the story like just like the
story of this world that you're in I
just found fascinating yeah yeah they
did an amazing job did you think that it
was necessarily a better you know sort
of uh like what bioshock two because
these are the guys that that designed
some of the sufferer bioshock two arkane
studios is that true yeah another we
talked about this when Scott Stein was
on remember oh NOS gustan Scott Jones I
don't remember when you in schedule haze
you remember him being here you remember
that that hold that whole week of your
life was a blur I don't yeah it's all
it's dark you got you got to admit there
are similarities there yeah no I mean I
see similarities with because I know the
art director is the same from half-life
right I definitely see similarities
there um yeah sure but I mean what ideas
wholly original I don't mind I some
similarities I thought that the city
itself really stood out as like a new
place right that feel like anything I'd
ever
agreed agreed for sure I think people
are going to be surprised to see how
highly receive they may be placed on top
10 lists halo 4 will be I can't really
comment because I haven't really played
it okay in my opinion yeah halo 4
provides one of the best single player
campaigns this year which is great
because I'm that's what I play those
games for not a huge halo multiplayer
guy right and I really like to reach for
its campaign even three I thought was
good for the kids three was okay yeah um
yeah so I'm really looking forward to
that uh but yeah I everybody okay fair
enough um let's get to what about
Darksiders 2 yeah pretty good you think
that's up there I don't know if it's my
top 10 but it was a very good game like
a lot of fun I i liked the advancement
like that was the sort of expansion on
the idea that i was hoping for the
Lanston right which was you know the
original game was essentially Zelda but
this game added you know a bunch of cool
loot stuff added like a lot of more a
lot more character customization right a
lot more exploration stuff so yeah I
mean that's a sequel for you but
definitely I agree definitely added
definitely was a more complete sequel
yep then perhaps any other game this
year including Borderlands 2 they
totally RPG eyes a lot of the elements
that weren't really there the first time
around yep and I thought was really good
I thought Sleeping Dogs was good I
didn't play it you didn't play it now
Sleeping Dogs was sort of you know it
was a GTA clone there's no getting
around that but there with with an
excellent fighting system the opinion so
another game to check out really the
best games of the year we're kind of
like in the middle of the year this year
yep you know if you don't include
Darksiders uh I'm sorry if you don't
include far cry 3 and and dishonored and
halo yeah and halo far cry 3 men we're
playing it now oh boy awesome right
tremendously good this might be my
number one no whoa really it might be
it's up there it's definitely not five
okay I'm with you it's a great game as a
top right for me but but aren't you a
little bummed out as to how there's
certain things that are just a little
annoying I think there's I don't think
the menu system should be laid out
better no I think the menus it's really
smart you don't think it's it's it's
takes one too many button pushes it
snappy it works fast I don't like the
fact that I have to like go through nine
different layers to craft something is
that something I'm doing all the time I
think that's only because it's the
beginning of the game in your constant
like crafting like base level things no
but I think no I mean I've been playing
it for a really long time okay i think
you know like i like I you know in the
beginning when you make your you're
bigger rucksacks and all your stuff like
that I just think it takes too long to
get to all that stuff I think it might
be because I'm coming off of Assassin's
Creed 3 we're managing those men you
even talk about them again we threw need
to measure imagining those menus is
honestly the most torturous experience
I've had this year it's almost like they
were designed to be deliberately
confusing yeah right it's so vexing the
funniest thing is that far cry 3 has so
many of the components that this house
is creed 3 heads on paper right off like
crafting power rating client on the time
well there weren't really are there oh
yeah there were surely right okay but a
far cry 3 does it so much better yeah
and it's just funny because they're both
ubisoft game yeah i mean different
totally different studios the only
different teams yeah that's what you get
that's what you get is so bizarre right
yeah very strange I'm trying to think of
we've left any out for the good games I
mean I would say that black ops 2 is the
best multiplayer black ops multiplayer
call duty game ever played it's funny
I'm very good at this multiplayer for
like I we got better at it to that I've
ever been it well yeah I know why is it
because we've been playing that serious
for so long I think it also cause it
ain't it is more of encouragement to not
necessarily be like running and gunning
yeah which I'm terrible at right you can
just shoot down UAVs and get points
right I am I think I really do think and
we're going to nerd out a little bit i
think the whole score streak yeah is
really the smartest thing they've done
with his franchise in a decade I mean
they to incentivize
teamwork right and incentivize doing
things for the better the team and not
your stupid kill death writing is really
really solid pick 10 stuff is very cool
pic 10 is great whites customization
stuff like that I really do like it and
you know let's hope these new maps that
come along or are good but I always feel
like by the third by the second map pack
I'm done you know yeah I like treyarch
games because they mix it up with
multiplayer maps and zombies maps yeah
so it's sort of you know by the time
multiplayer zombies comes around again
you're sort of ready for it I one
complaint I think the the I don't know
what a 12 maps that came at the game I
think some of them just look too much
alike magic I just think yeah I think
like there are a couple other couple
that just sort of feel like the same
thing something you've seen before
broken down city yeah broken and city
yet up there's a bunch of paper flying
everywhere yeah up what a plane crash
the middle of the bore okay that's great
that's what's gonna happen there yeah so
maybe too much of that all right it's
time to really get pissed at some of the
games that really did doc says here
that's great three okay week and you
know I'm with you man I'm with you
thanks peso an assassin's creed 3 to me
as a as a games journalist I've I'm more
perplexed with the high praise that this
game has gotten seemingly universally it
not totally universally but it is more
than your cross the board yet it's more
than you know uh even from you know I
mean we we didn't review it because that
was during sandy uh you guys gave it a
pretty high school um i think is an
eight point right that's that's high
that's hot yep i just don't see it I
just don't see it I don't understand why
this game continually and this franchise
well sad agree to was better yeah ok so
the Jeff as a person that hates
Assassin's Creed games can't really
comment on this no all right I've liked
pretty much every is that I even like
Assassin's Creed one I didn't love it
but I liked it this is the worst
Assassin's Creed game that's ever been
made agreed it is a slow-paced it
removes a lot of the like fun climbing
stuff that made as has this great games
assess the crew game ship it takes about
eight to nine hours to get into the main
story it's a very long and then once
you're in the main story none of the
story missions are all that
interesting so when you go to do side
missions you get even less interesting
wish like it's it's just bad game design
piled on bad game design yeah definitely
a bummer is very pretty sure i'll give
it that and very pretty and look if if
if a high school kids skipping class and
going to play assassin's creed 3 i'm
okay with that because he might get a
little bit of history i'll learn they
might get a tiny tiny bit of history out
of that and i think that's a win-win
situation yeah um we talked about before
call duty on vida oh god that was awful
i just it just makes you just slap your
forehead and and put your put your head
in your hands based on what i've heard
it was a bit of a deal with sony hmm
essentially sony had to deal with
activision which is why nihilistic
instead of activision made that game
right so you know it's a little it's it
reeks a little bit of cash in sure which
is shocking to me that activision would
do that with their most beloved
franchises right crap for that pahlavi
doubt but yeah you know to you and to
you and I that is okay and we sort of
say okay you get a pass yeah but for the
average gamer who does not know the
politics behind any of this that's awful
it's really gonna leave a bad taste and
especially yeah because a lot of people
were going to wake up on Christmas
morning and their loved one is going to
buy them call duty betta right because
they love call in the bundle their
pitching is a boil they're gonna be
pissed yeah it's bad and and you can't
even get around like oh it's I can I can
play this now it's almost unplayable
yeah um I guess you gotta you gotta talk
about res needle 6 oh god you got to
talk about Resident Evil 6 because
resident evil 6 was straight up one of
the disappointing games I played all
year really yeah is you expected it to
be so good ah there we knew that game
there was a year ago look there was a
little bit of hope what I played at at
e3 the the leon level because that's the
best part so even that level was so
linear and dull there's been yeah it was
definitely bad um you know it look I
it's not as bad as operation Raccoon
City that's okay give you that which
which is shocking and I can't believe
that there's going to be two resident
evil games on my worst games 2012 list
but there will be yeah um man oh man you
gotta mention kinect star wars in that
lavoie kinect Star Wars what I don't
know that that the han solo song is
pretty good I I just don't know yeah I
just don't know what was going on but
look a lot of people spend a lot of
years of their lives working on these
ready for more of them brought to you by
Disney a medal of honor warfighter do
you think that deserves to be a worst
game of 2012 I don't think anyone had
any expectations that that was going to
be good hmm so I mean it's throwing out
a disappointment it's just sort of you
know it delivered that low bar for the
course I think next year yeah we'll have
another battlefield game and then the
expectations will go up right and we'll
see um I'm gonna feel about Ninja Gaiden
oh I didn't play Sigma with every time
ninja game 3 yeah um I I was really let
down by that I there's something about
those games in recent years the the
level of difficulty I've really been
able to respect couldn't get down with
this third one yeah I near the the wii u
1 is actually an improvement i think i
rid of a lot of the like no you disagree
I I did not totally love what I played
okay but hey it is what it is yeah um
does anything stand out to you as some
of the really big disappointments of
2012 we also didn't talk about um didn't
talk about need for speed most wanted oh
yeah I've I think that was a really good
game okay I'm with you on that it takes
a little bit of sort of get into yeah
but uh really rewarding yeah at the end
of that very cool um and want to talk
about this to lollipop chainsaw oh I
didn't you didn't play that now I I'm
with I'm in that small sort of group
that initiated it okay wanted it to be
better wanted it to be a shadow of the
damn that game was terrific terrific but
unfortunately
just kind of fell short you have that
that's right all right I think we sort
of got through everything man yeah you
have a whirlwind a bit of a whirlwind I
don't think we missed any forex com oh I
