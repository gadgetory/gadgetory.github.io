world the largest cable provider in the
u.s. is now selling mobile phone service
it's called Xfinity mobile and it's
launching in the middle of this year
Comcast did not actually build out its
own network instead it is using
Verizon's network and blending that
coverage with Comcast's existing 16
million Wi-Fi hotspots now not anyone
can get this service it is limited to
those who already do get Comcast home
internet service that means areas
without Comcast like New York and Los
Angeles are not eligible Comcast has
roughly twenty nine million existing
customers and hopes to convince those
customers to tack on another service
with its attractive pricing bundles yeah
it's always about that bundle unlimited
data can cost $65 or $45 a line
depending on how much the person already
pays for home internet there's also the
option to pay for data ala carte at $12
a gig and sharing that data across all
devices in a family but Comcast is not
doing much else to convince you to
switch for example it's not going to pay
your early termination fees internet
providers are hungry to watch over you
on every network you're using to consume
their media we're seeing the same thing
over at 18 teen Verizon both are also
creating media and selling you the
access to watch it Comcast says it will
be selling the service on the latest
Apple Samsung and LG smart phones and
the idea is that the phone could
instantly login to your xfinity TV
account to stream video from your phone
