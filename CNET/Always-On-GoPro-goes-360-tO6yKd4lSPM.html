things that look super difficult to
create but are actually really easy to
accomplish as you see more and more
views videos show up online you might be
wondering how you two can join in on the
fun well I'm here at TechShop in San
Francisco and I've been building my own
time-lapse contraption that will help
you make one of these videos for less
than 10 bucks here's what you'll need
you'll need a GoPro camera or another
camera that can do a time-lapse function
crazy glue or super glue a wind up
kitchen timer a quarter-inch nut which
have already attached the timer with
super glue some sticky putty or blue
tack and your tripod of choice now our
task is to attach the camera to the
kitchen timer and the kitchen timer to
the tripod if you have a GoPro mount it
makes things really easy but if you
don't here's how you do it I've already
attached the quarter-inch nut to the
kitchen timer so the tripod fits in
perfectly and this is a standard size so
a quarter-inch nut is probably what your
tripod takes - now you'll take some blue
tack or museum putty and we'll roll it
up this is what we'll use to attach the
camera to the kitchen timer so that you
don't render it completely useless and
if you want to cook with it later on you
can alright on goes the putty and to
that the GoPro let's make sure it's on
there you go so the way it works is
we'll wind it up and it'll rotate taking
your time ops video and when it's done
you'll even get a ring okay the next
thing we need to do is set up the time
lapse on the GoPro I'll set it up to
take one photo every two seconds now in
order for us to figure out how long this
video will be we have to do some math
we're taking one photo every two seconds
that's 30 photos per minute 30 times 30
minutes that we're shooting is 900
photos now if one frame is one photo and
there are 30 frames per second we'll get
a 30 second video I deserve a prize for
that
okay our time-lapse tripod is ready to
go our camera is set and the last thing
we need to do is make sure this thing is
level so you can use a standard leveling
tool or if you want to get geeky
download a leveling up I've got one here
on my iPhone and you need to bring it
down a little bit bring it up a little
bit
and it's perfectly level okay let's take
this into the streets of San Francisco
and shoot our time-lapse video
all right our GoPro ran for 30 minutes
and now it's time to make our time lapse
video so I uploaded all these photos
onto my computer and as you can see
we've got a folder full of hundreds of
photos now there is lots of software
that'll let you make time-lapse video
but the easiest one and the fastest
honestly is QuickTime Pro so I'll open
that up go to file open image sequence
we'll find my folder there it is open
and at this point you can decide if you
want 30 frames per second or 60 frames
per second at 60 frames it will be a lot
smoother but you only have half the
length of the video let's stick with 30
and you'll see that QuickTime has
already done all of the work it actually
already put the video together but let's
just preview it to make sure it looks
right that looks good it's a little
rough but once it renders and exports
it'll look a lot better so let's do that
right now we're gonna file export
give it a name call it time lapse
and you have some options here there are
a lot of settings to choose from you can
really dig in here but one of the
settings that you want to pay attention
to is compression type make sure you're
exporting as a JPEG one of the other
things you might want to tweak is the
quality so the higher quality the large
and file will be I'll go ahead and
choose high not quite best but it'll
look pretty good okay okay
and it'll export
all right our video has exported and
we've got a 30-second time lapse with a
180 degree pan ready for uploading on
YouTube or even Vimeo and it's all
things to our time-lapse accessory with
our GoPro camera alright let's give this
thing a look now how Pro does that look
and now you know how cheap and easy it
is to make your own time lapse accessory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
