google+ today we're introducing 41 new
features across three major areas of
google+ first a new newly designed
stream a new hangouts application and a
fundamentally new photos experience what
you're going to see start rolling out
later today is the new Google Plus which
looks like this
you can see we've taken that
multi-column design and brought it to
the desktop and really made something
beautiful it's dynamic meaning depending
upon the size of your screen it can
either be one column to column or three
columns and we've made sure to give you
choice so if you go under the more menu
you're always able to go to a single
column if that's what you prefer of
course in this multi-column design we've
made sure that posts like photos and
videos can span multiple columns so you
get something that's truly immersive and
we made sure that it's fast fluid and
fun and so we put delightful animations
throughout the product for example a
share box that animates out menus that
slide in and out to get out of the way
and even cards and that flip and fade
beautifully and today we're introducing
related hashtags what we'll do is we'll
analyze the content of a post and Google
will put on the appropriate hashtag how
does that work well let's take a look
here's a post about the San go giants
baseball team it's not just about that
it's about buster posey a particular
player as well and note in the top we've
automatically tag that post and we know
it's about those two topics but that's
only half of the magic we also then rank
and search the entire universe of
Google+ content and we rank it just for
you so when that clicks on one of those
hashtags watch what happens we flip the
card over and we then show you related
items from the most important sources
and social proximity to you amazing
isn't it
now if you think that's impressive let's
take a look at another one of these
posts in this case one of the noted
photographers on our service has posted
a picture of Paris in particular the
Eiffel Tower nowhere in his post or in
the comments is the word Eiffel Tower
but if you notice google has
automatically hashtag this with the
Eiffel Tower how did we do that well we
did image analysis and combined with the
knowledge graph that recognizes
important landmarks and Google knew that
this was about the Eiffel Tower so if
you click y you can just go deeper and
click through other posts about the ipad
power
of course we deeply respect the content
producer and so you always have the
option of telling Google either on a
particular post or globally whether you
want your content to have this amazing
related hashtags feature and if we ever
get it wrong and have the wrong hashtag
you could always exit out so we're
introducing today a new application
hangouts and we think we've built a
product that is about conversations that
last with people that you love now
you're looking here at a list of
conversations not contacts some of those
conversations are one-on-one some of
those conversations are group
conversations but the primary pivot the
focus is on those conversations now if
Matt wants to get to his contacts maybe
he wants to add someone it's one tap
away you can see Google will rank the
important people that he normally talks
to and make that easily available for
either a message or a video call but
let's go back to the conversations
there's several attributes about these
conversations that are that I want to
talk about the first is my favorite and
that is these conversations can be
long-lasting so as matt goes back in
time why you're able to see that
conversation imagine that you have your
family in a conversation for many months
or a year there's the holiday party
there's the vacation you took together
there's important moments like a like
the birth of a child all those things
are stored with you even as I even as
you change devices in those long-running
conversations of course we give you the
ability to turn off history of course we
give you the ability to delete those
things but having the ability to save
those conversations is I think
delightful and amazing another aspect is
that the conversations are rich and
alive your photos are stored in albums
this is amazing this baby's not even
three months old and he's already
learned how to facepalm okay but all the
images that you shared as a family are
all right there in addition to beautiful
images that are easily stored and saved
the conversation feels alive look at the
bottom you can there see as people join
they show up as they're typing they
annum
out you can see exactly where someone
has read to it really feels like you're
in the same room together and we think
that's that's delightful by the way
you're looking at it on the web you're
looking at it on Android and you're
looking at it on iOS all available today
and by the way to other points one is
the point that Hugo made I think you're
going to love how the notifications are
all synced so if you wipe a notification
from the desktop or an engine on Android
it'll go away on another device it's
beautiful I think you'll like that but
my favorite feature sorry about that and
let's go back to the demo one other
feature I didn't talk about that was
pretty critical which is at Google we've
always believed that the best way to do
real-time communications is face to face
to face and so in that conversation Matt
can tap on the video icon and everyone
in that conversation will be dropped
into a video chat there you can see Matt
he's into the video chat and everyone's
being dropped in group video at no
charge isn't that fantastic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
