begun I'm Richard Carey and this is your
cnet update a couple of app perks are
popping up in the news today Facebook
has updated its messenger app for the
iPhone and iPod touch allowing people in
the US to make free voice calls over
Wi-Fi or data connection to their
Facebook friends that means ipod touch
users have another way to turn their
touch into a phone or iphone users can
use it to save money while over a Wi-Fi
connection this feature was first made
available to Canadian users as a test
but is now coming out to the state's
iphone users also confined by music from
amazon amazon launched its mp3 store for
iphone and ipod touch users but the
catch is that purchases have to be made
through the Safari web browser not
through any of Amazon's apps so you'll
have to go to amazon.com / mp3 it's
still not as smooth as doing it straight
through itunes but hey it's another
option and any music bought from amazon
is automatically accessible in the cloud
player app which works across multiple
devices the cloud storage service
mediafire is now available as an app for
android and what makes it interesting is
that it gives you 50 gigs of free online
storage space with no strings attached
the app already has been out for iOS
users mediafire lets you view documents
and photos stream audio watch videos and
share files with others but unlike
Dropbox there's no option to do a batch
upload and everything has to be uploaded
manually and Yelp the website that has
user ratings on restaurants and
businesses will now be adding health
code ratings for restaurants in San
Francisco and New York where these
scores are already posted in front of
stores Yelp is working with governments
to import the grades given to these
establishments by now you've heard of
the controversy surrounding the fake
girlfriend of notre dame linebacker
manti te'o as of this report there are
still questions that need to be answered
but the gist of it is that he says he
was a victim of a social media hoax and
something referred to as catfishing
where someone created a fake social
media profile and poses as a made-up
person to lure someone into an online
relationship the football player Te'o
says for a year he
this girl was a real person and they
talked online and over the phone and he
also believed her when she told them she
got in a car accident I was fighting
leukemia it even became a news story
when this person died of leukemia on a
game day the concept of falling in love
with someone over social media even a
person isn't real has everyone talking
so I want to hear from you have you been
involved in catfishing or know someone
who has or do you believe it's possible
to fall in love with someone over social
media send an email with your thoughts
to update at cnet com or you can shoot
me a quick video message using tout
that's your tech news update you can get
links to all the stories i mentioned at

studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
