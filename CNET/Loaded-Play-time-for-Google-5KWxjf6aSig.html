Carey on cnet com and it's time to get
loaded when you sign into your Google
account you'll notice a new option on
the menu bar called play google
introduced a new store for users to
download movies android apps music and
ebooks it's pretty much a rebranded
android marketplace with the addition of
google music and the google ebook store
the big goal for google was to put all
their digital content on place and now
that it's in the menu bar it's easy to
find and Google could be adding another
feature soon a commenting system tied to
google plus tech blog the next web is
reporting that Google is working on a
commenting system that would be similar
to what facebook offers as you know some
new sites and blogs let you log in with
Facebook to leave a comment well Google
wants to make sure they're not left
behind and it's working to offer that
same option an xbox live update will be
available this week in early reports say
it will give live subscribers access to
HBO Go and comcast on demand video
service those who are already subscribe
to HBO would be able to access HBO's
on-demand content like Game of Thrones
which is premiering this week Xbox Live
has already released other apps for
on-demand video services including Hulu
Plus and ESPN if you have an HTC phone
be sure to backup all your contacts
messages and call history before the end
of April because the service that was
your backup HTC Sense is shutting down
erasing all data and getting renovated
users can go to HTC Sense calm to
download a zip file of all their data at
the end of April the service will no
longer be able to sync contacts and
messages and will no longer be able to
track or find a lost foam in the
meantime HTC phone owners are encouraged
to find another app that can do the job
Square the credit card reader for mobile
devices used by small business owners
has gotten a hardware update for
encryption reports ventureBeat devices
that compete with square like paypal
here already were encrypting credit card
numbers as they transferred from the
device to the payment app square now is
doing the same and shipping out readers
with encryption as you've heard the new
iPad can tap into 4G wireless networking
speeds but that's not the case in
Australia even though it's sold as a 4G
device the high speed networks in
Australia use a different 4G frequency
than with the iPad supports so the
Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission is taking apple to court
seeking fines and trying to stop the
sale of iPads down under over the
misleading title the apple stores and
Australia still call it a 4G model but
there's fine print saying its 4G only in
other countries those are your headlines
for today I'm Bridget Carey for cnet.com
