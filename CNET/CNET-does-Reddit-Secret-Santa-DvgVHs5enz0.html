to do the reddit gift exchange
Secret Santa style so this year a bunch
of us are going to put in the kind of
gifts that we want tell the redditors a
little bit about ourselves and then
hopefully get something really cool in
the mail but the best part is we are
also gonna send out gifts people so I'm
gonna fill in the form and see what I
get all right it's signing up I really
like ice cream
I love tech and photography ever being
abducted by space aliens not to my
knowledge

of my favorite foods how I said ice
cream enough

live in I think Frasier slightly
intellectual and always funny and absurd

matched with I'm really excited

know about them favorite video game

like circuit bent and homemade
instruments since music in general math
and physics he shirts oh so much to work
with here and love cats

at office and see what else we can find
