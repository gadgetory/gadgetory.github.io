indispensable composers people actors
countries whatever you need to know you
get a Wikipedia but for one 24-hour
period Wikipedia will close its virtual
doors and protests to two pieces of
national legislation a decision that
users say will have a large impact my
fiance's in college and he uses it as a
reference I'd say that a very important
source of knowledge would be taken away
for me and my family the US House of
Representatives bill is called Stop
Online Piracy Act or SOPA and it's pippa
in the Senate protect IP act what these
bills will do is require us internet
service providers to pretend that these
allegedly pirate websites don't
existence reversely disappear from the
internet the film and recording industry
support the legislation as well as CBS
Corporation parent of cnet and CBS News
but some internet companies like
Wikipedia and privacy advocates are
incensed it's the free speech
implications of this it's like saying
there are a few bad books in the library
so we'll just lock the entire library
dozens of other companies like Reddit
and Boing Boing or joining Wikipedia in
protest also google plants on a homepage
protest link you could have 10 million
phone calls to the US Congress sign one
day this has never happened before in
the history of American politics this
kind of direct intrnt inspired action
one company that will now be joining the
blackout is Twitter in a tweet CEO Dick
Costolo said that wikipedias decision
was foolish in San Francisco I'm Kara
Tsuboi cnet.com for CBS News</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
