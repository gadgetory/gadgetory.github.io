is trouble trouble trouble I'm Bridget
Carey this is your CNET update Apple is
changing how it's going to pay royalties
for musicians on its new music service
and all it took was a blog post from
Taylor Swift you see miss Swift holds
much sway in the music world she
criticized Apple in a tumblr post on
Sunday telling her fans that she's
taking her album 1989 off of the Apple
music streaming service when it launches
next week she did not approve of how
Apple would not pay royalties for any
song stream during a person's
three-month free trial
she wrote I find it to be shocking
disappointing and completely unlike this
historically progressive and generous
company the post continues to make the
point that it wasn't about her needing
the money but the principle of the
matter and the system can hurt new
artists that depend on those royalties
to get started
she wrote we don't ask you for free
iPhones please don't ask us to provide
you with our music for no compensation
well Apple certainly doesn't want any
bad blood between Taylor Swift so after
that post Apple quickly responded and
changed his policy Eddy Cue Apple's
executive that oversees iTunes and the
new music service took to Twitter to say
apples gonna pay artists during the free
trial q told reporters he personally
called Taylor Swift to tell her about
Apple's policy change and Swift posted
to Twitter that she's elated and
relieved but as of this report she has
not yet agreed to let Apple stream her
songs on the new service guess she's not
quite ready to shake it off
Apple music launches June 30th and after
the three month free trial it costs $10
a month the service lets you play any
song in the iTunes library on demand
Swift also has criticized Spotify and
pulled her music off that service
Spotify offers a free version with
advertisements you see it's a crowded
market now for music streaming and if
you don't have a big named artist like
Taylor Swift
it can be hard to win switching gears to
shopping Amazon is changing its customer
review system in the US to highlight
reviews that are supposed to be more
helpful to you and me so how does it
know what's more helpful a computer is
calculating different factors giving
more influence to new
reviews and anything written by a
verified Amazon purchaser it's also
taken into consideration
anything that is voted up by customers
all of this will also impact the 5-star
rating it used to be just a pure average
of all reviews but now some people are
going to have more power to change your
rating than others the new system began
Friday and you may have noticed more
social media companies are hungry for a
piece of the shopping action Twitter
just launched product pages to highlight
things you can buy right on Twitter and
some businesses are also highlighting
items for sale on Twitter as collections
that's it for this tech news roundup but
there's always more at cnet.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
