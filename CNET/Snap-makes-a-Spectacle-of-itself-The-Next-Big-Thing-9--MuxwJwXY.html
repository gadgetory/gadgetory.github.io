I'm Brian Cooley in search of the next
big thing these are spectacles from
snapchat now known as snap the parent
company changing its name to something
more generic because they aren't just in
the social media business anymore
this is the actual set of spectacles as
you can see they wouldn't look out of
place in Elton John's dressing room the
idea here is pretty simple there's a
camera on the temple they take 10 second
video clips and kind of an odd circular
format and those get uploaded to your
snapchat account and that's it
they're not augmented or virtual
anything they don't learn they don't
take selfies they're very simple single
point usage devices and that may be
where the magic lies scarcity is part of
the strategy these are sold for a
hundred and thirty bucks through an
ephemeral traveling vending machine but
that means street prices are in the
hundreds or even thousands on eBay these
are a gimmick in the kindest sense of
the word and we'll probably only find a
minority though a visible one of users
but that's enough to help position
snapchat in its own space in a crowded
social media market they do solve some
meaningful issues of electronic Fung
Shui like being able to shoot photos
without having to hold your arm out in
front of you that tells the world I'm
shooting a photo and having an immediacy
that fishing something out of your bag
or pocket and turning it on and
activating it can't replicate and these
are hardware that says fun not tool
which is what Google glass said about
themselves or you for wearing them now
you can bet Apple and Google are
watching these very very intently
not because they want to learn any
lessons about software or sensor
integration or cloud integration that's
not the point here they want to see what
snap can learn about scaling an almost
insurmountable wall getting us to where
technology on our face know what's next
