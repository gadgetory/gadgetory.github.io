activity in the pool I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update in case you
don't already have a seagull band Fitbit
misfit or jawbone abandoned in a dresser
drawer at home here comes Sony with
another way to keep track of your daily
movement quotas sony unveiled the
smartband 2 and what stands out here is
that it's waterproof for swimming and it
tracks your heart rate you don't always
see both of those features together
there's no screen instead of just
vibrates and flashes little LED lights
that you to get your attention you can
get a vibration to let you know when
someone's calling or it can wake you up
in the morning after monitoring your
sleep movement at night you can also tap
it to skip ahead or pause and play music
now since there's no screen you can
manage it all through an app on iphone
or android it's listed as having a
battery that lasts for two days and you
can switch out the sensor to fit into
different color bands just like the
Fitbit it's on sales sometime in
September heading to 60 countries for
around 120 euro which comes to about 135
dollars if you're interested in that you
may want to look at the basis peak it's
also waterproof for swimming with a
heart rate monitor it costs more it's at
a retail price of two hundred dollars
and that's because it does a little more
and it has a screen and swimmers may
also be interested in the misfit shine
which is now selling a swimmer's edition
misfit is a step counter and a sleep
tracker that is waterproof and you can
attach it to wristbands jewelry your
shoe a belt clip the swimmers edition is
called speedo shine what a name it's
eighty dollars which is ten dollars more
than a normal misfit shine even though
it basically looks the same and that's
because it comes with an extra band a
magnetic clip and an action clip for
swimming it's also programmed with
special speedo firmware that is better
accounting your swim laps and there's a
little LED screen to on the back so
maybe you don't have to keep checking
your phone in the middle of a swim
session to see how you're doing it comes
out September first and you can find it
online at misfit com or speedo USA com
and Apple stores and speaking of Apple
stores if you visit a retail location
next week you may notice some changes
with where the ipods are stored the blog
9to5 mac says it has Intel from store
managers
that iPods will be moved to the
accessory section so you could just pick
one off the rack instead of it being
displayed on a table and needing an
employee to fetch one out from the back
for you to buy apple also made a change
to the Apple watch it's also reported
that maybe you don't need to go through
the process of making an appointment to
try it on you could just walk up to try
it on in a store and that probably has
to do with how crowded it is in the
store that's it for this tech news
update and you can dive in deeper at
cnet com from our studios in New York
