remind you just how old your car is this
thing wants to connect over Bluetooth
but your car's stereo is still trying to
figure out how to play CDs I'm Donald
Bell and today's how-to I'm going to
show you some general tips for
connecting your old your car stereo to
your new smartphone so in a perfect
situation you're gonna have a brand new
car like this one it's gonna have USB
ports for charging and connecting to
your stereo you're gonna have a
Bluetooth wireless connection for taking
calls and listening to music you're
gonna have an aux input for everything
else but cars like this are still a
fraction of what's on the road today how
are you gonna make your CD Eric our
iPhone ready now some stereos are just
gonna be beyond help if you're still
rocking an old cassette deck something
that doesn't even include an aux input
your best bet is to buy a new
aftermarket system and have that
installed a basic system with
installation should running around 200
to 300 dollars not cheap but it's not
too bad considering the huge upgrade
you'll be getting for something you'll
use every day now in some cases you're
dealing with the head unit that's so
integrated with the design of the car
that there's really no removing it in
that case a lot of people are gonna give
up hope they're gonna go with like a set
adapter or the most heinous of all
adapters the FM transmitter don't do it
quick note on FM transmitters the reason
they're so awful is because they're
regulated by the FCC they can't be
powerful enough to overpower any local
stations so they're really just these
weak underpowered things that are only
gonna work if you live in the boonies
but don't give up hope there's a good
chance that someone makes an adapter kit
for your old car stereo that will add an
aux input or an iPhone cable to the back
of the system and that will run out to
your glove compartment
now unfortunately these things are more
trouble than they're worth more often
than not because there's expensive as a
brand-new stereo they still need to be
professionally installed and you're
still dealing with an old stereo
interface you're often tricking this
thing into thinking that your iPhone is
a CD it's a big compromise but it's
workable now if you're lucky enough to
have an aux input built into your car's
stereo there are a world of options and
adapters available to you so take a look
around
sometimes it's in your console sometimes
it's in your coin tray
sometimes it's under your armrest look
for it because if you have one you're
gonna save a lot of money over buying a
brand new car Syria now one scenario you
can use with Knox input is a cradle
you've got the cradle here mount it in
your car to position your phone towards
you you can run the charging cable from
the phone to the power adapter in your
car and then an aux cable from the phone
to the stereo it's a lot of cables but
it works now if your stereo supports
bluetooth you can still invest in a
cradle just to have your phone position
towards you but you can cut that off the
cable connection by going over bluetooth
now if you don't have a Bluetooth
connection in your stereo and you also
just don't want to deal with the clutter
of the cradle and everything else you
can go with the Bluetooth adapter kit
these things plug right into your aux
input and it still has all the benefits
of having a Bluetooth connection you can
take your calls with the built-in
microphone you can still listen to music
all of that but you're not dealing with
all that clutter so there you go those
are my best tips for getting your older
car iPhone ready now you can read Wayne
Cunningham's full post over on Cena's
car tech blog you can also check out
