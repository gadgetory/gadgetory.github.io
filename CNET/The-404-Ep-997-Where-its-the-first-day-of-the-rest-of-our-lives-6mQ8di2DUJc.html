Richard Peterson switch on the ones and
twos today how you doing Richard thanks
for being here man appreciate that but
really thank you ah so yeah it's a new
show and I think we sort of owe this to
our listeners to be a little transparent
about what's happening to the 404 okay
we're shutting it down to over this does
blackberry catch it a go even tie was
scared yeah should I leave uh yes so
we're gonna be well we haven't really
decided on who's gonna be the new
replacement for Wilson yet because those
are big shoes to fill right literally he
wore big trees he was like a size 15
years ridiculous shoes around the office
too disturbing but we haven't found a
replacement yet but in the meantime
we're gonna have a rotating guest a list
of CNN employees which is kind of
awesome yeah please I starting with Ty
and ty you're gonna try and be here as
much as you can maybe absolutely all
right I just ask that was the first time
I ask them that yeah um I guess for
people that don't know ty I mean you've
only better not show a few times can you
tell the listeners what you do for
seeing it so I actually review
televisions and a bit of home theater
and I actually sit right next to Jeff so
it sort of looks like we're looking to a
mirror the whole evil Jeff Beck thing
yes look into the mirror and I'm all of
a sudden speaking with an accent we do
the whole room I reject don't touch each
other though if you watch the universe
will that's it at the end of the world
as we know it for sure um so yeah Ty's
been here how long you been at seen in
at five months yesterday I think
flies when you just hate in life I i
I've got to experience my first York
winter so nothing like a like a Sydney
winter but I think quite mild this year
don't be mistaken this winter was BS yes
okay we had black four inches total of
snow it's nonsense ya next year you're
gonna freak out yeah i was telling
Bridget Carey the same thing I'm like
dude four feet of snow guarantee ya wena
fainting it's been this it's been
nothing like you days I think wasn't
Halloween and then once in December that
was it yeah it's 50 degrees today with
the F man but you have like crazy
winners down there or what I gets to a
bell I can't do this celsius fahrenheit
it's fine it's good but it doesn't
nobody like today is probably a typical
Sydney win today okay so so mild very
mild yet huh and they complain you know
Sydney people complain about what do
they really they complain when they get
with it because it's usually beautiful
all the time they get weather clownin
sits with again right when they're dead
and everyone stays indoors yeah I'm
serious oh that's what's happening 44
we're gonna have a lot of you know the
rush tix of the world the Guttenberg
czar the world everyone's gonna help us
out and uh we will be having a permanent
replacement maybe we should do maybe we
should do will will be the next podcast
I'd Ida let's do podcast Idol would you
throw the voice she just ya llega like
oh I love this guy I love the right
person you tell it's a joke or we should
touch people's laughs if they have a
good laugh maybe they can replace Wilson
and maybe resident giggly um yeah and
it'll help if you're female yeah heared
you're early at an advantage yeah yeah i
mean in all seriousness though i think
we were throwing that idea around I
don't want to get it yeah we do on a few
more let's not lie be great that's not
lie all right let's let's get into our
show today we got a lot to talk about
this is cool i wanted to get to this
last week in arizona all right there is
a bill on the table that takes aim at
airbrushed advertisements yes okay so
any time off any time any time you see
an ad every time every time yeah
obviously it's photoshopped it's
doctored up a little
it but uh representative Katie Hobbs a
Democrat from Phoenix she would like to
require advertisers who alter or enhance
a photo to put a disclaimer on that ad
alerting customers that quote and this
is like the line she wants at the bottom
quote post production techniques were
made to alter the appearance in this
advertisement when using this product
similar results may not be achieved it
should just say will not be a cheat not
that they may not be a cheap ready guess
I was like a skincare product or make up
some like that they want to basically
say hey look this is you know Jennifer
Lopez okay you're not you're never going
to be Jennifer Lopez or anywhere and you
don't have photoshop people helping you
out every night bread so uh I don't know
I actually talked about a story like
this last year i remember it was for a
covergirl ad in a magazine uh-huh and it
was the national advertising division
forced Procter &amp;amp; Gamble the guys who own
uh that cosmetic company yeah to take
down a mascara ad that said you would
get two times more volume out of your
eyelash mascara if you use them and when
you use it you just weren't getting you
yeah you clearly weren't getting two
times the volume as much as what the
advertisement showed so I knew I mean me
personally I was not getting the volume
on the silent yeah exactly make sense
but then they put a disclaimer on the
bottom that said it was fake that I
think that was considered false
advertisement because the result wasn't
the same as well we're going to have to
have these uh you know disclaimers at
the end st. cankles anal leakage sharp
depression suicidal thoughts right in
your mascara that's what's gonna get to
I think so I think you're absolutely
right I think it's amazing that this
stuff has been able to do these company
been able to get away with this nonsense
for so long let's get serious about it I
play devil's advocate say that even if
this law did pass which it never ever
will I won't it i don't think anyone
from Congress would ever sign on is
there's a little disclaimer that says
professional driver never attempt yeah
okay when someone's going off-roading in
their beetle right okay i think the same
sort of logic applies yeah but does not
have any danger as there is life
threatening things like oh I beg to
differ if you have that much confidence
in yourself could find yourself
can cause a needlestick injury to play
someone right exactly you know I mean
the goal though is to help uh like young
women and young men with their
self-esteem right this is boosting their
confidence and giving them a bad body
image but i don't think that mascara
issues are the root of this problem if
you get rid of magazine ads it's not
gonna stop you know things like last
week's New York Fashion Week of course
not from doing runway models they did
the same image right a young people
you're right i don't know i don't think
i'll make a difference I just I just am
sick a Photoshop yeah I think that's
what it boils down to it I'm sick of
everything not looking how it looks in
real life yeah and everything you look
at in print on TV on billboards it's not
reality it's simply not reality but we
know that I know we as people who are
being advertised as you know that it's
not really right but and you're just
okay with that you're never gonna be
like damn the man let's burn this down I
don't know I don't know if they're
actually trying to push things at me
particularly that require photoshopping
and and I get like you know an
unrealistic body image out of that
you're right it's more it's it's
primarily aimed at women I think we can
all agree with that well we also wear
makeup to on the show sometimes you're
exempt from that like I ever heard
of speaking of photoshopping though this
story came out over the weekend I
thought it was pretty funny um this part
of the story is not funny Whitney
Houston's funeral was a new work on I
think saturday right and uh the Westboro
Baptist Church was apparently there
according to their twitter page and the
daughter of pastor phelps margie phelps
posted this image of um can we show this
picture cuz i don't care like hey time
it's okay everyone knows how ridiculous
they are all right so they sent out this
image that showed they're picketing
signs that are you know pretty offensive
and uh you know this was made to incite
people's emotions and you know get their
message across but it turns out
according to the New Jersey star-ledger
newspaper they confirmed that this was a
doctored image they weren't actually
there and almost there no no one was
there from the Westboro Baptist Church
and I was confirmed by other people that
were at the funeral no one saw signs
okay so had clearly photoshopped
themselves into this picture so i gotta
what's worse for you okay what's worse
being a
member of this bigoted disgusting neo
Nazi scum bag organization uh-huh or
being the dickhead that photo shops them
into something like that like what's
worse right well I think they did it
internally right I think they have like
a full team of like yeah of like
talented Photoshop people well I mean if
you look at this picture they're not
exactly talented you like that's right
it's like blow it up and looks pretty
doctor I mean I jizz are blurred and
yeah I think anyone with a keen eye for
this kind of thing tell ya um but yeah I
mean you're not doing anyone getting
lazy right like they're just getting
like I we could either spend hundreds of
dollars on that plane ticket to Newark
or we could just Photoshop ourselves
into it what do you say outsource this
hate yeah then go grab this out sourced
hate is this one of the first televised
funerals no new ok I'm coming from
Australia which we don't televised court
proceedings who don't televised funeral
well rest to me isn't it that's a big
Michael Jackson televised funeral really
I definitely agree I agree with you it
is it's messed up but that's what we do
here we didn't stop because they had
celebrity performers like r kelly saying
naughty for the Bennett but not for like
well okay I would really really be upset
if they were like a lot of commercials
and they sold the crap out of it but I
don't think they do I think they just
run it so slow tasteful for our block of
just morning right which is whatever but
uh that's what we do here man what else
do you love about our fine nation ah the
accents yeah isn't that messed up there
you know it and and no one thinks twice
about that yeah right do you think twice
about what freakin can cost is a gravy
boat you know boss thing you know look
what was what was in a bath when she
died that's really sort of upset black
and morbid ya know what you couldn't
avoid that no we dude we love that we
gotta get and not get enough not again
we got to know everything about it
that's what we used in she belongs to
the people or music the children are our
future the children indeed all right
well let's move on Jeff what what story
is catching your eye here we could talk
about any of these um this is really
cool and something that I personally am
and involved in researching myself and I
had not come up with a way but
apparently the fine crack team at seen
at how to has already come over the way
we're talking about how to send a
self-destructing email message yeah now
I feel like there's different kinds of
ways to accomplish this but there is
there any explosive involved in this
regard as vampires you don't need a
break your computer after not like up a
timer goes off I come over your house
with a sledgehammer yeah something like
that right yeah this also doesn't
involve you going over to their computer
and breaking it either this is actually
how to that Jason Cipriani from is it
chip really I don't know he's new dude
you tell him okay anyway so it's a
how-to it talks about this website
called one shot yes okay shares and it
basically lets you send emails to
colleagues that will self-destruct after
the URL is clicked on just once so it's
not really an email as such um it's a
message we've held in another song right
yeah which is kind of BS because once
you see you could just cut and paste and
then bam you got over a screenshot mean
 yeah exactly or I don't know
remember it yeah sorry I like that use a
pencil and write down whenever I go I
get the gist of this is a statement okay
yeah everything is basically able to be
recorded now but this but you know this
kind of takes away pretty gimmicky it's
gimmicky I think the only good thing
about it is that once it's you know once
it's gone off the internet there is no
legit documentation I feel like you know
even if you cut and paste it it's like
well you cut and paste that I don't take
your word for ya yeah but it does sound
pretty gimmicky it's I mean they're
saying that it's good for if you want to
send financial information now you know
like your social security number or bank
in phone you don't want that to be
copied down like Jeff just said you
could just simply write it down you
could just simply remember it yeah boyo
to stop drunk emailing I don't know if
that's a thing just facebooking yes yeah
but drunk emailing you'd have to
remember the site URL and right right
it's a whole process yeah let's be
honest yeah so I mean you could use this
if you really want to keep things
private just say it
stage whisper it yeah all right we'll
take one break when we're done we'll be
back with Ty and we'll get this more
stories also we've got coals in our
future and a lot more fun on the 404 so
stick around we will be right back this
is the 404 Mr effers the show where we
all sing
Oh
you
welcome back to the 404 haven't had a
good laugh like that I knew that you of
all people Jeff would love that yeah
you're so relieved what's the hell was
this jump at the show so you do not know
about stuff like that well you know it's
some sort of weird baptist church right
yeah yeah like evangelical they you know
they flop around on the floor and right
who stuff so the shining sea matar of
wool yeah it's all good people out of
them i watch religulous for the first
time yeah yeah it's quite uh i get i
have a problem with i'm not really just
myself but i have a problem with people
like Richard Dawkins and Bill whatever
his name is Bill Maher bill maher taking
the opposite you know your your side is
wrong yeah right I'm with you yeah I
think um yeah i i'm i'm in that vein
idea I just we can't get too much into
it but yeah being preachy on either side
it really puts people bill maher was
attacking innocent people he wasn't
attacking people like we just saw in the
video that were evangelical is like
clearly full of crap well i mean you
can't say that a key like I don't you
get all the same I know Bono's being
kind of mean about it yeah but you know
what sometimes you gotta be a little
mean I don't know yeah i'm not totally
against it but i understand everyone's
point of view on the subject yeah um all
right let's uh let's get back into these
stories it really quick I I want to ask
you about this because now they're on
the show I saw this video the other day
you post a review of the sony h MZ t
wanting can we put this up on the screen
everyone should go and watch the video
associated with the review so awesome
it's hilarious and can you tell us a
little bit about this is like a heads-up
display that you can watch TV with in
these goggles but you can explain about
these things have been around for a long
time yeah and i sort of drew a parallel
to not in the video but in the review
itself to the virtual reality headsets
near 90 s right I so I don't know why we
need these things I guess you know the
whole holiday thing you know it's real
it's not real it's it's virtual reality
so essentially what these are is to oled
displays at 720p resolution so
what I guess what the really good thing
about it is is that you can see 3d
without any crosstalk so that's that's
not seeing any of that sort of weird
ghosting effect between the images right
which really puts you off when you watch
things like modern lcds or assurance
plasma displays so these are really good
at doing that not very good at the focus
because they've got these weird sort of
like I guess lenses in them yeah they
had to move so all of the outside of the
display was all blurry gotcha so wasn't
good for watching movies but 3d games
awesome they were also and I never
meaning to try it out and I just can't
find 20 minutes to get out in the back
there and do it but um I still though
for gaming I know you told me you said
it was uh it was heavy the apparatus is
yeah so like half a kilo I don't know
what that is in like pounds yeah I
always seventh on something I survived a
three tons are ya um but you know
something specially something like
gaming where you want to be sitting down
for a long hours yeah I'm after an at
three hours it actually turns itself off
really yes so will matter what break
yeah no matter yeah you can turn that
option off right uh yeah it just turns
off right 30 and then before you realize
it you cannot do anything but look at
the ground cuz your heads just waved
down rolling around yeah so you need
some sort of scaffolding type structure
to hold it on like maybe some sort of
minocqua corn yeah I depends on your
head what about one of those like halo
things that people wear when they miss
their neck up real bad all right right
now my neck brace yeah like let's be
honest you're putting this ridiculous
science fiction prop on your head as it
is it weighs too much why don't get why
don't you give it like a
shoulder-mounted sort of thing you know
you left though but that's probably
travel pillows yeah exactly it's
probably the smarter way to go about it
this isn't meant for you to actually
walk around not only wait and that's a
stupid thing like it should be used on
the train or on a plane right and the
funny thing is that the only thing that
could recommend it for apparently this
is like an insider yeah said it's really
good for porn oh my god yeah that was
someone at sony apparently allegedly
said this it's really good for porn
tell you that's not know I did I've it's
only third you need for research on the
court of law rewrite in the court of
scene at law but yeah watching porn in
this I mean it's pretty honey it doesn't
it display to you on like a giant movie
theater style screening much yeah must
be I'm just thinking about scary how
dangerous that would be watching porn
but yet you mom's place or something yes
like being you know the end in you're
blindfolded and right i think it's just
you're playing a dangerous game I you
know it's like pin the tail on the
donkey but not that kind of game that
you mean it's just yeah it's doogie it's
okay yeah but wait I don't think what
Justin was alluding to before is that we
actually tried to use it in a public
situation nobody porn I'll sure say yeah
but Richard was actually there with me
shooting it so we went down to into the
subway and I had like a headset thing no
he said you're like going through the
subway turnstile and yeah it looks on
people's faces as you're pretty good
you're like walking through like bumping
into walls and people look horrified
they should at least be able to have an
option where you just like flick a
switch and then BAM you just see through
actually sit under it all the others yet
okay that's that's you know that's that
sounds safe you should be doing you
should drive with this thing is
basically what we're trying to say or be
cool that had an embedded camera or
something that would display you know a
360 view around you right in the screen
is just like a little lag yeah they
should you they should invent that
technology for like people who drive
tanks and stuff like Google apparently
you've got a heads-up display technology
coming oh that's right yes so maybe
they're talking about something like
that I mean it just seems like it's such
a waste to just I don't know Sony does
this all the time they'll invent
something that's like sort of cool and
then just be like here yeah use this
yeah like what am i why well how much is
it I think it was I can't remember if it
was like seven hundred bucks seven
hundred bucks ok just a lot of money
I'll just buy now is there a way to
somehow equate it to a precise like
screen size apparently it's a hundred
inches at six or seven feet ok so it's
equivalent to like a 42 inch at about
three or four feet oh wow that's
whatever has none don't sit so close to
the team guys gonna fry your brain in
fact you know what Sony suggesting you
wear it on your face I don't know man I
just don't know what to try this do you
still have it in the last still got it
yeah bring it in you should have figure
out so that s at that point thing I just
want to play games on is good for that
too um that's this is ridiculous tell
tell us Justin there's a new phobia
that's come into popular discussion your
greatest nomophobia nomophobia do you
know where that came from I can just I'm
trying to break it there and be without
a cell phone and I forget what the
linguistic tool it's called but it
stands for no mobile yeah which doesn't
make no but no mobile phone iya fonia
yeah or that which does it make sense
because it's presumably English or
Australian because we call mobile phones
not self it's a contradict yeah only in
America though could you ever have this
sort of phobia I feel Lysa's but people
do freak out when they don't have their
phones with them yeah but do they freak
out the same way that someone who's
claustrophobic feels if they you know
the fear you know you know I'll see it's
something times that they're not there
the fear isn't that they're gonna be an
emergency situation will need a phone
and they don't have one yeah I think
their fear is like a fear of missing out
like a fear missing out on like what's
going on facebook or things that they
can access on their phone right you know
it's more i'm pretty sure it's more of a
social fear but in a physical one and I
don't know man I think it doesn't
deserve the phobia Suffolk no no well it
you gotta take it with a grain of salt
cuz this came from it's kind of like a
marketing sure I gave him a survey I get
a cure envoy I get that they're saying
that they surveyed a thousand people in
the UK so not a big sample size
sixty-six percent of those thousand
people said that they have a fear of
being without their phone seventy
percent of female respondents have that
fear compared to only 61 percent of
males yeah what that mean I mean I have
it's sort of ridiculous because it's the
same fear of like losing your car keys
or something like that these you just
need well you know you guys I'm sure
have left your phone at home in the
morning we're going
and it feels weird but I always say that
I'm scared yeah I'm not gonna cry over
it are they scared of losing it living
at home or scared when they have lifted
home it seems like a nebulous type of
fear completely is yeah it's a fear of
being without their phones in general
and 1000 so you gotta read don't think
about not having your phone with you
really yeah that's the time except when
you don't have your phone with you yeah
exactly like the weird thing do you guys
do this I know Justin you don't really
drink a lot hi you know you're trying to
help me is like all right no I drink
you're fine i have had drinks yes yeah
wake up on a Sunday or a Saturday and
like the first thing you do is you're
like oh well where's my phone everywhere
you looked my front doors got a weird
lock on it so I do worried that I've
left my keys in the front door that's a
that's a problem yeah that's a well it
shouldn't happen but my otha when I wake
up I'm always I'm like crap where's my
phone yeah I don't even care about my
wallet where's my phone I don't know
where it is and it's always in someone's
jacket pocket or stay someone else's
there's like someone is in like it's in
a jacket pocket somewhere it's in
Stacy's purse like behind so I can't
stand that and I I wish I know Bureau
just call it but there's I don't know
man that's like cuz then if you don't
have a phone putting hackney right what
do you do in the depends i mean because
it's 14 android isn't there so like a
fine my phone type yes low yeah yeah
something there is one for I from which
I have and yeah that's actually quite
useful you use that a couple of times
can you or is the weirdest place you've
left your phone I i mean i know mine
right away i'll go for it yeah my the
freezer what yeah i lost c'mon like
finding a sock in the refrigerator
that's like the no adage no need I don't
know what it was I and this is recent to
it was a FreshDirect was delivering huh
so the first thing that I must have been
on the phone when they came to the door
I know what happened and the first thing
flex yeah and the first thing maybe the
first thing was uh you know the ice they
give you ice cream anything that needs
to be frozen it's in a plastic bag and
they put that out because they're like
all right to the freezer with this right
and at some point during the exchange I
must have just you know saved it a trip
they went right into the freezer yeah I
didn't know about it for like an hour if
it was fine but I know why he did it why
stop people called calling you he loves
it feeling itself I love it that was it
go to another uncle humor I did have a
fun it was like you know the Murder on
the Orient Express I had a phone stolen
from me on a plane no way yeah like
while you mid-flight actually when we
landed I took my phone out turned it on
and must have stuck it on the seat next
to me yeah and someone's reach beyond
are you sure yes you're just going
through the crevices now it's gone see
when something like that happens you I
say you tell the flight attendant right
and be like look I tell me when I was
gonna find it yeah like I literally
started filtering off us like madly goes
a lot for listen up applying I would
have blocked the eggs yeah good night no
one's league one of you a-holes has my
drip search all of you you know II can i
call it and it rings in someone's
banging it'll be awesome yeah you know
beat them up right then in there what is
this yours guess not yeah what I've been
seeing a lot of people this is I hate
watching this I saw it twice over the
weekend people leave their phones on
their lap when they're driving and when
they exit the door they get out and
forget that it was on there Oh makes the
worst sound in the world as it cracks on
the concrete you guys seen that before
like taxicabs and well it's oh I hate
watching them yeah it's kind of a bummer
meaningful and kind of funny the same
day of course especially if they're
driving with it I can't tell you how
many times I see these you know people
there walk they're driving through
hoboken and all they're doing is just on
the phone and they're only looking one
way because traffic cannot come more
than one ways but guess what people can
yeah yeah human beings are a lot more
you know prone to injury then a car
right car and they're just looking the
other way and they go and man oh man
it's so many close calls and I just you
know give him a little elbow to the hood
gimel intent one
somehow don't do that but if not should
guys that was alive boxing on there yeah
the ban we'll take one more break when
we get back some calls and we'll finish
thing up things up here on Tuesday with
Thai stick around for four continues
right after this
you
alright welcome back speak of the devil
you lock justice yeah he did that with
lock how real i ike i was out there like
he might've i mean you could do it so we
just watched a video of a cyclist that
got cut off by car the car came pretty
close to him almost knocked him off the
bike to retaliate cyclist road next to
him knocked off the side view mirror
yeah a little in a little much i could
understand if he did get hit and injured
right but he came close enough no not
justified I don't like road rage as a
cyclist myself and recycle Justin huh I
I don't tolerate that when when cyclists
yeah become assholes on you know why it
gives a bad name to all cyclists oh god
knows what that drivers gonna do to the
next innocent writer he's right you know
you know it's is it people with fold up
bikes and the the hive is sweaters look
ridiculous please leave these people a
little flag yeah you have people with
flags here don't know yeah yeah we have
like people with reflectors on the flag
that kinda makes sure that drivers can
see him yeah not me though um yeah let's
talk about real quick with would
youwould zid this is funny because I
didn't know this and it just sort of
went over my head so the little 3d visor
we're just talking in the break the 3d
visor that I reviewed I in Australia I
would call it the H what was it I think
I should've remembered MZ t 1 is when HD
zt1 you can also address how you say HH
so okay you're giving the it's got 2 h's
in it so what makes the sound of the
notes on the mat appear that's like a
TCH e you like that eh hanging em said
it said instead of the Z which I think
they brought up that leg zeds dead
babies it's dead right that design makes
no sense to me either ball from pulp
fiction okay is it dead there so said is
how you you you say the word the letter
Z yep yep can you you wanna fix that for
me was that you know like when you're in
the military you go like uh Hector Mary
zed is it something like that up a
person Zipporah yes gotta be you always
sad frizzy oh yeah absolutely okay I
master anything yeah yeah but what I
find really funny is the way that
Americans are pronounced letters like
CES or it's that really like in
Australia would say see yes yes or no
yes what's really funny is the HT what
is it the HTC 3g LTE it's really really
robotic how do you want to say all right
so yeah thing well yeah yeah yeah botón
otra delegated 30 of are you buggin is
that how bogan says i buggin bet I HTC I
like tht CEO g3t I don't know yeah
that's a lot of letters yeah that's
pretty silly and I'm in you know as we
all are in in some of these product
names of quite long oh you have lots of
letters in them especially televisions I
think televisions yeah is up but they
like phone numbers don't you think don't
you think it's time for these guys to
get together and just do even though it
is ridiculous how cell phones are all
have these silly names in maybe it start
this it's time to start doing that with
televisions is the Greg Belial just call
it all the body you get a new ship I
know that naming them people but you
know these abstract sort of like right
you know yes I fire exactly I know asian
miss it's lame but at the same time it's
not gxp 915 functional t like with uh
android operating systems they all go
alphabetically so you know web
chronological order they came out in
like that you know it serves a different
purpose aside from having a cell I but
either way lady should have that it's
time to start you know reexamining
nomenclature for ya especially with Sony
against they've only got about 10 models
towards ya so they could call each one
you know the the Sapphire the McGarry
the knee the knee so Nene know that
doesn't mix not they'd have to reach out
yeah that vizio could do that maybe y SE
I'm just taking a quick look at the cnet
top HD TVs and look at these is like pro
x5 um yeah yeah p ND 8000 series you
know it's ridiculous it is and they have
sub names for the different screen sizes
right yeah it's got a 46 in over
the worst is you're on the phone with
you know customer service okay sir what
kind of what's the model number your TV
hold on and let me reach around this
guide in the paper like oh no I have the
Panasonic you know you know 55 LW 9800
that's a real LG TV that's a joke it's
crazy let's too many too many many
planning problem I guess it's a simple
fix though alright calls from all the
time time to show the love 86 404 so as
everyone's now aware Wilson is no longer
with us he's alive you're like he's just
not on he's not a senior yeah he left
just want to make that very clear uh so
apparently people are we getting on
still a lot of calls even though he's
gone we can't really sort of weird if we
play them now yeah you know if they're
like goodbye calls he's gone right that
needs there's no way he's gonna listen
to this show after he left next ship is
sailing here ah but there is something
to address in terms of maybe what he's
uh he's left behind hey jeff its joey
from nevada calling wondering maybe it's
too late but possibly Wilson left behind
some artifacts that might be worth
giving to the 404 fans like perhaps some
business cards or beer cans an eating
chicken feet chicken pocket-lint or
pictures of sign pictures of Steve Jobs
you can give me that i'm pretty sure you
wouldn't leave that behind but
everything else may it's a specific
laundry list wasn't it yeah it's very
specific what else do you know about him
ah no i don't i haven't been in his
office yet yeah i'm actually trying to
steal oh yeah right you can't get in
because of all the chicken feet yeah
that matter floor all I went into
Wilson's office after he left for the
day on Friday yeah and it just looked
cleaner in Richard you can back me up on
this because you actually work in the
same areas handle full of stuff is a
little cube looks now like it should
have looked the entire time you worked
here yeah it just
clean up the mess and so I don't know
who's all that stuff is but someone
needs to clean that up yeah I mean let's
get on that yeah maybe I don't know you
move into that office or what did you
think I know I think mark might okay may
the best man win i was gonna say i'd
have to fistfight mark for it but we
know who would win that fight yes me nam
kid haha man it wouldn't even be a
confident decimate you they would just
literally ripped me in half yeah
straight down the dust would look like
some fatality from mortal game um all
right next next call and maybe uh ty can
help us decipher this hateful for this
is nice and calling from Australia I was
just going to see if you guys picked up
a new mountain lion advert that Apple
released that if you look closely
there's only one appearance of a macbook
pro and yet 27 appearances of the
macbook air what do you think this is
saying about a future of laptop lines
anyway I'm sure yeah whatever you say
time ah well we don't have an outline so
don't know what he was so we don't
actually have any sort of indigenous
cats left we killed them all yeah yeah
the last one dated like 1926 good
riddance so what's it like having
dizziness cats we do i what is that an
apple yeah oh yeah did you not hear what
he said no no I did I did all right and
so I just I just look good so come in
guys on the whole day line thing okay
totally got side tracked every second if
you want to talk about cat said I was a
show you just things go on for days it
was a mountain lions are the same thing
a perfumer you say pew matuma what what
is it Puma Puma Puma Puma like the shoe
brand like poo in it he has numerous
tumor a puma I like the Australian I do
drink an American accent that's a wisdom
of a man the speed of a puma I like that
I like that napoleon dynamite okay so
yeah um that's what he's talking about
he's talking about he was talking about
the commercial that they came out for
mountain lion right and he's saying that
they showed a lot more macbook air
laptops and they did was it just the
actual pro for showing the actual pro
yeah which is what is shootings they're
talking about getting rid of the pro
anyway
yeah maybe that's why this in phase that
out i think uh i think the writing's on
the wall i think if you if you really
really think about it and just look at
that the whole cold hard facts of
performance and what these benchmarking
results are when you compare the top of
the line prone top of line air right
there's there's the negligible
difference I think arm I think they are
on their way out I don't think a CD
drive a DVD drive even a blu-ray drive
is as attractive to them to the average
you know consumer right as it used to be
I think that those users would prefer
more USB ports than any of those you
know just give them a few more though I
agree to I think the air needs a few
more in those I also think the air uh
could use you know I guess I well you
know what I'm if you take away the
actual moving disk drive right and you
pop in that SSD you're getting an
incredible speed boost when you do stuff
like that so figure out a way to make
that more affordable because I feel like
that's the one thing that's making the
air just too much money where I would
love to get one but they're just too
much you know I want to get a top of the
line one and once you break past that
entry level one you're spending a lot of
money yeah so for me I want you know I
want that terabyte SSD drives G drives
are coming down though or even two years
ago Intel came out with the first laptop
SSD and we tested it here at cnet it was
six hundred dollars and it was 12
giggles some yeah i think it was like
three or four games which is nothing for
a laptop you need way more than that so
i think you're gonna probably see them
go down all right well I'll take your
word for it also tie to get off the
subject really quick uh chat rooms
asking you to say jaguar jaguar oh well
that's easy having fun no weirder know
like Jaguar look at the freeway what did
I hear you say the Fosters commercial
