the talk of Las Vegas mint made its
debut at CES last January now we've got
it here in the CNET smart home kitchen
you take a look it's the same four-door
build as you'll find a lot of Samsung's
high-end fridges except it's got this 21
and a half inch Tizen powered
touchscreen on the upper door on that
touchscreen you'll find this calendar
sharing app you'll find Pandora and tune
ins internet radio you'll be able to
order groceries through instacart
groceries by MasterCard the thing I want
you to check out though are these
cameras on the inner flap of the door
these three cameras here snap a photo of
your groceries every time you close the
thing and then if you pull up your phone
you can check that out of the store and
see if you need more milk or you can tap
here on this view and side button to
look at it on the screen now in all
honesty I was pretty skeptical about
those cameras when I first heard about
them yeah it might be helpful to applaud
your phone and see if you need some
ingredient when you're out of the store
but that's only gonna come in handy once
or twice a year right actually it's the
low here on the screen that I really
like the reason is you can just easily
pull down little markers here that tell
you when your food is going to expire
that's a handy way to keep track of
stuff you do have to keep things in the
same spot on the shelf because those
little markers won't follow your
ingredients around if you move them but
still it's a handy feature I like it the
touch screen also looks nice it's got a
good design takes good advantage of all
that real estate it's got it's not as
responsive as I'd like it doesn't feel
like using a high-end tablet feels a
little more sluggish in generic typing
on it is that comfortable you have to be
very precise considering that this
fridge costs thousands more than the
model that doesn't have a touchscreen I
wish that those controls felt a little
more high-end we'll have a lot more on
this fridge we'll see that more time to
get our hands on it and also do our
performance tests so stay tuned for that
in the coming weeks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
