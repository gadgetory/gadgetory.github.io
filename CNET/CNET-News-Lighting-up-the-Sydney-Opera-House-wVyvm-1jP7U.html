skyline without picturing the Sydney
Opera House this year as part of vivid
festival 2014 UK company 59 productions
are responsible for lighting the sails
and bathing it in animations and visuals
every single night I'm Lexy CBDs
foreseen it let's go behind the scenes
and take a look at some of the technics
making it happen we're using 14 Christi
20k projectors mounted on the ferry port
office at the Opera House
they are converged multiple units on to
each of four areas on the sails so we've
broken the the Opera House down into
four channels basically and we're using
multiple projects on each of those
channels each one of those channels is
controlled by a desk Tom watch out
server again with a central control
system which manages that play out to
all of those machines so it's a fairly
standard linear playback system with
quite a lot of complex work on the
content to really make him up to the
Opera House so I've never been to Sydney
until this week but one of the processes
that we employ with a lot of our work
whether it's in a theatre and opera
house of architectural mapping on the
outside of the building is that we
actually create a real-world 3d model in
our studio so for Sydney we had a 3d
print made of an architectural e
accurate 1 to 300 model which we then
projection mapped in the studio so we
were able to create a very accurate
representation albeit much much smaller
so that when we arrived here in fact 24
hours after the plane touched down we
were looking at images on the side of
the Opera House it was very pleasing to
see how close they were to our kind of
real world visualization that we've been
able to make so on the one hand we we
work with those 3d models tactile things
that you can move around and check
different reject triangles and so on but
we also pre visualize in CG so we're
using cinema 4d to actually move around
the Opera House to create kind of
virtual shots and virtual moving shots
together since what it might look like
as you travel around the harbour because
well as creating a lot of 2d 3d
two-and-a-half d
animation work we've combined that with
a lot of live-action filming
so we've after we had our 1 to 300
architectural model made we then took a
cast of that and created a number of
kind of replica models and a number of
different materials so we use plaster
gel wax wax our minyan various different
materials and we then filmed those at 4k
resolution hundred twenty frames or 240
frames a second high-speed in order to
create sort of what we're calling
organic effects so things like water
running down the outside of the opera
house like super heating the copper
version of it like smashing the glass
wax version like melting the wax version
like hurling paint at some of the
plaster versions so while was this kind
of backbone of digital animation we've
composited that together with a large
amount of live action which gives it a
kind of hopefully much more tactile much
more visceral feeling and there are
moments when you're not quite sure if
there's a lighting effect on the opera
house or whether it's projection or
whether we're somehow messing with the
materials of the actual surface even
though many of the visitors might not
know about the tech behind the scenes
there's no doubt that the finished
result of lighting the sails is
something special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
