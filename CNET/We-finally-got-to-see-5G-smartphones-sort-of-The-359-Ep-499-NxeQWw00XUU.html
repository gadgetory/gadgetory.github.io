Joe nice Alton I know it seems like we
talked about 5g every day and we do
but yesterday Qualcomm and Samsung
showed off prototype device is capable
running on the next generation network
there's a highlight of day one of the
Qualcomm Snapdragon tech summit which
was really all devoted to 5g and Brian's
app because we actually have footage
here we actually have the device to show
off which you know signifies that 5g
after years and years of hype is sort of
becoming a reality now they're running
on Verizon in 18 t 5g networks that were
said specifically for this event and
hopefully Jessica dual-core Tippecanoe
or actually on the ground will get a
chance to try them out later this week
they haven't had a chance yet actually
it was still kind of like behind a like
a curtain or something well we'll see
all right so shifting gears quickly
let's talk about Hulu I had a slew of
news yesterday the one that bugs me the
most is this idea that Hulu and ATT are
reportedly planning on introducing video
ads that pop up when you pause the video
yeah so the idea is that when you're
watching your stream you're watching
your show you pause it and instead of it
just freezing on that frame then you get
a live walking talking fullscreen ad
the idea is kind of taking that dead
space where you are maybe less annoyed
to be distracted right because you're
already like saying hey I'm willing
deposit right now of your own volition
but it does mean putting an ad where and
I didn't belong before and generally
people don't like yes that means they
what's the upside for this the upside
for Hulu is he gonna make more money
more ways yes for me specifically the
upside could potentially be you know Lou
is they don't they have a lower ad load
than normal TV does right they're
sensitive to the fact that they know
people are already paying them some
money yes
and getting advertising so they're
sensitive to the fact that they can't
just like body slam me with ads all the
time so they could lower the ad load
during the breaks it's possible maybe
they would I I don't I have no I
if they would do this or if they're
thinking of news but they could
eliminate one of your commercial breaks
if you pause it at the morning that you
want
there's just possibilities and it's
stuff that I'm sure that they would
think about but there's the possibility
that the ad load normally could be lower
that is I mean I would definitely give
up like if like my pause breaks I'm
having one less ad break not all bad
news though who signed a deal with
Funimation to bring more anime to its
catalogue including I guess the first
look deal to get exclusive new anime
Funimation obviously Cowboy Bebop
Dragon Ball Z more recently attack on
Titan like pretty much all the anime you
want to watch
it's just because Netflix have been
ramping this up as well right there's a
there's been like kind of a big rise in
anime interests over the last couple
years
yeah and I think it's because especially
as these services diversify into more
niches yes they realize that anime is
something where people are willing it's
a fandom that people are willing to pay
yeah get the things that they want well
I I I was a recent subscriber verve for
a little while and then they just ended
a deal with Funimation so I like lost
half my catalogue I canceled my verb
subscription already now you can switch
it over though there you go lastly
there's still no sign of the Avengers 4
trailer we have no idea what's gonna be
called but maybe that's what Marvel
wants you should check out this piece
from Gale who has a nice breakdown of
the history of trailers why they've gone
from the evolve from the simple
promotional tool to this social phenom
that everyone has to talk about on
Twitter on YouTube that's it for full
coverage tricks on the CNN or mother
check I'm Jonny sawsan thanks for
listening
well if you really kept me on my toes
for that one
yeah sorry that's a stack show right
there also our timer never went off so I
forgot this guy I'm like wait it's
alright Oh what do we want to talk about
first we want to want to talk about how
anime seems to be in a second or third
Renaissance do we want to talk about
like what the hell Marvel why are you
just teasing us along I kind of want to
say like but let's let's hit Hulu real
quick yeah with the whole ads thing my
biggest gripe aren't the ads it's the
lack of variety and ads yeah my biggest
problem in Hulu is every ad break it's
the same so here's I'm gonna blow your
mind that's on purpose yeah that's it
that's those are words that'll make me
unsubscribe just like reinforce not
because that's like on purpose by who
lose on who lose on because I think that
they generally would want to offer a
diversity of advertisement just for that
reason that it can be so annoying that
every single break you get the same
Walmart commercial at the beginning or
whatever it may be the reason is because
in advertising the way that
advertisement has always been sold for
television is on impression theäôve
repetition
yeah and so when you're talking about TV
ad loads TV as a linear thing is
obviously like there's a lot more
channels there's a lot more sort of like
real estate or whatever to plop down all
this repetition then on something like
Hulu where you have fewer breaks and
fewer commercials in each break but
advertisers still buy that way like they
still think in those terms I they're
like I have to have this amount of
repetition in order to get it's a sink
into people's brains and so when there's
fewer ads the same amount of repetition
you're getting the repetition is just
like an assault all the time yeah it's
not because they can't sell different
kinds of ads it's because the
advertisers want you to be to have it be
that reminder do they pay a premium for
that assault or it's just the way that
things are it's not like paying a
premium or not it's just like that
that's like when advertisers when
marketers are saying like this is the
buy I want to make the buy that they
want to make includes repetition in
every single ad break oh my god yeah
well let me just say from a consumer
standpoint and they should have done
this audience survey a long time ago
every time I hear something for
Astroglide or depends undergarments
I want them less is that what you get
assaulted with because you know they
target those that uh-huh I see what you
did there all right so for 5g let's take
some questions coming in first well
let's talk about how it's going to roll
out now I'm gonna I gotta go dig through
the b-roll again to find this but
there's a segment where they list the
the countries in areas where it's going
to go to in a succession mashek is
asking specifically if we know when it's
gonna hit India I think India is a
little further off they have to deal
with spectrum allocation and I don't
actually know if India was in that world
map like I saw Europe actress like
Africa obviously North America and Asia
or parts of Asia China Japan Korea I
don't know if India was there we'll have
to get back to you on that
hang on I'm digging it out right now so
path to mobile 5g there's the
architecture and then BOOM so we've got
oh this is rolling out for the UK
specifically for that carrier got it
okay I thought we had a better better
scope of it was an earlier map that was
flashed but it was very general I don't
think it's like went country by country
is sort of you know like Europe North
America Asia and I don't know if who got
down to the granular level of which
country was going with what all right so
you scoured the the keynote yesterday
which is ongoing today yeah did they
unveil any further information on
studies in regards to health concerns
it's a recurring question I judge a
birds yeah 5g killing birds which we
already said has been debunked by no no
look this is a conference where they're
hyping up the promise of 5g I think the
last thing they want to talk about it's
the health concerns I mean that that's
that conference was basically a two-hour
commercial for why you have five senior
life and how it's gonna be amazing and
how easy it is to be it's gonna be to
roll out so yeah those are all positives
I don't think they wanted to spend any
time talking about potential negatives
so gotcha
regardless of you know the legitimacy of
those claims like that was just not a
subject they were gonna ever touch mm-hm
do we think that 5g may eventually
replace DSL if you ask you know folks
like Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T oh yeah yeah
Verizon is already doing in a couple
cities in like four houses probably but
they're they're looking to expand that
nationwide because they can you know
they don't necessarily need to it's
expensive rolling out the physical
equipment to connect at home and it's a
lot easier to string up cell towers and
broadcast that that internet access
wirelessly yeah
and now what carriers are we confirmed
or on board as early adopters we had
AT&amp;amp;T we had Verizon who else I mean all
the Verizon AT&amp;amp;T all the big boys we're
talking about it EE from the UK also I
think was talking I think of Z there's
one of the British carriers you know
t-mobile Sprint weren't weren't
presenting at the conference but they've
also you know talked about launching in
numerous markets early next year so you
can imagine given the competitive
landscape especially here in the US as
well as South Korea and Japan and China
like Allah the the Roloffs will happen
around the same time even between
carriers or among carriers in the same
country just because it's so competitive
right now gotcha
what do we think will 5g provide
opportunity for new players to get into
the game new carriers do we think that
might be a side effect of the rollout um
probably not it's super expensive to
deploy these networks there was what is
his story
yes all right now from the folks from
Aereo that had been trying to kind of
create this
version of the 5g Network they have some
I don't know if they have service live
yet but they've got you in some cities
Boston I think and they're gonna be in
New York I think is where they're coming
next okay I got a I got an email that's
kind of like that's a home a wireless
home internet service yeah using this
kind of super high frequency spectrum
but it costs a lot to get enough
spectrum to cover an entire country like
billions of dollars and that's that's on
top of the actual equipment you've got
to lay out so it's it's real advantages
are all with the incumbent with folks
who have who generated a huge amount of
revenue because they could take that
money and pour it back into the 5g
Network sorry
hard road Justin Hammer wants to know
what's going to happen to Google Fiber
and other services with the reveal of
512 I mean Google Fiber under man I
break it to you I'm just as heartbroken
as you Justin yeah yeah they realize
just like everyone else they're like
putting in like ground infrastructure
fiber optic lines even though they
probably have the cushiest arrangers
because their city's bending over
backwards to get them into their their
communities to actually deploy this
stuff it was still crazy expensive and
just they probably looked at it and
realized with the ads and all this
Wireless stuff happening like it just
made way more sense to go wireless
is Google taking applications because I
mean I've got a shovel like I'll dig the
lines I don't care I just want fiber
because I hate time order anyways
preparing for college that's a good
screen name ads on Hulu are we getting
ads on Netflix as well could you please
clarify so no I mean the things like the
only ads you're gonna be getting on
Netflix for the foreseeable future
are like things that are like promos for
their own stuff they're getting a little
bit more loosey-goosey about promoting
their own originals right before
watching an original whether it's like
right after you hit play whether it's
like promotion that's moving before you
hit play on something that you know that
you actually want to opt into watching
because that autoplay
does they pop up at the end you know I
don't I haven't seen any but I mean they
do have you know they always have the
thing that like is watched next at the
end of a series and I can be watching
next something that they recommend right
but in terms of them selling advertising
for Pepsi or like yogurt like that's not
gonna happen here in the US it's
possible that the only place where they
would ever relax that is in places like
India Asia Pacific in in in countries
where there's a business a strategic
business reason to offer a freemium
version of Netflix where people aren't
quite as willing to just where the mass
population isn't quite as willing to pay
that monthly fee in order to get beyond
the pay wall they might like they
they've explored like lower priced
versions of the service for asia-pacific
countries where there's that sort of
market but in like standard Netflix
places where they already are and
already have a lot of subscribers
they're not gonna be going into
advertising anytime soon Pepsi yogurt
sounds good so just the clip further
clarify there were rumors floating
around is like as Netflix gonna start
using ads what you stated right now that
that squash is that yeah like yeah it's
it's like antithetical to the idea of
what Netflix is fundamentally that they
would introduce I was actually I was
talking to Amazon Prime videos the head
of Amazon Prime video the other day and
I asked him the same question like
especially because Amazon unlike Netflix
Amazon outside of video is doing crazy
business and advertising on its
e-commerce side and so I said hey is
prime video ever gonna have advertising
and usually when you talk to Amazon they
give you an opaque answer kind of like
they never answer what specifics right
and he was like no well no advertising
on Amazon Prime video but they could be
lying you know that - that would be
smart because I do watch prime video a
lot watches prime video probably too
much and I'm thankful for the lack of
ads yeah yeah Peppa Pig oh my god baby
shark actually sadly Dinosaur Train
anyone there
I know Dinosaur Train what's the one
with the bugs that are the beetles is it
just called beetles or something
is it okay it's good stuff out there man
and just going back peddling again
Hulu sucks it's serving up in a variety
and adds to be enjoyable and the Netflix
with their damn autoplay when are they
gonna learn that everybody hates that
everybody hates it no it's one of those
things that people say they hate but
like when you look at the numbers you
watch people may hate it but they keep
watching they start the video to shut
the trailer up just shut the trailer up
you know how you scroll through on on
your Netflix menu and then you stop for
more than two seconds and something
starts to autoplay that number yeah
their autoplay numbers are what's
boosting their their viewership and they
don't care about that I mean they care
about they don't care about having
numbers to tell people like hey our
viewership is up because because they
don't tell they don't tell anybody but
they do care about making you actually
watch video and they don't count that
they don't like use their own numbers
for their own purposes you know what I
mean like they aren't being like hey
look all of our subscribers are watching
a lot more video because we're making
them like they're not like Facebook in
that respect because they're not selling
ads they don't need to like brag about
their viewership cuz the only time you
need to brag about viewership is when
you're bragging to a marketer saying
like look at how much more people are
watching our stuff give us money yeah I
still hate the fact that if I'm
scrolling along and I want to view
something and I want to read the per
like the summary I can't get that thing
to mute like yes yeah that drives me
absolutely at the wall
okay swinging back over to 5g Timothy
wants to know what are the main
companies that are actually going to
profit from the 5g deployment I feel
like Qualcomm has a monopoly on this
yeah Qualcomm's got a pretty strong hold
on it
Intel theoretically down the line will
Huawei though yeah while we will just
they they sell a ton of 5v equipment a
lot of the equipment providers Ericsson
theoretically will profit
you know these companies like Verizon
18t they're really eager to get into 5g
and offer u5g services but they also
have to spend a ton of money building
out these networks so they don't
necessary profit right away the the
gains are more in kind of winning you
over as a long-term customer and selling
5g services to businesses and I know
whoever wants to use this stuff but
that's further down the line I think in
the near term you could see a lot of
these equipment guys
Cisco benefit from the 5g investment
here's one from Macon aur makaan I
apologize if I'm pronouncing that wrong
is it really 5g or just boosted 4G I
heard rumors it's just boosted 4G let's
take that a step further how can you
tell the difference
no that's a great question there are a
couple of key differences between 5g and
4G one I mean the speed boost thing is
that one's tough because 4G is getting
faster and faster to the point world we
can get you know 1 1 gigabit per second
connection on 4G so speeds a little bit
that's a little bit murkier but things
like latency the responsiveness of the
network the fact that it can sort of
connect different devices at different
speeds that it's a little bit smarter
that's that's how you can sort of tell
it's 5g the use of super high frequency
spectrum that's really only 5g that's
not 4G those are some of the ways that
you can sort of tell but I will admit
like at least for the first year - like
as you're transitioning between 5g and
4G it's gonna be kind of tough to tell
here's a fantastic question from lost
legacy What's Up sir will we still have
gsm cdma or will 5g unite the signal
bands lean signal band scuse me in terms
of CDMA and like 2 or 3 G GSM that's
eventually gonna get phased out as I
think everyone moves to LTE and 5g
exclusively that's gonna vary depending
on what country you're in and how
quickly these companies have embraced 5g
I think down the line like we will get
to this kind of universal standard with
5g where like every phone can work on
any network that's
kind of a dream at least early on though
it's gonna be I think even more
fragmented than before since every
carrier will have their own specific
spectrum or frequency that they need to
tune their phones to so you'll probably
see a lot of phones that are specific to
carriers always early on like one that's
optimized Verizon one that's optimized
for EE one that's optimized for breaking
T like the one plus you know one plus is
supposed to come to Europe first and not
in the US the 5g 1 plus phone and that's
partially because they have to optimize
for that network so you will at least
early on see a lot of fragmentation and
what about t-mobile Avery says I thought
they would be the first that they said
they'd be the first carrier to roll of
5g and they spent a ton of money on 5g
equipment there they didn't they're not
the first 18 t will launch low this year
making them the first to launch mobile
5g t-mobile will be in the mix they're
supposed to launch in I forget a lot of
markets early next year at least a dozen
if not more they'll be the mix in terms
of that early deployment but they're not
the first do we know where life I comes
into play against all this wait what
Wi-Fi somebody's asking about life I I
don't know what life is I'm sorry
apologies Wi-Fi one more from Ricky any
thoughts on how they'll address signal
strength in buildings there I mean in
terms of like stadiums there they're
talking about you know adding more
repeaters that that rebroadcast 5g
signals within that's where big space is
in terms of like offices like when we're
in right now they're gonna rely on Wi-Fi
still it's it's not 5g isn't an answer
for everything especially indoors so you
can imagine you know Wi-Fi so playing a
big role in this I just I'm curious to
see how it actually plays up against
since we struggle here in a big dense
building getting getting 4G in and out
I wonder if 5g will actually perform
better but I think it's still gonna be
struggle like this building has
historically have been really bad for a
sorceress yeah president but why oh geez
not gonna help with that like the
actually if you if you consider the
spectrum being used it's fairly finicky
when it comes to walls and windows we've
got a lot of whatever old thick walls
that block our signals so five g's not
gonna help with that and electronic
interference here yeah I mean I sit by
the window and you'd think I'd have
better connection but it's still pretty
terrible yeah now them's the breaks but
we are out of time thanks everybody for
joining thanks for your questions we'll
be back tomorrow with episode 505 gee I
can almost promise you that just 500g
yes we have three days in a row
5g non-stop so this is Roger years since
4G happened
and lt I know since that yeah you've
been like when is the next G in ten
years you go into hibernation mode yeah
it's Bob G hype is over it's like
launched I just sort of like it retreats
to cocoon 410 goes into standby mode
that's right
till 6g rolls around I can't wait for 60
all right take us on out of here guys is
available on iTunes tune in feedburner
stitcher google play music google
podcast the amazon echo of course
cnet.com we will see you all tomorrow
bye bye
