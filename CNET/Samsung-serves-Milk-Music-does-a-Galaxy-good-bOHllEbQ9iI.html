with a tall cold glass of samsung milk
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update samsung has created its own
streaming radio service similar to
Apple's iTunes radio Samsung's music has
an offbeat name it's called milk music
yes milk like moo cow does a body good
have it with cookies milk it's free to
download in the Google Play Store and
there are no commercials but you can
only listen to it if you have a samsung
galaxy smartphone and for now it's only
available in the US basically it's
another perk to keep Samsung customers
happy within the ecosystem of Samsung
products if you come across a song that
you like there's no option yet to
purchase the track but that'll be
offered eventually it's powered by
slacker radio and the interface is
similar to a classic FM dial tuner where
you scan the frequencies to find the
music you like milk will have pre-made
stations and you can make custom
stations based on an artist or song also
in the world of apps you won't be able
to watch 6 seconds of smut anymore on
vine the video-sharing app owned by
twitter is now prohibiting sexual
explicit content vine lets users share
six-second video clips and when the app
first came out the creators allowed porn
but try to make it hard to find by
blocking some hashtags but vine will now
remove the content saying its quote not
a good fit however nudity is still
allowed if it's for art or education a
new way to make soda at home will be
revealed soon a company called sparkling
drink systems says it has created an
at-home carbonated beverage maker that
does not require carbon dioxide
cartridges which are what you need if
you use a SodaStream we won't see this
new product for a few days until March
fifteenth when it's on display at a
trade show in Chicago it looks like the
company beat coca-cola and curing to the
punch it's been announced that later
this year Keurig will also have a
carbonated drink maker that does not
require co2 cartridges and it'll offer
coke branded flavors there are also a
few cool gas
instead seen it reviewed cool in the
literal sense there's a new dyson fan
I'm sorry Dyson doesn't want to call it
a fan it's an air multiplier the new
model is supposed to be 75 percent
quieter than the last one it uses thirty
percent less energy but at three hundred
dollars you may not feel it's worth ten
times the price of a desk fan that you
can buy at the drugstore and you better
not lose the remote control that it
comes with since the only control on the
unit is the on/off button that's your
tech news update but you can find more
details at cnet com / update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
