Federal Trade Commission I'm Dan
Graziano filling in for Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update the FTC has
filed a complaint against t-mobile that
claims the carrier placed hidden charges
in phone bills for premium messaging
services the agency alleges that
t-mobile made hundreds of millions of
dollars on fees relating to these
charges it claims that t-mobile's
billing practices made it difficult for
customers to detect that anything was
wrong because they didn't show that
these charges were from a third party or
part of a subscription the agency has
also said that the carrier has failed
issue full refunds to some customers but
t-mobile CEO John ledger has called the
complaint unfounded and without merit he
said the carrier stop billing for these
charges last year and is already
processing refunds the FTC however wants
to ensure that every customer gets their
refund in other t-mobile news that
carrier will be offering the Nokia Lumia
635 smartphone to customers later this
month the handset features a 4.5 inch
display a 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
processor and a 5 megapixel rear camera
the Lumia 635 is the first smartphone in
the u.s. to run Windows Phone 8.1 which
includes a lot of new features and
improvements including Microsoft's
answer Siri the Cortana voice assistant
the device also runs on t-mobile's LTE
network and is the carrier variant of
the global release Lumia 630 which Cena
editors rate is a good gettin it three
out of five stars the main selling point
though is the price the Lumia 635 will
cost you only 168 dollars and you won't
even have to sign up for a two-year
contract now that's what I call a good
deal the Lumia 635 will be available
online from t-mobile on July ninth and
in stores on July sixteenth while metro
pcs will begin selling it on July
eighteenth online and in stores and
finally Songza an online radio provider
similar to pandora announced that is
being acquired by google the service
recommends various playlists based on
the time of day the weather your moo
food or an activity songs is Google's
20th acquisition this year joining the
ranks of companies like nest and drop
cam it's an interesting time for Google
to buy a music streaming company
remember that apple recently purchased
beats and amazon also launched its new
prime music service google has said that
there are no immediate plans to change
Songza although the company is exploring
ways to integrate the service into
google play music and possibly youtube
