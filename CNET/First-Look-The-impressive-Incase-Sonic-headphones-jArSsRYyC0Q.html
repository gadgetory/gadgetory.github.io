first look at the incase sonic over ear
headphones now you probably haven't
heard of in case headphones before
because while these are actually the
company's first run and it's a pretty
good one the Sonics make good use of new
materials that drive headphone design
forward and this pair looks and feels as
great as they sound now the unique thing
about this headset is that the chassis
is essentially stripped of all the
weakest elements of a traditional
headphone those pressure points being
the earplugs the ear cups and the joints
that put it all together now the
headband and ear cups are both built
from a one piece modular design that
hides notched adjustment brackets into
the side and that reduces the amount of
cordage that can easily become a tangled
mess also the headphones eliminate the
metal hinges that cause a lot of
headphones to creak under pressure so
these will certainly outlast competing
more expensive headphones like the beats
by dr. dre for example also you'll
notice that the earcups themselves are
oval shaped to mimic a real ear which
makes a lot of sense and also makes it a
lot harder for me to go back to
headphones with circular ear cups now
the adjustable nubs inside allow for a
fully articulated rotation that should
accommodate a range of head sizes and
the ear cups are actually padded with
memory foam that's built like a couch
cushion for your head but that also
makes for a tight seal that helps to
block outside noise when you have music
playing through them in case also
provides two separate three and a half
foot chords that disengage from the
headset and also include a 3-button
remote control for track navigation on
your iPhone so I ran several different
types of digital music files through an
iphone 4s paired with the in case onyx
and I'm really impressed with its high
frequency extension the base is very
punchy and shines through without
muddying the rest of the instruments and
you'll also notice an impressive sense
of open space while you're listening
that sort of takes the music out of your
head and gives you a better sense of
your musics composition the way it was
originally intended so the in case
tonics really proved that you don't need
to be in the audio business for decades
to produce a really solid headphone by
introducing new materials that give them
a secure
fit while also maintaining a level of
comfort that warrants all day use either
on the run or in the office in case has
succeeded in producing a near-perfect
headphone that's certainly worthy of
your 150 dollars now you can read more
details in my full review on cnet com
but that's going to do it for me I'm
Justin you you just took a first look at
the incase sonic headphones and that
sounds good to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
