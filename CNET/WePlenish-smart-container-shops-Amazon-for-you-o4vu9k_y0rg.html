much but it can change the way we think
about the kitchen of tomorrow it has one
little job to make sure you never run
out of your favorite snack and that
could mean big things for Amazon and the
future of grocery shopping this is the
Java smart container it's made by
startup company called
we plena sh it has little sensors on the
inside walls that detect when an item is
running low and it will automatically
reorder that item for you on Amazon it
can even place the order without needing
your confirmation making it totally
automated as you can probably assume you
need to be an amazon prime subscriber
for the service to work and there are
limits to what it can order the
replenish team worked with Amazon to
make the container compatible with 50
types of snacks and 20 of those items
are different types of coffee pods like
cake hub Keurig pods or Nespresso coffee
pods make sense coffee is one of those
things you never want to run out of and
you need something to hold all of those
little pod thingies but if you don't
care about coffee pods maybe you want to
get your fuel from something else like
gummy fruit snacks when you set up the
container you use the app to sync it
with your home Wi-Fi and you pick a
snack or coffee pod from the approved
list and the container sensors will
check the status of your supply twice
maybe three times a day you see it
learns over time so if you go through
something faster it'll check it more
often when my fruit snacks got to the
bottom sensor they're about five pouches
left and it ordered more for me
automatically and I got a pop up on my
phone letting me know that more were on
the way yes I have it a lot of gummies
for this but I did it for science so
don't judge me okay for science this is
designed for individually packaged goods
so you can't go putting loose food in
here and it wouldn't do you any good
since it doesn't have a lid and yeah
just just don't do that the we plan is
Java is not the first kitchen gadget
that goes shopping for you on Amazon
Britta has a water pitcher that orders
replacement filters target is also
Explorer
this space with a service called target
fetch it's testing out a smart paper
towel holder
it'll order more rolls after so many
spins and there's a bluetooth-enabled
soap pump that will also order refills
Amazon started this whole Auto reorder
idea with - buttons that you press we
need more of something the smart
container is the next evolution of that
concept it's battery powered with three
double a's which should last about a
year the container itself will cost
about $40 when it hits Amazon in October
for now we plan ish is finding its start
with the coffee crowd and those folks
that really love their snacks
hey I'm Bridget Carey thanks for
watching so would you order a gadget
like this that kept giving you more of
the same snack I don't write you but I'm
really kind of sick of the same snack
over and over again but I kind of see
the benefits so it was so much think in
the comments subscribe ring the bell to
be able to catch up on all the latest
gadget tree and in the meantime alright
I'm gonna go see if I can find myself a
soda because I'm getting count there's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
