shade tree mechanic needs an auto repair
shop once in a while and most folks need
one a lot more than that
I'm Brian Cooley here with my top five
tips for spotting a good repair shop
for about the most expensive biggest
piece of tech you own number five look
for certification things like ASE Triple
A Better Business Bureau and your
state's Bureau of auto repairs complaint
records they do count for something
especially if they're current and not
from 1969 under the previous good owner
now plenty of mediocre shops have these
things in dusty frames on the wall but
it's a stone number for tidy if grease a
dirty shop can't be a good shop but all
things being equal tidy tells you
something this is auto repair not
Grateful Dead trip dancing a certain
rigidity of process technology and
workspace make good things happen there
are great mechanic sewer slobs I just
haven't met one yet number three lots of
questions from them to you nothing gives
me the willies faster than a service
writer or shop owner who takes in my car
with barely a curt question or two you
see details up front lead to the best
least repair in my experience this is
also key to getting it done right the
first time
not the second or third infuriating time
number two no flushes when they urge you
to do a preventive transmission cooling
system or fuel injector flush that the
car maker makes no mention of in the
owner materials you need to flush the
shop these are signs they're likely in
the upsell business more than the auto
repair business before I get you to
number one here's what it won't be don't
sweat getting your parts back I know
that's a classic old-school sort of a
thing but it's predicated on a toxic
relationship from the get and you're not
gonna be able to recognize that greasy
bag of parts even came off your car or
not
shady shops know that my number one tip
is basic but there's nuance to it get a
reference but not from your friends
those same ones who were fooled by that
bag of greasy parts off some other car
instead hit the forums that deal with
your kind of car that's probably one out
there and if you find one with enough
members you're probably gonna find local
ones who've been to every shop in town
if you do have a friend who has car
repair savvy of course ask them but just
because you know someone who's had their
car repaired doesn't mean they know car
repair ask the right people or top five
lists to wait the car lover go to see
net on cars calm but on top five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
