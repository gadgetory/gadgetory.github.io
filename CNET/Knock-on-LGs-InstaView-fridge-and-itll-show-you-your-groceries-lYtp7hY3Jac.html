in store and door refrigerators
specifically the LFX see two four seven
nine six D now this is a counter depth
model and a nice black stainless steel
finish and the insta view feature here
is this dark panel here it's actually a
window into the door indoor compartment
now door and door you can open the door
like normal or you can open the door by
pressing this button just to get into
the indoor shelves but with insta view
I've got this window that I can knock on
to get the lights on and see what's
inside now LG pitches this is sort of a
more efficient way to raid your fridge
with this window that lets you look
inside without opening anything but the
thing about door and door compartments
is that they typically make the
temperatures go up to begin with this
entire door and door compartment if you
look at the heat map is nice and bright
orange on the default setting they're
all those temperatures are above 40
degrees warmer than the rest of the
fridge not exactly what you want
although it's somewhat forgivable given
that you're probably only storing drinks
and preservative heavy condiments on
those shelves now we've tested door and
door out pretty extensively over the
last few years and it really doesn't
have any appreciable effect on the
actual amount of cold air that leaves
your fridge if you open that door indoor
compartment you're gonna let cold air
out if you open the whole fridge you let
cold air out we've tested both ways the
grass looked the same it's not gonna
save you any energy and as counter-depth
fridges go it's pretty good the storage
space is pretty flexible you've got a
lot of shelf space you've got this
drawer that slides back you've got room
for tall items my one tiny qualms is
that I couldn't find a good spot for
this 2-liter bottle of soda there were
no shelves that would fit it upright and
even when I push that movable shelf back
there wasn't that much space to actually
sit the bottle on it kind of sat there
awkwardly so not the most flexible
fridge I've ever tested all of LG's
interview fridges are pretty expensive
and this one's no different coming in at
forty four hundred dollars that's a lot
probably too much for me for that door
and door feature that I don't think adds
that much convenience but if you like it
and think it's a cool way to check
inside then go ahead and put it on your
dream kitchen wish list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
