to test out a brand new piece of kit
that's looking set to shake up the
fashion industry this is the Zozo suit
as you can see this very very skin type
two-piece shows off all my curves and to
be honest you know my beautiful doughnut
and coffee filled gut now I've never
really had self-confidence issues in the
past but I'm not gonna lie being here in
one of Sydney's most photographic
locations has shaken my self-confidence
just a little bit but it's all good
that's not what the Zozo suit was
designed for anyway I'm gonna show you
exactly what it's all about alright so
back in the office I've put a sweater on
display or from looking at my gut for
the rest of the video but back to the
Zozo suit so the Zozo suit is the
brainchild of us our kumazawa and he's a
Japanese punk rocker term entrepreneur
billionaire who founded a website for
fashion known as Zozo town now in
Missoula he's actually short by Japanese
standards and he realized that other
people probably have the same problem
they can't quite find clothing that fits
them so he came up with an idea no idea
was to make an easy to order custom fit
clothing app that's so
so here's how it works so once you sew
sew suits arrived you download the Zozo
suit app and you go through the
measurement process it's very simple
it's all directed by the Zozo suit up
basically you just press next and it
runs you through the whole thing
you use those those two package you
actually get a stand as well and that
stands for you to place your smartphone
on uses the smartphone camera to take
pictures of you in 3d space and it uses
the white dots on de Zozo suit to form a
3d measurement so once it's taken all of
the photos you can see it produces a 3d
measurement of your entire body and
across your entire body you've got 18
measurements so you can see the neck
I've heard upper left arm sort of down
the bottom as well you can see that my
left calf is sort of
average which I'm pretty happy about
been working on that lately and also
your ankles down the bottom so once your
measurements in the system you can just
go to the shop your items button it
takes you to the storefront with the
zozo collection these are all made
in-house all of this apparel is those
those own brand and you can see
straightaway there's an oxford shirt
here for 48 dollars I can just select my
color
I'm gonna go pink I think that suits me
I only want one add to the bag once it's
in your bag and basically ready to go
now because it's taken my measurements
just now that oxford shirt when it
arrives it's already gonna be tailored
fit me and only me perfectly
now I've already ordered some items so
I'm actually gonna go jump into those
and show exactly what those are suit
apparel line looks like on this
fantastic canvas alright so I went with
a simple gray crewneck and some dark
blue straight slim jeans and to be
honest the major thing is how well does
it all fit and I'm pretty happy I mean
the gray crewnecks sits exactly as I
want it to it's the right length and
that's all because of the 3d measurement
system the jeans probably are a little
bit bigger than I expected they do have
a little bit of give especially around
the waist but also at the ankle I would
like them to be a little bit lighter but
that is what a slim straight beam is ok
so beggars can't be choosers
so the Zozo suit has enough there to get
people interested but with lengthy
shipping times and the price point is it
going to be enough to actually keep
people interested
for all my thoughts and impressions head
to cnn.com I am of course Jackson Ryan
I'm gonna jump back into Zozo soup and
I'm stupid reason then go to a cafe for
some good reason and get a copy I'll see
you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
