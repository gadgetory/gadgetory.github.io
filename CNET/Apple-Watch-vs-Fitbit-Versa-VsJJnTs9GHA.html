with the Versa and it's ready to go head
to head with the Apple watch this is
Apple watch Series 3 vs. Fitbit versa
both share a similar square face with
rounded edges the Versa has three
buttons and the Apple watch has one plus
a digital crown they both have
interchangeable straps a selection of
metal finishes and you can choose a
variety of watch bases to further
customize the look so my main priority
that I look for in a SmartWatch is
fitness tracker first and then kind of
SmartWatch second because that's what I
use it for the most obviously you know
to tell time and stuff like that but my
main feature is the running I'm totally
the opposite I am SmartWatch first and
then fitness features second design wise
I definitely noticed that the Fitbit for
a lot will flush against my wrists than
the Apple watch the Apple watch is much
more chunky exactly that little bulge at
the bottom with the sensors kind of
starts digging into your skin after a
while and almost least a little
indentation if you wear it to time I
thought the Apple watch was pretty
confusing in terms of the digital crown
I didn't know when to press it I'd know
where to turn it or the other button
like what do they do
I eventually got used to it but then I
put the Fitbit on and oh my goodness
three buttons I had no idea what each of
them did what kind of did bother me was
that the straps are is hard to swap out
and I do swap them out between running
and going to work for example the Apple
watch is much easier to swap out have
you tried it
I've tried the Apple watch but not okay
we need to have this challenge let me do
the Apple watch and I'll swap out the
band and you try to solve out the Fitbit
one alright okay
yes am I gonna get blamed for this I
know I'm just I'm glad it's not just me
and then and I can say this because this
is week this is everybody on the first
try oh I'm embarrassed at how slow I am
at this Lexi this is why I had to do it
because I was worried it was just me so
this is validation thing okay so at
least it wasn't just me nori that's
really tough to do if you've never
encountered that before really hot it is
no no no this this was me the first time
changing it
the Fitbit works with Android or iOS and
the Apple watch is tied to Apple's
ecosystem Fitbit mirrors the
notifications from your phone and you
can adjust what shows up from the Fitbit
app but you can't call on your voice
assistant or respond to a text Android
users will be able to respond to text
with canned responses in a future update
the Apple watch lets you do a lot more
especially if you have the LTE version
so you can leave your phone at home it
has basic functionality like making and
taking calls responding to texts or even
ordering a lift there are also a lot
more third-party apps to choose from
than the Fitbit the Apple watch lets you
do mobile payments through Apple pay for
payments with the versi you'll have to
get the special edition and in the US
this version costs $30 more both are
water resistant up to 50 meters which
means you can take them for a swim or
wear them in the shower so when I was
wearing the Fitbit I really did miss the
ability to respond to text and I also
missed this thing able to talk my
messages like to take them through Siri
I found it's pretty accurate for me most
of the time and my you know my accent is
not necessarily that easy to understand
especially for voice assistants if
they're sent to the US version but it
does a pretty good job now I'm
interested to know because you use
English and Spanish yeah for me the
dictation feature wasn't that useful
because it it doesn't it doesn't know
what language to respond in when I'm
texting so oftentimes I would dictate in
English and it would start trying to
dictate some gibberish in Spanish and
and vice-versa so I didn't use the
dictation I do like the the ability to
be free from the phone but at the same
time I end up spending more time but I
do like the other features of the watch
like you know Apple pay is a big one for
me and all sorry unlocking your
the Apple watch my favorite feature of
the Apple watch that I do miss when I'm
wearing the Fitbit it's so simple but
the Find My iPhone it's huge
when I'm walking out the door if I can't
ring my phone I'm like ah I just I miss
that boy watches measure steps distance
altitude and heart rate the Apple watch
has built-in GPS to track distance and
map your route the Fitbit relies on your
phone's GPS but if you don't want to
take it with you the Versailles uses
steps and stride to calculate distance
so going into it I thought I was really
gonna miss the GPS tracker on the Fitbit
it doesn't have one built-in and you
have to rely on the phone but actually
it wasn't as bad as I thought it's
pretty accurate in tracking distance
even when I don't take the phone along
with me but I do like seeing my map and
my accomplishment of my route in the
Apple watch if I have been out and
exercise I don't want to be tethered to
a phone at all and so having GPS is such
an important feature for me I don't like
using those first party apps generally
to track my R on my workouts whatever
I'm doing I usually use the third-party
app like Strava just something I can
kind of track my progress over time and
I'm competitive I want to see how I
compare to other people and that
motivates me even more one of the things
that I did like a lot about the Fitbit
that the Apple watch in Hamm was the
coach app as a new mom who doesn't make
it to the gym as often as I would like
having the ability to summon a fitness
instructor on my wrist wherever whatever
for 10 minutes was really great just
having those visuals about like how to
do an exercise that was a huge
game-changer for me
both allow you to see a deeper breakdown
of your information over time on their
mobile apps fitbit's consolidates it
into one app and lets you log other
health data manually like food and water
intake the Apple watch has a similar
breakdown but it is split between the
watch app the activity ring app and the
health app I love the Fitbit app the
fact that it translates the heart rate
info into actual useful information is
key for me you can look at a workout and
see when you were in cardio zone or in
fat burn mode or in your peak and so for
a run I want to have reached my peak or
else I'm not working hard enough or for
Pilates I want to stay in fat burn zone
as much as possible I really like that
as well and when I went back to the
Apple watch and I was trying to find the
right data there's three apps to choose
from I'm like do I look in my activity
ring up no it's not that it's really can
the health app nor like dog because
we're gonna watch off like where am I
supposed to look I really wish there was
a consolidated way to kind of get all
that information I'm sure that there are
lots of other third-party options as
well but you can do that with but just
the native way to do it it's so much
easier if you just have that all in one
place rather than scattered over kind of
three different areas and then the watch
itself you can sing songs to each watch
while they charge with the Apple watch
you can only sync music from your Apple
music library or stream over LTE while
the Fitbit syncing process is more
complicated you'll need the desktop app
and you can only load songs you own if
that's all too much trouble you can use
Deezer or Pandora to sync playlists so
when I was trying to put music on the
Fitbit it took forever and the fact that
I had to attach it to a computer was
just another pain point rather than
pulling across from the app so the good
thing about the Apple watch is that yes
you can pull across here and music
pretty easily from your phone but you're
tied to the Apple music ecosystem which
is kind of annoying now I have a Spotify
subscriber like Apple please please
please please please and Spotify please
please please please have some sort of
integration because I want to be able to
use my Spotify account for you you know
you think I'm on there I don't use it
that much so because it's so hard I
would use it even less
I mean the fact that it's so seamless
over the Apple watch I do have songs on
iTunes so it was a lot easier to
transfer then the painstakingly long
process on the Fitbit so I know that I
would probably just load one playlist
and then never even touch music again
because it's so hard where the Fitbit
really shines is battery life after
about five days of wearing the Versa all
day during workouts but not listening to
music it still had about a 10% battery
left the Apple watch struggles by
comparison especially if you're using
battery intensive features like LTE if
you adjust tracking workouts and using
it Samira notifications from your phone
you'll probably get about a full day's
use anything extra is a bonus okay
Vanessa it's crunch time I'm gonna put
you on the spot what is your favorite
and least favorite parts of beach okay
so for the Fitbit my favourite parts are
just the comfort of wearing it all day
the coach app I really like the price
point and the battery life those are
keys that's one of my biggest complaints
about the Apple watch is that I do have
to charge it every day but ironically my
favorite parts of the Apple watch are
what I don't like about the Fitbit is
the fact that it doesn't have GPS and
that it doesn't allow mobile payments I
mean you do get the you can get this
special edition so there's a way around
that but in that sense I think the Apple
X has it beat and the integration with
all the third-party apps is I like that
about the Apple watch how about you okay
the fact of Fitbit is you know platform
agnostic you can use Android or you can
use iOS but someone that swaps between
the phone ecosystem all the time I like
the fact that I'll be able to use the
Fitbit across whatever phone I'm using I
just wish that you could respond to text
messages but Android is coming soon so
that's something at least and the music
is the other big thing for me so because
of the Apple watch and the Fitbit are
kind of tied to these redeco systems
themselves like in terms of how you put
the music on until one of them gets a
Spotify I think that's kind of like the
big decision-maker for me as you
mentioned the comfort and the battery
life on a Fitbit is such a great
advantage over
Apple watch - sounds like you're not
ready to commit until one of them gets
Spotify on the other hand I will just
take both of them then Lexi I'll just
wear both of them one on each race what
do you guys think which one did you like
best which one would you buy let us know
and vote in our poll thank you again for
