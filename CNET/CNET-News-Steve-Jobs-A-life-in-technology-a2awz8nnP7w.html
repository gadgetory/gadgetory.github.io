somehow connect in your future you have
to trust in something your gut destiny
life karma whatever because believing
that the dots will connect down the road
will give you the confidence to follow
your heart even when it leads you off
the well-worn path a philosophy Steve
Jobs learned to embrace after a life of
victories setbacks and surprising
diversions that made him an agent of
change in how we communicate and are
entertained he is gone but his vision of
our digital world very much remains the
story of his life in technology played
out in three acts the magnitude of which
can only really be seen now looking back
Act one it's 1977 Jobs and Apple
co-founder Steve Wozniak introduced the
Apple to the first successful personal
computer but 1984 brought a much bigger
milestone the first personal computer
that was really personal today for the
first time ever
I'd like to let Macintosh speak for
itself with a graphical interface mouse
creative software and whimsical design
it was a completely different animal
from the sterile machines coming from
Microsoft and Intel just as different
was the TV commercial that announced the
Mac one they still talk about in the ad
business today and which showed jobs new
technology sells better with a little
height but none of that would be enough
to hold back the juggernaut of Intel and
Microsoft and the difficulties Apple
faced in growing the Mac business led to
jobs being shown the door at his own
company in 1985 I was basically fired
from the Faline I was 30 that was
difficult when
happen but maybe the best thing that
ever happened to me at 2:00
shortly after jobs ouster he founds next
to produce a new kind of advanced
workstation computer that runs on an
object-oriented software architecture
which would become the basis of a
dramatically new and better Mac OS years
later
similarly telling was the design of the
next machine stylish austere and
breaking convention sound familiar
in 1986 Jobs also acquired the graphic
arts division of Lucasfilm turning it
into Pixar the studio that mainstreamed
animated features and can boast that its
films deliver the highest average gross
revenue of any studio in the film
industry but in classic form act 3 with
jobs biggest he retook the helm of a
nearly bankrupt Apple and introduced the
iMac the following year with what was
the first of what we now call a Steve
note iMac comes from the marriage of the
excitement of the internet with the
simplicity of Macintosh it was the first
personal computer designed around the
internet when Bill Gates and Microsoft
Word of the PC era Jobs was about to
become to the Internet and eventually
mobile era we got a lot of incredible
stuff to show you today his presentation
skills at events such as Mac world would
become legendary examples of showmanship
and star power in industry it's really
beautiful this is what it looks
detractors would derive jobs hype as a
reality distortion fee but the iMac
worked and Apple began to turn around
but Jobs single biggest course change
for Apple was not a computer but the
iPod what is iPod I haven't had one
right here in my pocket in fact there it
is right there
introduced in October 2001 it was small
in size spacious and capacity and looked
good but more importantly it diversified
Apple away from head-on competition with
the wind tail computer makers while
luring away their customers when iTunes
launched Windows support in October of
oh three I'm here to report to you today
that this is half
Apple begins to rewrite the music
business become a major media player and
got its first taste of market dominance
but in terms of financial success
nothing tops the Apple product that was
built on the shoulders of the iPod today
Apple is going to reinvent the phone the
jobs and apples showed an uncanny
ability to once again get the formula
right appear the originator and make a
piece of advanced technology seems
simple magical and fashionable with that
same DNA the iPad arrived in April 2010
we'd like to show it to you today for
the first time and we call it the iPad
and again legitimize the category that
other companies had only nibbled at the
edges of for years
it's so much more intimate than a laptop
and it's so much more capable than a
smartphone Apple has had its share of
flops but they mostly pale compared to
its hits and there were always notes of
hubris around the latter day company
seen most in jobs almost dismissing
documented problems with the iPhone
fours antenna we think it's affecting a
small percentage of users and we think
some of that problem is inherent in most
every smartphone but mostly apples since
Jobs return has been a culture changer
as much as a technology company one of
the biggest success stories in American
business and virtually indivisible from
the identity of its CEO and it seems
right that the best epitaph for him
might be found in the words of an apple
TV commercial but wasn't really selling
anything except Apple and while some may
see them as the crazy ones
we see genius because the people who are
crazy enough to think they can change
the world are the ones who do
