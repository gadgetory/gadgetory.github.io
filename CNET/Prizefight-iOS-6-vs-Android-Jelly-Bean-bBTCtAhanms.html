and this is an epic Apple versus Google
tries fight you'll be talking about when
it's over it's a prize five foot shout
between iOS 6.1 three and pure Android
jelly bean 4.2 - we're bringing the
whole mobile team on for this one our
judges for this fight are senior editor
Jessica Duke it out Dholpur senior
editor Bryant boom-boom Bennet associate
editor Lynn by the Phi D LA and myself
real Indian pound now we'll take all
four judges scores and average them out
to the nearest tenth each round the
final prizefight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
system it's a four round beat down round
one is designed do looks matter when it
comes to a mobile operating system you
bet it does and all of our judges agree
that iOS is easy to use but it doesn't
look much different than every previous
version of iOS with its rounded corner
icons now in some of its specific apps
it still uses a skeuomorphism design
where a note app looks like a notepad or
something like Game Center has a felt
poker table design I know
iOS fans if it ain't broke don't fix it
but iOS needs a major overhaul to be
fresh sleek and sexy again now jelly
bean has a clean modern design that
looks and feels like it's from the
future and it's consistent across the
board with its native apps its menu
transitions and even something like the
lockscreen
add some visual eye candy jellybean gets
a perfect 5 and iOS gets a 4 next round
is user interface and navigation
we set it over and over that iOS has the
easiest pick-up-and-play user interface
on any mobile device to date and that
won't change you can create folders for
multiple apps and it has more functions
like swiping down from the top for
notifications that is one of the few
truly customizable parts of iOS it gets
a little more advanced with double
tapping the home button for currently
used apps and controls or holding it
down to access Siri for its voice
features but its biggest drawback is
that it's so locked down that real
customization is pretty much
non-existent now jelly bean admittedly
isn't the easiest operating system to
pick up and play and you'll have to
learn how to use some of its features
but it's not that bad and there's a
point where you want your phone to do
more and a good amount of people are
there customization is king here with
creating folders for apps Android
introduced the notifications pulldown
but also being able to customize your
home screens with specific widgets that
give you more control over the phone and
you can even customize your type of
lockscreen
this is really a personal preference of
ease of use versus more customization
and eventually there will be one with
both but iOS takes this round with the
4.8 and jelly beans gets a four it's
after averaging two rounds jelly bean
has the edge next round is features
iOS 6 kept many features from iOS 5 the
same improving some and redoing others
like maps now Apple Maps has
turn-by-turn directions but it falls
behind lacking public transit directions
there's no Google Streetview and maps
that still aren't as accurate right now
sure it's 3d can look pretty good with
that flyover feature but it's still more
style than substance
now Google Maps has stayed the same and
improved on their foundation and is
still the undisputed best Maps app on
mobile with accurate turn-by-turn
navigation public transit options and
you can even use compass mode on Street
View Siri is more useful with sports
movies and food recommendations but it
still isn't accurate enough and it takes
way too long to get information back
from its servers what do I mean by that
who is Bruce Lee
that's what I mean now Google's voice
recognition for search and voice the
text is so much faster and more accurate
and Google now for local happenings
around you traffic and weather is their
answer to Siri then we have iOS is
passbook that has some potential but no
one is really using it and the lack of
NFC hurts where jellybean brings native
NFC support with Android Beam four
wirelessly sending content from one
phone to another although it could be
faster and you have Google Wallet built
into the OS as well they still need to
perfect it but iOS doesn't have anything
like it baked in both OS is pulled from
their ecosystem Apple's iCloud and
Google services sync your mail contacts
and calendars and wirelessly uploading
of photos as well Apple calls there's
photo stream Google calls it Instant
Upload
now iOS is FaceTime is more integrated
into the OS for video calls and you can
use any third-party app on jellybean
like Skype but jelly bean brings even
more like a gesture based keyboard
typing option that actually works really
well and the notifications drop-down
that allows you to respond to emails
from it and have quick access to your
key services on the phone and please
don't tell me iOS is gamecenter is
really a legit feature jellybean takes
round three with a perfect 5 and iOS 6
gets a 3.8 so after three rounds
jellybean is ahead by half a point what
is
anyone's fight the final round that
decides it all is ecosystem Apple pretty
much created the most successful content
ecosystem and it all started with the
foundation of iTunes where you'll still
have the biggest library of content for
music TV shows and movies and iTunes
exclusives are bonus tracks that you
just can't find on other stores then you
throw in the App Store and it's almost
unfair it's really no secret that when
developers build an app they typically
do it for iOS first and then Android and
that's not Google's fault it's just the
reality
Google was late to the content party but
it started to catch up and the Play
Store is now a legitimate option for
media content like movies music books
and magazines iOS takes the final round
with the perfect 5 and jellybean gets a
four so let's average out all four
rounds and enterprise buy the Google
jumped out early Apple fought back hard
in the final round but it just wasn't
enough and Android jelly bean takes this
price buy four point five a four point
four and is your prize buy it winner
these are two amazing operating systems
that will only get better but there's
competition from Windows Phone 8 and
Samsung's Tizen coming soon
i'm brian tom thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time for another
prizefight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
