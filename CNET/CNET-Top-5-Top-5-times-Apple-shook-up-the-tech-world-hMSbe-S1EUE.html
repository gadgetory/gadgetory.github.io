Akhtar Apple's big developer conferences
over and that mythical Apple TV and or
Apple TV streaming service remained a
tech unicorn
however apples had a crazy history since
it was founded in 1976 today we're
taking a look at the top five times
Apple shook up the tech world at number
five is introducing the iMac when the
original iMac debuted in May 1998 it
featured an eye-catching design in a
world of beige boxes the iMac was this
colorful computer that looked like it
belongs in the Jetsons it even had a
handle for some reason however there was
something missing from the iMac there's
no floppy drive you'd have to use a CD
drive if you wanted to use physical
media at that time this was a big deal
floppy drives who were staple of
computers back then Apple also included
some new ports on the side something
called USB instead of Apple desktop bus
or scuzzy the bold iMac was the first
big thing consumers saw from Apple since
Steve Jobs returned in 1997 at number 4
is the introduction of the Apple store
way back in 2001 Apple launched its
first retail store it was considered a
risky move what did Apple know about
retail aside from dealing with
third-party retailers not much what
about the idea that other retailers
might not carry Apple products since the
company would be directly competing with
them the Apple store showed that Apple
could succeed in retail by using a very
different approach when it came to
selling computers if you went to an
Apple store you'd see a clean place with
lots of room to test out all the
products it was really easy to get your
grubby little hands on apples pricey
computers and gadgets without being
bothered by the staff that's not the way
computer stores were back then even
today the Apple stores influence is seen
at other retailers take a look at a
Microsoft Store or Samsung one at number
three is the introduction of the
original Macintosh and its OS in 1984
this is number three what on earth is
above this let's talk about the original
Macintosh it was the first computer
available to the masses with a graphical
user interface that could be controlled
by a mouse before the Mac using a
computer involved typing in commands at
a prompt using a keyboard only there's a
metaphorical desktop or file folders the
Mac change that before you write in we
know that Apple didn't invent a GUI but
popularized it
Computers made their first major step
into being adopted by everyday people
thanks to an easier interface number two
reinventing the music business by
introducing the iTunes Music Store in
2003 in a world of rampant music piracy
some computer company called Apple
decided to offer a solution all in how
to do with strong-arm the entire music
industry into a price structure where
songs would cost just 99 cents for a
downloadable copy to be able to buy
these songs individually no album
purchase is necessary that right there
was an amazingly difficult task
Apple effectively dragged the music
industry into the digital age when the
iTunes music store launched had 200,000
songs and no subscription fees the
downloadable music models served as a
blueprint to future services and the
number one is that one time Apple
basically turned the world upside down
by introducing the iPhone in 2007
smartphones were around before the
iPhone but this was the device that
changed everything from blackberry palm
Motorola Samsung Microsoft and any other
company that had a hand in phones on top
of that Apple played hardball with
wireless carriers particularly in the
u.s. no pre-installed software from
carriers would come with the iPhone and
no carrier branding adorned the outside
of the phone the original iPhone is
laughable compared to today's modern
phones but the first iPhone was years
ahead of the competition at the time
Apple built an operating system that
allowed a user to use intuitive gestures
and taps to navigate a relatively
complex device it also had a real web
browser the iPhone greatly influenced
what a smart phone would be from his
introduction that list kind of made me
angry maybe three should have been
number one maybe the introduction of the
iPod should have been on that list let
me know what you think on Twitter on
that is well more top fives like this
