home to date was its lack of support
from multiple accounts living in a
household with multiple people meant you
either had to share things like calendar
and music accounts or get multiple
Google home speakers today Google fixes
that Google home now supports multiple
accounts with personalization and neural
network voice recognition here's how to
set it up when you open the Google home
app you should see a notification that
says multi-user is now available if you
don't see that notification tap the
device's button an icon of a television
and speaker in the top right corner tap
the action overflow button in the top
right corner of the card for your Google
home and select settings you should see
a notification there that also says
multi-user is now available you can also
get to the setup menu by going to
devices settings more and shared devices
click the plus sign in the bottom right
corner to begin setup tapping one of
these notifications will begin the
process of teaching assistant your voice
you must say the phrases hey Google and
ok Google twice each tap continue then
tap invite if you want to add someone
else to the Google home additional users
will need to download the Google home
app and go through the same setup
process but since their account might
not have already been connected they
will need to link their own music
accounts and personalize the Google home
preferences to their liking by
customizing new sources linking their
Netflix account and tweaking what their
my day includes
this also means that we'll need to add
smart home devices to their assistant
account as well this keeps just anyone
from joining your Google home and being
able to control your smart devices to
set up another account from the same
device open the Google home app and hit
the hamburger button in the top left
corner select the drop down to select an
already connected account or hit manage
account and add account to sign in to a
new one then go through the same setup
process up to six accounts can be added
to a single Google home you can see all
the active accounts in a Google home by
going to devices settings and linked
accounts there you can remove your
account but you cannot remove other
accounts once more than one user is set
up on a Google home speaker nothing
needs to be done to switch between
accounts since assistant has learned
each of the users voices when you say
things like tell me about my day your
personal calendar and traffic report
will be referenced when you ask to play
music your preference a music service
will play by the
