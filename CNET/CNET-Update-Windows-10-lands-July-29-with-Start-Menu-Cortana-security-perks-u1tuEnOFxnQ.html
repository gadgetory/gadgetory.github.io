months I am Bridget Carey this is your
sting at update Windows 10 has a launch
date the next version of the operating
system will be available to download on
July 29th it's available as a free
upgrade on your PC or tablet if you
already have Windows 7 or Windows 8 if
you like you can reserve a copy to
download now and when it's available
your computer will automatically
download it on Windows just look to the
system tray at the lower right corner
and you should see a new icon with the
windows logo that prompts you to get
Windows 10 and if you're confused on the
numbering it's not you there was never a
nine Microsoft just jumped to Windows 10
and you could think of it as a blend of
seven and eight giving you both the
desktop experience and the touchscreen
tiles the Start menu is back along with
some new features Internet Explorer is
being replaced with another browser
called edge you can make notations on a
website and then save it as an image to
share you can also ask Cortana questions
through the browser Cortana is like the
Microsoft version of Apple's Siri and
she's woven throughout the operating
system letting you make requests or ask
for help with voice commands you can set
a reminder with Cortana through the
desktop and then later get the reminder
to pop up on your phone you don't even
need to have a Windows Phone to do that
there's going to be a Cortana app for
Android and iPhone windows 10 also has
some new security perks you can unlock
the computer just by sitting in front of
it the camera scans your face to
instantly verify your identity and
speaking of security Google has made it
much easier to keep track of your
privacy and security settings all on
Google services because it's now all in
one place go to privacy google.com to
see how Google tracks your data and you
can see which apps and devices have
permission to connect to your accounts
you'll be able to turn off anything that
is outdated or makes you uncomfortable
meanwhile a few new gadgets are cropping
up at the Computex technology show in
Taiwan asa stay beautiful air and like
the Apple watch it has a little knob on
the side it also
in two sizes a 49 millimeter and 45
millimeter screen and you can pick from
gold silver and gunmetal colors along
with several other types of wristbands
aside from this youtube video that looks
just like an apple commercial we don't
have too many details yet about the
watch
but Asus also showed off a phone it
named the zenfone selfie it's embracing
the world's narcissism with a
front-facing 13 megapixel camera and it
has beautification mode to make your
face look its best it has a stand so you
can prop it upright and face it forward
that's all for this news update but you
can get more details at cnet.com and
also get a peek at Asus and other new
PCs and its tablet the Zen pad from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey
