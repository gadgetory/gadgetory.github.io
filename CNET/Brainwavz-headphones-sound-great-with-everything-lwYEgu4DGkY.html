of the brainwaves hmm 5 if you're
looking to buy a set of headphones the
amount of choices available can quickly
become overwhelming especially as it's
hard to know how much to spend but if
you're looking for a set of true - head
phones you don't need to spend that much
stupid name aside the brainwaves hm5 are
available for under 130 dollars these
are monitor headphones as opposed to
consumer ones as in they're designed to
be listened to at home but have a more
analytical than musical sound the build
quality is very good and compares well
against the similarly priced Audio
Technica m50 s however the brainwaves
fit better the leather ear cups go
around the ears completely and the
headphones don't creak when you move
your head like the m50 s do they don't
look much though so there's no bragging
rights there as with other professional
headphones the cable is detachable and
comes with either earth 1.3 meter or 3
meter cable in the box there's also a
spare set of ear pads in the box as well
the sound quality is very neutral with a
slight boost to the vocal
intelligibility and a gentle roll-off to
the bass
this makes the headphones very versatile
and adept of most types of music
compared to the Audio Technica m50 s
that HM 5s aren't as convincing with
rock music as they lack bass Panch but
they are a shade more detail in the
vocal response which is a decent
trade-off that would also be of use in
recording studios where the mid-range
response is very important and the
closed design stops sound leakage if
you're looking for a detailed pair of
headphones that also sound good with
music and are comfortable to wear for
long periods I couldn't think of a
better pair of headphones for the money
than the brainwaves HM vibes this has
been tae Pendlebury for cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
