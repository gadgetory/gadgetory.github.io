is the quirky pivot power genius this is
a 79 $99 power strip now why would a
power strip cost that much well this one
is smart and has two outlets right here
on the top that you can power on and off
from your smartphone using the free wink
app for iOS and Android devices this
means you'll be able to power on your
lamp your cell phone charger whatever
you can think of just by pressing a
button on your phone now quirky teamed
up with GE to release this product it's
an update from an existing design that
had the pivot ability but it wasn't
smart so they're adding that and they're
raising the price to 80 bucks his 80
bucks a good price for this thing I
don't know the Wemo switch that we
tested cost 50 bucks it only has one
outlet but it also adds if compatibility
and it works really well
you can plug a motion detector up with
it I think that's a pretty good product
and that might be the better option here
but this does have two outlets and the
wink app is pretty well designed you can
also use the pivot power genius with
quirky spotter multi-purpose sensor and
that is a little smoke detector looking
thing that can detect motion and sound
and light changes and temperature and
humidity and you can use all of those
changes as triggers to control when the
power strip turns on and off in my
testing those spotter sensors weren't
always as reliable or consistent as I
would like so if you're thinking about
buying this power strip and want to buy
the spotter as well check out my review
of that device just to make sure it's
the right fit for you another cool
feature you connect it to your Wi-Fi by
holding your phone up to this light
sensor and having the app flash a light
pattern that's really cool also keep in
mind that if you like the fact that this
thing pivots and flexes to accommodate
large chargers and bulky plugs you can
get this power strip without the smart
functionality for a lot less it cost
$29.99 you can find it on sale on some
websites from $19.99 so if you don't
care about the smart functionality or
the wink app just go with that instead
overall the pivot power genius is an
interesting product and I found that
turning lights on and off and using it
my smartphone worked really well so if
that interests you and that sounds
useful check it out
foreseen that I'm right wrist
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
