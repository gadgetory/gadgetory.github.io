than six months and crossing 300 million
miles in sight has reached its
destination the red planet Mars welcome
to Mission Control at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory on dayley Hill
less than an hour from now in sight
we'll begin the most harrowing six and a
half minutes of the entire mission udl
entry descent and landing the team is as
prepared as it can be but who knows what
Mars has in store today the crews
Mission Support area is filled with
engineers monitoring the situation and
for the first time during a Mars landing
you can be in the room - we have a
360-degree camera in this control room
allowing you to experience the landing
right along with the team there you see
it and to look up the link just go to
the insight watch page you see there on
the screen and this mission has actually
two control rooms the second is at
Lockheed Martin space outside of Denver
Colorado engineers there are on council
two plus people all over the world are
tuning in at museums and libraries and
other locations including this one at
the Pasadena Convention Center and that
is where friends and family are watching
right now there will also be an
opportunity to watch in New York City
there they are cheering there will be
also an opportunity to watch in New York
City when landing coverage gets
displayed on the Nasdaq tower you see
there in Times Square and of course if
you are watching please snap a picture
and share it with us using the hashtag
Mars landing we'd love to see it now I'd
like to introduce you to NASA
Administrator Jim Bryden Stein thank you
for coming oh it's my honor so excited
to have you here
so this is your first Mars line it is in
this job no I'm right I have witnessed
these as I should say from the sidelines
for many years this is going to be the
eighth time that we have a successful
landing on Mars everybody knock on wood
but this is the first time for me to
participate as the administrator so it's
very exciting very much not nervous
excited look at their amazing people
here no way I could be nervous all right
so we hope to have you back on set after
landing and maybe take a couple of
social media questions absolutely all
right if you would like to ask the
administrator a question use the hash
Tagg asked NASA and before you go you
did ask about the lucky peanuts so this
is your bottle take in they're happily
munching on these all right thanks for
joining us now let's give you some
background inside in short is short for
interior exploration using seismic
investigations geodesy and heat
transport it's different from other Mars
missions which all studied the surface
insight is the first mission to study
the interior of the red planet the basic
idea of insight is to map out the deep
structure of Mars we know a lot about
the surface of Mars we know a lot about
its atmosphere and even about its ion
asphere but we don't know very much
about what goes on a mile below the
surface much less 2,000 miles below the
surface down to the center and this will
be the first mission that's going to
Mars specifically to investigate the
deep inside of Mars we know that the
earth is habitable we know that Mars is
not there might be something that we
find out in terms of the structure of
Mars versus the structure of Earth that
maybe can help us understand why that is
inside carries a seismometer which
measures the seismic waves that have
traveled through Mars from Mars quakes
and maps out the deep interior structure
of Mars we're gonna also have a heat
flow and physical properties probe which
will penetrate into the Mars surface
about 5 meters or 16 feet to take the
temperature of Mars and it has a radio
science experiment which uses the radio
on the spacecraft to measure small
variations in the wobble of Mars as Pole
to understand more about the structure
and composition of the core
insite will be the first mission to pick
instruments up off the deck of the
lander and place them on the surface of
Mars I like to say that we're playing
the claw game on Mars with no joysticks
the seismometer needs to be installed in
one place and basically not move in
order to get the best seismic data we
also have a wind and thermal shield that
will then be placed on top of that
seismometer to protect it further from
the environment for the heat flow probe
HP cube it also needs to sit in one
place take a while to hammer itself down
into the ground and acquire the thermal
measurements over a long period of time
insight is a mission to Mars but it's
much much more than a Mars mission in
some sense it's like a time machine it's
measuring the structure of Mars it was
put in place four and a half billion
years ago so we can go back and
understand the processes that warn Mars
just shortly after it was accreted from
the solar nebula by studying Mars we'll
be able to learn more about earth Venus
mercury even the moon even exoplanets
around other stars landing on Mars is
always difficult more than half the
missions have failed our experts in this
field are systems engineers for entry
descent and landing they speak EDL let
me introduce you to two in our control
room kristine Soleil who will be making
the mission call-outs during landing and
Julie warts gem she is our color
commentator who will help explain
mission operations christine let's start
with you
I understand that there was a final
software update and adjustment what does
that mean that's right yesterday we sent
the last EDL software parameter update
to the spacecraft's computer this update
told the spacecraft exactly when it will
hit the top of the atmosphere and also
fine-tuned things like when to deploy
the parachute this EDL software is very
important because insight uses this
software to perform entry descent and
landing completely on its own Mars is so
far away from Earth that when a command
from Earth it takes about eight minutes
for it to reach the spacecraft entry
descent and landing from start to finish
is less than eight minutes long so
insight has to do this all by itself
alright its fate is sealed
now I understand that the team is about
to do a readiness pull Julie can you
fill us in on that sure so that's gonna
be a poll between our ETL communications
engineer and several of the different
orbiters and antennas that we have here
on earth so we have Marco listening in
on us and MRO which is Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter will be listening
to our data and recording it for us and
then the radio science engineers will be
eavesdropping in on our signal from all
the way back here on earth and sandi our
EDL communications engineer will be
checking in with them making sure that
they're all ready to go ready to support
us and just a little you know under an
hour to land on Mars all right so we're
standing by for that for the readiness
pull and I understand that the peanuts
are going to be passed in there pretty
soon I believe us that that's the idea
yeah we'll be passing around the peanuts
very soon after that for those of you
who don't know the JPL peanuts are a
tradition that gives us a little bit of
extra luck on our critical events so if
anybody out there wants to join in on
peanuts and give us some extra good good
luck peanut vibe we'd love to have it
well there's a story behind that that
way back when in the early days of JPL
there were several missions and there
were six Ranger missions to the moon
that failed yep but then with Ranger
seven or seven somebody somebody passed
around people yeah yeah and it worked
and you don't mess with what works so
it's not a superstition it's a tradition
we just give ourselves that little bit
of extra luck all right so yeah if you
have peanuts at home please have some
that's right
all right thanks Julie nASA has had
seven successful Mars landings but the
EDL team never ever becomes
overconfident JPL chief engineer Rob
Manning says things have to work just
right during six
have critical minutes although we've
done it before landing on Mars is hard
and this mission is no different the
process to get from the top of the
atmosphere of Mars to the surface we
call entry descent and landing or EDL it
takes thousands of steps to go from the
top of the atmosphere to the surface and
each one of them has to work perfectly
to be a successful mission
the process starts well above the top of
the atmosphere of Mars
the cruise stage faces the Sun it also
has its radio antenna which faces earth
but now we don't need the crew stage its
job is done the next step just seven
minutes before arriving to the top of
the Mars atmosphere is to separate the
crews stage before you hit the top the
atmosphere though the space capsule has
to orient itself so the heat shield is
precisely faced to the atmosphere now
the fun begins the vehicle is moving at
nearly 13,000 miles an hour but it's
hitting the top of Matmos here at a very
shallow angle 12 degrees any steeper the
vehicle will hit the thicker part of the
atmosphere and will melt and burn out
any shallower the vehicle will balance
off the atmosphere of Mars at the very
top the atmosphere it's about 70 miles
above the surface of Mars and the air is
starting to get thicker and thicker and
thicker as it does that the temperature
of the heat shield gets well over a
thousand degrees centigrade enough to
melt steel over the next two minutes the
vehicle decelerates at a back-breaking
12 Earth Gees from 13,000 miles an hour
to about 1,000 miles at about 10 miles
above the surface of Mars a supersonic
parachute is washed out of the back of
the vehicle 15 seconds after the
parachute inflates it's time to get rid
of the heat shield six pyrotechnic
devices fire simultaneously allowing the
heat shield to fall and tumble away from
the via
exposing the lander to the surface of
Mars 10 seconds after the heat shield is
dropped three pyro technically deployed
legs are released and locked for landing
about a minute later the landing radar
is turned on sending pulses toward the
surface of Mars as the vehicle starts to
try to measure how high it is above the
surface and how fast it's going out
about a mile above the surface of Mars
the lander falls away from the back show
and like this entrance and very quickly
the vehicle must rotate out of the way
so that the parachute and the back shelf
doesn't come down to hit it the last
thing that has to happen is that on the
moment of contact the engines have to
shut down immediately if they don't the
vehicle will tip over so of all the
steps of entry descent and landing
happen perfectly and we are safely on
the surface of Mars we'll be ready to do
some exciting new science person later
on in the program meantime let me
introduce you to someone who has been
working on insight for seven years he's
the project manager Tom Hoffman 7 years
and today's the day that's right 7 years
but we're just a little over you know 40
minutes now and we're going to be on the
surface gonna be awesome
really exciting all right so let's talk
about insight it's using tried-and-true
technologies based on Phoenix this time
there's a bigger challenge with
communication correct normally we have
an orbiter that can give us vent pipe
communications but it's different this
time that's right most of the time when
we've landed recently we've had Mars
Odyssey which can do bent pipe
communications and so we get real-time
data as we go through ETL and we've come
to expect that and actually we really
really want that in this case our
primary technology primary orbiter is
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and so what
that's going to be doing is actually
well be listening to us on the UHF if
you go to the video you can see this
emerald will be listening to us and
beginning all the primary data and it
will send it back to us unfortunately
only at three hours after we land
so it doesn't give us the bent pipe live
information we have a couple of other
sources that we're looking at we have a
green bake observatory in West Virginia
Max Planck observatory and EPEL spur
Germany which will be giving us UHF but
those only give us a couple of different
points in time and so we did something
kind of cool this time we brought along
a couple cube SATs called Marco and so
hopefully they're both working great
today Oh fantastic so we're hoping that
they're gonna continue to work all the
way through EDL and they well be giving
us real-time feed so we can show how
that works on the next video here so you
can see here's insight with its crude
stage getting close to Mars but we have
two stalkers following us they've been
following us since we launched they
launched on the same launch vehicle as s
and so you can see the green there is
we're sending UHF signals to them and
then they turn that around it's in a
much stronger signal back to earth we
can't communicate on UHF direct to Earth
with a signal that tells what's going on
in the spacecraft that Marco can if it
works for us
all the way down to the surface we're
gonna have some great information coming
from Marcos so Marco is basically trying
to fill that gap that we would have had
if we had live communication coming down
to us absolutely so if it does not work
does it affect insight mission at all no
not at all we'll just be doing a little
more nail-biting but right now it looks
like it's gonna it's gonna be working
but it doesn't impact insight at all and
we have one final way that we're gonna
know that we've got successfully the
ground which is the spacecraft will
phone home okay once it gets down to the
ground it's gonna have gone seven months
through crews seven and a half minutes
of tear and it's gonna call back and say
hey I'm on the surface I'm feeling
pretty good everything looks good so far
and also to prep the audience they're
not even after landing we're not out of
the woods just yet
correct not just yet we have one more
step that we have to do we have to let
the dust settle quite literally we're
gonna kick up a lot of dust when we land
we need to let that dust settle before
we want to unfurl our solar rays we're
100% solar-powered so it's very
important that we get those out
unfortunately both MRO and Marco will be
out of view by the time that we have
those completely unfurled and so we're
gonna have to wait five and a half hours
until Odyssey comes by and tells us that
yes indeed our solar arrays are
so we'll definitely have a celebration
when we get successful landing but we're
going to have to temper that just a
little bit and wait about five and a
half hours so now absolutely for sure
we're in good shape
so we have immediate knowledge if we
have the Marko's so just to run it
through it once again what's going to
happen with EDL we've got some we have
the video the show how exactly is this
all going to play out in six and a half
minutes and we can roll the video okay
yeah so you can see here we're attached
to the crew stage we drop that off say
thank you for the ride to Mars it burns
up in the atmosphere you can see it gets
very hot on our heat shield we're
getting up in some places maybe 3,000
degrees Fahrenheit as we go through this
we're on the heat shield for about four
minutes that dissipates about 90% of the
energy that we need to dissipate before
we get to the surface then we pop our
parachute we're going about 850 miles an
hour when we pop the parachute we're on
that for about two minutes then we'll
drop off the heat shield
we'll start acquiring the ground with
our radars very much like an f-16
fighter jet radar the legs will pop out
we'll start descending we drop for just
a second which is very terrifying for me
our descent thrusters we have 12 of them
there's sixty eight pound thrusters
start thrusting and dropping us to the
ground and slowly slowly we drop down
going only five miles an hour so in that
six and a half minutes of Terror which
is a little less than the seven minutes
so that's great for me we go from twelve
thousand three hundred miles an hour at
seventy-five miles above the surface of
Mars we get to the surface for five and
a half miles an hour that's amazing
that's absolutely amazing well before
you go Tom there was a couple of
pictures we wanted to show you we have
watch parties taking place all over the
country and let's see if we can put one
of these watch parties up for you to see
this is from Ohio this is a person who
has a watch party it looks like in a
classroom that is so awesome isn't that
great that folks are watching with us
yeah I know people all across the globe
want to put on a good show phone today
all right well I'll let you back in all
right all right take care thanks for
joining us
okay let's introduce you to the people
who built insight Lockheed Martin space
outside of Denver these are the folks
who built Viking in 1976 and Mars
Phoenix in 2008
the operations team is there and
Lockheed inside EDL manager Tim Lynn is
standing by Tim what's going on in there
team's getting really excited we're just
about ready or what about a half an hour
from entry and the start of entry
descent landing so the team is really
excited focused but also very excited
about the upcoming successful entry
descent landing where we're getting
close to well we talked about the fact
that insight is based on tried-and-true
technology it's based on Phoenix but
you've had to make a couple of changes
for inside what were they yeah we've so
obviously as you said we leveraged
Phoenix a lot there was a lot of great
things that were able to take from the
Phoenix mission but insight is a unique
mission its landing towards the equator
of Mars and a number of things are
different the where we're landing we're
about one and a half kilometers higher
in altitude in addition and so what
that's required us to do is actually to
come in a little bit more shallow in
addition we're a little bit heavier than
than Phoenix was so we've had to
increase some of the strength of some of
the lander itself so the parachute we
have had to increase the strength we
actually deploy the parachute a little
bit higher because of some of the
differences in our entry time line and
because of when we're landing we're
landing them towards the end of dust
season so we also have actually
increased the thickness of the heat
shield so we're about a quarter inch
thick around our heat shield to
accommodate that that potential
sandblasting that we could see when we
actually do our entry descent landing so
a number of things we've changed but
we've obviously leveraged a lot from the
very successful Phoenix mission as well
that's fantastic so you were able to
kind of customize it because there were
some concerns earlier on that there was
a death storm taking place it was dust
storm season that's right in fact we've
had a lot of great support from our
orbiting assets MRO and Odyssey a couple
of spacecraft that we've partnered with
JPL and that were built here at Lockheed
Martin they've actually provided a lot
of great insight into
into the weather on Mars any dust storms
that are potentially happening on Mars
and as of today and have actually the
last couple of weeks it's been great on
the surface of Mars we're anticipating a
very nominal very seasonal weather in
terms of both density atmosphere as well
as temperature and dust storms appear to
be very benign sore very optimistic it's
gonna be a great day for landing on the
surface of Mars
all right that's great news thanks Tim
and I know your team is getting excited
over there just as much as we are
absolutely yeah thanks a lot
okay the time now is 11 21 it's about 20
minutes the tension is building in both
control rooms it's about 20 minutes
before crews stage separation it's not
too far off whose stage separation is
expected at about 40 minutes past the
hour so we are indeed getting close so
where is insite going to Mars it's a
place called Elysium panacea Benicia is
Latin for flat Elysium is ancient Greek
for afterlife paradise it's located near
the equator north of Gale Crater not too
far from Curiosity rover the team calls
it the biggest parking lot on Mars it's
a place that safe got plenty of sunshine
that will power solar instruments to
study the interior of Mars what's inside
Mars we know a lot about what's inside
earth but at Mars we've only just
scratched the surface to learn how Mars
formed we have to study its deep
interior NASA's insight Lander was
designed to do just that
by taking the planets vital signs
listening for its pulse or seismic
activity including any marsquakes
taking its temperature to see how much
heat is flowing out from deep inside and
checking its reflexes to see how much
the planet wobbles as it whips around
the Sun these all provide clues to what
the planet is really like inside so
what's inside Mars insight can help us
find out by giving Mars its first
thorough checkup since it formed four
and a half billion years ago the more we
learn the better we'll understand all
the rocky planets and the history of our
solar system joining us now is Bruce
Benner the principal investigator of
Mars insight insight is a mission to
Mars but we keep hearing again again
it's more than a mission to Mars
that's right Jay I mean we're going to
Mars obviously to study the Martian
interior and to map out the divisions
inside Mars but we want to use that
information to understand more about the
solar system as a whole and how rocky
planets formed and rocky planets we have
an image to show folks so we're talking
about Earth the moon Mars Venus yes the
the planets of the inner solar system
that are made mostly of rocks and they
all share the same basic structure with
a dense iron core a rocky mantle and
then a crust of lighter silicate rocks
but the very details of the thicknesses
of those layers the sizes and the the
compositions give us a lot of clues as
to how those planets form and why they
went down very different paths and into
the different planets we see today so
explain to me we are going to have a
lander you're going to be on the surface
how would you be able to study the
interior well we use where it called
geophysical instruments they use the
principles of physics to actually see
through the rocks I mean we're using
seismic waves the same way you might use
a flashbulb to take pictures of
something we're using Mars quakes which
send out vibrational waves through the
planet and as they go through the planet
they reflect off boundaries they get
bent they change their velocity and it
Changez The Wiggles that you see on a
seismogram when we go through the planet
you can see that here it hits the
various boundaries and those waves are
reflected sometimes they're bent it
becomes a pretty complicated pattern but
scientifically we've learned over the
the last hundred years how to interpret
the the code of the signals it comes
back up to the surface and the
seismogram the seismometers pick up that
signal and then turn it into data that
we can use on earth to understand you
know what the 3-d structure is of the
planet so normally you use three
seismometers in this case you're
bringing SycE that's one how are you
going to be able to get that information
using one well we had to get kind of
clever because on the earth you know
usually you have plenty of seismometers
you can use multiple seismometers to to
triangulate in on where the earthquake
is on mars we're gonna do something a
little bit different we're going to use
not only the the P and the S waves that
you may have heard about but we're using
the surface waves and here you can see
the surface waves kind of moving out
from Mars quake and as it passes over
the insight Lander you can see the
seismogram up there in the upper
left-hand corner where you have the the
Wiggles now those waves keep on going
around the planet and because Mars is
not so so large there still have a they
still have a fair amount of amplitude
they haven't gotten completely damped
out by the time it's gone all the way
around the planet passes over this the
the spacecraft again and finally even
the way that went but the other way
around the planet comes across and hits
us yet a third time and so we have extra
information over just the P and the S
wave we have the surface wave arrivals
that we can use to pinpoint the distance
from the Mars quake to our lander and
then we use something called
polarization analysis to figure out
which direction the waves are coming
from and by doing that we can do the
same thing that we can do with three
stations on the earth just using the P
and the S waves and very quickly there
is still another instrument built by DLR
that's also being carried up by inside
can you talk a little bit about that
yeah that's our heat flow probe and it's
a pretty cool instrument that uses a
Kanaka mole we call it to burrow its way
down into the surface it has a motor
with a that that winds up a hammer and
it knocks itself down just a few
millimeters at a time but we do that
twenty or thirty thousand hammer strokes
and it gets us down we hope to get down
to be about sixteen feet below the
surface and once we get down there we're
actually measuring the heat coming out
of the planet by measuring the
temperature along the cable as it comes
up to the surface and looking at how
that that heat that temperature
increases as we go down and extrapolate
that deep into the plant to understand
how much energy there is inside the
planet to drive the geology and the
drive vulcanism Mars quakes all kinds of
activity it's amazing how much you'll be
able to learn from the surface about the
interior that's right I think it's it is
amazing and it's been something that
I've been working on for my whole
professional career and it's just I I
find it fascinating but all right we'll
talk about that thanks very first first
thought of a mission like this as he
mentions 40 years ago when he was a
graduate student the rest the team
hasn't waited quite that long but this
is a big moment for them too recently we
sat down with a few of the members and
asked them what is it going to be like
as we get close to landing it's a very
difficult thing to do and everything has
to go perfectly as humans we've sent 17
different missions to the surface of
Mars and 10 of them have crashed before
we can land on Mars we have to get to
Mars how do we get to Mars the main
responsibility of the navigation team
used to ensure that the spacecraft is
delivered to the right point at the top
of the Martian atmosphere the target
location faced about 12 kilometers in
size our accuracy is comparable to
shooting a basketball from Staples
Center in downtown LA and hitting
nothing but net in a basketball hoop in
New York City that is moving at our
speed of about two feet per second and
it's spinning about its axis cuz landing
site you know we have an ellipse oh it's
pretty big it's about 60 miles long we
could land anywhere in that ellipse
there's a chance that we command right
on a rock
and we don't really have any control
over that so that's what makes me
nervous
we've tested the radar by flying it on a
helicopter we've tested pieces of the
heat shield by putting them in an arc
jet facility we've tested the parachute
by testing it in a wind tunnel and
putting all that together in a very
tightly controlled sequence where every
single thing has to go right we've never
tested that and the first time that's
gonna happen is wants you to live arrest
two motors it is about 11:20 9:00 a.m.
Pacific and you're watching live
coverage of the insight landing from
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena California we are about a half
hour away from landing and people all
over the world are watching take a look
at the map that we have for you we can
show you right now this is a watch
in-person map where people have watch
parties all over the world all over the
United States in Paris and Berlin even
off the coast of Madagascar and folks in
the Big Apple will also be watching
today the Nasdaq tower will switch over
to landing coverage for about an hour
that means people in Times Square can
watch too and later today NASA will have
the honor of ringing the closing bell
and that will be a little over an hour
from now and if you are watching take a
picture and send it to us using hashtag
Mars landing here is one I believe it is
from the California Science Center in
Los Angeles and I am told Mayor Eric
Garcetti will be visiting later today
things are getting more active for the
team now let's check back in with Julie
warts chin in the control room what's
going on Julie yeah so we've heard from
MRO a couple of times that's Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter they are doing
their slew they're ready to support us
they're doing great and we heard from
both marcos marco a and b that they're
out there there we've got telemetry lock
with them from the ground stations here
so they're doing great and everybody's
ready to go so we're pretty excited
fantastic we will check back in with
Julie in a moment meantime this is a
good time to tell you a little bit more
about that technology experiment we've
been talking about Marco as we mentioned
earlier insight does not have an orbiter
in position to send EDL data back live
so the cube sets hope to fill that gap
here's how the work communicating
between Mars and Earth requires a
complicated choreography with everything
in the right place at the right time
sometimes hours can pass before
information is relayed from one planet
to the other that's why when NASA's Mars
insight Lander launches this year the
rocket will carry two tiny satellites on
a technology test of their own meet Mars
cube one Marco NASA's first CubeSat
mission to deep space these briefcase
sized satellites will travel separately
from the insight Lander while they test
out new miniaturized technologies and if
they make it to Mars they could relay
information back to earth about insights
descent and touchdown and do it in mere
minutes although this fast communication
isn't crucial to the success of the
insight Lander this CubeSat test could
change the way future spacecraft phone
home alright let's check back with Julie
to see if the Marcos are indeed ready to
support and listen for insight Julie
what do you know so they are they are
ready to go I haven't heard about their
slew coming up yet but they are ready to
go we've heard from them they're both
healthy and they're both doing great
which is just wonderful news so I think
they should be doing a slew and justment
actually yeah I think they should be
doing a slew with just a minute well
stand by and listen then
all stations the systems we can't
confirm we are entry - 20 minutes
ETL nav - has been initiated the star
tracker has been powered off
the nav 2 software has been initially
initiated so when we're in cruise we use
a star tracker in a similar manner to
how sailors navigated years ago we look
at the Stars and get our relative
position from them we use a star tracker
for that and now that we're close enough
to Mars we don't need that anymore so
we're gonna transition to what's called
nav 2 software and that lets us
basically just use velocity and
acceleration from this point on so we
don't need the started slew to
appropriate attitude for bent pipe that
pipe mode will be entered shortly okay
thank you very much and that was
obviously our confirmation of the slew
for Marco so that's great news
and tastic so I was saying before
they'll be the NAB 2 software rule
propagate from here on out and we'll use
velocity and acceleration so we have
powered off our star tracker and we're
on our now 2 software and everything's
looking great
okay thanks thanks Julie thanks
all right the cruise stage separation is
just about four minutes away and Rob
Manning joins us now Rob is the chief
engineer here at JPL and an absolute
veteran of Mars landings we're going to
play a little video for you right now
you haven't seen it yet but we'll roll
it there you are you're the phase lead
you're sitting up front
yeah that's why it looked like it and
it's successful yes I hate to see
whatever good like if I wasn't
successful but talk about that
what is EDL like why is it so hard
well it's many years of work by many
many people who struggle to put all the
pieces together and particularly because
we can't really test
Antron descent and landing on this
planet it's much more complicated Mars
has a lower atmosphere thicket thinner
atmosphere less e gravity Marco you just
can't put the pieces so it's imagine you
had a big Broadway production mark would
be really one little show until all the
audience shows up so that's what it
feels like so it's so you never really
know if you've really done it right well
we've done it seven times can we say
that a piece of cake we know what we're
doing no I don't think so I mean yeah we
get better at it and there's no doubt
we've learned we've learned for both the
successes and our own failures including
failures of other missions outside of
this country so those pieces come
together in our minds I we try to put
what we learn together and and just do
the best we can and if we don't succeed
we will learn because we are collecting
data on the way down if we if something
bad happens today we will be able to
take what we learned even though we may
fall on the ground
after we get kicked off the horse we'll
get back up brush ourselves off figure
what we did wrong and get back on the
horse well there's a lot of uncertainty
just very quickly give us some possible
scenarios of what could happen during
EDL today especially during
communications well the the the great
news about having communications there's
almost almost anything that go wrong we
there's a very good chance we'll figure
it out but things like you know the
parachute has to go right we know you
don't open parachutes on earth and going
Mach one and a half one and a half times
the speed of sound you just don't do
that you don't need to in this planet
but we have to because if we waited any
longer we'd be on the ground very
complicated radar system has to work
outer space all the way to the ground
and look for look for the ground what if
it locked up on the heat shield well
we've tried to avoid that problem we
fixed that problem we think it to
prevent that from happening but what if
we got it wrong things like that could
could happen and our vehicle could have
things bad happen but we worked hard
this time we separate
in systems video , the hex court at this
time MRO has full have bloated their
electro sequences Marco is expecting
carry lock at any time Marco B is
reported there in bent pipe still
waiting on a copy that thank you
for your science report UHF carrier
detected ETL con marco clubs in fight
mode
Marco Bravo has locks on the carrier
Marco Alfa has also locked on carrier
system based on inside cord
as expected the DSN has el oso inside
expand copy that thank you
all station insight systems on inside
court DSN is lost the x-band signal from
insight indicated expected crew stage
separation standing by for UHF signal
acquisition via Marko or radio science
we are about five minutes from entry and
have confirmation we've lost the x-band
signal from insights this was expected
because we have transitioned from the
antenna on the cruise stage to the UHF
antenna onboard the spacecraft ground
stations have detected the UHF signal
and Marko has lost on the signal this
confirms that insight is transmitting
UHF signals as expected in sight
telemetry through the Marko relay is not
expected until about two minutes before
entry the vehicle has also performed the
turn to entry maneuver the vehicle is
turning away from a Sun pointing
attitude and oriented itself to enter
the Martian atmosphere this is a big
first step getting just getting the the
cruise stage separated it's now after
the vehicle turns itself to the right
orientation the cruise stage is now
going to be get further and further away
until it's about three or four football
fields away and will burn up in parallel
as the vehicle enters Mars and Christine
mentioned turn to entry what does that
mean it was because the cruise stage has
to be pushed off to one side like this
the rest of the vehicle has to turn to
face the atmosphere and to be dead nuts
on as it hits hits the the top of the
atmosphere so this is taking all the
heat coming into the atmosphere exactly
it'll be both provided source for drag
but also thermal protection because it
gets over 1500 degrees Celsius on the
top of this heat shield very very hot
but on the inside a heat shield is maybe
only a fraction of a few degrees above
room temperature so it's a wonderful
protective device to keep our
you're safe all right so the next thing
we're standing by for is is entering
through the gun at the top of the
atmosphere gradually slowing down right
now the vehicles just now beginning to
look very soon will be beginning to feel
the atmosphere touching it actually
entry is above the atmosphere slightly
so it's really not until a few half a
minute or so before after entry before
we start really detecting the fact that
that atmosphere is slowing us down all
right we'll be standing by yes exciting
entry is scheduled for 1147 the cruise
dates SEP and the entry times are locked
in correct they are they're locked in
when we selected the target and aim the
vehicle very precisely that allows to
know exactly when we hit the entry point
which is 35 55 kilometers from the
center of Mars so we know those times
are locked in but what about all the
other events that take place
regi science reports dropping carrier
power effect Marconi and Marco B ham
telemetry just heard both Marcos have
telemetry they are doing their job these
small CubeSat sir relaying ones and
zeros with a few seconds lag from from
the vehicle up to the up to these two
vehicles and they reach forward them
back to earth to the Deep Space Network
using x-band antenna and keep in mind
this was all in an experiment we weren't
sure that this was going to work but we
had this need that we didn't have live
communication in this particular mission
well we don't really need communications
we don't need their information except
if something went wrong we would very
much like to get the data right now we
have others telemetry via the Marco
relay
watch the data flowing under their
screens as if they're commuting directly
data will provide detailed information
about the state of the spacecraft
throughout ETL we were on pins and
needles waiting for that because we
weren't really sure this is wonderful
news this this will allow us to give
some just continues working all the way
to the ground and beyond
we might even see a first picture from
the surface of Mars
very soon atmospheric entry on my mark
three two one mark
so in a few seconds the vehicle will
start sensing the atmosphere
I said thirty five twenty two kilometers
from the center of Mars and it's going
to start to slow down very very slowly
at first but then faster and faster and
faster till to it to reach us about
seven G's I made that mistake in the
video it's actually seven G's not twelve
and so it will but will still very very
quickly slow down and from fifteen in
approximately one minute inside is
expected to reach its maximum heating
rate plasma blackout is possible during
peak heating and could cause a temporary
drop out of telemetry this could last
for as long as two minutes yeah the gas
that comes off the heat shield as it's
slowing down it looks like a meteor if
you're on Mars watching this streak go
by that brightness of gas does interfere
with the radio reception and so it's
possible that Marco will lose that
signal while it's going through this
very hot entry but not to be alarmed not
to be alarmed it's it's part of the
design we expected radio science reports
plasma blackouts as expected okay Wow
Brown stations have reported plasma
blackout still receiving insight
telemetry via Marco Marco alpha has
carrier interruption in sight should now
be experiencing the peak heating rates
portions of the heat shield may reach
nearly 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit as it
protects the lander from the heating
environment that's hot Michael promises
carrier interruption but still in luck
inside has passed through peak
deceleration telemetry shows the
spacecraft saw about 8g echo alpha and
Marco Bravo a rock radio science reports
carrier detected communications coming
in inside is now traveling at a velocity
of 2,000 meters per second it seems to
pass this very critical point of peak
heating and peak deceleration the next
big step is parachute inflation the next
event is parachute deploy inside is now
traveling at 1,000 meters per second
once insight slows to about 400 meters
per second it will deploy its 12 meter
diameter supersonic parachute the
parachute will deploy nominally at about
Mach 1.7
standing by for parachute deploy
radio science reports sudden changing
Doppler ground stations are observing
signals consistent with parachute deploy
Marco Alfa Marco Bravo maintain lock
status telemetry shows parachute
deployment radar power Don ciccio's
separation commanded
this is really good news so far into
needles we have radar activation where
the radar is beginning to search for the
ground once the radar locks on the
ground and inside is about one kilometer
above the surface if the lander will
separate from the back shell and begin
terminal descent using its 12 descent
engines
altitude convergence the radar has
locked on the ground yes standing by for
Lander separation terrier interruption
on Marco Alfa and Marco Bravo Lander

standing by for touchdown
touchdown confirmed
[Laughter]
this never gets old just erupted great
Jim Preiser
the key design is locking sandy gravity
this is really fabulous
thank you something going on in there
what oh really we've cut over to the
camera over in Times Square
boy people are weathering the rain to
see this
this thing has a lot more to do though
it's a lot more to go on both today and
in the days that follow before the
science can begin but you know just
getting vehicle on from earth to the
surface of Mars is no mean feat I mean
just the mere accomplishment here that
we're seeing it's you have to understand
that this this this this vehicle is very
very complicated it uses 12 engines each
of those engines are pulsed ten times a
second producing these little tiny
impulses almost like little bullets that
keep the vehicle going out a constant
velocity as like approaches the ground
and still going over five miles an hour
so those legs feel a fair amount of
crush we still don't know the state of
the vehicle right now we need to look to
make sure there are no rocks nearby the
solar panels have to art well being just
in just a few in about five to ten
minutes we'll begin to open up they have
waiting for the dust to settle because
the dust was certainly a lot of dust
being lifted in the air around the
vehicle right now which is now just
settling so we're standing by after
touchdown it waits a couple of minutes
to give us an x-band beep and so we are
standing by for that it's a
communication that comes directly to
earth from insight yes and and it goes
to the Deep Space Network there's also
something that might be happening now if
we're very lucky in sight might be able
to relay an image or a parcel image
taken just a few a couple of minutes
after landing so I'm
standing by hoping to see that but if
that doesn't happen we'll certainly get
more images later in our Odyssey pass
you know about five hours we see Bruce
Banner waiting for it there I don't know
if they see it you're waiting that's
that's Justin Maki Bruce Banner looking
carefully the cameras to see what they
might see you're waiting for the image
to come back so this is the first image
from insight itself inside is taking a
picture with one of us two cameras
probably a view of what's directly in
front of the spacecraft right from the
lander this is a camera that it would be
using to figure out is this a good space
a good place to put down our instruments
so it is going to take an image and send
that image to the Marcos the Marcos in
turn will relay it back down to earth
that's correct I don't see a lot of
image has a dust cover on top we have
lost the signal for Marco you can see
potentially a lot of so we don't know oh
there it is you can see a better view
you'd see that really is debris near
it's the horizon back there de Loup of
blueish sky that's part of the lander
deck on the front left I can't take out
but it looks like there's not a lot of
rocks in the field of view but those
dots you see there are very likely to be
dust particles on the on the lens the
dust cover which will be removed yes yes
in a better clear view after that dust
cutter can move so it incites you know
I'm sorry a cube SATs relay
communications job is done
they're now flying on they're now taking
pictures back toward Mars
hopefully MRO which flew overhead might
have been lucky enough to capture the
descent of this insight Lander on its
under its parachute while was well well
though this is going on tomorrow is
flying overhead recording the data like
also monitoring the track transactions
and recording every bit of signal look
good and but it also had the ability to
take a picture and maybe look like we
did with with you know both Phoenix and
later for Curiosity rover we might be
able to see the parachute
that would be fantastic we are standing
by now for that expand beat yes in sight
phoning home saying I'm here and I'm
okay
system based on inside court the DSN and
expand radio science reports x-ray and
carrier detected copy that Thank You
flawless flawless this was perfect case
scenario this is this is what we really
hoped and imagined in her mind's eye
though we spend most of our looking
visualizing all these bad things can
happen sometimes things work out in your
favor and will look very carefully at
the data see what might have what how
well it went it but it certainly looked
like it was a very successful and
perfect landing
we'll have to see as we get more data
how well he's going right and and and as
the as the vehicle proceeds the solar
panels will be deployed hopefully
there's no we're not on a tilt it
doesn't look like we are but from the
image but the solar panels will be
deployed safely we hope and we'll get
confirmation of that around five o'clock
local time here in about four hour four
and a half hours five hours from now
this is such a difficult feat in that
because of the one-way life time there
is no way that any of these engineers
could possibly control the vehicle it
all has to be done in commands and
software we have to train it to do this
work on its own so the vehicle is
completely nominal reported nominal it
is it's happy the lander is not
complaining
we have we had a way to tell us if it
was unhappy and it wasn't it's not
unhappy it's quite it's it's it's in a
normal mode and so it's gonna chug along
for the rest of the rest of the
afternoon
and finish the activities all right well
Rob I know you're anxious to get in and
congratulate the group thank you so much
for sitting here and helping us out
explain UDL all right well I'll let you
go and go congratulate your friends all
right take care
on inside out of the loop recording
completed at 24 for 34
all right as we had promised we said
we'd bring back the administrator to get
your take on what was it like to be in
that control room Jim what was it like
well I'll tell you it was it was intense
and and you could feel the emotion it
was very very quiet when it was time to
be quiet and of course very celebratory
with every little new piece of
information that was received it's very
different being here than watching it on
TV by far I can tell you that for sure
now that I've experienced both and then
of course you know what's what's amazing
is as soon as it was over I got a call
on my cell phone and it was the phone
number was all zeros and whenever I get
a phone call that's all zeros it's got
to be somebody important I answered it
and it was the vice president he watched
the whole thing
he is absolutely ecstatic about our
program as you're aware he's the
chairman of the national space Council
and he's been of course a keen advocate
for what we do and to have him call
within seconds of mission success is
tremendous and just so everybody knows
he wants me to say congratulations to
everybody here at NASA and all of our
international partners and everybody who
has contributed to this mission
what an amazing day for NASA it is an
amazing accomplishment in that this is
something that is happening millions and
millions and millions of miles away and
these people are able to do it
incredible and what's fascinating is the
whole time I'm watching it I'm thinking
every milestone is something that
happened eight minutes ago because
that's the time like to get a signal
from Mars to earth and so it's it's kind
of you know it's it's it's exciting but
then you have to step back and realize
that this has already occurred in
history so it is it's a unique
experience incredible and just the
enthusiasm here is incredible so what's
for the future
looking ahead 2020 well let's get
through December so for the rest of this
we think about what's happening next
December third we're launching American
out
American astronaut to the International
Space Station so that's gonna be a big
achievement and it's going to be on a
Russian Soyuz rocket that the last time
we launched a human was not successful
it was scary but we figured out what the
problem is we're moving forward and now
we've got that underway December 3rd
going forward from there we're gonna get
the first science data back from the
Parker Solar Probe on December 7th so
that's not too far away either
and then we've got osiris-rex that will
be in orbit around Venu shortly after
Christmas so no shortage of exciting
things and then on January 1st we're
gonna fly the New Horizons mission which
for people who are not aware that's the
mission that went to Pluto back in 2014
gave us stunning images and data and
information science on on Pluto and now
that mission is still going strong it's
it's in the what we call the Kuiper belt
now which is an asteroid belt well
beyond Pluto and it's going to be taking
images of Ultima Thule which is an
object in the Kuiper belt Kuiper belt
which we we have never been able to go
out there and take images of anything at
close range before and now we're doing
so you ask what's happening next I guess
we we have right now at NASA there is
more underway probably than I don't know
how many how many years past but it's
like you know there's a drought and then
all of a sudden there's all these
activities all at once so we're busy
we're gonna be working through the
holiday but a lot of amazing discoveries
to be made and we're looking forward to
it so funny because our ask NASA
question you basically answered is does
the success of NASA insight influence
the timeline for future manned lunar or
Mars missions
well certainly everything we learn about
Mars at this point is going to help us
understand how to do in situ resource
utilization so insight could actually
provide some really good information
about whether or not there's liquid
water on Mars and maybe even where it is
and how to get to it we strongly believe
that there's liquid water you know 10
kilometers under the surface of Mars so
the the key is the answer is yes the
more we learn the more we're able to
achieve
and so to get to Mars yes but the lunar
missions the the you know the
president's first space policy directive
is to go to the moon to go sustainably
with international and commercial
partners so when we say sustainably that
means we're gonna have reusability built
into the system and we're gonna we're
gonna test and prove technologies at the
moon that ultimately
we can replicate at Mars so we're gonna
retire risk prove human physiology at
the moon which is only a three-day
journey which means you know if
something goes wrong you can get home
safely we saw that with Apollo 13 but we
need we need to use the the moon as a
proving ground to accelerate our path to
Mars in the meantime we're doing
missions like insight to learn as much
about Mars as possible insight is going
to help us understand really asteroid
impacts as well you know cuz it's it's
got a seismometer well it's just gonna
help us know how often is Mars getting
impact with asteroids and if we're gonna
send humans there it'd be important to
know if those humans are gonna
experience asteroid impacts so and
that's pretty much our goal is always
learning from our missions and build
upon those mission one after another
nASA has a long history of doing just
amazing work in building on its past
successes and in fact its past failures
so I'll tell you what an amazing time to
be at the helm of this extraordinary
agency we are so glad that you are here
to share with us well thanks for joining
a true pleasure thank you and I'm sure
you need to go in there and celebrate
with those folks but thank you for
stepping out for absolutely all right
take care now Mars exploration is cool
stuff but if you're not convinced just
yet just talk to the insight scientists
and engineers
no one conveys the excitement more than
the people who actually work on the
mission so earlier this year the
outreach team filled up a van and went
to 15 California cities they called it
the insight roadshow
so we're here in San Francisco at the
Exploratorium and this is part of
insights roadshow since it's the first
interplanetary mission we've ever
launched from California we're actually
doing a lot of public engagement
activities along California and we're
just talking to the public and talking
to them about insight and getting them
excited and sort of sharing information
that they probably wouldn't get just
from a website we have Mars clubs and
touchable kids we have replicas the
actual launch vehicle that's gonna be
taking the insight to Mars we have a
selfie station with fun props people can
take pictures children really really
like Mars you have a dump station where
we invite kids to come in
yeah jump we have a little seismometer
on the floor which measures ground
motion so if students can come and jump
next to it they can actually see they're
recording on the screen and they make
their own quake I've had people come to
me and say this is the most I've ever
understood about a space mission I'm so
happy I came because now I understand
what you're doing I understand why it's
important and I'm really excited you
kind of imagine how it looks but seeing
it in person actually puts it in
perspective she was able to explain in
love what happens the cameras what goes
into the ground it's a great exhibit you
know but for myself and also for kids
that want to learn about Mars
okay we want you to meet another Mars
veteran here at JPL our director Mike
Watkins you were a mission manager for
curiosity absolutely I think this is the
fifth Mars mission I've worked on Mars
Lander so maybe we're getting the hang
of it finally ever get better I mean
does it get old it's always the same it
doesn't I mean I think we're just as
nervous every time you know the whole
landing sequence and it's just such a
crazy time and and you know we can't do
anything it's this feeling of
helplessness right because the
spacecraft's on its own and everything
we you know we could do we did a day ago
and so I think you just always have that
nervousness but you know we have
confidence in the team we have
confidence in the engineers and
scientists that they did everything that
they could do and and you have to put it
in their hands and it's our eighth
successful landing so we learn from this
we learn a little more we do it better
the next time
pretty much absolutely and you know we
had we have had one failure we've
learned from the failures too so in fact
it when we learned from all the failures
from all the missions even if they're
not JPL missions or NASA missions each
one of them tells you a little something
an extra test you should do an extra
thing you should guard against you know
when the Mars atmosphere or on touchdown
and so we've learned from all of these
and luckily we've been we've recently
been very successful and we're always
trying something new we're always trying
to learn something new we had a
situation this time Odyssey
couldn't be in place to give us vent
pipe communications and so Marko came
about the Marco is just an incredible
success story you know exactly as you
said we couldn't have Mars Odyssey do
the real-time bent pipe for the EDL
events we would had to wait a couple
hours and and and have the replay from
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter so we
embarked on this kind of crazy idea to
build these two little cube sets and you
know cube sets are something that high
school kids can build these days but
they go up and they go around the earth
they go around the earth these are the
first interplanetary cube SATs first
time we've ever seen cube sets outside
the Earth's orbit and their sole purpose
was to do the relay so they have this
very cool expand planar flat antenna
there and they relayed the the UHF
signals in real time for us and it was
just amazing it's built by a lot of
early career folks here at JPL with a
little bit of adult supervision but know
the engineers
did a fantastic job and Marco had
exceeded all of our wildest expectations
they worked perfectly we built two
because we thought maybe one will get
there they both got there they both
worked it's just a great tribute to the
whole the Marco team you saw them in
there they had their special black
shirts just a fantastic thing and not
only did it work for this mission but I
think it opens up the door for more
small missions like that we could
actually put cameras on them and put
other instruments on them they're much
less expensive so there's I think a
whole new whole new door we just opened
the door to a new class of planetary
science thanks to the Marco's and so I
just made with off-the-shelf parts
so yeah you know some combination of
off-the-shelf parts and some new stuff
that we did we had to build a special
radio of course because has to talk to
the Deep Space Network the antennas are
a little bit new technology but a lot of
the stuff is pretty pretty standard
stuff that that you could replicate at
much lower cost in terms of the future
that other missions will be carrying
their own relays and not having to
depend on a bent pipe from a they might
carry relays they might actually carry
scientific instrumentation you know they
can do more than just do relay they can
actually take pictures you know they
could they could do spectrometry they
can do lots of other stuff that we that
we would like to do with orbiters and so
there's a chance we could send them to
Venus we could send them to asteroids we
could send them to Mars I mean there's
lots of stuff we can do and I think
we're just learning the capability of
what we can miniaturize and what we can
put on these cube sets but this is a
great you know a great first first
effort well we have one question for you
it's a social media question from George
K aged 9 from the UK how long did it
take to plan and build this mission
insight well that's a great question so
I have two answers that inside itself
typically our missions take from the
time we start the mission to the time we
launch it it's about four to five years
in the case of insight to two things
happen one to our advantage and one not
to our advantage the first is we had a
lot of heritage from a mission called
the Phoenix so a lot of the design work
had already been done because it was
done for this mission Phoenix even
before that for Mars Polar Lander so a
lot of the basic design we kind of
inherited for this mission on the other
hand we had a little bit of bad luck in
that the end
the seismometer is so unbelievably
precise is so incredibly accurate and
hard to build that we couldn't quite get
it ready so we're doing that in
partnership with the French and a lot of
other countries in Europe including the
UK and Switzerland and and and and other
folks we couldn't quite get that ready
to go for launch
so we had to actually wait two years and
took an extra two years then because of
that so Mars and the earth are only
lined up to launch about every 26 months
so we had to wait another 26 months so
that took us a little bit longer well
speaking of the internationals that's a
perfect segue for where we're going next
throughout this program we've been
trying to introduce you to the people
behind the scenes and for the insight
mission it requires that we go beyond
our borders this is truly an
international mission let me introduce
you to Dominical gr Dini a Swiss Italian
scientists who studies earthquakes and
marsquakes some of us have been in this
mission for 20 years it's a lifetime
project and the many cultures beaming
I'm an Italian living in Switzerland I
work on earthquakes and therefore I
would work on aspects I am a professor
in university seismic risk a seismic
hazard of my main field of applications
inside is a mission which is geared to
measure the physical parameters that
help us to characterize in theory there
are two main reason why it's important
to do by International Cooperation there
is a big motivation coming from all the
different parts to complete it and the
community grows much faster than the
knowledge grows much faster
the Swiss role in this mission to
deliver the electronics for the
seismometer and we will provide daily
routine analysis and check if there are
seismic events or maturity impact in the
planet itself this is what our students
do work out how the planet developed and
what is the future and that is a direct
relevance of how we understand about the
earth it's so interesting and that
partnership goes far beyond individual
scientists take a look at this it is a
picture of the calibration tool on the
deck of the insight Lander
it's what the team uses to calibrate the
cameras on Mars and notice
the flags and logos it's recognition of
our international partnerships with the
French German a French government Space
Agency connects and also the German
Aerospace Center DLR and it is my
pleasure to welcome sice project manager
for Leela day from kanessa an executive
board member Hans your detox from DLR so
I I can't imagine a better day I am very
enthusiastic I'm very grateful for all
the people of the mission and also my
foot my foot are going to the team the
testament of the science team to Bruce
Banner Philip you on your knee now we
have mayor Williams picture of the
ground and now the work to deploy so
seismometer is beginning so a new
adventure in the best conditions thank
you for that definitely a new adventure
hunter work what's your feeling the HP
cubed is on that deck it will be ready
to go let's know it's not a job now but
first of all I'd like to congratulate
our partners here in the US and it was a
great day and a great job they did it's
not easy to land on Morris that's what
we know and it's between for me as well
because the first time that we land on
Mars with an instrument at least at
least as I has experiences and so it's
it's a great day and it was really
exciting so far now the job starts for
us what's funny the leap you had once
said you're a musician as well
you're he plays jazz you see exploration
and music very similar because the human
management of all that activity is
exactly the same the technique it's
different you have a seismometer on you
have an orchestra but the world thing to
find the best talents on things like
that are exactly the same amount to
deliver on time to be ready on to all
the best performances everything is
similar
and we should let people know that we
won't be able to be collecting science
right away is that correct yes we will
be collecting science what several
months from now we are beginning the
deployment is going to take about two or
three months of course we will have some
data during the deployments but the best
data to make the best science will be
about the beginning of March no it's
it's it's the time yeah but it was a
great job so far so from our team and
our teams all the teams and as you said
it needs a lot of people to bring it up
to to Mars and make it successful
mission well I have to say
congratulations thank you thanks for
joining us
well here's another profile now meet
Ravi Prakash it's his job to keep
insight healthy on Mars we could to
explore the universe and see things that
no one has ever seen before my name is
Ravi Prakash and my job is to keep
insight healthy when it's on Mars
insight is the first spacecraft that's
going to go to Mars and try to
understand how rocky planets have formed
a screenhouse column living a healthy
insight spacecraft is healthy batteries
we have heaters all over our spacecraft
that keep our spacecraft warm enough so
that it operates the way it should we
look at these things as well as many
other parts of our spacecraft on a daily
basis to make sure we have a successful
mission there are thousands of people
working on insight so the systems
engineers responsible for understanding
how changing one part of the spacecraft
ripples through the entire system and
how that affects all the other parts of
the spacecraft
I actually worked at JPL for eight years
and then left for about three years to
look for a non-profit where I've used my
engineering design skills that I learned
at NASA to help people in poverty I
realized that the stuff we do here
impacts billions of people around the
world every single person whether they
realize or not has been impacted by NASA
technology we are the next generation of
explorers all right let's meet Ravi
Prakash in person Ravi is in our sandbox
at the JPL in-situ instrumental
laboratory and wait a minute where did
that beard come from Highgate yeah you
know they were there about 10 of us that
decided on the day we launched to Mars
that we were going to show
and not shape again for seven months
until we landed on Mars so I am extra
excited that we landed not only because
we have a mission on the surface of Mars
but I have two little girls at home that
love to pull my beard and so I can
finally put them into that
alright so probably help us out what
happens next now clearly in sight is not
out of the woods just yet
correct you're right so we have some
very important steps ahead of us the
first is that we have to deploy our
solar arrays this is what the spacecraft
is doing right now it's deploying these
two solar arrays so that we get energy
from the Sun this is one of the most
important things that we have to do
right now after that we're gonna do a
series of checkouts on our spacecraft to
make sure that everything survived this
harrowing entry descent and landing onto
Mars and then once that's complete after
the next few days will start hard to
play our instruments onto the surface of
Mars so what exactly is involved with
the instrument deployment so this is the
first time we're using a robotic arm to
put instruments on the surface of Mars
this is a process that will put our
seismometer on mars as well as the heat
flow probe and it ends up taking about
three months which sounds like a really
long time but this is because you know
we have to be very careful and make sure
everything happens just the way it needs
to unlike earth we can't send a
technician if something goes wrong and
so we just want to get it right the
first time all right and we in our
interview just heard that we may be
looking at not until March before we get
science that's right we get some amount
of science immediately as far as the
environment of Mars and get wind data
temperature data like magnetometer data
but then once we start getting seismic
data that will be in the March timeframe
all right and can you explain to me Ravi
the Issel the the test fit that you're
at what do you do there so this is a
Martian sandbox for the past two years
we've had a great team that's been
testing deploying our instruments on a
variety of different slopes and rocks
now that we actually are on Mars we're
gonna transform this area to look
exactly like the place we landed and
test out deploying our instruments one
more time before we do it on the real
thing all right thanks Ravi
congratulations thanks so much
now that insight is on Mars it needs
some changes inside is no longer
cruising to Mars so the team
longer needs the crews mission support
area in a little while the team will
hand over operations to a new group
sitting in another JPL control room this
is the surface mission support area it's
in another building here at JPL this is
where the team will be operating insight
from here on so the handover is the
final step and that will take place at
about one o'clock hour time that's about
a half hour away for us it's time to say
goodbye our congratulations to the
inside team and special thanks to our
ETL system engineers Christine Saleh and
Julie Ward's Chen standby for a news
briefing on NASA TV at 2:00 p.m. Pacific
5:00 p.m. Eastern and for those of you

social media it was wonderful to share
this historic event with you we have
some pictures for you that will leave
you with enjoy and congratulations in
sight
