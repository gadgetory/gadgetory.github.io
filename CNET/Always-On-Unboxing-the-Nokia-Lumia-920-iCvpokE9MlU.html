Nokia Lumia 920 previously the flagship
Windows Phone until the HTC 8x came out
but this guy is still from what I hear a
very good phone and a good value at 99
bucks with contracts we actually had to
have Microsoft FedEx s1 so we don't have
like a box but so there's some kind of
box in here I've been looking forward to
this phone actually I wonder what color
we got I'm not gonna cheat we're just
gonna open it and see oh we got black
wah wah um you guys this is a giant
brick of a phone it is so heavy I cannot
believe it Wow alright before we end
look texting and driving it can wait
I'm all over this campaign of 18 T's
let's see what else we have in the box
we have oh look I like this they're
actually telling me that it's the sim
door key with a little sign and it's
Nokia branded see what else we have down
here
oh it looks like we have our own NFC tag
also nice with a little explainer about
what NFC is they're trying to make this
beginner friendly which i think is
actually quite smart we have a pretty
good how-to on programming your own NFC
tags from always-on with sharing back
then you want to check that out we have
our product and safety information here
our power brick which is actually kind
of big well they're not that surprising
since the phone itself is kind of big
very short little charging cable and
that will do it for the box let's have a
look at this phone now I've heard that
this phone is pretty big but dudes it's
so fat and beefy and once again
continuing our beginner friendly theme
we've got stickers all over the back
telling us what the various ports are
and the various buttons I could say I am
kind of loving this I was loving it
until I thought it was like a real
sticker
got the camera front and center it's a
pretty highly touted camera eight point
seven megapixels with a Carl Zeiss lens
and I kind of like the orientation of
the camera right here it says you can
get right to taking pictures I'm gonna
turn it on and go through some setup
here while we wait for it to come on
let's do some specs the Nokia Lumia 920
has a 4.5 inch LCD display with a 1280
by 768 pixel resolution that is full HD
I don't usually talk about the size and
weight of a phone but in this case I
think it's relevant to know that it
weighs six point five ounces it's a
little bit of a brick it's powered by a
1.5 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
dual-core processor with just one gig of
onboard ram so it'll be fast but not
blazing fast the screen is covered in
Gorilla Glass that the company says is
scratch resistant it does support 4G LTE
and of course it runs Windows Phone OS 8
the camera is eight point seven
megapixels it has a Carl Zeiss lens and
a flash and it can record 1080p video
it's an impressive camera although some
of our reviewers found that the photos
aren't as good as you might expect
there's a 1 megapixel front facing
camera which I find a little
disappointing in terms of connectors you
have micro USB for charging and data and
a three-and-a-half millimeter Universal
audio connector there's also micro USB
2.0 onboard unfortunately no HDMI
support the battery is a somewhat wimpy
two thousand milliamp now Nokia says
that will give you nine hours of talk
time but our testing has found quite a
bit less than that you don't have to
live in the cloud with this phone there
are 32 gigs of on-board storage and it
starts at just $99 with a new contract
and is only for 49 unlocked the Nokia
Lumia 920 is a pretty serious phone it
is big it is beefy it's got the specs to
back it up though and at $99 I actually
think this is a great way to get into
the Windows Mobile operating system it's
pretty fun to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
