and we're taking a look at the pioneer
SP SB 23w this is the highly anticipated
sound bar from pioneers line of andrew
jones design budget speakers and the
whole system is selling for $400 a
pioneer doesn't look like your typical
plasticky sound bar it sports a
composite wood cabinet that's better for
sound quality but does add bulk to the
system it stands at about 4 inches high
and if you're placing it on your TV
cabinet it might end up blocking your
TV's remote sensor the styling is a
little boring with a black vinyl finish
but it looks good enough sitting under
your TV the included subwoofer is
Wireless and it's tiny it's actually
probably one of the smallest subwoofers
I've seen with a cell bar system that
makes it easy to hide in your living
room although it does sound best within
a few feet of the sound bar the included
remote isn't great with a wafer-thin
design that's hard to navigate by feel
luckily you can program the sound bar to
respond to commands from your TV or
cable box remote or even better you can
use a universal remote around back
you'll find a bare minimum selection of
ports an analog input and an optical
input that might not seem like much but
it's plenty if you use your TV as a
switcher by connecting all your devices
directly to your TV and then connecting
your TV's audio output to the sound bar
there's also built-in bluetooth with
support for the better sounding app X
codec and that will let you wirelessly
stream audio from just about every
mobile device but the real reason to get
excited about this product is its sound
quality the Pioneer sounds better than
just about any sound bar we've heard and
certainly better than any sound bar at
this price the little sub delivers a
surprising amount of low-end and it
blends particularly well with the sound
bar that blender really contributes to
the overall natural sound so while other
systems may try and value with excessive
bass or virtual surround effects the
Pioneer simply strives to sound more
like a set of good balanced speakers
that's why it's one of the few sound
bars that actually sounds good with
music as well as movies and most sound
bars can't handle music that well
we compared it directly to two excellent
sound bars the JBL SB 400 and the sony
HTC t2 60 and the Pioneer clearly
sounded best with a wide range of
content although the JBL can sound a
little bit more powerful on movies but
the bottom line is that you're not going
to get a better sounding home audio
system without spending more than this
and even if you do spend more the
pioneers still sounds better than a lot
of the pricier sound bars that are on
the market so while there are some
nagging design issues they're relatively
minor and worth putting up with if you
care about sound which is why the
pioneer SP SB 23w earns the Editors
Choice Award in the sound bar category
I'm Matthew moscovia and this is the
pioneer SP SP 23w</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
