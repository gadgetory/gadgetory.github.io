two big outputs of any engine are
horsepower and torque you know all about
the first one you've heard about it
since you were a little kid it's in
every automotive advertisement
everything the automaker has ever talked
about has horsepower in there somewhere
but torque as far less well understood
though extremely important let's break
them down and define them first
horsepower is a measure of work its
definition makes that obvious one
horsepower is equal to 33 thousand
foot-pounds per minute now torque is
also a measure of work but it describes
work as twisting force it's kind of like
horsepower in a circle and without the
per minute factor torque is measured in
foot-pounds not a certain number of them
though for example it may take 27
foot-pounds of torque to loosen a
particular bolt on this engine without
regard for how long you have to apply
that force so at the risk of
oversimplifying horsepower expresses how
much work you can get done in a certain
amount of time torque is about how hard
you can twist something and that's key
because how does a car move itself the
engine turns it twists the gears in the
transmission they twist output or drive
shafts and that moves the car torque
really should be the star
okay seriously let me show you on some
charts how horsepower and torque work I
promise you won't fall asleep now these
are charts from cars have been put on
dynamometer is basically treadmills for
cars you've seen these our partners over
at Edmunds do a lot of kind of testing
and gave us this data and it's very
instructive here's a 2011 Ford Mustang
here's how the chart works on the Left
you've got your vertical axis of either
foot-pounds of torque or amount of
horsepower down across the right is
basically your tachometer its rpms from
1 to 8,000 in this case now look what
happens the torque line is this light
blue one you start building around 2,000
rpm and you got more and more torque as
you increase the revs you peak right
around here at about Oh 4200 with 365
foot-pounds all that engine has and you
stay at about that range until around
5200 rpm this is the sweet spot this is
where you've got peak torque that just
keeps coming after a while more rpms the
torque begins to drop horsepower keeps
increasing let's look at another car
here's a very different engine in a
McLaren mp4-12c supercar here's our
torque line again builds gradually and
then notice that about 4200 all the way
out to about 6200 this guy stays flat
and right about at the peak amount of
torque around 415 foot pounds this is a
wider what they call fatter torque band
you've got more rpms where you have full
torque from the engine mercedes-benz s63
instructive because this is a twin-turbo
v8 look what happens with turbos this is
the torque line it's out of hand it
Peaks really fast and it stays broad
chunky and 611 foot-pounds of torque
that's a lot by the way for a very long
time before it begins to degrade
and finally a very different car a Scion
fr-s Peaks here early at only 143
foot-pounds of torque but then look what
happens you get this dip here if you
ever hear me driving a car and say I
feel like there's a flat spot in the
torque curve that's what I'm talking
about it's not flat at all it's actually
a dip where the car feels kind of
gutless and then up around 4800 rpm it
kicks back in again and stays nice and
flat all the way out to the mid 6,000
now you may have noticed in all these
charts torque tends to peter out as you
get to the higher rpms up near your
redline that's because the engine is
less able to breathe efficiently there
secondly notice that horsepower keeps
climbing even after torque drops off why
is that seems like it's two engines
doing different things well even as
torque drops off the RPMs keep climbing
and horsepower is largely a product of
rpms times torque so we can put those
two together and keep that horsepower
line moving up because torque is
dropping but only modestly as our PMS go
up in a linear fashion okay I hope
you've got a better understanding now of
horsepower torque the relationship and
how they impact the driving experience
of a car also note we do our car videos
I'll show you those two numbers and
horsepower is usually the bigger torque
is often the smaller unless that car has
a turbo or a supercharger which
artificially puts more in the engine and
allows the torque to come higher or as
high as the horsepower that gives you
another clue as to what that car is
going to be like to drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
