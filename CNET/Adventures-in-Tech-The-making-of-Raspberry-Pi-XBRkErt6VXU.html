size of a pack of cards and costs just
$25 and once you've built it how do you
use it to grow a new generation of
programmers in this special episode of
adventures in tech we explore the making
of Raspberry Pi
Raspberry Pi is a tiny computing board
that's so simplistic you have to learn
basic programming just to turn it on
geeks love it for its flexibility but in
fact when the Raspberry Pi foundation
built this tiny machine they were trying
to use that user unfriendliness
to solve a growing problem in the
computer industry early computers
required a certain level of knowledge to
use but those who did get to grips with
them grew up and built better machines
modern gadgets that were much more
accessible and today you don't need to
know anything about how a computer works
in order to use one but if new
generations are losing touch with what
makes computers tick how are we going to
build better ones we've come to
Cambridge a spiritual home of computing
to speak with raspberry pi inventor Evan
Upton very simply the problem we wanted
to solve was we saw here in Cambridge at
the University the number of applicants
to study can be a science fall from
maybe five hundred 480 places in 1995 to
roughly two hundred ten years later and
really we were trying to find with
Raspberry Pi a way to reverse that
decline so I think the thing is that
young programmers learn about computers
and what they learn is that a computer
is like a metal box that contains a
keyboard and a mouse in the display and
a battery and lots of software and stuff
what we teach them is that actually you
know this is a this is a computer
concept of a basic machine for learning
was there as early as 2006 prototypes
were built but ultimately it was in 2010
with the arrival of the micro DB
developed at Broadcom that Evan became
convinced the Raspberry Pi was viable
several years of hard work later the
first pie was ready to come out of the
oven the Raspberry Pi model bee went on
sale in February 2012 and it backed a
surprising amount of power into its tiny
form at the center of the first pie was
a 700 megahertz processor backed up by
256 Meg of RAM it didn't even come with
any kind of casing but could run an
operating system off an SD card and
sported several crucial outputs
including a headphone jack USB Ethernet
and HDMI raspberry pi was an immediate
hit plenty of media attention turned
into sales and within a year a million
boards have been sold with the
itsy-bitsy microcomputer becoming a
fixture of tech culture geeky types
founder
way to make their own media centers
while even geekier types dreamed up
weird and wonderful applications for the
PI such worthy pursuits as making a
keyboard out of beer cans opening a
garage a vegetable drum machine sending
it to space controlling robots building
a pet feeder an arcade cabinet or a
small arcade cabinet the back-to-basics
nature of the Raspberry Pi has made it a
plaything for grown-up geeks but in a
world of iPads and X boxes how do you
enchant the younger crowd according to
the Foundation's education mastermind
it's the crudity of the pie that makes
it such a powerful teaching tool ok it
doesn't come so that when you turn it on
straight away it works first time it's
not in a fancy case it doesn't work my
magic these are really important points
and what actually make party planner a
great tool for learning with putting on
a desk in front of children and they see
that they ask questions and for any
teacher that's when you know your
children are engaged the foundation is
making inroads with education
Google bought 15,000 raspberry pies for
UK schools while communities around the
world have come together in raspberry
jams to get to grips with the pie the
foundation also runs Pike Adam II
classes which train teachers on how the
hardware can be used in the classroom we
have started to see adoption among
children we think that we have about a
million of them of the three and a half
million we've sold over a million of
them are in the hands of children one
way or another but we found now that
schools many schools are picking up and
using it and so we're seeing it move
from informal learning into formal
learning and that's quite exciting for
us here at foundation what do you think
the future holds for young programmers
and have you experimented with the
Raspberry Pi let me know and check back
