Alfred rang Samsung's developer
conference kicks off tomorrow and while
it's normally the kind of a snooze fest
we actually will be paying attention
because it's probably the first time
we'll see the long talked about foldable
smart from' phone from Samsung I'm
looking forward to it I haven't really
liked all the designs I've seen so far
of all the prototypes and things like
yeah because it takes something it makes
it bigger right yes like it's as if you
could fold the tablet and that's the
whole goal like they want to go bigger
give more space yeah hear me out here
here's my proposal you take a regular
size Samsung Galaxy s8 or s9 that size
which is already fairly large and you
make that in that foldable cuz then
that'd do a palm phone yeah so then you
would have more space in your pocket and
you would still have that like you know
like big phone that you would need I
don't think we need to go bigger yeah
but you do have to think about how that
works right if you've got a small device
that you're folding up that's a little
bit more complicated than a big device
folding into a smaller device yes if you
think about all the components and
batteries and all this stuff getting
crammed in there right we have the
technology we should we should be going
smaller instead we had something when
you fold something it's to make it more
convenient to like carry around and
things like that people want small they
were big I would say that a lot more
people want smaller devices a lot more
people you mean you yes a lot more
important people basically all right
well beyond the foldable phone the real
meat of the developer conference will be
a focus on Bixby that's Samsung's off
ignored digital assistant it's supposed
to open up Samsung's supposed to open up
Bixby to developers as well as foster
alexis skill like capsules the client
capsules for whatever reason you know
despite the fact that Bixby's been on
all the flagship phones with a dedicated
physical button hasn't taken off yeah
for Samsung sake they should definitely
you know reboot Bixby or at least make
it much better than it actually is
because it is seriously running the risk
of becoming the voice assistant joke
right now I mean for a while that's been
Cortana but now I feel like it's kind of
a dead horse to make fun of
Bixby's it's kind of sad because Samson
try so hard to make it a thing yeah and
I will say I've talked
about this on previous podcast where
Bixby does have an advantage because
Samsung doesn't just make phones or
speakers they're also making
refrigerators and TVs and that is where
pick speak could you know really have an
advantage over something like Amazon
with their Alexa microwave what yeah I
mean it just hasn't really seemed to be
that useful for a lot of people at the
moment no it's it's not and we'll
probably see the Bixby speaker smart
speaker at this developer conference
hopefully we'll get a launch date for
this this was teased a few months back
at that the note 9 launch hopefully that
gives it a bit of a shot in the arm
lastly offered you wrote a story about
the biggest threat to today's midterms
and it's not hacking what is this it's
actually misinformation on social media
claiming that a machine has been hacked
and the Department of Homeland Security
the FBI the Director of National
Intelligence all put out a joint
statement last night talking about this
saying that they've not found any
evidence of hacks against infrastructure
like voting machine or voter database or
anything like that right but they do
know that there is a effort from Russian
trolls or people from rolls from Iran
basically targeting social media using
that as a platform to spread lies and
rumors that you know oh this vote voting
machine was hacked that's not a so
bother to vote is that the idea yeah
that bother to vote because it's already
rigged or something like that so the
idea is that you know that this has
happened before they've gotten videos of
a voting machine where somebody presses
some one person and it like shows
another person instead oh yeah that will
go viral that happened in 2016 during
the presidential election a Russian
troll account used that video and
basically said look I told you this
election was rigged and these machines
are hacked and things like that so that
is not true it turned out that the
person was just using the machine wrong
and there's probably gonna be a lot more
cases of that happening today and that's
not to say that voting machines can't be
hacked it's just you should be a lot
more skeptical way if you do see
something like that on social media and
regardless you should go vote yes yep
all right for a full coverage chickens
on CNN and Roger Chang I'm alfred ring
thanks listening
all right that's it for the recording of
the audio podcast those are the stories
that we're focusing on today we want to
know what you want to know more in depth
as these stories goes and it's gonna
fuel us to go and research better and be
better at our jobs allegedly in the
meantime let's go ahead and shout out
Carlos and Texas Aaron and Brazil and
Sunil thanks for pointing out that it is
Diwali coming up on the 7th so to our
wide audience of wonderful Indian
viewers and Watchers happy Diwali
so in the meantime let's go ahead and
take a question well this is more of a
comment from our friend Timothy he says
manufacturers are gonna have a lot of
time making folding cases for these
scratch heavy folding phones they're
just gonna turn into bifold wallets when
they're all said and done well I am
really curious to see how these foldable
phones look you know we've got right now
the closest we've got is the axon and
that ZTE phones kind of a bulky thing
it's got two displays on a hinge and it
folds out probably when you fold it in
you know there's a screen in the front
and the screen on the back and that
really kind of freaks me out
oh yeah look so like if you throw over
the table you're just gonna scratch it
up and if you have a case for it just
cover up that back screen I mean so I
know they've invented I think they came
up with a special case that was a bit
more like a bumper so it won't obscure
the back screen but it's it's weird and
I'm not sure if that's the way it's
gonna go you know the concept video you
showed earlier
I think Samsung had two screens one was
you know it folded out into a the inside
would have a big screen and they'd fold
it in and the top side would have a like
a secondary smaller screen which seems
like probably the best way to do it but
also having those two screens seems
power intensive and not super efficient
and you can imagine it being really
really bulky so we'll see I mean I I'm
curious to see we've been we've been
talking about foldable phones for a
while it's really kind of touted as one
of the kind of next big innovations in
smartphones at a time when we're really
not seeing a lot of innovation aside
from notches
so I mean that's that's why we're dream
I don't know if it'll actually be
something worth getting at least for the
first couple of generations but I'm
definitely fascinated by the idea and
really want to see how much we're gonna
actually get to see out of this cuz
remember this phone isn't expected to
come out until at least next year and so
this is really to get developers
interested so I'm fearful that like they
pull out this device for like five
seconds fold it open fold the clothes
put back in the pocket like walk off and
like that's it that's the entire thing
and we'll have to wait till next year to
actually get full glimpse of the phone
are you psychic Roger cuz I anticipate
that's exactly what's gonna happen
Samsung sent me their script so I'm
already well-versed today yeah
so speaking of pockets have they given
any potential dimensions on this new
folding device like Matthews asking if
it is going to comfortably fit in the
pocket and I have to agree with them
that just in in the world where we slim
things down to you know let's call it
paper thin adding a second layer to that
that's gonna feel awkward and take us
back to 1998 shall it not yeah I mean at
least look if you look at the ax on em
as and then to be fair this I think
that's a rougher product but that's a
thick phone it's basically two phones
sandwiched together and it doesn't feel
that great your it's pretty thick
it's a little bulky that's why if you go
with my idea and just take a regular
sized phone and fold that it's still
gonna be bulky okay but it would you it
you would have more vertical space I
would argue or fold it in a triangle
shape so Ross and then you could have
four phones what Walt four screens at
least you can have two phones that fold
into triangle shapes and then put them
on top of each other into make a square
you can look magnetically laughs yeah
okay yeah are you making like origami
phones yeah we should do that that's
what they should do with all the
sebacean okay air my phone is a paper
crane I'm intrigued in your Kickstarter
it'll never work
alright moving on here's one from
Timothy do let's go ahead and talk about
the voice assistance already we have a
lot of debate going back and forth and
go ahead everybody just let it loose let
us hear your true feelings on who is the
suckiest voice assistant if it's Bigsby
Cortana
Ceri i'll stop naming them so I'll stop
triggering your speakers so let's bear
that in mind for this episode I already
apologized Timothy do says whose fault
is this Apple bought the company who
created Siri and those same creators
created Bigsby and Sampson bought it so
well the Creator they didn't create
Samsung created Bigsby they did by a
company called viv which was started by
one of the co-creators of Siri they
didn't actually integrate that
technology until like the second
generation until I think earlier this
year like when it first launched Bigsby
woods its own Samsung homegrown
technology which probably explains why
it wasn't very good it's supposed to be
with this new generation with a via
technology it's supposed to like
understand context a little bit better
that said people just aren't using it
even if despite the fact that there's
like a dedicated physical button on your
phone that only pulls a bixby people
still choose to use the Google I mean
yeah it doesn't help that Google
assistant is on the exact same device
and people are already familiar but it's
it's you know it's on the home button
the Google assistants on home button you
know it's there is a dedicated physical
button but yeah people still choose the
Google version David Rodriguez needs a
shout out before he has a mild aneurysm
so hey hey what's up David Matthew
dacher our buddy - in the chat points
out it would only be logical that these
folding phones be comprised completely
of Gorilla Glass 6 I think that's a
no-brainer oh yeah I mean that would be
ideal who knows if they yeah would they
be able to use that though I mean I
don't know how this folding like like
are they using some like flexible
material to fold it or below low Just
Blaze yeah ok I don't know yeah yeah I
don't I don't know there's a lot of
questions about this where we're still
not sure how this is gonna work I would
say having Google glass 6 yeah would
definitely help I just don't know if
that all that's part of the
implementation with a flexible bid so I
still really just don't understand the
the point of making a folding phone
outside of a the game it can be screen
space screen space it's is that really
just it cuz that just seems man the
ultimate goal of a scroll
unscrew unfurl your phone I don't know
I've seen that and like I've seen that
in anime or something I mean I'm all for
like the unveiling of the scroll to
decree the Kings exactly but like is
that really functional no role that's
your fun man and light it up
let's talk a little bit more about the
voice assistance while we're we're just
dancing back and forth between topics
people still going back and forth thank
you for your contributions about who you
think is the best and worst assistance
personally for me I've been kind of
married into the Amazon ecosystem so I
use that the most I have Google on my
phone I have mixed feelings about it
it's impressed me in some instances and
then utterly failed in others actually
utterly failed on the same instances at
different points in time
yeah and I've talked to a rich brown are
the head of our smart home reviews team
and he generally thinks the Google
options the best one I guess he's spent
more time like I I'm with you I usually
I've got a lot of echoes in my house so
I tend to use the Amazon option but I
think it's just like I'm more
comfortable I haven't really had a
chance to use Google assistant that much
so I know with what the rich having
spent time with a lot of them he
generally likes Google yeah I would say
that it's never too late to change over
to any one of them like I started with a
bunch of echo dots just because they
were really cheap and I got them on a
sale yeah then some Google homes were
very cheap and I got those on a sale and
then I was just switching between both
of them for a little bit you have them
both your house did you like I used to
have them both I used to have an echo in
one room at Google home Mini in another
room and I would just like kind of trade
off okay and then I kind of just made my
decision that the home was like easier
for me to use really yeah so I like
switched over I mean I think that if you
anybody that thinks that they're like
stuck with one system like I think it's
you're at least able to try out like the
other you are but if you spend money and
use like
putting the time to put in like
smart-home yeah gadget that's tied to a
particular one I think it's tougher this
way yeah I just I'm just saying if you
are curious about it like they're there
you can like switch over you're not like
stuck I would say yo shout-out to storm
king for a deep cut the scrolling phone
was future tech in a sci-fi show called
Earth final conflict oh holy crap I've
got that show existed storm king you're
my hero today holy cow that's right
that's why it's stuck in my head that
you've that show that I I think going
watch like three episodes of before
whatever reason it's stuck in my head
are you gonna be able to scroll up your
phone and poop your dog on the nose
wanted to misbehaving if I owned dog
yeah I think that would be part of the
that's the future stability yeah
absolutely my god now I'm just gonna sit
here and watch Earth final conflict
today that's why I'm not getting
anything done that was a cool show man
Roddenberry you don't get better than
Roger show's over show's over everybody
I'm just gonna fifty nine podcast is
available we getting sued for this
probably okay alright anyways sorry I
got distracted a did do it was a cool
show give me a break a fantastic special
special eight nine became for that for
that reference yes money
I'm totally beyond distracted at this
point and while we're at it let's shout
out Omar what's up Omar thanks for
joining us here's a great question from
solid cancer oh seven horizontal folding
phone or vertical folding phone which is
gonna catch on the most probably
horizontal horizontal yeah I think we're
like a phone that folds out to become
holds this way this vertical but then it
becomes horizontal after you unfold it
maybe I don't I don't know I mean you'd
want in terms of like watching videos so
most people are used to folders which is
vertical so maybe it'll be that way but
horizontal I don't know it's it's let's
say horizontal to safer bet though do it
diagonally make it a triangle yeah
most of you bite yeah multiple parts and
then you can kind of combine them I like
that and I motorola already try that the
mods yeah no well project ara really the
Google's thing the Lego has a Lego stuff
but no triangles though they're all like
little squares and rectangles I can fold
into a triangle you can also play like
the the paper football game yeah and
like flick that across station that is
also set up by for pretty sure that's
gonna hurt like hell
oh yeah that would hurt a mess up your
fingernail pretty bad the price of
innovation is is always hot I mean all
right so I'm still kind of mulling over
this question horizontal seems the
logical version to me because it's going
to constrain the proportions of video
playback right if you're gonna get more
screen you're gonna do things probably
more watching yeah video etc vertical
really get you not much it'd be like a
weird clamshell thing yeah
horizontal sense it opens up like a book
so yeah it it seems more natural for you
like if you flipped it up yeah it just
seems weird I mean he points out that
yeah we used to flip up phones all the
time but that was to access the keyboard
not to garner more screen space yeah I
can't imagine that long screenbeam we
were - that's great yeah like a long
screen like this unless it was a
scrollable phone I'm ok with that
ok what would you scroll that horizontal
or vertical
you could do it both ways yeah do both
ways we got a couple minutes left so
let's keep the conversation going mark
dybul thinks that there should be a hulu
of voice assistance one stop shop for
them all we're now you're gonna see that
that would be great that would be just
opt-in you can go in and watch like NBC
like yeah
considering that you there's so many
things that you can only watch on
Netflix and Amazon now I feel like Hulu
is not that's not like it's not
one-stop-shop I get the idea we're
trying to say MEMS being lame and
quibbling yes I think that I think the
idea of like voice assistance either
talking to each other or being
that we've talked about that concept
down the line it's we're in early days
of these voice assistance so of course
it's gonna be fragmented people are
gonna try to like stay there claim and
eventually there'll be a handful how
many one I think there will be once
there's a clear-cut winner I mean yeah
you know when search engines were coming
up there was Google Ask Jeeves and Yahoo
right Alta Vista yeah and you know
obviously like Google had one out on
that one I think it might be a different
story here just because Amazon has some
pretty deep pockets yep Apple is and
Samsung I I don't think this is one
where Google can just like we're gonna
outlast all of them so it might be much
harder for a clear-cut winner and in
this whole voice assistant discussion
and if Samsung is boosting up baek's be
like it says it is then you know you
know new challenger has entered the
field yeah yeah I mean keep in mind
Samsung is looking at I think they're
looking to hire just a massive number of
AI experts over the next couple of years
so and that just one company with deep
pockets all these companies have a huge
amount of resources apple just bulked up
their own AI staff so you can imagine
these things we're gonna get a lot
better there's gonna be a lot more
there's just gonna be a lot more
fragmentation for a while until this
gets settled out but I don't think it's
gonna set up get settled for a while one
more question from Kirk regarding the
Google Home Hub can it replace Samsung's
smart things hub does it have z-wave
what is ziwei z-wave is the one of the
wireless protocols for smart home stuff
I'm not entirely sure
ah that's rich all right rich brown rich
brown yes when are we gonna have him on
the show when he comes here from yeah
he's in Louisville it's a little tough
to get him on he was here for the thank
you folks around know I've seen oh the
Google event briefly but he was in and
out I would have loved to have had him
on but I think we had Jess on to talk
about pixels no yeah that figures
no offense Jess all right we are pretty
much out of time here but let's go ahead
and farm a question out for future
fodder what would you get out of a
foldable phone use case
because I'm still having a hard time
picturing the true value in it and why
you would need that as opposed to just
getting you know smaller and tablet or
something like that or I don't know
using your television besides video what
are some some beneficial use cases for
foldable phone
we've got hitch in the chat says as an
athlete I would like a foldable phone
I'm curious to see how that would
benefit you as an athlete I'd imagine
just the compact size to an extent being
able to carry it that way but otherwise
Phyllis in folks I'm struggling with
this myself that would say with that
extra screen real estate in fact that
it's foldable almost like a lot is like
a mini laptop like you can use you know
one screen is a keyboard one screen is a
screen or you could have multiple
screens I could do multitasking there I
bring up the acts on em because they did
come up with a number of apps that sort
of took advantage of the screen the idea
was they on in one particular use case
they had the screens kind of folded on
each side so like we could play a
battleship or something like it could be
like a two-player thing where one person
the other side I'd be on this one we'd
have basically two screens interacting
with each other there definitely I think
that's why I'm kind of excited about
this because with foldable phones and
like companies like Samsung trying to
get these developers on board to create
new kinds of apps that take advantage of
it we probably don't even know what the
the real killer apps for these for this
design would be I think that's something
that developers are gonna have to work
on the next couple months or years until
we get something worthwhile all right
I'll take that for now but we are out of
time thanks everybody for joining us
thanks everybody around the world for
coming to view the 3:59 we'll be back
tomorrow at 11:15 a.m. Eastern with more
techie news Shetty chat but until then
Roger take us on out of here 39 is
available on iTunes tune in stitcher
Bieber play music Amazon echo of course
Tina calm I'm probably sure I missed a
bunch of those but we'll see y'all
tomorrow
take care Dan Ackerman on to talk about
the MacBook Air
he wasn't here today
we'll talk about that but tune in
tomorrow for MacBook Air stuff buckle up
folks it's gonna get weird
