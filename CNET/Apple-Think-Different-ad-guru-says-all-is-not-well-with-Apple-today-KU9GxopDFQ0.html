its most high-profile campaigns and at a
time when the company was still very
much an underdog tell us how that got
started how did that relationship with
Apple begin I got the opportunity to
work on Apple in the days of John
Sculley and then a few years later when
Steve Jobs needed a creative director at
his ad agency to handle next I was a
candidate for the job simply because I
had the Apple experience you know and I
always stress to people that we didn't
know that Apple could possibly succeed
in those days it was near bankruptcy you
loved Steve Jobs and had faith in him
all that kind of stuff but you didn't
know like I didn't invest my own money
in Apple people asked me why I didn't
today because I could have been wealthy
the whole thing worked out in such an
interesting way the first thing we did
was the think different campaign and we
did that really just on faith Steve said
great things are coming we didn't know
what anything was going to look like or
how it was going to function
it was the success of iMac that really I
think turned all of our heads because it
became the best-selling computer like an
Apple history really so you have been
credited as the person who came up with
the name iMac tell us how that happened
Steve had a name in his head for the
iMac that made us all shudder when we
heard it he thought that math man would
be a good name and it made us all
scratch our heads and say why really
it's a pretty terrible name he just
liked it he couldn't really explain it
but he did what he often did which was I
challenge you do something better so the
concept of that first computer was that
it was the easy way to the internet so I
for internet Mac for Macintosh seemed
rather obvious to me so Ken you're the
author of a new book think simple which
is all about simplicity in advertising
and in all walks of life really taking
Apple today do you think it's managed to
maintain that focus on simplicity or if
things changed I think if you listen to
Tim Cook or Johnny I've today simplicity
is all we
is part of the conversation but I think
one has to be objective if even if
you're a fanboy such as myself all is
not totally well in the world of Apple
and I don't mean that to be so alarming
as a lot of people you know feel today
the values are there but I think there
is are there some there are some issues
in the execution it's a quality control
thing I supposed I think people fall in
love with Apple products because they've
been simple and reliable and beautifully
designed all that stuff so once you
start pulling back on any of those
features you won't be creating the the
love and that is essential to Apple
success looking at the tech world today
and the way that tech companies are
advertising can you think of any
particularly good examples that you've
seen of particularly effective campaigns
or all the opposite any particularly bad
efforts using it's a tough question
because I don't see any tech company
that I look at and say you know I love
everything they do there they're like
pieces that they do Samsung is a very
good example when they came out with
their anti Apple phone stuff of that
people waiting in lines at the you know
for the Apple Store I thought those were
actually fabulous and they did to Apple
exactly what Apple did to Microsoft and
the PC world in their old ads that had
the max versus of the PCs but Samsung
although they accomplished that with
that campaign they have done some of the
most horrifying ads I've ever seen so
consistency is a very very important
thing and Apple has been pretty darn
consistent doing high-level good quality
advertising Kent Siegel thank you very
much for your time my pleasure thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
