and this is the show where we cover the
hottest apps in the mobile space at the
apple event last week the big news was
the announcement of the new ipad but
apple had some other software
announcements including a brand new app
for iOS devices I photo was already used
by many Mac users to edit and organize
photos and share them with friends and
family though the iOS version is not as
feature rich as its desktop cousin
there's plenty of useful things you can
do with iPhoto on an iOS device the
touchscreen interface is a joy to use
but definitely takes some practice to
get used to while the tools are
available in only a couple of taps it's
not immediately apparent how to use them
fortunately Apple included an excellent
help interface that calls out each
interface element with more information
should you need it once you've got the
basic controls down you can start
improving and playing with your images
I'll grab one I took earlier today on
Second Street the picture is a little
drab and the grey skies aren't helping
so maybe i'll start by cropping the
image after touching the cropping tool i
can drag the sides of the image in to
make it smaller I'll try to get rid of
that gray sky first now with that
finished maybe I want to adjust
brightness and contrast to bring out the
details use the sliders at the bottom to
adjust both brightness and contrast
simultaneously or grab just the contrast
slider to adjust it independently next
all just colors iphoto separates the
colors into real-world terms so after
adding a bit of saturation I can adjust
the tones for blue skies greenery
there's not much here obviously and skin
tones this photo is starting to pop out
a bit more to bring out specific areas
of the image I'll use the brush tools
these are a little confusing at first
because people generally think of
brushes as painting tools but it helps
to think of it as painting the effect
onto the image maybe I'll saturate the
color on this building a bit more there
are several brushes to play with to
brighten darken and sharpen your image
finally we can add effects touching the
effect button makes affects fan out on
your screen you have options for warm or
cool effects duotone black and white
vintage and others but i'll choose
artistic to take this image to the
extreme oh
and traded so much on the building that
maybe I'll apply it the tilt shift
effect to make sure the focus is on the
building finally to really go to
extremes I'll add the oil paint effect
at any time during the process you also
have the option to reference the
original image by touching the show
original button at the top one of the
great new features for iOS devices is
the ability to make journals with your
photos journals arrange your images into
a collage once you've assembled the
journal you can move and resize images
to get them just where you want you also
can add in a map using your gps location
for the image or add in the date to show
when you took them when you're finished
you can watch your collection of images
as a slideshow export them to itunes or
publish to iCloud which lets you send a
link to family and friends the finished
product this was made from a trip to
Maui recently lets you touch an image to
see it full screen great for setting to
family so they can see your adventures
your family member will receive a link
and you're finished journal will show up
full screen in their web browser
certainly we haven't covered everything
here but with a unique set of tools cool
projects to make with journals and tons
of effects and image editing options I
photo is a great value at 499 well it's
not as feature rich is a desktop version
we still recommend you tap this app
immediately that's it for this week's
show if you have any suggestions for tap
that up please send them to tap that app
