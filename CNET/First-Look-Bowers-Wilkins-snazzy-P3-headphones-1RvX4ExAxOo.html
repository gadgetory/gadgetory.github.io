cnet.com and I'm going to give you a
quick video tour of the Bowers and
Wilkins p3 headphones which are among
the slicker on ear models I've come
across these are BMWs third pair of
headphones in the first two models the
on ear p5 and the in-ear c5 have earned
strong reviews from CNET compared to the
p5 the p3 is a more lightweight and
affordable model that features a fold up
design and a hard shell carrying case I
can't say I like the case design as much
as the headphones design the clamshell
can snap shut on your finger and since
the case is made out of hard plastic
it's going to get scuffed up over time
but it is very protective along with the
carrying case you get one cable with an
integrated microphone and remote that's
designed to work with the iphone
microphone will work with other phones
including android models but the rope
features are hit and miss with non Apple
smartphones if you're an audiophile who
wants to eliminate the switch for quote
unquote straight wire with gain
performance BMW provides a second cable
that leaves off the microphone and
inline remote and is easy to swap in the
p3 headphones are made out of aluminum
and durable rubber and feature
custom-made ultra light acoustic fabric
on the ear pads these headphones are
very comfortable for a non ear model but
they don't feel quite as comfortable as
the P 5s which costs $100 more and have
bigger plush or leather ear cups the ear
cups on these guys breathe a little
better than the P 5s but they'll still
get your ears a little steamy on warmer
days as for performance the p3 sound
really good and like the p5 have
detailed well balanced sound and good
bass the p3 can press on their own but
my view of them changed a bit once I
compared them to the p5 s the p5 just
sound more detailed open and more
refined in other words that extra
hundred dollars you pay for the p5 s
does get you better sound in the end the
p3 is a strikingly designed headphone
that also sounds very good I can't say
this is a great deal at $200 but it's
about what you should expect to pay for
a headphone that features this level of
industrial design sound quality and
feature
yes you can find headphones that sound a
bit better in this price range but few
look as good I'm David Carr know and
that's the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins p3 headphone
