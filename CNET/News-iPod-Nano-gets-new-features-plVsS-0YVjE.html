to talk to you about the ipod and we
started the ipod simply because we love
music and that hasn't stopped we still
love music and we're still making great
ipods in fact it's the best lineup we've
ever made the shuffle the nano the ipod
touch so I'd like to give you updates to
two of those lines today first ipod nano
just last year we introduced an all new
ipod nano and it's a really fun way to
enjoy your music wherever you are and
customers love it for its compact design
its multi-touch display its built-in
volume buttons and equip so you can wear
it wherever you go it is a pedometer and
even a built-in FM radio so we've added
some updates this year first with this
multi-touch display we decide to make it
even easier to navigate and so now you
can display big beautiful icons for all
of the features on it and just swipe
between them with your finger to switch
between the radio the clock the fitness
application it's really simple and
fitness of course is one of the most
popular uses for the Nano you can use it
when you go to the gym when you go on
one of those walks a lot of people like
to run with their iPod nano so we've
improved the fitness experience as well
now right out of the box with the ipod
nano you can go are not only a walk put
a run as well without adding any extra
sensors or devices right out of the box
you go for your run you come back you
plug your nano into your mac or pc and
you can upload all the data about your
run right up on to Nike Plus this
website and track all of your runs over
time look for achievements compete with
friends it's a really great way to get
fit so that's one of the really great
uses of an ipod nano there's a really
cool use that some people have created
all on their own without us doing is
they can't create a market of
accessories like watch
fans to make this watch you can wear
that's an ipod nano it has all your
music in it and of course tells time we
thought that was really fun we see this
around the world so with the updated
Nana we've added in a software some new
clock faces to make it fun for people
who like to wear it as a watch why not
right so here's one this is a classic
great beautiful watch with Roman
numerals or maybe you want a retro LED
style watch on your wrist watch with
some really cool complications or a
watch that's color coordinated with the
color nano you picked and then this is
really fun we've worked good partners at
Disney on some characters you can have
on your watch so if you want a Mickey
Mouse watch you can now get one yeah yes
the arms move to keep track of time or
can get Minnie Mouse as well so it's
really cool this the ipod nano comes in
seven gorgeous colors it's been priced
for eight gigabytes at 149 and 16
gigabytes at 179 well now the ipod nano
just 149 for 16 gigs and 129 for eight
gigs make it the most affordable nano
we've ever had so that nano is available
