very embodiment of the trickle-down
theory take a bunch of features that
only appeared in high-end products and
after a couple of years these become
part of the entry level the AVRs 730
offers not only Dolby Atmos and DTS X
but also compatibility with 4k and HDR
video plus denon's own he√µs multi room
music system all for under $500 us this
is the first time in three years that an
entry-level receiver has offered here's
the system includes a series of speakers
and now receivers that support most
streaming services including Pandora and
Spotify as well as network playback
while Yamaha and Sonos offer better
systems and Google chromecast is crazy
cheap it's good to see down on at least
offering an alternative the receiver
offers a decent selection of connections
including a total of 6 HDMI ports with
support for the latest video standards
including Dolby vision sound quality is
what you're ultimately here for though
and the den on is equally good with
movies and music we tried a number of
different loudspeakers including the
difficulty lack UV 5s and didn't notice
any compatibility issues
well Sony STR DN 1080 might sound better
and also offers Google chromecast
capability if you only have $500 to
spend the den on a VR s 730 is a very
good choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
