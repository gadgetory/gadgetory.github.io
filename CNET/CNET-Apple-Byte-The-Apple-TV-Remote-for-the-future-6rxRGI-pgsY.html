welcome to the apple byte it's all the
good and bad inside the world of apples
so let's get to the show including a
special visit to Macworld 2012 now our
lead story might not be the sexiest to
start off with but it's important after
the New York Times published an
extensive story on the working
conditions at Foxconn one of apple's
largest manufacturing partners it's not
a pretty picture with harsh working
conditions underage workers people
clocking in 60 hour plus weeks and a
factory explosion in May that killed
four people and injured 18 now Apple is
not the only major company who uses
Foxconn others like IBM HP and Lenovo
also have their products built there the
big a has addressed some of the issues
and has audits with its suppliers but
the takeaway here is that we really need
to be aware of how these products that
we purchased are being produce just
think about if Apple had fifty percent
of all iphones come out of their
factories defective you know they would
immediately make changes and in light of
their record earnings and the amount of
products they pump out they can also
make changes in the way their products
are made and they really need to address
this again now I'm the first person who
loves his tech but it's worth taking
back a step to bring this to your
attention and really it's your move now
Apple now we talked about those earnings
and it was another Apple best quarter
ever for q1 of 2012 posting revenue over
forty three billion dollars and a net
quarterly profit of over 13 billion
highlights were the announcements
included a record 15.4 million ipads
sold and CEO Tim Cook said the company
hadn't seen any slowdown in ipad sales
after the introduction of the Kindle
Fire who earn now a record 37 million
plus I phones were sold and that hobby
of theirs the apple TV it sold 1.4
million units in q1 of 2012 apple sold
2.8 million in all of 2011 alright guys
we know that Matt goal that is happening
just down the street so we wanted to
send my twin brother to give you the
report on the floor
alright Brian we are here on the show
floor at moscone center this is Mac
world 2012 i like to call mackerel I
world so what we're going to do is we
looked around to try and find out what
is some of the hottest stuff here today
this is Sydney this is iOS recharge
stations before so as you can see you
can fully recharge it to four devices at
once simultaneously without compromise
each port provides you to pull intense
it's a full recharge so the 2.1 amps is
going to able enable it to be a faster
charge you also have this kind of nice
stack where you could fit what about
three ipads and then additional device
definitely you can fit three ipads but
you can recharge it before at the same
time and then who do you think this is
really going to target specifically yeah
we're looking at not only households we
chose for ports for a family of devices
but you're looking at work offices
hospitality settings educational health
care everyone's starting to incorporate
tablet you so we're really targeting
elbows alright a Mac world also we like
to find friends and family zaki you had
some interesting for you back about her
yeah I think it's a little too
scatological you know I give me too many
public jokes you know Joe florid soul
that's so he likes I'm you joke but
still watching it no I don't know i
don't like poop you know that's that's
what i want to fast-forward I'll a of a
fan you know you with some of us over 50
people watch to watch the wackiness this
is a special made system to add lenses
to your iPhone it comes with the case
and this handle within the handle are
housed the two lenses this is a magic
trick you got going on here that's right
the century wide-angle lens is right
there
and on the bottom part o.o the fisheye
lens that's when everybody likes to see
all right now this is the ipro lens how
much does it retail for right now
currently with everything that includes
the case to handle the two lenses 199
then you guys just announced a new
telephoto lens right that like kind of
doubles the image just today we
announced our brand new two times tele
extender thank you for that I'm out my
mac all the time so this will be
released in mid-february we announce
them at CES they feature integrated
ports so you've got your me display port
and USB passthrough right here and we've
got a nice rubberized cradle and the
whole unit ships just as this you pull
out of the box is ready to go drop it
down connect your power and your two
accessories and you've got yourself a
docking station now how much is going to
retail for these are going to start at
55 for the 11 inch models and go up to
60 for the 13 inch models I just like
him a lot because they're really clean
and how they look that's something
that's the best part about now also I
didn't I didn't know you guys had this
but the click tell me about this because
this is probably another really hot
designed product of you guys it's called
the click it joins apples bluetooth
keyboard and magic trackpad together
into a single streamlined unit and you
can use it on soft slippers so you still
retain your clicking functions here in
the trackpad which is really important
if you like to use your computer say
it's part of a home theater setup or on
your lap I know a lot of people type in
the labs too so it also keeps it from
wandering off and a desktop environment
all right there you guys have it a look
at the show floor from Mac world 2012 we
didn't want to show you all the cases
that were here but we did want to show
you some of the unique things that we
found in you know what I'm just going to
enjoy watching this back to you Brian
alright Brian it looks like you're
having a little fun over there but let's
wrap this up with a couple more stories
and rumor news with ipad 3 rumors pretty
much dried up 9to5 mac is reporting from
their own source at that factory called
Foxconn that Apple is gearing up to
begin production for the iPhone 5 now
the latest rumor says we can expect a 4
plus inch display that's longer and
wider than the current iPhone and there
will be no teardrop design at all the
source also says there are various
sample devices floating around and none
of them have an iPhone 4 or 4s form
factor and none of the devices are final
versions translation the only thing we
know is that an iPhone 5 is coming out
in 2012 and a more Apple TV news tidbits
that will get your juices flowing a
recent patent application reveals Apple
is flirting with the idea of a universal
touch screen controller that can control
multiple devices including a TV a video
tape player video disc player a stereo a
home control system or a computer now
could be the iPad or it could be
something completely new but I know some
of you already busted out your wallets
in anticipation all right that's going
to do it for this week's show remember
to send us your emails to the apple bita
cnet com I'm Brian Tom thanks for
watching and Lloyd I Love You Man
