year's iPhone 6 but it's not the same
phone as with previous S models Apple
put most of the changes on the inside
and you know what that means I'm Bill
Detweiler and this is cracking open
hold on iPhone 6 next to an iPhone 6s
and you'd be hard-pressed to tell the
two apart like the previous model the 6s
measures 5.4 inches tall and 2.6 4
inches wide it's a few millimeters
thicker and about half an ounce heavier
but I doubt most people will notice
these differences the 6 and 6s both have
a 4.7 inch retina HD display but the
newer phone features Apple's 3d touch
technology which can detect how much
pressure you apply to the screen and
perhaps this is why Apple covered the 6s
s display with a new kind of chemically
strengthened glass now in addition to
using stronger glass Apple also used a
different aluminum on the 6s instead of
using a serious six thousand alloy as
they did on the iphone 6 apple built the
6s s body out of a more rigid series
7000 aluminum alloy so hopefully we
won't see any bendgate stories about the
6s now that we've looked at the phone's
outside it's time to break out our tools
and take a look at the inside to crack
open the iPhone 6s
I removed the two pentalobe screws
located along the bottom edge and then
use our handy opening tool to pop loose
the display now with the front panel
open the first thing we're going to do
is remove several metal plates which
cover connectors for the battery front
panel and other components we'll then
disconnect the battery and remove the
front panel now the overall hardware
layout is the same as on the iPhone 6
there's a speaker and lightning
connector assembly at the bottom battery
along the left side motherboard along
the right and the camera assembly at the
top one change we can see however is
Apple's new
taptic engine sitting below the battery
it replaces the older phones vibration
mechanism and is slightly larger which
means the speaker next to it needed to
be just a bit smaller also smaller at
least in terms of capacity is the 6th SS
battery which is rated at 1715 milliamp
hours compared to the 6 SS 1810 milliamp
hours now despite this reduction apple
claims battery life on these 6s will be
the same as it was on the older phone
turning our attention to the new front
panel assembly we find the new 3d touch
display a 5 megapixel FaceTime camera
which is an upgrade over the older
phones 1.2 megapixel unit sensors and
earpiece speaker and the improved home
button while I would usually remove the
battery as part of our teardown I'm
going to leave it in place as I remove
the other components now this will keep
me from having to glue it back in later
now the first component to come out is
the new I side camera which has been
upgraded to 12 megapixels and can now
shoot 4k video at 30 frames a second a
small antenna comes out next and then
after removing a few screws dealing with
a new hex head standoff and attaching
the remaining connectors we can lift out
the motherboard now unfortunately the
shields that cover the iPhone 6 SS
motherboard are soldered in place
obscuring our view of the new a9
processor and m9 motion coprocessor
that's built in and most of the other
chips as I want to put this phone back
together in working order I'm going to
leave the shields in place the last
pieces to come out are the speaker
assembly and the taptic engine still
attached to the case are the headphone
and lightning connector assembly volume
buttons ringer switch power button and a
slew of connector wires most of these
components are held to the case with
both screws and adhesive if any of these
components were damaged removing them
and replacing them wouldn't be difficult
but I don't want to risk damaging them
during removal so I'm going to leave
them where they are except for a small s
label on the back of the iPhone 6s and a
newly available rose gold finish the
phone looks identical to last year's six
looks however can be deceiving
Apple packed lots of new tech into the
iPhone 6s and if you're still using a 5
or a 5s and maybe even a 6 I would
definitely think about upgrading for a
complete list of specs pricing and real
world performance tests check out the
