smartphone and web site has some kind of
password and that makes sense we need to
have our data protected but it's also
impossible to keep track of a password
for every website we visit or every
device that we own so the vision that I
see for the future is one king all
Internet so in my keychain here
literally this is my cue to my house to
my bike and this is the key to my
internet you because you baqi uses NFC
technology to make logging into
smartphones and laptops more seamless
this is an application I will log into
lastpass which is one of the password
manager support CBT right and I'll put
my key behind my phone and it will
automatically launch the application
right AFC NFC is like magic every time
you use it there's little doubt that
password authentication is an area ripe
for innovation and the big guys are
definitely keen to kill the password
Google is looking into youbecause tech
for its Chromebooks while Microsoft is
playing with picture password protection
with windows 8 then there's apples
recent buyout of authentic a fingerprint
biometrics company pippa in the UK is
also targeting biometrics by developing
fingerprint based authentication for
tablets and smartphones and by onnum
will soon be shipping software that uses
a sample of your electrocardiogram to
log in and authenticate but the coolest
tech I've seen lately is I verify this
startup uses your smartphone's camera to
image and pattern match the blood
vessels in the whites of your eyes it's
gonna take some pictures look up and to
the right so we do this two or three
times initially to the left look up and
to the right okay so you're now enrolled
right cool yeah so now we will see if we
can get you verified and now do that
exact same thing again okay
and to them all right there look up into
the left look up there to the right and
you're in and I'm in there you go look
at that Wow still not everyone is
convinced that biometrics is the wave of
the future we have choose today not to
include by metrics because my biometrics
is static information and true but no
one can steal it yes well I guess they
could steal your eyeball I saw that our
movie once it can steal a picture of
your face and a picture off your
fingerprints and it's already happen but
I verify has an answer for that no one
outside of terrible action movies can
take my accra me you know that funny
thing when your blood stops pumping
different things happen to your blood
vessels they're kind of small
pressurized flexible tubing they
actually change significantly so yes you
can't actually steal someone's eye
they're kind of our picture of the eye
nor video of the I take that Hollywood
yes so whether it's your fingerprint
your heart rate your eyeball or a key
that you carry around I think we can all
agree that the passwords days are
numbered and that is a good thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
