samsung's new Smart TV features for 2017
the company has improved its smart
interface to make it a little more
usable than last year and some cool new
features include a sports mode and a
music mode in sports mode you can go in
and select your favorite teams and from
there we'll tell you when your teams are
playing with push notifications that pop
up on the TV screen you can go directly
to the game when it comes on it looks at
your cable service and figures out
exactly what channels and what games are
on and gives you those push
notifications they can also appear on
your phone as well as the TV screen
itself there's also a new music mode to
identify songs that you hear on the
television the song starts playing that
you want to know about you can press the
music mode and it will identify the song
using Shazam and then you'll get the
information on the song and if you have
a compatible app like Spotify you can
actually go in and play the song using
it Samsung has also improved the phone
app this year so in addition to
controlling the TV like a standard
remote it looks a lot like the interface
on the TV itself that allows you to go
in and use different apps like Netflix
and Hulu directly from the phone cast
them to the television just like a
chromecast samsung's new TV remote is
all metal and completely redesigned from
previous years and just a few buttons
make it a little bit easier to use than
some other remotes we've seen that's a
quick look at samsung's Smart TV and
remote functionality on its new TVs for
2017 I'm David Katz my art scene</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
