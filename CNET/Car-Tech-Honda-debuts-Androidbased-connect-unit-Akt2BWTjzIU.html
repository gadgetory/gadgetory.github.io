auto shout i'm taking a look at the new
honda connect head unit this is the new
head unit where the cars combines
navigation and all at but the really
cool thing about this new head unit is
it's actually running the android
operating system which gives it a lot of
flexibility for apps and the like and
also underneath the hardware there's an
NVIDIA Tegra 3 chip running those things
that's a fairly robust computing
platform when we look at this interface
here we get a tiled interface a fairly
attractive tile that interface a very
modern look but this is actually one of
the interfaces you can load at least as
they have on the demos here at the Paris
show now when I look at this one one of
the first tiles i sees navigation now
that's at the center of most head units
by hit that tile it brings up our very
familiar-looking garmin icons here the
garmin where to and the Garvin view maps
buttons I take a look at the map I see a
regular got a perspective view map and
that's again this is Garmin software
this is actually the garmin navigator
app were seen here and this should also
do live searches as well because this is
a connected unit in the sense that it's
actually running data from a connected
smartphone when you have your smartphone
connected to the system that's how this
gets data through now we go back to the
main screen here and the coolest thing
about this is the app integration the
fact that with Android we can load all
sorts of apps on here so if I hit this
one button on the side I bring up my app
center and I can find new apps here's
the apps that are loaded on the system
right now I have aa ha radio that's
internet radio service I don't have a
web browser here that's kind of cool I
hit the Honda App Center icon this is
where i can find new apps for the system
actually apps that are available on the
App Store the Honda's going to run a lot
is going to curate these apps I'm not
going to let you load apps that they
don't D more safe for the car like it on
my car app section here I've got a
number of apps i've got again aha I've
got a p.o that's an internet radio
service I've got a unbranded fuel prices
app and a parking app to those are all
useful things they only show a few apps
here right now but being Android they
can have anything that's a really
available on the store
right now so there's a ton of apps that
they can make available to drivers if I
go back to my main screen here I've got
my standard head unit features like the
stereo for example here's this audio
tile here and right now we're seeing an
F my screen this is just standard radio
stuff i look at my sources here i've got
USB ipod integration bluetooth streaming
even an hdmi input this is all stuff
it's going to be standard within this
how to connect system but the app
integration is really the exciting part
about this and the android operating
system just gives you so much
flexibility in that regards this new
honda connect system is going to be
available in the new honda crv and the
honda civic but only the European
versions for now this is a fairly major
hardware and software rollout so I would
expect Honda is going to roll these out
to other regions in the future but for
now we don't really have any information
about availability in the US I'm Wayne
Cunningham here at the 2014 paris motor
