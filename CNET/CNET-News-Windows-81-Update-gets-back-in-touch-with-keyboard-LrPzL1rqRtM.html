is a bunch of UI improvements we've made
to the mouse and keyboard experience of
Windows and I mentioned already that I
can boot straight to the desktop or
resume to the desktop but now I want to
talk about one of the most used area of
computing real estate in the universe
and that is the windows taskbar if you
are a Windows user that's been a Windows
user for a long time you probably have a
deep and intimate relationship with the
taskbar it's the way you think about
switching between apps or launching apps
and we've enhanced it significantly in
this update to work with new Windows
Store apps so you'll see down here i
have a few apps that are win32 apps and
then over here i have a bunch of taskbar
buttons for apps that are our store apps
so here is the facebook app and you'll
notice when i open it up right up here
at the top we show the title bar because
windows users that are that i have a
mouse and keyboard are incredibly
accustomed coming up here to choose
minimize and that now works in a modern
app i'll switch back here to facebook
again and you notice the taskbar was
displayed on the bottom as well so if i
moved down here to the bottom of the
screen the taskbar will pop up and i can
use that to switch between modern apps
there's mail there's facebook or i can
switch back to a win32 app like I ie the
desktop is brought up I no longer have
to think about a different switching
model for apps whether they are win32
desktop apps or modern and I want you to
keep in mind thank you
I want you to keep in mind that the work
that we've done to make touch grade is
unaffected by these changes if I were
holding a tablet in my hands being able
to swipe in from the left and do task
switching is convenient natural and
that's still present but it's no longer
required for my mouse and keyboard use
now similarly if I'm using a tablet when
I swipe in from the right with my thumb
it's handy to have the start button and
settings and search right there but that
was something that we wanted to fix for
mouse and keyboard users as well so
let's take a look at the start screen
when I go to the Start screen you'll
notice we've made a few changes here to
make it easy for mouse and keyboard
users to get to those functions so right
here we've put a PC settings tile in
because Windows 7 users expect to find
settings or control panel on start up
here we've added a power button and a
search button so those functions which
previously hung off your right thumb are
now easy to find on start the second
thing we've tried to do is not just make
it compatible so it's easy to learn but
get all of the new value live tiles in a
customizable Start screen to be more
familiar for Windows mouse and keyboard
users so we implemented a right-click
context menu that pops up in a familiar
way a way that all Mouse users have
grown to love and it makes it easy for
me to do things like resize a tile into
its large or small size and so on even
beyond that there are power user
commands that Windows users are familiar
with like holding down the control key
and selecting a bunch of app tiles and
then when I do that I can grab them all
and drag them around together I'll move
these tiles all to here and you can see
that set of three all moved or I can
choose a set and change them all to
small tile so I have a powerful and
quick way to interact with the Start
screen via the mouse ok now the last
thing i want to show is ways that we've
improved windows 8.1 via this update to
help users find your apps so i'm going
to come back to the desktop and i want
to point out here you might have noticed
and this is on all pc's that get the
windows 8.1 update we are pre pinning
the
Windows Store to the task bar so that
desktop mouse and keyboard users will
get will find the store much more
discoverable it's right there it's
always available and in fact I also want
to show you that this is a store update
that will be coming a little later we're
improving the store you I to be really
mouse and keyboard friendly and instead
of some of these functions being
off-screen handy if you have a touch
tablet but not so discoverable on a pc
with no touchscreen now it'll be much
easier for people to discover these
categories find recommended apps and so
on and so on so the store update as well
is going to become mouse and keyboard
friendly and that's something we'd like
you all to do with your apps we're going
to be providing samples for you and
doing right click menus and the kinds of
things that make your UI discoverable
and on screen for mouse and keyboard
users so that's the first change the
second change that we've done besides
making the store really visible is when
people are using their pc to do things
like searches we want your apps to be
present so here i am on the start and I
could like a click search or I could
just start typing and if I start start
to start typing something like pinball
you'll see right here we recognize there
are apps in the store that match we
serve them up to the user so finding a
nap and installing an app is incredibly
easy right there at the top of search I
could just click here to jump to the
store and install that and then the last
thing is that we've seen some people get
a little bit confused about where did
the appt go when i installed it an
installed app is no good if there's not
user engagement after the fact so you
see down here just as in Windows 7 we
added a prompt to show you where new
apps are installed and you see here that
new apps are highlighted in the all apps
list and of course I can just right
click on one and choose to pin it to my
Start screen or now pin it to my taskbar
so whether I'm a desktop mouse and
keyboard user or a tablet user focused
on touch I can find the apps I care
about I can make them accessible and
they work well in the modality that I
care most about so that is a quick look
at the windows 8.1 update the windows
8.1 update will be available to all
windows
8 and 8.1 users via windows update
starting april eighth next tuesday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
