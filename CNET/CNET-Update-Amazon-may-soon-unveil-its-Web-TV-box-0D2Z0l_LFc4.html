living room I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update amazon could soon
sell a streaming media box for
televisions according to a new report
from recode Amazon is gearing up to sell
a box in March that would stream online
video much like a Roku or Apple TV now
we've heard about Amazon working on such
a thing for a while now but we may
finally see it unveiled soon there have
also been reports about Amazon working
on a living room game system and it just
acquired a game publishing studio so it
makes sense that this box could stream
video and games we'll have to wait and
see YouTube has made a few changes to
its layout to make it easier to manage
playlists the desktop site will look
more like mobile apps for example there
is this three line icon next to the logo
that places subscriptions and playlist
options in the center of the screen and
playlists that you've liked or created
are in the guide personal playlists also
have a better editing screen everyone
may be buzzing about what's up but let's
not forget about blackberry messenger
the folks at blackberry want you to know
that they're still hip and they know
what's hot these days stickers that's
right the BBM app is launching sticker
packs to keep up with all the other
messaging apps that have been using
stickers for a while now these stickers
will be in the BBM shop some for sale
and others free Microsoft is pushing out
software updates for the Xbox one game
system but it's asking customers to test
the update for bugs before it releases
the changes to everyone Microsoft is
inviting a number of Xbox Live members
to preview these features and offer
feedback and they'll continue to be
testers for future updates Sprint is
beginning to improve network coverage
for subscribers by letting phones make
calls and send texts over a Wi-Fi
network right now only two android
phones will be able to do this the
samsung galaxy mega and the galaxy s4
now these phones will get software
updates automatically to enable the
service in the coming weeks and Sprint
will expand this Wi-Fi service to more
devices throughout the
year and to cap things off check out how
one company wants to make a selfie more
useful ticketleap is an app for creating
this selfie ticket it's an event ticket
that has your face on it and you get in
by showing that it's you on the ticket
instead of having someone scan a barcode
it's meant to be a fun way to be more
social at small community events
obviously this wouldn't work so well for
a huge concert or baseball game if you
want to create events that require
selfies for entry go to ticketleap calm
that your tech news update but you can
find more details at cnet com / update
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
