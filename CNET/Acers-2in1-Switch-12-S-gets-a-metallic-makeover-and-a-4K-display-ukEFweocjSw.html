a 2-1 hybrid that's a laptop and a
tablet when you need it to be you've
probably seen a few hybrid laptops but
asus which line does things a little
differently there are no buttons
depressed or latches to lock instead
you'll just pull powerful magnets keep
things in place that makes it really
easy to attach and say you want to pop
it around and try it in a different mode
this is a CS big disperse which yet
there's a 12.5 inch IPS display and you
can get it with a full HD 1080p with
screen or in some markets you can go all
the way up to 4k the switch 12 also
includes Thunderbolt 3 on us bc that's
one sport that will support thunderbolt
and USB c and mini DisplayPort so does a
whole bunch of jobs at once now the
older models in the aspire switch line
were made of plastic but this is made of
anodized aluminum and it feels really
good it's liked feels nice and sturdy
and it looks really sleek but you're
going to pay for that upgrade when it
arrives in February is going to start at
nine ninety-nine had ever seen it for
more and be sure to check out our full
CS company
