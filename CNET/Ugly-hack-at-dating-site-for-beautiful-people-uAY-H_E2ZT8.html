beautiful people have to worry about
getting hacked I'm Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update if you've ever been
denied entry into the elite dating site
beautifulpeople.com well it's time to be
grateful that you are rejected from the
shallow network because the personal
details of more than 1 million members
of beautiful people have been leaked
online that's according to a report from
Forbes the data breach you know what
wait hold on to report this story right
I need some appropriate background music
yeah that's better the data breach
appears to be from December and it's not
just your typical user names and emails
but also specific details on what these
people look like exact addresses income
education current employment mobile
phone numbers even if there is no
financial data in the leak all of this
info is gold for identity thieves
researchers work with Forbes and
verified that a number of these accounts
are real people the dating site released
a statement saying that anyone who
joined after july of last year was not
affected beautifulpeople.com is no
stranger to controversy the site often
brags about denying access to people
deemed too ugly to join and last year
the site announced it dumped more than
3,000 members for gaining weight or
looking old but before you laugh at the
pain of the genetically blessed the
Spotify users may also be dealing with
some hacking drama it's been reported
that hundreds of spotify account
usernames emails and passwords have been
leaked online that's according to
TechCrunch TechCrunch says it reached
out to some of these accounts and
verified that they are real but Spotify
denies it has been hacked and it told
CNET that its user records are secure
either way if you use Spotify it's a
good idea to change your username and
password and make sure that that
password and email combo isn't also used
to log in to other sites and as we
continue on today's theme of horrible
internet people twitter is doing more to
help users report abuse if someone is
harassing you on Twitter soon you can
attach multiple tweets in a single abuse
report so you don't have to waste time
reporting every single tweet twitter has
been criticized for not doing enough to
combat abusive users so here's another
baby step
that's all for this tech news roundup
you can head to cnet com for the latest
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
