splash or a fuss the hidden killer of
cars and toyota wages it's green tech
cred in a big game time to check the
tech EC cars differently we love them on
the road and under the hood but also
check the tech and are known for telling
it like it is ugly is included at no
extra cost the good the bad the bottom
line this is CNET on cars hello and
welcome to CNET on cars show all about
high-tech cars and modern driving i'm
brian cooling well I would say literally
millions of words have been written
about these guys the new Ford f-150 due
to its radical new aluminum structure
it's a little-bitty 2.7 liter engine
that's available and much better cabin
but it's time for the talk to stop we
got our chance to go not just on the
road but off the road in the 2015 f-150
Lord is dramatically recast the f-150 it
may be the biggest gamble you see a
major automaker take in your lifetime
are they thinking and why let's dig into
it as we drive the all-new 2015 f-150
and check the tip there are two big
stories going on in this vehicle that
come into the category of lightness it's
an aluminum truck by that they mean the
outer shell the body the cab the box
then there's the frame made of
high-strength steel this is a steel that
they get from their suppliers that is
particularly strong for weight that
means it can be pressed very thin in
places but it's not so much strength
through bolts now for it's likely gonna
have a lot of company in the aluminum
shed soon
in fact word is the next Jeep Wrangler
might make the switch as well
according to Ducker worldwide
consultancy by 2015 the average vehicle
in the US will have 394 pounds of
aluminum ten years later that will get
to almost 550 pounds what used to be a
rarity in big Jags and Audi's is now
looking like a fact of automotive life
they can do more work more efficiently
this is a game changer for full-size
pickups the bottom line is they've
shaved some 700 pounds of this vehicle
off from the last generation they've
gone so far as to even redo the logo on
the fender to express lightness by
hollowing out the F now adorning that
body are some interesting details on the
outside first of all they've got some
optional LED headlights for the first
time LED tail lights are also part of
blind spot technology because the radar
sensor is built into that red lens take
a look at how they've sculpted out the
door here they say they brought down the
Beltline a little bit so you can get
that truck pose even when the windows up
and then they really scoop it down here
to give you more visibility down around
the corners
of course I'm obsessed with the
technology under the hood and this is
the story there the 2.7 liter little
itty-bitty sort of EcoBoost v6 that's a
very small engine for a full-size pickup
what they're doing here is applying the
turbocharged direct-injection combo they
call it EcoBoost the numbers are pretty
impressive 325 horsepower 375 pound-feet
of torque turbo engines tend to be
torquing
now the mpg needs to be pretty good to
make the 2.7 engine worth having in the
line it does nineteen city 26 highway in
4x2 that's better than a similarly laid
out Ram tundra or Silverado powered by
gas now the towing capacity when you
have this engine is a little bit reduced
it's the lower end of their range at
8,500 pounds now if you think a 2.7
motor is too modern for your full-size
truck hang on Park Assist will be a ford
exclusive in this truck adaptive cruise
is also class exclusive there's forward
collision warning brake assist available
blind-spot cross traffic and lane keep
assist also spoken here 6-speed
automatic is your only choice across the
whole range and of course rear-wheel
drive base or you can buck up to
all-wheel drive let's call that
correctly four-wheel drive now some more
tech and engineering highlights or
around the back end of the f150 first of
all look at this piece of glass here on
the rear it's all one piece and they
just cut out the glass and reset it
against a gasket and they motorized it
this way it's not just slick looking it
also allows your heating coils to be
more continuous across the piece and do
a better job clearing your view now
coming around the rear nothing too
unusual about a rear camera on a truck
but this one's also hooked up to what
they call a trailer hitch assistance
gives you a special view on the main LCD
in the cabin lines up a dotted line
right to where you got to go to hit the
hitch to hits on the bump right here on
the key fob and you can do this little
trick brings down the tailgate with a
nice soft release on a hydraulic damper
now inside the f-150 my Ford touch
greets us I'm not going to go into that
we've seen it on many Ford vehicles it
basically carries over here but notice
what is not touchscreen lots of clusters
of related controls here that are big
and tangible here are the knobs and the
butt
for media below that the very large
knobs and buttons for climate which Ford
says they did intentionally after a lot
of research where folks said sometimes
functions get scattered all over the
cabin and they hate that similarly your
light controls are all down here in a
pod oh well next to your left nice what
you won't find here on the dash is a
bunch of replication of what's on the
center screen they found that a lot of
their f-150 buyers said why do I need it
in two places that are 12 inches apart
so over here you've got a physical
tacking speedo and then you've got a
bunch of virtual gauges for things like
engine oil pressure and temperature and
fuel level and then below that is a big
region that I would typically use for
what they call my view you can click
down through your favorite seven
displays chosen from dozens as I
mentioned all f-150s have a standard
six-speed automatic there's no variation
there on those vehicles it's a pretty
straightforward vertical gate that comes
down into manual shift mode and which is
handled by a rocker here on the side no
paddles and obviously a two in one
position rear view camera hops up and
looks pretty good it's pretty sharp and
available on these vehicles is a
surround view as well using front left
right and rear cams now the cabin is two
inches wider and they took that space
and as opposed to giving it to you here
they gave it to you here they put two
more inches in the center console that
leaves you with a pretty big boxes you
can put almost anything in hope my
laptop whole bunch of laptops and Ford
says they did something to control glare
in this vehicle they went through and
they said all right what do you want to
put in here designers in terms of shiny
stuff then they ran that through some
computer modeling probably some light
ray tracing to say what's going to glare
at the driver and changed it we
tediously go through every surface and
change the shape of it so you don't get
those big spots that glare they're
annoying as you drive
crazy to the autocrossing the truck with
the lighter platform nothing better than
that for a car that handles well as well
as is efficient you haven't driven a
full-size f150 lately you're thinking it
still drives like a truck well no it
doesn't actually it drives like a large
car now I got the two-seven here as you
know and I'm doing manual shifting in
this case but the power is really good
and responsive that's the thing you
might not expect in a car like this it's
very nimble and the engine is right
there where I want it which is what I
really wanted to find out
now I'm out here on ice kind of a simple
two lane country road let's open her up
and see how this 2.7 v6 does this is a
nice delivery of power driving this
thing around right now has just an
everyday vehicle this is a very
substantial engine it's got a nice note
to it do you hear that kinda gets down
there and snarl cars don't catch fire on
their own very often but those that do
have fire related defects tend to have
higher insurance claims even after a
recall has been issued in a moment why
fire-related auto defects are scary and
headline-grabbing
and the need to fix them should be real
obvious so why don't fire risk recalls
get owners full attention
well us car owners aren't real good
about bringing their cars in for recall
work hearing on average 65% of recalled
cars are ever brought in for the work
according to a Government Accounting
Office study of recalls from 2000 to
2008 wheels tires and brakes seem to get
customer's attention the most cruise
control seats and amazingly airbag
issues have lower compliance level
compare that to Germany where you can't
register a car that isn't up on its
recall repairs their compliance rate is
a hundred percent now a fire later
recalled they actually Center on
something like an electrical switch for
a hose clamp or a seal so don't try the
gas of a recall is serious it really
pays to double check if there are any
fire or other open recalls on your car
and tend to it because we also differ
from Germany in another useful way here
the car makers on the hook to pay for
the reef
welcome back to CNN on cars I'm Brian
coolie you're about to see a little
theme bubbling up in our show right now
that have major car makers putting the
crown jewels on the line now we saw a
bit of that with Ford
taking their backbone vehicle the f-150
and rather dramatically reinventing it
here at Toyota it's a little different
they're putting the reputation for green
visionary technology on the line as they
try to come up with what's next after
Prius they think it's the Mirai
fuel-cell vehicle which they believe is
the road to the future if your Toyota
your Prius is both a huge triumph and
kind of a nightmare
then set the bar really hot after you
did that and kind of change the auto
industry what do you do next they think
it's this this is called the Mirage
Japanese for future they tell me it is a
production hydrogen fuel cell vehicle at
a time when most people think hydrogen
fuel cell is either a yesterday's failed
experiment or distant tomorrow's
technological wish the moriah is
fascinating because it's a big bet being
made by the company with the most to
lose in terms of its cred as a
powertrain visionary let's tour the guts
of a Mirai now in the back you've got
not one but two hydrogen tanks one kind
of here around the axle line and one
under the rear seat those are filled at
10,000 psi with hydrogen gas that gets
down to a liquefied level but it's only
about five kilograms total weight of
hydrogen you'll put a lot in here notice
it's got a battery this is a hybrid but
it's an electric electric hybrid
sometimes the car will take this
hydrogen and run it through this fuel
cell stack right here I'll use that
directly to power the electric motor but
other times or at the same time it will
also create energy in the fuel cell
stack and send some into the battery for
storage while also driving the vehicle
that's why it's a hybrid of two kinds of
electricity the idea is to be able to
have a nice buffer and not create at all
on demand and then of course you've got
an electric motor with a power control
unit that is red
simply like other electric vehicles the
really interesting stuff is from
midships on that the simple version of a
fuel cell is that it takes in hydrogen
crosses plates and as that happens the
hydrogens electrons are coaxed off in
different directions which is where the
electronic flow is generated that
creates current at the final stage
hydrogen combines with available oxygen
to form h2o in the form of water vapour
enough water vapors produce that the
mariah has an h2o dump button that
empties out it's splatter if you will so
you can leave all that outside instead
of it puddling on your garage floor
notice you can also use this vehicle to
power other things like your home in an
emergency it's a weird little side angle
to this vehicle but there's a great big
high current port in the trunk so if you
were to have a power outage at your home
they will have accessories that will let
you break that out into household
current 120 AC 300 miles of range on a
fill three to five minutes to fill up
the tanks and no plugging in whatsoever
now in the market the key to the mariah
is actually not so much the Mirai as it
is Toyota's ability to sell a vision and
that turns on making hydrogen available
but they say less available than you
might think if every vehicle in the
state of California ran on hydrogen we
could meet refueling logistics with only
15% of the nearly 10,000 gas stations
that are currently operating in the
state based on the assumption that
owners would want to reach a refueling
station within six minutes of their home
or work okay what's a light driving this
advanced technology well as Twitter is
actually kind of proud to point out it's
sort of unremarkable if you've driven an
electric car before it doesn't feel that
much different that's really different
at all high torque very quiet the
occasional whine of motor and reduction
gears but it feels like any other
electric
what they were going for we don't want
this to be jarring or something have to
get used to other than the different way
you fuel it I'll say this though it does
feel torque e'er and generally more
powerful than a lot of other sort of mid
class electrics or plug-in hybrids I've
driven there's no lack of power or power
assist things like seat eaters and
heated wheel things you'd normally be
nervous about in the battery cargoes you
want to preserve that precious charge in
this car they point out the behavior
should be different because you'll be
able to charge readily if you can fill
it up at all in your area and then you
won't worry so much about being so
parsimonious with the bolts size of the
vehicle on the outside is kind of closer
to Camry than it is to Prius and notice
in the trunk you do not have folding
rear seats you do have a little bit of a
limited trunk space they're not bad but
there's some intrusion from where they
have mounted the twin hydrogen tanks now
if you're adjusting this to save money
sit down
sufficient hydrogen to cover say 300
miles will cost you around 50 bucks in a
Mirai you can do that same distance for
about $33 and a four cylinder gas Camry
that cost a lot less upfront and for
just $10 in a Nissan Leaf but with all
the charging stops it by taking days to
get there and as anybody's guess where
hydrogen prices would go
should there be widespread adoption
because we're nowhere near that
now saying Toyota wants this to be the
next bigger Prius is an apt statement
but the Prius required no changes in
infrastructure the world was already set
up for it if you will
the mariah arrives on a very different
stage okay the Mirai hits the US fall
2015
price will be around 50 75 that's steep
of course new technology look for about
thirteen thousand dollars in federal and
California credits the only state where
it's going to be sold initially later
they'll expand out to some northeast
markets they have to follow the
infrastructure of course but this is a
major stake by Toyota a vision not just
of a vehicle but of where they think
infrastructure can reasonably go and if
they're right this short circuits a lot
of the headaches that surround battery
electric today in a moment the costs of
going electric and cars that are good
choices to be your life see that on cars
returns
you
I'm in a DeLorean
and the doors open upwards and it's made
of stainless steel and it's one of the
coolest cars on the face of the planet
and it will forever be one the brakes
are terrible also we're doing 40 miles
an hour on the brakes come on come on
come on and still buy more from the ex
car team of CNET UK at cnet.com slash
welcome back to CNET on cars i'm brian
coulis time for some of your email this
one comes in this week from eric l who's
asking about evey maintenance he says I
would like to see some discussion about
the tech of car repair he writes it
occurs to me that the ownership costs of
some of these electric cars like a Tesla
may be considerably lower than that of a
conventional car and when you bring an
electric car to the shop what do they
look at well Eric I can generalize here
every Evy is going to be a little
different but first of all certain
things go away
Eevee's don't have oil filters or oil
changes no air filters no transmission
fluid changes or transmission filters to
deal with no belts to wear out no spark
plug wires to get A's and need
replacement a lot of things go away
got to be fair combustion engine cars
have made amazing strides lately in
reducing the frequency of servicing
those things as well so it's not quite
as stark as you might think
electric motors are the core of an Eevee
they have a reputation just generally in
industry as being incredibly tough and
long-lasting the planetary gearboxes
that move the power to the wheels and
adjust the RPM a little bit those are
kind of a mixed bag it will vary by make
and model of Eevee and none of them have
been on the road that long
tires are interesting because v's tend
to be rather heavy and have a ton of
torque so depending how soft and grippy
attire they spec those may wear out
rather quickly especially if they're on
the drive wheels but all EVs are heavy
and put a lot of weight on the tires
finally the brakes are interesting
consideration Eevee's do much of their
braking by electromagnetic regeneration
basically reversing the motor
electrically not so much putting pads on
discs so your brake wear costs should go
way down now in this show we took a look
at two cars that are turning the page on
new chapters and their manufacturers
history at f-150 and the Toyota Mirai
but a lot of you have asked about cars
that are kind of durable evergreens cars
that go incredible amounts of miles and
never seem to die they're really durable
ones so we've got a great top five list
for you the top five cars that are on
the road with incredibly high mileage
with the average age of cars on us roads
these days at a record 11 point four
years and climbing to nearly 12 years
old by 2019 we clearly no longer have a
problem with old cars here are the cars
you want to be in twelve years after the
purchase cars that seemingly run forever
according to data from our L pulp which
is the Bible of this sort of thing by
the way these are cars I'm taking out
trucks and big SUVs they tend to run
forever anyway and that's a separate
video number five the Nissan Maxima the
max can trace its roots back to the mid
70s but its father the Datsun 810 rather
godly roamed our streets by the time it
got the oddly Roman maxima name in 1980
it was one of the first Nissan's to use
any American parts namely from General
Motors number four is the Honda Odyssey
this is quite an achievement because the
Odyssey only dates back to 1994 but that
honda reliability has made up for lost
time in the market this is where
fold-flat rear seats were invented by
the way most recently Odysseys
innovations have veered off toward a
built in shop vac which I find oddly
wonderful number three the Toyota Avalon
I have a secret hunch that if you also
ranked cars by average owner age the
Avalon might be number one it had
old-school oddities for a Toyota like a
front bench seat and a column shifter
whose that aimed at however your
grandparents may have to now shop for a
used Crown Vic because the Avalon got
all sexed up last year duh be entombed
one number two is the Subaru Legacy
soubise parent company has roots in
buses train cars and garbage trucks
I don't believe they know how to make
something that breaks combine that with
the fact that sube buyers for whom
driving something old and worn just fits
the look and you have a tag team almost
surprised it doesn't add up to number
one except that would mean bumping the
Honda Accord are number one when the
Accord launched it was a sensation the
question for a year or two wasn't would
you be buying an Accord simply how much
you were willing to bribe the dealer to
allocate you won the Civic had already
established that you'd be getting one
tough ride only now with room and great
looks borrowed from the classic Scirocco
generation 1 damn making myself want one
by the way the Camry the best-selling
car ahead of the Accord and from the
company that most folks equate with
durability wouldn't quite make our list
it would come in at number 6 thanks for
