too real for some at this year's CES
large ships are kind of like Star
Destroyers he has a god dude riders
wearing samsung gear headsets were
tossed around in reality while they saw
a galactic Adventure in virtual reality
if you want to live out one of your Star
Wars fantasies to play holographic chess
hollow lamp projects a game onto a
surface which adjusts to your view by
using eye-tracking it allows you to see
the object as if it was in 3d on the
tabletop in front of you if you're
getting a little bleary-eyed from one
too many drinks the backtrack skin is a
wearable breathalyzer that constantly
monitors your blood alcohol level so you
know not just how drunk you are now but
how drunk you're getting and when you'll
be sober beauty is now in the eye of
smart mirrors at first glance this
mirror looks like a regular makeup
mirror but the high mirror is actually a
smart mirror and with one photograph can
analyze my skin everything from fine
lines to dark spots thesis red spots so
these are the symptom areas its marking
getting pumped up could mean using the
small active five puck in an app instead
of waits a few minutes i use it i did
get a pretty good pump and it was
actually fun and felt like a really good
challenge and apparently no one is too
young to have their own exercycle the
150 dollar fisher-price think and learn
a smart cycle is designed for three to
six year olds it connects via bluetooth
to tvs and tablets so kids can play
educational games while they're writing
