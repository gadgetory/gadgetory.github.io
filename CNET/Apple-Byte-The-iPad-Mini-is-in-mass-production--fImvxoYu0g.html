a bigger part in the apple byte well
yeah I mean look look at some of these
look somebody calmness they're great but
great there's like oh he's fantastic
he's my girl and they want to send more
of me okay yeah yeah you know what um
yeah let let's do that yeah really yeah
sure Jim all right great hey what's up
Brian song here and welcome to the apple
pie for all the good and bad inside the
world of Apple now we have a sweet good
to give away at the end of our show but
first to the stories now hot on the
heels of the iphone 5 the news is now
all about the ipad mini according to The
Wall Street Journal Apple has started
mass production of the new iPad Mini my
own sources confirm the same information
and Matt go to car reported earlier in
the week that Foxconn's facilities had
started production in Brazil it's also
where they shot that awesome scene in
Fast Five where they were like jumping
through these buildings of music no oh
that was sick all right guys now you
know these stories are true because
guess what even more leaked parts okay
now we know none of this is official but
website ukrainian iphone calm claims
these are more images of ipad mini parts
from factories in china featuring the
inside of an ipad mini back cover with a
headphone mini-jack that will still
remain on top and a sim card slot that's
been moved to a lower position the outer
part of the back cover appears to have
the same black anodized aluminum as the
iphone 5 sexy but sensitive now you can
also see this image that the purported
7.85 inch LCD display and the front
bezel of a white ipad mini as well that
match it with rumors from over a month
ago so when might we expect an
announcement well a report from the
apple to point o blog says invitations
for apple's mini event will be sent out
on october the 10th with the unveiling
to happen on october the 17th and the
ipad minis would then go on
sale on Friday November the second the
source a major investor translation a
really really rich guy who's trying to
drive up his stock now we're expecting
an announcement this year but if Apple
is selling the new four-inch screen ipod
touch with 32 gigs for 299 what are they
going to sell an ipad mini 4 299 349
even if the other competitors in the
7-inch space are 199 well we'll see and
you can be sure we'll be all over the
ipad mini news like stripes on zebra but
let's not forget about the iphone 5 now
a lot of you weren't really happy with
what i said last week for example
Matthew writes in with hey this is the
Apple bite why don't you just quit the
show or just call it the samsung bite go
buy a galaxy s3 already okay I think
I'll just quit now Elle's betch on
twitter says i want to cuss you out what
you say about the galaxy s3 we're team
iphone over here actually i'm team
edward now on a more positive unrelated
note and anonymous viewer writes in with
this after finding my ipod touch all wet
multiple times today I caught my
two-year-old licking the screen she
won't confess the learning to lick the
screen from you but since we watched the
Apple bite every week it is likely she
has picked up this behavior from you
mission accomplished alright guys Apple
biters see some of you guys get crazy
like way too crazy I didn't say the S 3
was the best phone that always comes
down to what you want in a phone not me
but it's absolutely really the most
innovative phone right now just deal
with it unfortunately it doesn't get any
better with the latest iphone 5 scandal
called purple gate this is where a
purple haze or purple flares appear when
you point the camera towards the Sun or
bright lights have you guys seen this
effect on your pictures well some
photography experts have speculated that
the new sapphire glass covering on the
iphone's camera might be the culprit can
we just throw a bad apple out already
now picture comparisons clearly show the
effect an apple had an official response
for one gizmodo reader recommending her
to angle the camera away from the bright
light source which implies that you
might be holding it wrong now Apple also
says the purple flare is considered
normal behavior for the
iphone 5s camera well at least I won't
have to use Instagram filters anymore
now you guys probably heard Apple CEO
Tim Cook made a public apology for
apples poor maps right after last week's
beatdown of a show from us so clearly he
watches the Apple bite I can't think of
a better reason of getting up in the
morning in cook statement he said Apple
was extremely sorry and even suggested
map alternatives to use until Apple gets
their Maps right now Apple even created
a section on their app store for them
some of you wrote in to try using bing
maps or mapquest alongside the other
alternatives we gave but in some good
news Street View is coming to the web
version of google maps by the time you
see this and you can use it on an iphone
or ipad at maps google com so we like
that all right guys let's take a break
to check out the app of the week you
guys have to check out a new game called
granny smith and it's just 99 cents it's
a fun racing side scroller where the
goal is to collect three apples and
coins time your jump so you land on your
feet by releasing the jump button at the
perfect time and then use your cane to
slide on Rails with all the coins you've
collected you can then use them to
upgrade granny smith with gadgets like
banana peels and baseballs see all the
things your grandma actually kept in her
pockets now the 3d graphics have this
cool wallace and gromit styling and it's
a refreshing new and unique game on iOS
devices so check it out and finally guys
let's do our giveaway if you guys have
an iphone 5 and you don't want it to get
all scratched up or beat up my good
friends expect are hooking you up the
Apple diners with their pixelskin HD and
fab shell cases for the iphone 5 now
these cases are hot right now now I
personally have a purple case because
it's my favorite color or because you
