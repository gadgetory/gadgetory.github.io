touchscreens case in point the LG
lfx25991st 24.6 ink it up with your
fridge and you'll be able to adjust
settings check the filter status and
even track the expiration dates of what
you're storing inside I like the energy
saving modes that automatically cut down
on usage during off-hours and I like
that the app will notify you if your kid
leaves the door open an integration with
the Google assistant lets you check the
status of the fridge using voice
commands which seems pretty ho-hum but
it's there if you want it with almost 28
cubic feet of total storage space you
should have more than enough room to
feed the whole family out of this thing
and the matte black finish does an
outstanding job at repelling
fingerprints - it's not an exciting
design by any stretch but it is
practical and modern looking and it
includes the sort of baseline features
that you'd expect from it like a
slide-in shelf and a temperature
adjustable pantry drawer now this won't
come as a surprise if you're a regular
fridge follower of mine but my biggest
problem with this refrigerator is that
door in door compartment a lot of folks
really like the feature but the problem
is that thin door in front and the extra
seam
both of those compromise performance
just take a look at this heat map these
are the average temperatures from a 72
hour test at the fridges default setting
and as you can see the entire door and
door compartment runs warm with orange
hot spots up above 40 degrees Fahrenheit
you've got a lot of options if this is
the kind of refrigerator that you're
looking for including models with better
smarts more unique features and
performance that isn't compromised by
gimmicky door and door compartment
my advice keep shopping
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
