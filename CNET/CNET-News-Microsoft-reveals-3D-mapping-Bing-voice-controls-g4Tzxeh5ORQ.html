we're going to take this 3d imagery all
the content we are treating and enable
it through a 3d control that you can
embed inside your applications I guess
that's what I'm showing you here today
okay so let me play with this low hmm
let's see if there are some hotels here
maybe I can you can go along their
hotels maybe I can go explore a little
bit before I go with it now this takes
the idea of going and visiting a city to
a whole new level you can see how
beautiful this imagery is this is built
using cameras that we have built
ourselves with some amazing optics this
is very very high resolution imagery you
can see all the details and these
details actually you know become really
interesting when you really think about
interacting with the real world you know
here's a beautiful building here meet
again Oh beautiful this and dollars and
basketball codes so you can see how you
know this is beautiful imagery can
actually provide a canvas for a whole
lot of interesting things so let's see
what are some interesting isn't that we
can do now you know one of the things
about the real world and especially
waiting to look at the real world in
this amazing way is that it really
starts begging the question that you
know I've had lots of questions I'm
going to visit the lens here I'm going
to visit some really beautiful
architecture some churches there and the
question it pops to your head hey who
designed this thing now normally a user
would have to change from this
application go to a browser type in
Valencia type in whatever little context
they can put in but reality is the user
is looking at your appt at a particular
object you know wouldn't it be nice if
they could just say who is the architect
folks what you see here is that we've
taken a whole lot of steps
we've taken a whole lot of steps away
from a user and we've you've allowed you
to create an unbounded amount of
knowledge right into your applications
because I could have asked a different
question which would have a gain bond to
the Bing platform and it would have
returned with an entity which best
relates to what you're looking at so so
let's let's keep going so I've decided
that Valencia is indeed a very nice
place so I'm going to visit it so I'm
gonna go ahead and add Valencia to my
itineraries now while I was stabbing at
the water cooler this friend of mine
said that they had some of the best food
when they were in Valencia I said well
that's great and what does he do he
reaches into his wallet and he gives me
a card now this is a little analog
artifact that he brought from Valencia
now if I go put this into my if I go and
put this into my wallet I'll probably
lose it a week later and I've definitely
will not find it when I'm in Valencia so
let's see if we can do something better
let me use some of the eyes
functionality in the Bing platform and
and scan this this part which I can then
use later so I go ahead and scan it
so using the OCR capability that is
available through the Bing controls you
can now scan the information which is
wonderful except that I don't speak
Spanish so let me see if I can do
something a little bit more interesting
great so now using
so now using the OCR capability Bing
platform and the translator capability
I've combined those two things and now
let me go ahead and save this later so
that pan am in Valencia I won't forget
it add this idea for dinner to my
itinerary great so now this information
which existed in an analog artifact is
now saved with my itinerary available
for me when I'm in Valencia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
