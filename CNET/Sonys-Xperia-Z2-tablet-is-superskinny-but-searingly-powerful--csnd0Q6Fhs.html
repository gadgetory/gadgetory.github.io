Sony Xperia z2 tablet a 10.1 inch
Android slade's measuring a ridiculous
six point four millimeters thick but it
still packs in some seriously powerful
tech pick versed to up and you'll
immediately be struck by how skinny this
thing actually is feels much more like
you're grabbing a thin pamphlet than a
tablet something helped by its
lightweight 10.1 inch display means it's
quite wide but that's made much worse by
having such huge bezels around the
screen
I mean sure why bezels give you
something to hold but this is just
needlessly wasted space that makes a
screen look all squashed in on the plus
side of the screen is bright crisp and
it has great colors and you can
customize the color balance if you
prefer things to look a bit warmer like
its predecessor the z2 tablet is
completely waterproof not only keeps it
safe from spilled drinks but it also
means you can happily prop it up in your
kitchen while cooking safe in the
knowledge that you can rinse it under
the tap when it inevitably gets covered
in sauce inside it's running a 2.3
gigahertz quad-core processor which gave
some excellent results in my benchmark
tests easily handle the high-definition
gaming and video streaming and
navigating around the Android 4.4.2
kitkat interface was a breeze sony has
squashed a six thousand milliamp an hour
battery into the skinny buddy which I
found to be something of a mixed bag on
the plus side it kept going on my video
drain test for over 12 hours putting it
right alongside the iPad air and the
downside to battery drained away quickly
in standby mode and it used so much
power when gaming but it lost charge
even when it was plugged in the drain
test shows that the battery is very
capable so I'm more tempted to blame the
software for the odd performance issues
fingers crossed this is something that
Sony can fix in a software update
although the battery is a slight concern
the Xperia z2 tablet is still a great
looking powerful slate if you're after a
10 inch tablet and don't fancy giving
Apple
or if you're just very clumsy around
water it's definitely worth checking out
I'm Andrew Hoff CNET and this is a Sony
