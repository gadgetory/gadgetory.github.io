we're here with the CEO of a began to
look at a new device you guys are
introducing to the market a little bit
later this year early next year ed tang
CEO a peg and we've got some a bit of a
jumble of wires here but it all leads up
to this what is this this is a it's a
new media platform that we're
introducing next year and one of the
core technologies that we developed at
alpha god is this revolutionary display
technology and it's called a virtual
retinal display and what's different
about a virtual retinal display versus
any other kind of display is that it
projects light directly in your eye
we're actually mimicking your natural
vision right because objects around us
nothing is emitting light nothing is
glowing light right everything we see
around us is reflected light and that's
why things just seem that much more real
vivid natural but most importantly
comfortable so from a hardware
standpoint how does it compared to
something like a traditional virtual
reality headset which hasn't been like
an LCD in front of your eyes right so
LCD panels like LCDs and old LEDs those
are all emissive light it's very
challenging to get emissive light to
look really really good and really
comfortable for for your eye and by
reflecting light in your eye is how we
can how we can mimic that natural vision
and we have a really really interesting
approach to addressing that issue and
what is that we're using we're using a
brand new micromirror technology here
now I know Google looked into technology
like this when they were developing
glass they ultimately went a different
path because they had some issues were
trying to get light to focus correctly
for a wide variety of people how have
you been able to address that my
co-founder is a brilliant brilliant
scientist and so he was able to have
some of the best optical design
resources now I think they're probably
some people would be a little bit
worried about something beaming and
image strictly under their eyes any
concern about eye strain no not at all
where previously people have tried using
lasers and that's that's inherently
there's some dangers to that we're not
using any lasers using a very very
low-power
light source and all this is simply
shining a really dim light on on some
years so from a consumer standpoint
what's the the main advantage of this
sort of technology over
LCD panel or something like that you get
a completely different level of realism
it's like looking at a TV of a picture
of the outside versus looking through a
window it's like that's kind of the
level of difference you see in image
quality and image realism you can stare
at it for hours you stare at it all day
and feels totally comfortable
unlike staring at a LCD screen where
your eyes get tired after an element so
inherently the resolution of this is
WXGA which is 1280 by 800 but what's
interesting is because of the way we
send light in your eye the perceived
resolution is incredibly high so when
you get a chance to see it you'll notice
that you don't see any pixelation any
screen no effect no gaps in the screen
the other interesting that point out is
not only is the resolution really high
but the framerate can be extremely high
I mean this prototype right now can run
240 frames a second mom and we were able
to push that up if we need to but would
you see this hitting the market maybe is
something like a competitor to the
oculus rift with that gaming style
applications or maybe more for in a
multimedia style 3d imagery applications
or we're focused on the on the media
standpoint right now there's a lot of
interest in oculus what they're doing
the virtual reality I think it's
fantastic they're trying to bring
virtual reality to the mass-market and
then the other end of the spectrum you
have something like Google glass were
they trying to give you that always
connected kind of glanceable display
right we're kind of targeting a
different market here we think that that
with the level of experience that we can
deliver here that there is something
really interesting and we're seeing a
lot of demand from consumers who want to
consume media and games so go ahead put
it on so what I would encourage you to
do is to close one eye and adjust the
focus so we can actually adjust the
spacing between your office here using
single image yeah laughs trouble yeah it
is so go ahead and hold on to that okay
here whenever you're ready I'm ready all
right here we go okay this is a screen
this display the image you're seeing is
being projected directly on your retina
you just get an image that is so much
more vivid and realistic but most of all
it's a very comfortable image as I've
spent a fair amount of time wearing the
oculus rift and even with the HD version
you can still see some you know some
amount of pixelization
and there's always a little bit of eye
strain
you know when you get adjusted right but
this is very very comfortable I mean the
device itself is perhaps not the most
comfortable thing for the family but in
terms of comfort for my I yeah it is
quite comfortable and yeah the
resolution is is quite good and the
color is quite good too I wish everybody
at home was able to see all right now I
have a new version or a different
version I guess we should say of
prototype here which adds head tracking
and slightly different design but the
big difference is this was got head
tracking stuck on the side here right
right yep it's a slightly different
prototype based on the same technology
we've we're always continually trying
out different sensors and different
adjustment mechanisms so there's just
another element that you can you can
experience alright let's try this guy
out ah so what you're seeing is a very
very low resolution video streaming off
the internet hmm so now again prototype
hardware when might we expect to see
something a little bit more finalized we
expect to have a consumer facing
prototype early in quarter 1x here maybe
see yes time to see us we'll see
let me great alright then thanks very
much for bring this by the pleasure I
can't wait to see the final version
again this is Tim Stevens checking out
the avocado prototype virtual retinal
display</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
