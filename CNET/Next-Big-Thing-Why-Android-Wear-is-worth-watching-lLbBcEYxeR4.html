Android that you wear we're right at the
beginning in the miniaturization of
technology you're gonna talk to your
wrist how tall Barack Obama it's finally
possible to make a powerful computer
small enough to wear comfortably all day
long Google's Android wear is a compact
version of that operating system that
really has to do three things run well
on new devices like smartwatches get
manufacturers to buy into that market
and get consumers to do the same thing
and who will pretty much delivered on
almost every rumor we predicted and
their full rollout of Android wear with
big time support coming out of the gates
with the LG G watch and Samsung's gear
live just one more top to pay and the
pizzas on its way the pretty gorgeous
stainless steel and leather banded watch
is here your watch will also provide
intelligent answers to smokin questions
he can even check his heart rate after a
jog now Android wear on its own actually
does very little a SmartWatch running it
like a samsung gear live or an LG G
watch has to first pair to a late-model
android phone no windows phone no i
phone support here once that pairing is
done your watch starts to get fed the
content it needs for some very simple
notifications and basic interactions
like reminders of your next appointment
or simple guidance to get somewhere like
your next appointment messages and easy
ways to reply weather forecast coming up
payment confirmations travel status
updates now these are just some basic
early use cases and of course an Android
where's functionality is limited only to
what developers can come up with which
isn't much of a limitation at all but
know that the mode here is to have very
simple swipe and voice interactions
between menus and information screens
there's no keyboard on that watch now
the first watch is out with Android
where are the predictably nerdy Samsung
gear live and LG G watch more
interesting is the pending Motorola 360
this is a watch with a round face and a
very jewelry like look Android wear is
able to map it
display an interface to the actual round
display not just crudely crop it that's
important because many like myself
believe that a key part of Smart Watch
success on any platform is going to be
the ability for watch designers to
really spread out aesthetically and not
be limited to square textile displays
another big step forward with Android
wear is a degree of agnosticism in the
past most smartwatches short past I
should point out only worked with their
own family of phones early Samsung Smart
Watch has only worked with Samsung
Galaxy phones and not even all of those
that's not a formula for success going
forward Android wear will allow the
watch to work with any Android phone
running 4.3 of the operating system or
newer but still no windows phone iphone
or blackberry coordination it's early
days of course for the SmartWatch is not
to mention the Android wear subset of
them that said here's my memo to the
Android wear team as well as the
manufacturers building on it first make
it smarter right now we feel the early
Android wear watches are kind of giving
scattershot display of information and
content it doesn't really seem to map to
my moment in the day as well as it could
let's filter better make it
indispensable this is still very much a
luxury market nobody can't live without
an Android wear SmartWatch let's find
the really important use cases so it
goes beyond the novelty stage we need to
extend battery life we all have enough
devices right now that to get plugged in
every day and look like jewelry once you
get past that first million geeks and
early adopters nobody's going to buy a
SmartWatch that looks like they strapped
a smartphone on their wrist it is of
course too soon to predict the growth
curve for android wear let alone the
broader SmartWatch market for a number
of reasons first of all Apple hasn't
even entered this space yet secondly
most consumers have no idea what we're
talking about thirdly the battle between
fitness bands and smartwatches has to be
sorted out and there is an awful lot of
overlap there but for now at this moment
android wear seems to be the biggest
bear in a small growing and have to be
chained</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
