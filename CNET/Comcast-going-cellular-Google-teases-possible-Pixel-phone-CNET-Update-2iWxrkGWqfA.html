giant announced that the company is
launching a comcast mobile network by
mid-2017 but there's a twist comcast
network runs on the verizon wireless
network you see it's designed to depend
on the 15 million xfinity Wi-Fi hotspots
across the nation and when there's no
hot spot it's going to jump to verizon's
network some hot spots are public such
as at the park but other hotspots are
actually customer routers inside
people's homes so Comcast's network is
really made of its own customers routers
with verizon filling in the spaces
between comcast CEO Brian Roberts
announced the plan at an investor
conference as reported by The Wall
Street Journal but Roberts did not
discuss pricing or any other details
such as where it will roll out first and
speaking of mobile google is expected to
unveil its new phone in two weeks at an
October fourth event google teased the
news in this tweet with a video where
the search bar turns into the shape of a
phone a phone that's drawn with a thin
line perhaps align the width of a pixel
because all reports indicate Google is
going to call it a pixel phone instead
of a nexus in fact the blog android
police posted some leaked images of what
could be the new pixel phones made by
HTC we'll know for sure when the event
starts at nine a.m. Pacific on the 4th
but if you are looking for something
more basic perhaps you're interested in
Microsoft's brand new nokia feature
phone it's the Nokia 216 it's a very
basic phone probably the last Nokia
phone to come from microsoft says it did
sell the nokia feature phone division to
a foxconn subsidiary and hey it has a
headphone jack that's it for this tech
