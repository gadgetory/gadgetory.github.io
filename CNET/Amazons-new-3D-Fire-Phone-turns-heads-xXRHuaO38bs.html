Amazon's first foray into smartphones
and with it they take on 3d and an
interesting feature that lets you scan
the world around you
I'm Jessica Dahl Court for CNN and I'm
going to take you on a very quick tour
but first the specs the phone has a 4.7
inch 720p HD resolution it's a little
bit less than some of the phones that
we're seeing today but then again the
phone is smaller too Amazon said it was
really important for them to create a
phone that you could hold and operate in
one hand if you don't have bigger pots
so far I find that this is true and some
of the gestures and movements that
Amazon has also built into this phone to
help along with that but we'll get to
those later the phone is black and it
has a very slightly rubberized rim that
runs all the way around it I found that
this was good for gripping there's
Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and the
back so it creates a nice a slick
surface that is actually warm to the
touch because it's been held for quite a
while it does pick up smudges but it
also increases the premium look and feel
a little bit but the phone wouldn't jump
off the shelf for its build quality but
when you look closely you see that there
is a little bit of an attention to
detail so I don't look at it and think
luxury you'll notice that there are five
cameras on the very front of the phone
and one home button now the cameras are
here for motion detection actually
tracks the distance between your head
and the device and also figures out
where you're looking so that creates a
3d effect only one of these cameras is
actually going to be used to take
selfies and that is the one slightly
off-center just to the right of the
speaker grille on the top now the home
button has three functions first of all
it takes you to the home screen slash
carousel and that you can use to
navigate around some top level apps
these are purely optional and
customizable you can unpin them if you
want to remove the home button also
opens up the app grid where you can look
at the apps that you have on the device
and also those that are stored in the
cloud and these kind of move to when you
tilt the phone
and lastly if you press and hold you
will get a voice assistant this is based
on the same technology as the one found
on Amazon fire TV it is not run by
Google there is a Google element however
and that is that the OS is based on
Android it's completely forked so you
can't get into Google Play you have to
use Amazon's apps there are 240 thousand
of those as of today it is based on an
Android jelly bean but it does pull in
some of the memory compression found in
KitKat and this is the Amazon fire OS
version 3.5 on the vacuum have a 13
megapixel camera with optical image
stabilization there's an LED flash as
well on the side next to the volume
controls you have a dual function button
press it once to launch the camera you
can press it again to take a picture if
you press and hold the button that is
the feature that will scan the world
around you it will identify music a URL
and open a page there's an optical
character recognition so you can scan a
poster with a phone number or business
card and be able to capture the business
part it will also scan barcodes or if
you just hold up a common object it will
identify that as well
under the hood you've got a 2.2
gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
800 processor so that's pretty fast 2
gigabytes of RAM and here as well
battery life is 2400 milliamp hours and
there is a promised
video playback time of 11 hours now
let's take a closer look as a 3d feature
Amazon is calling this dynamic
perspective and it shows up in a couple
different ways so first of all a
lockscreen image is deep and rich and if
you move it around you can kind of look
into the background a little bit so it
looks like you're there
second of all with mapping when you zoom
in on a location if you tilt the phone
you can sort of see the street name
around it and identify some of the
features of landmark in our case the
Space Needle since we're in Seattle if
you're on the web browser you can also
tilt the phone up and down in order to
scroll some other motions include
flicking your wrist to the right or to
the left to pull out additional menus
and turning it even further to see a sub
context menu now all of these are custom
sizeable and controllable in the
settings of course the phone does also
tie into all of Amazon's own software
and services and you will get Amazon
Prime for a year
I'm Jessica velcro for CNN this has been
