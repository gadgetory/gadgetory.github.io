worth to you in a dishwasher
that's a question you might want to ask
yourself if you're considering this $900
LG model because it's not nearly as good
of a cleaner as the very similar $1200
LG now this $900 LG is still pretty good
it scored a 69 point six percent average
on our really rigorous cleaning tests it
also has a lot of features especially
considering it costs less than a
thousand it has a third rack for
silverware and small items it has a dual
control cycle that lets you use a heavy
spray on the bottom rack and a lighter
spray for fine china on the top rack it
has a upper rack that raises and lowers
so you can fit tall glasses almost all
the tines fold down for a $900
dishwasher it's pretty well rounded now
all those features are present on that
$1200 LG dishwasher as well but I'm
giving this one more credit for him
because it costs less but I also found a
lot of things about that $1200 LG
annoying and those are still here too
and I really don't like how the bottom
of the upper rack herbs and flows it
makes it impossible for even standard
dishes to fit securely and there's no
Express cycle the closest this
dishwasher comes to that is the quick
and dry cycle which still takes more
than an hour that $1200 LG makes up for
all those annoyances with really amazing
performance it scored over a 90% in our
tests this one doesn't quite do that we
regularly found missed spots on
silverware in between dishes it tends to
redeposit pieces of spinach and jilly
all over the place and it's particularly
bad at water marks those white splotchy
things it leaves them all over the
glasses in the silverware if you can
spend a little more or wait for an
opportune the $1200 LG over this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
