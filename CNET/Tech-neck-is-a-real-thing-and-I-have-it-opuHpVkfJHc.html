but don't worry it actually felt good I
found myself in this position because I
spent too much time in this position
years of crunching up and hunching
forward while using computers has given
me tech neck yeah tech neck I know it
sounds ridiculous but it is a real thing
and apparently I'm a classic case I'm
dr. McKenzie Hubert and I'm the
chiropractor at Manhattan total health
her adjustments are helping get my neck
back in shape because it's currently the
wrong shape x-rays confirmed that years
of bad posture changed the curvature of
my spine putting extra strain on my
vertebrae and it left me with upper back
pain that wouldn't go away your head has
gone forward which is called forward
head carriage which is an effect of
Technic or a cause of Technic you know
and it happens over time this doesn't
happen you know over a week or two using
a phone this is years so why does a
little hunch cause so much strain your
head normally weighs about 10 pounds
like this bowling ball
you know how the further out you hold
the ball the heavier and heavier it
feels and you have to work harder to
keep it up while just bending your neck
down 45 degrees is like holding up a 50
pound head but this doesn't have to be
your story there are easy things you can
do to prevent Teknik start by changing
how you hold your phone stand up
straight and try to keep your arms to
your sides and hold your phone like
you're a t-rex now there's less reason
to bend your head forward of course it's
good to sit up straight at your desk and
you can be better about it by getting
those feet flat on the floor and put
your elbows to your sides and the top of
your monitor should be at your eye level
and the monitor should be an arm's
length distance away from you you can
counter the strain by bending your head
back and look up it also helps to
stretch your arms back squeeze your
shoulder blades and roll those shoulders
pressing your head back into your hand
is another nice stretch but if stretches
aren't enough be sure to talk to a
doctor and get professional help it's
what I needed to feel better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
