and 8 plus come in product red now but
not the iPhone 10 I actually been
playing around with one and I wanted to
take you through what it was like to
unbox so here's the full unboxing and a
comparison with a lot of products
including some of their apples
we compared against a lot of red
products before and we're gonna do the
same thing this time comparing it
against other red products and an Apple
product so let's go
got a little opening tool we're gonna
open this up red iPhone logo on the side
I'm gonna cut into that and oh there's a
plug a plastic tab so I didn't have to
cut into it at all you don't have to cut
into it let's just get that plastic
stuff out of the way this is a 256
gigabyte iPhone 8 plus open it up get
rid of that tool thing and opening it up
here's the instructions or a hint of red
we'll save that for later and there's
the iPhone and already you can see a
difference it's black on the front not
white last year there's white previously
was white this time it's a black front
with red and a very glossy red this is
glass back and fingerprint magnet but I
like the color the sides are aluminum
which matches last year's iPhone 7 plus
but getting to the charger it's white
and the ear pods are also white there's
nothing else red in here
white lightning cable but kind of cool
if it was all red but nothing else
heading in there as far as we can tell
and but that stuff off to the side let's
just go back to the iPhone so pick it up
turn over and carefully take off the
plastic there we go in the back and the
front that is the most fingerprint free
you will ever see this phone unless you
carry a cleaning cloth or something so
turn it over
there's the sides there's the back and
it's very bright like a cherry red in
this light but it does change tones
depending on where you are when I looked
at it previously it was almost like a
dark blood-red but these aluminum sides
are exactly the same tone as the
aluminum backed iPhone 7 plus product
red so there you go turn it on
while that starts up let's open up what
came with it there is the product red
slip and it says on there a portion of
your purchase will go towards the Global
Fund for HIV and AIDS doesn't say how
much but a portion and there's the
instructions always good to have
standard issue fine print and white
Apple stickers not read so there you go
and there's the phone starting up and
the thing surprising there I you know
it's it's a red iPhone so that's that's
exactly what you expect well let's
compare it to some other things for
perspective last year's iPhone 7 plus is
a different type of phone it's a metal
back phone and the color sometimes looks
exactly the same
and Simon looks pretty different so here
it's glossy again like cherry red and
the iPhone 7 plus product red has a
shimmery type of metal back so a little
bit different I like the new color
compared to last year's but they're both
again almost from this distance they
sometimes look the same but you can see
as you turn them a little bit different
last year's was less of a fingerprint
magnet so there is that and they both
have the exact same size I mean the
seven plus and the eight plus are
physically nearly the same phone in
dimensions and there's the white and the
black I prefer the black it just creates
a a cleaner look overall you're less
aware of the bezel too so that's a
comparison to both phones turn them over
get another look at them home buttons no
face ID or anything and there's no
iPhone 10 in product red this year so oh
well I mean maybe there'll be one in the
future
they do have an iPhone 10 product red
case I'll show you in a moment
let's compare it to this red glass Vaz
that I have here uh you know who knows
what color red that is so it's not you
know an easy color comparison but it's
it's a bright red and that's bright red
as well how about the C net logo I've
got it on my laptop and on the MacBook
Air holding it up and I mean this is a
sticker applied on but the C net logo
looks a little more orange the Apple one
is definitely the iPhone eight plus is
deeper red again much more like a cherry
red so what other things last.fm frisbee
there we go that's red and also still
looks like orange compared to the
product red it's a really red red if you
like really red Reds like sports car red
that's that's where you're gonna get
with this phone put it off this side so
what else is really really red fire
extinguisher that's that's really red
actually that's the closest match that's
a good match that's basically so it's a
fire engine red is another way to
describe product red so there I'd say
I'd say the extinguisher is the closest
match so far if you look at those two
fire extinguishers not as glossy okay
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons starter kit let me
roll that thing out of the way I'm sure
you got one of those Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons
kits lying around or maybe you don't
that's an orange box though compared to
the product red very different Reds
there so fYI red tumbler I get a pizza
parlor that's a good darker red also its
translucent and finally the iPhone 10
Leather Folio this is the new product
red one and just move that tube out of
the way alright
there we go now it's funny because this
is a very different read there's like a
brick red and holding it next to the
iPhone 8 it looks like Brown so it's a
little bit odd but keep in mind there
are other red iPhone 10 cases that Apple
makes and there are other red cases that
other companies make and you can also
get other red cases for other iPhones
that you have or if you put a different
color case on the back of your product
red phone it won't look red so there's a
lot of ways that keep in mind that
product red is not a is not always gonna
be visible in fact I would love for the
product red to be visible on the front
and back of the phone maybe at some
point they'll do that why don't they do
that is this lipstick red I don't know
and there are a lot of lipsticks but I
did get there are more cosmetics russet
so I'm just curious
you can you can judge that yourself I'm
