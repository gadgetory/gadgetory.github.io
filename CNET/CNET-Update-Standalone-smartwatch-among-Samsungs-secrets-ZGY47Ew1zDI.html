secrets of Samsung I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update in the world of
technology reporting much news is made
from rumors about products that don't
yet exist thanks to the ever helpful
anonymous source well in the past few
days many Samsung secrets have been
spilling out seven secrets to be exact
let's start with a new SmartWatch The
Wall Street Journal is reporting that
Samsung has another SmartWatch up its
sleeve even though it just released
three brand-new smartwatches
in April this new version will not
require you to pair it with a phone it's
a standalone device that will have its
own SIM card and it couldn't be unveiled
in just a few months Samsung is also
reportedly working on its own 3d gaming
face goggles it would be similar to the
oculus rift
that's a virtual reality headset made by
a company that Facebook recently
acquired for two billion dollars
Engadget reports that this thing would
strap on your head and you were
connected to a phone or a tablet to play
a game and that could arrive before
Sony's version of its virtual reality
headset that's called project Morpheus
now this may not be the only head tech
that Samsung's working on mystery
product number three is a Google glass
type headpiece the guardian spotted a
Samsung trademark application in Korea
for something called gear blink and it
says it's for wearable computer
accessories and software that records
health conditions last October Samsung
filed a design patent for eyewear that
connects to a smartphone and that same
month it was awarded a patent for a
headset called sports glasses you add
all that up and we may see something new
to wear on our face it may even use this
gadget to help us type on a virtual
keyboard there's another patent for a
device that projects a keyboard on your
hands to type but I have a feeling it'll
be a while before we get an answer to
that mystery there have been teases to
more normal products including a new
tablet Samsung invited press to tab into
color at
event on June 12th it seems to be
hinting at a new version of the Galaxy
Tab tablet and one thing Samsung loves
to do is make many versions of its
popular Galaxy S smartphone and there
are reports and photos of one spin-off
called the galaxy s5 prime it could have
really fast download speeds but it may
just be sold in Korea a spin-off that
will likely go on sale in more places is
something called the Galaxy s5 active
it's the s5 sporty sister and proof of
its existence comes from videos uploaded
by TK tech news that your tech news
update you can find more details at
cnet.com from our studios in New York
