duty in real life this might be the next
best thing
blasting away with pistols rifles and
grenades in an augmented reality arena
it's called recoil and it's a lot like
laser tag if laser tag were invented in
2017 you drop your smartphone into a
blaster plug in a pair of headphones and
you'll be able to keep track of your
health objectives and even hear enemy
gunfire that doesn't actually exist the
basic technology is the same as it was
in the 80s these guns fire invisible
beams of infrared light but everything
else is way more sophisticated using
Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth these guns
communicate their position and heading
to a portable base station which shares
it with other players the guns are big
beefy plastic toys with strong force
feedback so you'll know when you're
shooting and when you've enhanced each
has three infrared hit detectors on the
front and sides and push-to-talk voice
change you just smack this button to
reload the weapon the game supports up
to 16 players and even people without
guns can play you just download the app
and you can run around healing teammates
placing land mines and launching
airstrikes to assist the other players
and it's a good thing you don't need the
guns because these toys don't come cheap
a starter kit with two pistols and a
base station will cost 130 dollars this
August you can expect to pay 50 for each
extra pistol 80 per rifle and 15 for a
grenade speaking of which you might want
that rifle the extra accuracy and ammo
make a big difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
