by graphic designers and video editors
but the release of Windows 8 really gave
Logitech an opportunity to use the
center button as a touch-sensitive strip
that really lets you navigate around
your computer using simple swipes of
your finger I'm Justin U and this is a
first look at the Logitech T 400 mouse
logitech offers the t 400 in red blue
purple black and pattern colors to match
your Windows 8 device so this is a
really logical buying decision if you
recently purchased a Microsoft Surface 2
tablet in terms of fit we found that the
low profile design is kind of
uncomfortable to use for long periods of
time and can be even worse if you have
bigger hands so the sides of the mouse
are wrapped in rubber to give your
fingers a place to rest while you hold
on to it and left-handed users will be
happy to hear that the mouse actually
works in either hand underneath you'll
find a couple tracking strips and a
power button to help you save battery
life it uses two double-a batteries and
the Logitech tells us it should last
about eighteen months of use even if you
don't power it off between uses there's
also a place inside the battery slot to
store the USB receiver that you're going
to need to pair this with your computer
it's one of Logitech's unifying
receivers that lets you connect up to
six peripherals using a single dongle
but the most obvious difference between
the T 400 and other mice is this center
button which is actually a glass touch
strip that gives you Windows 8 users a
versatile shortcut to things like
four-way directional scrolling back and
forth browser navigation taking you back
to the Start screen and more that's
obviously too small to use things like
pinch to zoom so if you're into that
feature a lot you can check out a
dedicated touchpad accessory like the
logitech t6 50 so you can check out all
the details in my full review on CNET
but that's going to do it for this video
I'm Justin you you just took a first
look at the Logitech T 400 touch Mouse
for Windows 8 thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
