with your style the echo look is
official it's got all the features and
Amazon echo has except that it also has
a depth sensing camera with an LED flash
it can take photos and videos of your
outfit of the day and a feature called
style check combines machine learning
and human fashion specialists to compare
two outfits and suggest which one looks
best on you while it seems like a silly
idea the fashion industry is big
business a July 2016 digital retailer
report shows Amazon with a huge lead on
other online shops like Macy's and
Nordstrom the company has been
purchasing fashion retailers like Zappos
comm and making its own private label
clothing the McKinsey global fashion
index estimates the fashion industry's
worth at about two point four trillion
dollars globally so the echo look could
become incredibly valuable to Amazon if
it can gather a large group of users
willing to share their clothes shopping
data the echo look isn't quite for sale
just yet much like the original echo
Amazon is taking requests for
invitations to purchase the device it'll
cost you $200 when it's available about
20 bucks more than a full size echo if
you want to try out style check before
committing to the echo look you can if
you're using an iPhone it's in the iOS
Amazon apps programs and feature section
amazon says echo look will continue to
evolve in add alexis skills just like a
standard echo so time will tell on
whether this is a device everyone wants
in their home or if it's just a niche
