you will not die the DC extended
University this shared movie universe
with Superman Batman Wonder Woman and
the rest has had its share of ups and
downs today let's be optimistic and
explain why the DC EU is not going away
at number five slowing down in 2014
Warner Brothers said it would release at
least 10 DC EU films as well as
standalone Batman and Superman movies
the press release outlines 2016 through
2020 let's take a look at that list
starting at 2017 Wonder Woman 2017 check
justice leave Part 1 2017 well there was
one the flash for 2018 pushed back to
2020 or later Aquaman in 2018 yep
released in December Shazam 2019 still
on the schedule
Justice League part to 2019 not on the
schedule there has definitely been a
shift in the DC film universe instead of
hazily putting out movies there is time
to pick up talent like James Gunn to
helm Suicide Squad to a more cautious
approach could allow for higher quality
movies what an idea
coming in at number 4 is Aquaman I was
skeptical about the Aquaman movie the
character has been described as West
Thor which is somewhat accurate the film
itself was dumb at times but pretty
decent as far as I'm concerned the
Aquaman movie did not feel like it was
trying to respond to fan backlash it was
a story about Aquaman it was relatively
self-contained shocking I know this felt
like a slow and steady approach to
rehabbing the DC EU image and number
three Joker
while this movie does not share ties to
the current DC movie universe I think it
will drum up more interest in DC movies
people will still associate this Joaquin
Phoenix Joker with DC's Batman even with
no connection to Ben Affleck on top of
that should Joker be a success this
could set up a whole other set of events
Disney did an interconnected movie
universe very well with Marvel maybe
Warner's trick is fully embracing an
Elseworlds label force films and try
everything
and anything superman Rhett's on anyone
and number two is access Warner Media
owns all the rights to DC Comics
characters and those rights are not
going anywhere
Warner can slow down production because
it is not going to lose the film rights
history lesson before it's Disney days
Marvel was dying to raise money it sold
off the movie rights to its characters
to various studios Sony got spider-man
Fox picked up x-men and the Fantastic
Four Universal grab the Hulk yeah DC
does not have this problem it just has
other problems and the number one reason
that DC EU will survive is crisis on
Infinite Earths if you don't know much
about DC Comics let me explain the
company has a history of rebooting its
comics universe on the regular with
events like crisis on Infinite Earths
crisis took all of DC's different earths
and merge them all down all it takes is
one crisis in the movies to realign
everything we've got variants of lots of
characters existing in movies and
television a crisis level event could
fix the whole thing by cherry-picking
the best parts of the DC Universe and
just killing off the bad need to recast
Superman and Batman but want to keep
Wonder Woman and Aquaman no problem I
think a crisis event could work for all
of DC's properties could it coincide
with the our vs. crossover this year
maybe do you think DC's extended
universe will survive or is it doomed
let us know Amaya's Akhtar I'll see you
