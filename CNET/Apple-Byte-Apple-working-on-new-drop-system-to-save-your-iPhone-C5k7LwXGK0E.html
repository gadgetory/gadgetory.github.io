another episode of the Apple buy where
no animals were harmed during the
recording of this show it's all the good
and bad so let's get to it and while
many of you were eating Thanksgiving
turkey the Japanese magazine Mac fan was
busy publishing an article with the
purported schematics of the iPad pro or
what they're referring to as the iPad
air plus you can even take a look at
this mock-up comparison video by
canoopsy to give you an idea of the
measurements and sizing now Mac van
claims the device will have a 12-point
two inch LCD screen it will be seven
millimeters thick in a 12 by 8 point 7
inch form factor powered by a next-gen a
9 processor and 4 built-in speakers on
the edges for stereo sound with a
targeted launch between April and June
of 2015
Japanese publication Macko Takara said
Mac vans claims aligned with the same
Intel they have collected as well so
really now the great debate should be
should we call it the iPad pro or the
iPad air plus or how about this why
don't you guys come up with the next
great name for the big screen iPad and
tweet me at brian tong with the hashtag
next ipad name this should be fun and I
will put my favorites in next week's
show and know no one is going to steal
my maxi pad name from two years ago
that's mine alright we're expected to
see whatever Apple has cooked up for the
next Apple TV in 2015 but in the
meantime streaming media boxes and
sticks are gaining popularity especially
this year and the market is quickly
changing now according to a parks
associate report in 2013 Roku was the
runaway leader with 46 percent of the
market and Apple had 26 percent but the
first nine months of 2014 has shown a
dramatic shift with new cheaper
alternatives so check this out Roku is
still number one and now makes up 29%
Google's chromecast has moved into
second place with 20 percent of the
market and Apple has dropped a third at
17 percent so far this year with both
Apple and Roku losing market share
thanks to the chromecast and Amazon's
fire TV stick now in a cool to admit the
report also says 50% of all video
that US consumers watch on TV is now
from streaming devices so an ala carte
service for your favorite stations can't
come soon enough
alright in the Apple patent world the
big a was recently awarded a patent for
a futuristic iPhone protection system
that will recognize when a phone is
dropped calculate its point of impact
and then shift its center of gravity to
avoid hitting sensitive components think
of this as the neo from the matrix of
iPhones you know he's like dodging
bullets on the fly like ah oh my gosh
the iPhone Neal that's the name of the
next iPhone it's genius this patent
discovered by Apple Insider is pretty
amazing so when your phone is falling
the protective mechanism described as a
motor with an eccentric mass is able to
impart force on a falling iPhones
rotational axis causing it to land on
its back side or side instead of on a
corner or directly on the screen oops
now we won't know if or when this will
be a feature but this is just some
pretty cool stuff all right Steve Jobs
may be gone but his swagger lives on in
a 10-year lawsuit that's finally going
to trial over whether Apple violated
antitrust law by exclusively allowing
the iPad to only be accessed by iTunes
and preventing other companies like
RealPlayer from selling songs or loading
music onto Apple's music player now
according to a videotaped deposition in
2011 before Jobs passed on SJ was asked
if he had heard of real networks the
company Apple had blocked Steve Jobs
replied do they still exist and that's
what we call swagger now real networks
is seeking over 350 million dollars in
damages okay the Apple Store puts some
pretty cool things on the shelf from
time to time and for the holidays they
are now selling iPhone app enabled
Christmas lights from lumen play now
check this promo out it looks so fun and
amazing look how happy everyone is you
can jump on beds or swim in a training
pool by yourself with these lights so
it's 12 Christmas lights on a 12 foot
cable and you
have to at least get one starter kit
that has the hardware to talk to your
phone for the price of $79
yes plus an additional 12-foot strand
with 12 lights cost 59 bucks so uh I
don't know how much eggnog they think
we've been drinking like I love the idea
behind these but I can get 24 feet and
25 multicolored lights from Target for
$11.99 now I'm not gonna hate on anyone
who buys these for their home or their
training pool but there should be a
warning on the promo ad that looks like
this warning you'll need to have obscene
amounts of money to be spending so much
damn money on your Christmas lights just
so you can control them on your iPad in
2014 you know what actually I don't
think I'm alone here yeah I'm in the
giving mood this week and this gets a
bad apple
you've missed that haven't you alright
that's gonna do it for this week's show
keep emailing me at the Apple bita
cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong we're
collecting another viewer feedback show
and we want to hear what you don't like
about the Apple byte yes we're always
looking for improvements and you can't
see my face thanks so much for watching
and we'll catch you all next time for
another bite of the Apple
I think I got my swagger back I think I
got my swagger back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
