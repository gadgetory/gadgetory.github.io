headphones every single set of
headphones on this list costs less than
$100 in fact you can buy all five for
around 230 bucks let's get to it at
number 5 for the Skullcandy Inked
wireless headphones they may look cheap
but the sound quality was well-balanced
for a pair of headphones and can be
found for under 50 bucks the Inc
Wireless is also very lightweight the
controls with their big buttons are
found on the left side of the collar the
Inc Wireless also worked well as a
headset if you feel like making phone
calls you weirdo who makes phone calls
number 4 the eye frogs impulsive duo
these cost around 45 dollars they are
lightweight and have dual drivers for
some decent sound the duo features a
unique design with a hub that clips onto
your shirts the hub is where you'll find
all the controls the clip can also be
used to wrap your headphones around the
eye frogs impulse duo are sweat
resistant if you want to wear them in
the gym that brings us to the creative
soundblaster jam let's talk about the
elephant in the room right away those
looks you can call the design retro if
you want but I think they look hideous
but looks aren't everything the creative
soundblaster damn man even that name
sounds retro can be found for around 40
bucks and delivers a good sound for the
price its lightweight and comfortable
and has NFC so you can tap to pair it
with certain devices number two is the
Plantronics backbeat 500 these are the
most expensive headphones on this top 5
costing around $80 the sound quality is
very good for the price and the backbeat
500 should get around 18 hours of
battery life if you're not blasting the
volume the backbeat is going after the
beats market the beats solo 3 Wireless
cost somewhere in the neighborhood of
$200 the Plantronics backbeat also has a
separate button to easily access Siri or
Google's assistant coming in at number 1
is the anchor sound buds slim I own a
pair of these actually they feel pretty
sturdy with metal housings and are
comfortable the earbuds are magnetic so
you can wear the headphones like a
necklace when you're not listening to
music play pause and volume buttons are
on the inline remote that's all so
you'll find the microphone and a
charging port you're supposed to get
around 7 hours of usage on a charge if
you
listen at a moderate volume the sound
quality is good but not great however
that's very pretty give a bowl because
these costs are not $25.00 thanks to
David Carnot for his help on this top
five

know I'm always looking for a good pair
