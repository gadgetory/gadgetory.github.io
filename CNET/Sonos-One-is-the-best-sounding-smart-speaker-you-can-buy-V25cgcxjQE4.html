especially at the budget level the
soonest one is a breakthrough product
it's the first time a company has
produced a smart speaker or in other
words a speaker with a voice assistant
on board that actually sounds really
good and the best bit is that you aren't
stuck with just using Amazon Alexa in
2018 the speaker will also be compatible
with Google assistant offering users
real choice music sounds great - maybe a
little closed or dark for lovers of
classical or folk but excellent for rock
pop and dance the one is the same size
price and shape as the existing play one
but it offers both better sound as well
as the inbuilt microphones onboard the
one is not interchangeable with the play
one though as it has been completely
redesigned which means unfortunately you
can't pair it with play one to play in
stereo you'll need another one to do
that at the moment saying Alexa
activates the microphone and you can use
it as a regular smart speaker it does
pretty much everything an echo can do
ask it for the weather turn off the
lights or whatever you want Alexa is it
going to rain today you can ask it to
play a song and it will play however at
launch it doesn't support Spotify and it
defaults to Amazon music instead the
good news is that the speaker supports
Spotify Connect as well as 80 different
streaming services via the Sonos multi
room app if you've been waiting for
smart speakers to actually get good then
the time has arrived the soonest one
maybe uncharacteristically rough around
the edges right now but will no doubt
improve dramatically over time
nevertheless the soonest one should be
the number one choice for music lovers
who want to buy a smart speaker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
