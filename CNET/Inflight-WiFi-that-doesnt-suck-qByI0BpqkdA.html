the air I don't know if you can hear me
but it looks pretty clear everyone knows
in-flight Wi-Fi usually sucks but this
plane lets you watch YouTube without
tearing your hair out
it's got fast satellite internet and it
works whether you're on the ground or a
cruising altitude bonus so one of the
biggest problem with in-flight Wi-Fi
making FaceTime calls or video chat
usually it's pretty slow with the
air-to-ground system so we're going to
try it out with satellite and see how we
go Brian Tom calling me come in
Brian Tom can you hear me hello hello
it's like I'm on a Boeing 757 test plane
with Honeywell's in-flight Wi-Fi and on
average my download speed is around 30
megabits per second it slows down when
more people jump on the network but I
can still stream multiple videos at the
same time this aircraft has an antenna
on the roof that connects to the
satellite network and Internet is
delivered to you through a regular
router and it works over water unlike
air to ground systems that use cell
towers for the signal this Wi-Fi
connection is also used by pilots in the
cockpit but not for watching Netflix so
what this app allows pilots to do is to
be able to get up to date weather
information in the cockpit during the
flight the connected radar helps the
plane understand which turbulence is by
talking to systems on other planes apps
also let pilots use less fuel by showing
an optimum flight path over 25 airlines
are installing the honeywell jet wave
hardware that powers this faster Wi-Fi
including Lufthansa Singapore Airlines
and Qatar Airways in the US expect to
see planes with this tack within two
years airlines will ultimately control
the system but even if you're not
getting the maximum bandwidth it's still
so much better than watching a buffering
