who love video games right there's
hundreds of millions yeah hello no
comment all right
games consoles are the way that gamers
have been enjoying games for years and
years and years now but is the era of
the console at an end with me is a man
who doesn't think so it's Rob crossly
from CNET sister site GameSpot Rob you
think that game consoles are not going
anywhere I slightly disagree tell me to
start with games consoles why are they
staying aren't we done aren't we done no
absolutely not done at all there is a
audience of gamers who absolutely adore
the stuff and they've been going going
on for 20-30 years nearly four years now
these are people who will pay 50 pounds
50 dollars for a premium video game ok
these are people that love Lee against
these are people that talk about video
games and there are quite a few few
million of these people ok there's tens
of millions of these people and and and
their passion for video games have not
them has not diminished if anything has
become more intense in Internet age as
you could probably have probably seen oh
yeah yeah mm-hmm so these people if you
have an audience that love video games
and if that audience is huge ok the
audience might have shrunk just slightly
but if you have that audience then you
have a business and so consoles are
going to carry on absolutely but looking
at the most recent generation of
consoles so you sue your Wii U and the
Xbox one ps4 Q
the sort of surprise from industry
onlookers when all of these games
consoles were announced had like a CD
drive for example whereas it felt like
we aren't we sort of at the point where
actually do we really need like a CD
drive and then you start thinking well
hang on actually sort of if if
everything sort of downloaded to even
like really need a like a box could we
not just have like a hard drive with a
PSN subscription or something like
that I don't like it feels like the
constant the role of the console is just
sort of being eroded and eroded and I
think maybe these boxes that sit under
our televisions soon they'll be gone
okay
consoles have definitely become media
centers certainly in the case of
Playstations lines and in case of Xbox
line Xbox is the line of consoles
they're becoming media hubs but
nevertheless you know grand theft auto 5
in launched in 2013 we released last
year and this year
that's the best-selling solace video
game of all time so there's still a
massive audience for these games yeah
definitely but is there a massive
audience for them so in the way that
we're getting them at the moment because
you're right like this of that's the
interesting point about retailers but
but you said that's what disks is sort
of hanging on in there and you're right
and compared to other mediums like if
you look at music what's happening with
Spotify and like Apple which is expected
to launch a streaming service if you
look at TV and the rise of like Netflix
and things like HBO's
streaming service if it doesn't it feel
a little bit like the video game
industry you know which was once a sort
of pioneer of the of the digital medium
is is slightly behind because of these
big chunky boxy things full of bits of
electricity and components enough that
it feels it feels a bit cluttering Oh
well I'll tell you something that there
was a service called online and that
that was announced in 2009 okay yeah I
remember yeah pre Netflix pre I hate for
you go free Spotify yeah and this was an
idea of streaming games yes people's
households yeah about any wires and what
you explained it didn't do too well and
that's because yeah video games I mean a
song is 2 Meg or something like that and
a video game is 50 gigabytes streaming
an interactive form of media which is 50
gigabytes is not easy and it's going to
take a long time before it's feasible
there's PlayStation now right now that's
a place not PlayStation now right now
but is it service called PlayStation now
and that's Sony's game streaming service
yeah it's not doing too well it's kind
of it's not doing so great they're not
putting the thrusters behind it they're
not fully backing it because people
because when you stream a video game
we just doesn't work at the moment the
technology is not there the internet is
not ready for it basically right so yes
games are a bit archaic in terms of
their software delivery as you say but
that's the Internet's full and then the
other games it's the the theoretical
speed or the Internet's full okay I'm
all right but when you talk about
technical limitations like that I think
there's an argument to be made that
consoles generally are just not as
profitable as they could be in fact I
think that generally the whole sort of
console idea it's sort of a mug's game
really like it so yeah I don't really
know why Microsoft and Sony giant tech
behemoths that they are but persisted
with this console idea for so long
because it when when the generation
changes look at like let's say that
let's sort of I don't know this is going
to be controversial but let's say that
Microsoft was pretty much the company
that was on top of things in that within
the last console generation right with
the Xbox 360 he had a lead it had so
many Xbox fans when I think of all of
the fans that a sort of loyal customers
that Microsoft much of must have lost
because it stuck to this weird sort of
rigmarole cycling through the hardware
thing where it released a console at the
same time at like they all release
consoles at the same time and it's just
basically saying to your customers like
look here's on it here's our next thing
here's what everyone else is doing as
well it's a chance to hop off what the
sort of games you're absolutely right
I'll make sure that you're winning and
if you look at the companies that are
making you know the most money in in
today's tech world it's companies like
Apple and Google and it they're
companies that lock you into an
ecosystem like you know like Netflix or
something you know you're sort of you're
in and you in suddenly you find you
can't get out because you spent so much
money and like soft and and Sony both
have those ecosystems set up so I don't
know why they are giving their customers
a chance to hop off the bus that is an
excellent point thank you and you've got
me at my most nervous right now because
that isn't really however you're still
wrong okay good because you're at sea
right and everything and happy with
Nintendo every single time they release
the console apart from the Wii every
time they released a new console lesson
less customers a chance to drop off as
you say yeah you don't trap them in the
ecosystem mmm
but but this is an inevitability
consoles do you need to look better
consoles do you need to upgrade overtime
and and the the by product of a concept
grading is new excitement amongst that
massive group of gamers if you have new
hardware you have new possibilities new
games new visuals and people being
excited again alright well that is what
we think about games consoles but what
do you think do they have a future or is
it time to call an end to the days of
the games console let me know and stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
