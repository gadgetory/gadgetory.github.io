was a drastically different affair from
last year no high flying stunts and no
new device announcements the highlight
was a surprise rare appearance by CEO
Larry Page who sounded hoarse due to
strained vocal cords oh we should be
building great things that don't exist
page was preceded by a parade of Google
executives trotting out the tech giant's
latest creations among them at ten
dollar a month streaming music service
to compete with the likes of Spotify and
Pandora so this is radio without rules
the song keeps playing but in the
background all access has made us a
never-ending mix of related tracks now
for curious about what's coming up we
can swipe to take a little peek ahead
but more importantly we can tap on the
playlist icon and see in detail
everything that's coming up a redesigned
Google+ was unveiled with a look and
feel reminiscent of Pinterest this new
stream is about design and depth and
today we're introducing related hashtags
what we'll do is we'll analyze the
content of a post and Google will put on
the appropriate hashtag new photo
features to enhance and edit your images
were introduced one which Google humbly
called Auto awesome creates short
animations from a series of photos taken
in quick bursts sharing photos may be
less of a chore thanks to a tool that
selects highlights from a larger batch
of images so if you go on vacation to
Thailand it'll take out things that are
overexposed and under exposed and blurry
and it will filter in photos that you
want to see so people that you have
affinity for your family or your friends
google also demonstrated a simpler way
to search on desktops using your voice
and a new hot wording feature that
anticipates your query ok Google show me
pictures of the santa cruz boardwalk
they're taking on Apple in Syria in a
really big way and what they're doing
behind the scenes is really connecting
together things like voice social
mapping across all of the services we're
going to see much much more of that it
wasn't a flashy conference but the new
tools announced may offer more substance
getting users the information they want
when they want it in San Francisco I'm
