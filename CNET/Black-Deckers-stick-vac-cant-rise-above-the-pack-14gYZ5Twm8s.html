I'm taking a look at the Black &amp;amp; Decker
36 volt lithium stick vac with aura
technology it's alright alright I
suppose a few more details would be
pertinent this is a mediocre stick
vacuum there's not a whole lot that's
terrible about it there's not a whole
lot that's great about it it's a little
bit over priced at $300 not disastrously
so but $300 is a lot to pay for
something that's mediocre so in terms of
optimized run time the battery life here
runs about 20 minutes again that's fine
not bad not great it does keep suction
wall from beginning to end but with good
cordless backs that's becoming more and
more calm Black &amp;amp; Decker does have a
handy little display here of LEDs
showing you how much battery you have
and you know dipping as you get closer
to empty so you know when it's time to
recharge but recharging from empty takes
a long four hours out of the box it's
easy to assemble again it stands on its
own and yet it's light and maneuverable
I kind of thought it'd be a nice
combination of being sturdy like an
upright while still having that ease of
maneuverability of a stick but it
certainly does not have the power of an
upright you'll definitely want to look
elsewhere for deep cleaning your carpets
it's as well with large particles and
because it's light it'll do fine for a
spot cleaning but it gets pettier
completely tangled meaning the links and
the motor head actually cream this in
terms of performance keeping it in the
middle of the pack in terms of stick
vacuums let alone upright performance so
I can't recommend the Black &amp;amp; Decker 36
volt lithium-ion stick vac with aura
technology over the hundred and eighty
dollar Hoover Linx but the machine isn't
a disaster it's
it's alright for more check out my full
