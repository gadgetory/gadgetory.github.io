buy you know what we do it's everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and the iPad pro is here like I have it
right here
and it's glorious like look let me show
you right here this is big as my face
said it's that big all right now as per
request by some of you I will not make
out with it and even if I did it's so
big now that's what she said yeah you
wouldn't even be able to see it happen
so I'm gonna spend a good amount of time
with it in my review from someone who
actually paid for it with their own
money is coming in next week's show also
I still need an extended quality time
with the Apple pencil and the smart
Keyboard but you might ask Brian you
just bought the iPad pro you're right
but see Apple decided to make the pencil
and keyboard available a week later even
if you pre-ordered instead of holding
off and selling the iPad pro and the
pencil and the smart Keyboard case at
the same time the pencil is this iPads
biggest differentiator
it's the showcase feature and you can't
even buy one on day one that's just
stupid and you know what that's a bad
apple and yes my voice just cracked but
sure there's bad but the best thing
about this iPad and no it's not the fact
that the Apple pencil is waited to roll
on its side with the word pencil facing
up seriously now this guy delivers
notebook level performance with its a 9
X chip that's even faster than the
current 12-inch MacBook gretna with an
Intel Core M dual processor it still
falls short of 2015 Broadwell or skylake
based machines but it's GPU performance
is ridiculous
while performing a 2015 15 inch retina
MacBook Pro in addition to other Mac
books and all the iPads this thing ain't
the iPad pro this thing is the iPad
Beast
cook told The Telegraph the iPad pro is
a replacement for a notebook or desktop
for many many people they will start
using it and conclude they no longer
need to use anything else other than
their phones come on Tim I'm sorry
even the hardcore fanboys know you're
drinking a little bit too much of the
kool-aid now it still doesn't seem like
this is a device that will be able to
replace my own laptop but like I said
I'll give it a go see apples even
promising big things from this with a
new TV ad in fact they're promising the
universe with the iPad pro oh this is
sweet tip of the day don't get stuck in
someone's iPad all right since we're on
the topic of the iPad and buying new
goodies from the store if you had to
guess what do you think the lowest rated
product on Apple's online store is gonna
give you a moment to think about it okay
well it's actually two things you were
correct if you said Apple's lightning
the USB cable with over 1,000 one-star
reviews all of my original ones were
destroyed and the other apples MagSafe
power adapter with over 1,000 one-star
reviews of its own arguably the two
least durable products from Cupertino
that continuously fray are the rubber
coating breaks or just stops working
it's been this way for years and it's
pretty clear all 1000 plus have you
already through your own bad apples at
them but I'll just pile on here
all right Apple released their latest
software updates for developers
the second TV OS 9.2 beta for the Apple
TV is out now and the third betas for
iOS 9.2 and OS 10 point 11 point 2 Apple
music is also now finally available on
Android on the Google Play Store
membership still cost $9.99 a month but
this could be a nice addition for a mix
Apple and Android
hold with the $14.99 family plan believe
it or not those families do exist and
the Steve Jobs movie yes that one is now
officially a complete bomb in box
offices it's so bad that Universal has
pulled the movie from over 2,000 screens
projections from its debut weekend were
between 15 and 19 million dollars and up
to this point it just earned over 16
million now it unfortunately shared the
same fate as the 80s cartoon reboot for
Jem and the Holograms that was also
pulled from over 2,000 screens by
Universal and I never thought I'd have
jam and Steve Jobs in the same story
like ever and to end things on a good
note you've got to check out this
awesome customization from the people at
color where if you ever wanted a retro
80s iPhone 6's check out this color job
with the beige coloring fake air vents
and that signature Apple rainbow logo
now the phone's just sold out they made
only 25 units for $15.99 a pop that's
1599 for you guys who think you're cool
but only think you're cool because you
have one and no one else thinks you're
cool all right that's gonna do it for
this week's show you can send me your
questions and comments to the Apple byte
at cnn.com or tweet me at Brian Tong
thanks so much for watching it will
catch all next week for another bite of
the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
