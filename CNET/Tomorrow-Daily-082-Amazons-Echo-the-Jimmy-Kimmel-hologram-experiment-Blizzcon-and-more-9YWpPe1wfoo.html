surprise product called echo but will
you use it jimmy kimmel found a way to
host two different shows at the same
time on different sides of the United
States no planes involved that's crazy
to it also a high-tech ballet shoe might
pave the way for better high-performance
athletes okay but really Jimmy Kimmel on
both coasts with a hologram in in the
conservatory with a candlestick it's
tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I got a
clue referencing yeah that's exciting
professor Mustard Colonel Colonel
Mustard professor plum our Clues on my
favorite games as a kid so I'm your host
Ashley skeletron amis always kill
anonymous that's a really boring game as
a kid oh I loved it I love logic that's
right you were yeah you're as awareness
super duper nerdy in like a really great
way a super weird kid um alright so
we're just gonna jump right in because
this has been a really weird kind of day
for technology but in a good way like
just weird so let's hit the headlines so
this morning amazon announced a surprise
product that nobody was really expecting
kind of came out of nowhere called echo
and I mean we've seen Kindle Fire we've
seen their tablets their fire phone
which didn't sell very well but now
we're seeing this sort of new product
which I find terribly fascinating and
I'm dying to know if you guys are
interested in this this is echo and and
if you're just listening it is what
looks like a tube in a Pringles can it
looks like a Pringles can and it's
actually about the size of a Pringles
can its nine and a half almost nine and
a half inches tall it is a
voice-activated cloud-connected speaker
woohoo so it's a 360-degree speaker
which is cool listen music on it could
push music from your phone to the device
but the real cool thing about echo is as
I mentioned it is cloud connected and
voice activated so if you use the word
Alexa it alerts the echo to the fact
that you were talking to it and it will
answer questions for you do things for
you that you would request so for
example in this video we see many
different use cases of this family the
guy is like hey you know the alarm goes
off and he says it's Saturday and then
she does Alexa what day is it and she
says it's Thursday so till then he gets
up so here's the the dad and the family
pushing music over to the to the device
but you can ask it a bunch of questions
you can ask it I in the video they ask
oh how do you spell cantaloupe Alexa you
can do Wikipedia entries I know he asks
how tall is Mount ever
in this video music streaming shopping
list so if you say add this to my
shopping list echo will add that to your
shopping list which is pretty cool it's
it's not out yet I but will be very soon
it's a hundred ninety-nine bucks to buy
but if you're a prime member and here's
the crazy thing nope you're a prime
member yes you had a hundred dollars off
you get it for dining dollars 99 bucks
you can but you it's invitation only to
buy it so you have to request an
invitation to buy it they want to see I
guarantee this as a test bed it's like
how popular it's gonna be people will
buy how many people by Georgia I think
after the I think they got a little too
confident with the fire phone and it
didn't really sell that well so now I
think they're taking a more conservative
approach to getting these products out
but yeah so 99 bucks for Prime members
and really like for a prime member this
is sort of the this is sort of a thing
that you might want and I foresee in the
future and this is my prediction that if
this sells very well we are going to see
the ability to say Alexa ship me
wreck-it Ralph on blu-ray and then it
automatically orders it from your Amazon
account ships into your house like you
don't have to even deal with amazon oh
that's dangerous it is very dangerous or
or maybe it's just add blah blah to my
cart and then the next time you open it
on your phone you can then check out
this is the coolest tech that Amazon's
had since like what the kindle fire or
whatever right yeah i think this is
really interesting I I know that a lot
of people will probably be nervous
though about the fact that it's always
listening so it's always listening for
you to activate it like so it still has
to be listening even though you haven't
activated it with the term Alexa but
it's very similar to like Siri google
now like okay Google yeah it's ok Google
but it's always listening for that ok
Google so that's I think that's the
thing that people are still may be
regular consumers might be a little
nervous about I do like conspiracy
theorists yes we have to get ready hey
Alexis listening to you like Alexa
shipped me at tin foil hat make a tin
foil hat um fluoride in the water come
on it's I mean it's a trade awesome $100
hundred bucks so that's 10 I thought it
was really fascinating I think this
really competes with a lot of the the
little hundred dollars sort of speakers
that you see definitely yeah there's I'd
like to hear the sound test
sure yeah and it's three but it's 350 or
360 degree sound and you're going to be
able to also use streaming services they
have a few streaming services like
iHeartRadio signed up for this so you
can say like subs you know Alexa play
rock music is what they do in the video
and then she just starts playing Rockies
cool so that's kind of neat 100 bucks
yeah back secure if your Prime member I
mean here's the thing if you're not a
prime member what is it it's like 100
bucks now to be a prime member so you
pay that you'd pay full price but you
get a free prime membership you should
be a prime number anyway yeah after
night when you're born they give you a
prime member that's pretty true yeah I
think now if you're born in an Amazon
Fulfillment facility you get a free
lifetime sometimes you get dry under
there yeah sometimes people just have
babies in there it's weird they don't
ever let them out ah tell me about Jimmy
Kimmel okay so some really cool tech was
used on Jimmy Kimmel Live and basically
it was hologram have you seen that Tupac
hologram and who hasn't seen Tupac as a
hologram yeah but they went they took it
to the next level because not only did
the first level was they projected him
to Nashville okay for this is Nashville
yes oh look there is he can popped up
like magic he's uploaded he's just it's
just him standing and he looks it looks
perfect at this was at the cma theater
um and he even brought on Guillermo his
sidekick well you gotta have a Guillermo
as a sidekick so this is while he's
hosting his live show here in Los
Angeles here on channels and then they
says in Nashville and then during his
show later on his show they projected
some they projected a band that was at
CMA to his theater that as well as crazy
Musgraves where he interviewed her on
stage see here's his stage in Los
Angeles and all the other people were in
Nashville that's the outdoor stage yes
Andy the other way this is all done by
hologram USA there look oh whoa look
there's Kacey Musgraves all her legs um
so much legs so yeah so this is this I
love hologram technology they've done it
with the gorillas at i think it was
american music awards it's always really
fun obviously they're goofing around
with it in this video but there's they
want to do some some interesting things
they want to get dead celebrities in
music
and stuff like that protect them onto
stage for concerts for like 90 minute
concerts I'd like to lock I feel like I
heard about this when they were saying
something about wanting to get the
rights as hologram us a company one of
the rights like Frank Sinatra and stuff
and they wanted to do these like sort of
specials where they were like 90 minute
sort of things that people could either
watch or like they could attend that
would be like like Elvis and stuff
that's crazy I'm so skeptical skeptical
of all I'm so skeptical if I would do
that I don't know if you guys are
watching in the comments would you do
that and who would it be for no that's
that's that is in fact the hashtag of
the day it is hashtag TD dead Hollow
yeah and this question is what dead
celebrity would you want to see
resurrected via hologram who would it be
for me oh gosh um I would say well it's
really hard I think I'd want to see the
Beatles performing but with a live Paul
McCartney and Ringo but then you have
George Harrison yeah I mine was also
mine was also Beatles or Jimi Hendrix Oh
Hendrix or uh yeah just anybody from
that era on it Jim Crow she ever see Joe
Pesci wow that's that's a really weird
that's a crazy reference I like they
pulled that one out Janis Joplin that's
well that's a good one she's going crazy
oh this Elvis would be good there's like
so many really great oh you could see
you watch you know there are there a
little chains you could see you can see
oh just not disturbed what's the 10
drowning pool's drowning pool we could
bring back drying pull you guys they can
perform that one song and they just lime
we could bring back sublime a blind
you're gonna have Roman yeah Oh nirvana
oh we could see we could finally have a
real David role would be on the drums
yeah well I mean they still at pat's
mirin and Chris Chris Nova see like
they're so around they're playing with
food fighters they're coming out again
Kirko just gotta have made Kurt back
that's really awesome that's really cool
so that's your hashtag of the day
hashtag TD dead Hollow she's your head
later she did I say Jim could I liked
hey I had a clue reference so now we're
even okay all right our third story
today is I found very interesting I
don't necessarily go to the ballet very
often but I saw this video and I thought
it was pretty neat this is I know it is
a shame I'm so uncultured this is called
eat race
and so here is a ballerina and she's
putting on some point shoes and this
this technology allows the dancer to
track their movements through visual
translation so what's happening is it is
it works with lily pad Arduino
technology so this video that they made
is a little bit more of an artistic sort
of representation of what you would be
seeing but you can see in the video like
this the swoops of like her movement so
what it does is it uses Arduino you
attach it to the pointe shoes so here's
the here's the technology where it's in
the shoe already or use your own shoes I
believe these ones are I think there are
costs either custom-made or like the the
ribbon is custom-made like so it's sewn
in like you can't just like pop it on
there but it is generally I would
imagine you could convert a pair of
pointe shoes to these so it sends that
data as the dancer moves around it
tracks pressure and movement and then
translates that data into pictures and
then the dancer can export that image as
a video those images as a video so you
can see exactly where your feet are your
positioning where you're putting your
weight things like that for me I saw
this and I thought that it would be
really awesome for athletes if anything
that involves very intricate footwork
this would be a really cool thing to
sort of find out like hey like for
example I had ACL surgery when I was 16
I blew out my ACL because I wasn't
landing on both feet at the same time
and for me like I would have loved to
have known I was that I was doing that
so that I could have stopped doing that
but the thing is is like this is really
cool and for me it there are a lot of
doors that could open for professional
athletes dancers people who are learning
to dance so maybe it's like oh hey like
here's a comparison of your Foxtrot or
whatever to a professional dancers
Foxtrot and you can see where your
mistakes are what's different about
their steps versus yours so I just
thought that was really neat yeah
perfect your your craft yeah perfed k
leavin finally perfect your electric
slide I got that in the moonwalk so down
again I gotta get that I go get that
good yeah oh and uh
Joe oh who doesn't love my repertoire is
really well that's broad that's pretty
broad that's pretty big I'm all over the
men good yeah but yeah so that's our
third news story we will be right back
we're going to take a quick break we'll
be right back with another round of into
it having to do with this this
delightful little friend here and and
then of course your user feedback and
our phone tog refer the day so don't
look away it's tomorrow daily welcome
back welcome back to the show it's
tomorrow daily every week on Thursday
before we release you out into the world
to be miscreants or whatever it is that
you're doing they love being this
currency yeah I mean I guess we did too
to be fair um but every week before we
do that we like to tell you guys what we
as individuals are obsessing about and
so this is into it okay audience what do
you what are you into this week okay
what can people check out this is an
oldie but it's a goodie and I've known
about it since YouTube I really like DIY
channels and i really like channels
where people show you how to do things
for less than I like that that are like
you know a oh look I want to bust
through a wall but I'm not I don't you
know I don't have Hollywood budget right
this is called Indy mogul now it is now
a dead Channel but they have a back
catalogue that goes for like three years
forever and they basically teach you as
a novice filmmaker an indie filmmaker
how to do some stuff that you couldn't
otherwise do so you teach you how to use
like pipes or you know specific lenses
and just basically really anything they
just got to make props they teach you
how to use your camera better just a ton
of stuff anything you would want to do
with special effects horror films again
like the the busts through the wall but
one of my favorite segments that they do
is they're like okay so let's say we
want to build like a laser gun like a
prop laser gun they have this this wheel
and it's like a challenge thing they
spin it and it lands on a specific price
la prices alone so I'll be like five
dollars one hundred dollars and
attributes immedi but they never haha
bankruptcy they spin it
and then it'll land on purpose to save
five dollars and they have to build it
for five dollars and they always do it
so it just shows you that with any
budget you could build something so it's
a really it's a really positive channel
engineering your new stuff you can just
thought you can go on there and search
for a specific type thing like I did the
other day I did like steady mounts yeah
I looked that up and then I looked up
different lenses make sure you got to
make a lens that like instead of a
telescopic lens they they taught you how
to make one from scratch oh wow it's
really cool I oh I want to go check that
out it's the boat now but it was bill
2013 but it's really cool they've done
practically everything at this point so
I really like that yeah check it out
yeah it's I love DIY stuff so that is
pretty on stuff okay so your turn
obviously you guys I'm excited I've got
my murloc I'm ready kales dropping his
phone is an item mad guys it's time for
blizzcon 2014 I'm not messing around
anymore okay so it's at the anaheim
convention center i'm going i bought my
ticket i sigh i bought my ticket i paid
my money i'm going to blizzcon as an
attendee I don't even have a press badge
I just go cuz im a nerd what oh cuz im a
nerd and no I'm really excited there's
gonna be obviously diablo 3 is gonna be
their heroes of the storm hearthstone my
favorite okay my favorite part a
blizzcon those cost you the cosplay is
amazing that's always a favorite of mine
they got a contest and it's always amaze
they do and it lasts for like three
hours that's the crazy thing is it lasts
forever and they have to do like dances
and stuff like that people stop doing it
oh my god they'd stop doing the dancing
because because I was there um I was
there at the year yeah this is my murloc
hat I was there the year that the kid
came out to do the undead like
headbanger dance and he broke his leg on
stage like he was jumping up and down
and just like snapped his leg like
obviously to not get enough calcium what
a new super noob level 1 undead warlock
obviously there's not always something
cool the company broke is like so they
stopped doing the dance competition but
they still do the cosplay and it's still
ridiculously good and they also stopped
doing the
voiceover the voice' likes where people
would come out and do quotes like and
they pretend to be a character because
everybody came out trying to do like you
know like four different characters and
then and the other thing was is it was
really boring and it took like an hour
to get through everybody and everybody
just over it yeah but it should be
really fun Nerdist apparently is like
taking over like they're they're doing a
bunch of stuff I think Chris Hardwick is
the one hosting the costume contest this
year which is pretty awesome oh yeah
nice that'll be entertaining yeah
that'll be really fun and then add the
bikes everywhere I know he didn't notice
and not as a hologram which is
unbelievable um but no my favorite thing
about blizzcon is always two things one
the heroic raids because you always get
to see raids that you're never going to
see otherwise they always bring out the
best Oh top to the top alliance and
horde raid guild in the world like I
think last year was method and I don't
remember the name of the other one and
then they it's like a it's competition
they got to get through all five losses
five heroic raid bosses 25-man 40 grade
so it's pretty fun i love watching it
and then the other thing that i really
like watching is the starcraft two
finals which is super intense yeah I I
have no idea what's going on because I
can't think that fast gosh it is
hardcore like those guys are crazy good
at starcraft and i've played starcraft
and i enjoy it but i can't play it like
that yeah no it's unreal have to be your
but i love watching it I love watching
and I love the the play-by-play
commentary like that's my super bowl
like that's the sports event that I like
to see every year so that's I'm really
excited and also metallic is performing
Metallica I'm excited about that sale
they put on a great show there's always
really good concerts at that blizzcon
really really good except for last year
was blank what I do too but before those
it Tenacious D and Foo Fighters like
Ozzy played one year blink-182 yeah I
was blink I didn't stay for that I sia
mediately went out and actually no I
spent time i think i was playing um i
think i was playing Reaper souls I was I
stayed in and just got in line and got
to play all the games that I had missed
I don't have anything particularly gift
link Oni to just doesn't make sense yeah
was a little weird okay Metallica makes
sense yeah but yeah it was that I'm
blizzcon that's what I'm into all right
no way are you gonna dress up no I don't
dress up in cosplay but I will be there
so if you see me don't be afraid to stop
me and ask for a picture or whatever if
you want one I mean like don't do that
if you don't want to figure with me
because that would be awkward if you're
gonna force you ok time for user

sorry I give realize like this is like
it's like my vacation every year we're
gonna cut and you're gonna keep going I
know ok so user feedback we asked you
