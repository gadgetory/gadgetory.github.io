the ground up it can seem really
overwhelming when you look at everything
that's out there but you can customize
your smart home to fit your specific
needs the easiest place to start is
probably with a smart speaker
I like the Amazon echo because it's
accessible and practical and it has a
growing set of skills and integrations
for your smart home once you have your
smart speaker set up its easy to extend
your smart home into light bulbs we like
the Philips hue white LED starter kit
because it comes with a hub and two
really good bulbs they have flicker free
dimming and work with every major smart
home platform if you want extras they're
just 15 dollars now if you don't want to
go around replacing every bulb with a
smart light bulb but you still want
smart control over your lights I'd
recommend the Lutron cassada in-wall
smart switches these are super easy to
use the app is really intuitive and it
works with nearly every smart home
platform they also include cool features
like geofencing and scene management if
you want your smart home to be more
energy efficient you should consider a
smart thermostat like the Eco b4 it
includes a remote sensor so it can
accurately monitor and regulate your
whole home's temperature it also
includes a ton of integrations like a
built-in Amazon Alexa speaker if
improved security is what you want out
of your smart home I recommend the
Amazon Cloud cam it's got 1080p video
prompt notifications and it's free
24-hour clip storage makes it more
appealing than the competition it also
works with screen integrated Alexa
speakers including the Amazon fire TV
stick another way to smart in your home
security is by adding a smart lock the
auguste lock is a retrofit style that's
really easy to install it also works
with nearly every smart home platform
and if you add an august connect Wi-Fi
adapter you can control your lock
remotely all of these devices are great
ways to smart in your home but it's
important to remember to pick the things
that you like and create a home that
works for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
