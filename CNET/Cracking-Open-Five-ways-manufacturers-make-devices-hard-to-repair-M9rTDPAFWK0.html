lighter than ever before but to build
these ultra slim ultra portable devices
designers and engineers often make their
creations more difficult if not
impossible to repair well I'm bill
detwiler and on this special episode of
cracking open i'm going to show you five
ways manufacturers are making our
gadgets harder to fix and give you a few
tips on working around these self repair
roadblocks our first self repair
roadblock is it new or unique to
computers and mobile gadgets but tamper
resistant screws are popping up on more
and more devices Nintendo used try wing
screws on the wii and gamecube sony used
special security torx screws on the
slimline ps3 and apple uses pentalobe
screws on the iphone macbook air and
retina MacBook Pro luckily our first
roadblock is also the easiest to
overcome with a little online research
you can buy a driver or bit to handle
any of these screws unfortunately some
manufacturers are abandoning screws
altogether choosing to glue components
in place and that's our second roadblock
whether it's the iPads front panel the
galaxy s3's ribbon cables or the retina
MacBook Pros battery removing glued-on
components can be difficult and risky
and it's best not to remove a working
component that's glued in place if you
absolutely must do so he can sometimes
help weaken the adhesive but should be
used very carefully if glued on
components weren't enough today's
gadgets are also filled with tiny very
fragile connectors whether it's a board
to board connector or a flexible flat
cable connector today's tablets and
smartphones are filled with them the
keys to working around this roadblock
are a little patience a light touch and
if you really thin tools up to now I've
been able to help you overcome the
repair roadblocks on our list
but the last two aren't so easy to work
around at number four is a roadblock
that manufacturers are using less
frequently but that still pops up from
time to time batteries that are soldered
to the motherboard favored by some
tablet and smartphone manufacturers
there's no way to replace a battery like
this without breaking out the soldering
iron or wire cutters replacing a
soldered battery is definitely one of
the more difficult do-it-yourself
repairs lastly there's one repair
roadblock that's almost impossible to
overcome and unlike soldered batteries
device manufacturers are actually using
it more frequently it's a fused front
panel and display assembly whether it's
the apple iphone or google nexus 7 a
fused front panel and display assembly
makes repairs more expensive because if
one component breaks you need to replace
both and while it's sometimes possible
to separate the two components you often
risk damaging the working half in the
process so often it's just not worth the
risk well that does it for our list of
repair roadblocks I hope my tips help
you the next time you need to fix a
broken device now to see more
