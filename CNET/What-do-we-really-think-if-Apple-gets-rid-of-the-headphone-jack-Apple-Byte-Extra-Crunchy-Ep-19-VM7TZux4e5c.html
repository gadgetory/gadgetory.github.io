building in san francisco california
it's the apple byte extra crunchy
podcast with your host Bryan Tom what's
up everybody what's up welcome to the
show it's a polite extra crunchy episode
18 we keep on going stronger we're 18
deep deep 18 deep we've got sponsors now
we've got you all interacting with the
show we want to say thank you so much
for listening we will jump into the show
right away biggest headline right off
the top according to Macotakara Japanese
website Apple may replace the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on the iphone
7 with an all-in-one lightning connector
is this real is this I hope this is not
real cuz this is bad news could this be
true Bad News Bears Bad News Bears this
headline for first of all Macotakara
just from a reputable ax t you know
standpoint they typically have been able
to get out a lot of info very early
before it happens like 67 months before
it happens when I look at this my first
reaction my gut reactions like know what
are you doing but then I look at it a
different way for example okay first of
all what it what is Apple thing it has
anyone actually requested Apple to bring
to make the iphone thinner does anyone
really want the iphone to be thinner
that's an apple fetish they want
everything to be thinner smaller
skinnier so obsessed with it everyone
has been begging for every phone company
under the sun to give us better battery
life you make this thing sinner and yes
it's only gonna be one millimeter
cording to the story by going with a
lightning connector and removing the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack a standard
that has been around since the 1950s
that is literally still universal today
Apple would be able to shave one
millimeter off the iphone it would make
it uh as thin as the current although
not updated that often ipod touch yes i
just don't see why we need this we don't
need it
and what I think what Apple's trying to
do is set up another revenue stream if
we have to buy adapters and we have to
buy different cables and different
things and change change our whole you
know like everyone had the old-school
iphone ipod players you know like just
like a music player you plug in everyone
had to buy new one of the new of those
right you just have to replace too much
stuff all the time it's it's a big pain
keep on periscope were saying hey it's
the iphone razor that's a shout out to
the moto razr one of the like the
hottest phone back in like two thousand
or so yeah two thousand a little
resurgence the last couple it did it did
so here's another thing that I think
about when Apple wants to think like
this battery life should be key they
have still yet to they always just like
to note like to make a fact that o our
battery has stayed the same you're just
getting a slimmer model I'm at the point
where I don't care the other issue that
i have about this is that ok let's say
you go lightning connector let's say you
make it a millimeter thinner are we
we're probably going to have to have an
adapter oh we just we just have to now
Apple will have to include that adapter
what happens when you lose that adapter
you have to buy another adapter you're
going to lose that adapter 2999 30 bucks
boom we're going like that okay another
issue is that i think when i look at
this like the ipod touch a millimeter
thinner has still has a 3.5 millimeter
stereo jack yes so you don't really have
to get rid of it per se you they could
probably they're the they're one of the
top engineering design design companies
in the world you tell me to get rid of
that no okay the other thing though that
I think is interesting and someone point
this out maybe there should be some
innovation from a standpoint of can we
universally yes three point five
millimeters is the standard could we
make a thinner one of that and
eventually because before it was bigger
before right was it a quarter Jack
before III don't remember I don't think
it was ever a quarter we had like for
example right with you with these uh
studio headphones right you have you
have that
plug yeah you have an eighth inch Anna
and a bigger plug correct these adapters
for that so is there it's not happening
overnight or anytime soon could they
could we see a smaller 3.5 millimeter
jack like a two millimeter jack one day
still that would suck because so many
people plug their iPhones into like a
stereo aux cable an issue oh it do you
want to charge your phone and listen to
music at the same time how you gonna do
that oh I have to have a bluetooth
speaker now and then I have to charge my
bluetooth headphones I'm saying you have
to charge everything now to use it
people people are like hey this is cool
maybe they're gonna make it thinner and
apples going to give us a wireless
charger I don't think people understand
actually wirelessly charging your phone
is actually kind of annoying yes from a
standpoint of it's less efficient you
don't get as much of a powers you
actually have to put it on that plate a
lot longer okay the other standpoint is
you have to have a dish you have to have
a plate to put it in I actually you know
with some of the devices that I've had
phone wise it's it's not as convenient
as you think because let's say you go on
vacation you have to bring a little dish
with you yeah you got to bring them you
got to bring that with you now maybe you
guys don't care but you have two
wireless charging is in like all these
starbucks how many people do you
actually see it using wireless charging
right now it's not there yet and then
when we talk about just wireless devices
like Stevens I'm out bluetooth
headphones I want a headphone that when
i plug it in or when i use it is going
to work no matter what I don't want to
have to rely on the fact that my
headphones need to be charged for me to
use this phone man I can't listen my
Kanye dude my headphones aren't charged
okay yeah exactly your your Kanye my
Kanye my our Bieber in fact our beaver
well we were talking about beaver like
two episodes ago all the comments on the
show we're like Bieber bite backing me
up you guys are killing me we talked
about four cameras not talking about it
they're gonna call the beaver bite again
place yeah it's just the big pain in the
butt man I don't want to have to charge
my headphones I don't have to charge my
bluetooth speaker I don't want to have
to live in a in a field of Bluetooth
frequencies also okay then let's talk
about this let's say they put it on the
single Lightning port adapter uh if
there is no wireless charging on the
phone is this adapter going to be able
to split so you can still charge your
phone
while listening to it at the same time
that's another thing adapter or are they
gonna put two lightning ports on the
phone adapter let's also talk about yet
to change even if you they had two
adapters on the phone let's let's let's
hypothetically play this out if they had
space to put 2 Lightning port adapter so
one could be for power and one could be
for headphones well that actually off
centers every dock that's out there so
you would need a new dock as well yes
it's like those doing SE don't do it I
wonder if they put out these rumors so
that we can all vet it before you know
they actually make a decision like let's
let's put this rumor out there and see
what everyone thinks about it you know I
I'm not complain about because I see the
benefits of it I think for a general
user like me if the adapter supports
charging and physical headphones at the
same time I probably won't care yeah but
what about I care about number one
battery life yeah that's why I'll care
yes now if they did this and said hey
you're getting five more hours of
battery life over the 10 that we
promised then I'm all then I probably
won't care as much battery life hasn't
significantly increased with the new
operating system it bumped up by like an
hour just from overall optimization
according to Apple I haven't really felt
that it's that much better but probably
cuz my i watch that I never uses
draining all the power like for reals um
but let's I'm just gonna you know what
do you guys think yay or nay get rid of
the headphone jack and go with just all
lightning well I'll just look at these
responses I mean yeah well do you think
Apple would really do this I do think
that they would do I would not put it
past them but the only way that it could
be cool if it's like Joaquin Phoenix's
headphones and her that's the only way
it would be cool you know just like
wireless earbuds that might be you know
I'd be down with that nenene no hell no
hell yeh i got i what there's probably
one yes out of every ten someone already
criticized me they'll watch really bryon
watch I think I said Apple watch as I
say i watch I don't even know anyways
again this is not an official statement
by Apple these are the rumor
horze uh it could be perceived as
innovative but just making a phone
thinner and removing a port isn't in and
everything's you have to bring more to
the table than that now why don't you
work on that 3d touch even more that's
what's innovative I'm still all up on 3d
touch yeah I'm probably I I think it's
amazing so have you felt like it's sped
up here it's real subtle right like it's
it's real soda subtle but more apps are
starting to use it now what was the most
recent app that got it that I was like
really happy about what is it no Shazam
hat so you don't have to open the shazam
app now oh that's and then say yeah just
like force touches am yeah that's good
it's gonna pop in my head but this isn't
about this exam is one of those that you
need to get use fast too yeah like a
song will be playing like on a radio or
something you got your like rushing to
get shazam out yeah there you exact
that's the hit a little right yeah
firstworldproblems yeah yeah I know 3d
touch saved my life thanks Sam alright
i'm just some more follow-ups to what's
going around in the Apple world again
these are rumors this is not happening
we're not going to say bad apple or not
because it actually hasn't happening but
we we are we feel strongly that they
would do something like this oh this is
gonna be a very controversial subject
for a while it's gonna be a hot topic
and then what if they don't even do it
I'm gonna give like out whatever yeah
everyone forget about like I'm moving on
with my life alright another report
comes out um by 2018 Apple will actually
be using OLED displays for their phones
this would be according to economic
Taiwan Daily News currently we know that
Apple is using LCD we know that Samsung
phones other phones are using OLED
displays oled typically better brighter
colors sharper images across the board
you would have to obviously integrate
with their 3d touch technology I don't
know how far along they are from there
it would hurt some of their suppliers
more than anything but it would help the
most LG and Samsung who are really the
experts in OLED displays right now that
would be their manufacturing to
support apple but I'm all about an OLED
display on an Apple device yeah yeah I
mean I is so small the screen so small
for me I can't really tell a difference
but I do tell a big difference on my
redness on my retina MacBook big
difference yeah anytime yeah so you know
i i'd have to see it with my own eyes
first so starting in 2018 we expect to
see something like that also another
rumor i was probably one of the biggest
critics of the iphone 5c I've ripped on
it mercifully and I wasn't trying to
attack me I just thought it was it's it
was completely opposite of everything
that Apple had stood for before the Tim
Cook regime but we have seen now look
Apple is a different company we have two
different sized iPhones we have an iPad
pro that's allegedly according to Apple
a multifunctional device something that
tim cook himself criticized before and
said who would want a refrigerator and a
toaster well Apple made their
refrigerator toaster it's called the
ipad pro it copies or tries to be like a
surface pro they've done that you know
again with the iphone this is all right
according to a digit times a new a 9
based 4-inch iphone is expected to
launch in early 2016 the good thing
about this it would also have an NFC
chip inside so it would be compatible
with Apple pay but this would be kind of
like their iphone 5c it's a recording
the report this is ming-chi kuo from
digit times it would be based off of the
iphone 5s design and it has four back
there has some funky metal colors yet
have some like metal casing and maybe
they're gonna bring some like it'll be
like the ipod nano colors on your phone
that's cool like some metal metallic
brushed aluminum type things like that
I'm have to get one of these from my
sister cuz she's still on a flip phone
man what yeah she's like flip phoning
hard so I'm like you gotta get an iphone
she's like now I don't know if the I
don't know if there's anyone here that's
using a flip phone that watches are
that's listening to our show I'd be
surprised if they are I give am a major
props Adele uses a flip phone really in
the video hello are you oh man that that
uh yeah everyone's making fun of that
video I'm aren't we're doing something
like I don't know
I don't know anyways a lookout for that
expected to be in early 2016 the kind of
iphone 4 see I wonder like I'm known I
don't know they haven't said what they
would actually call the phone yet but we
will see and then just kind of finally
wrapping all things up iphone related
Samsung has now agreed to pay apple 548
million dollars as part of their kind of
long-standing patent dispute that at one
time was at 1 billion dollars over time
things have been reduced and thrown in
appeals courts and gone back and forth
and forth so now Samsung has agreed to
pay 548 million dollars this is from the
lawsuit or the patent filings uh sorry
not patent filings this is from the
trial apple vs samsung where samsung had
their phone model concepts that were
like all old-school buttons d-pad navs
yeah and then the iphone came out and
then after that Samsung pretty blatantly
copied the form factor yeah it was with
the I think it was the g3 the Samsung g3
was the one that really looked basically
or as the four is therefore phone there
galaxy s4 oh yeah here here's that look
phones like really like to do like the
earlier iphones is similar so that was
part of it also they're still I believe
they have still yet to figure out what's
going on with their pinch and zoom
functionality I think that's still under
scrutiny by the patent trial and appeal
boards in the course so that's trying to
get figured out but as of now 548
million dollar Samsung has actually
agreed to pay this as a as part of part
of this agreement that's a big story man
yeah duck actually have to cop up half a
billion well because they've been
fighting it they've been trying to get a
regime and trying to get it removed from
poor it actually looked like they were
still gonna peel this but finally they
just gave in said okay fine 548 like
cool we'll just throw you down some cash
there you go this is the one where in
the apple byte video we did iphone 5 on
in rolla seems a better pay up me this
is that from that right now lassie right
that's all right so that happens like
paying up that's like two and a half
years later yeah that's a long time if
you don't know iphone 5 on it you should
look at it that's all I'm so watch that
video go look it up alright um

new products Apple products new rumors
all day every day thinner macbook air in
13 inch and get this 15 inch sizes
coming for WWDC 2016 oh yeah that's
according to the rumor mills again as
well this one's sorry this one's time on
economic daily news this is interesting
because they've never released a 15 inch
super thin macbook air yet we have the
macbook pros we do have a 13-inch
macbook
my brain is all over the place we have a
13-inch MacBook Air just not a 15-inch
the other interesting thing is that the
macbook air line currently consists of
11 inch 13 inch apple has that super
ultra thin looks really amazing a laptop
that's that macbook that most the time
the problem ages are it's the gold one
you know that gold one that's super thin
yeah yeah the ultra-thin macbook it
doesn't have enough power though for me
it's it's like a basic laptop that just
looks amazingly thin so I'm all I would
only even consider that thing way down
the road once they give it a lot more
off maybe if they bring some sky like
we're still waiting for skylight there's
no confirmation if skylake processors
will be in these thinner laptops but
it's just a just a little bullet point
to keep your eyes on cool WWDC typically
they have released laptops there and
showing off new hardware so um we will
wait and see if that happens also I I
hate these stories because it
disheartening after i just bought a
product like two months ago no coding
two digit times production of faster
apple TV 5 is rumored to begin in early
2016 that's brutal come on come on man
happen to me more about the ipad 3rd
generation i know i talked about it
before yeah they release like the new
ipad like six months six months yeah
there was another one I'm like oh okay
cool yeah thanks guys thanks for
crapping on me yeah so this is just a
rumor that they would be using a faster
processor the a 9 processor we all know
that according to Apple because the
current new apple TV is using an a8
processor there's no 4k video support
probably my biggest complaint about that
is that we have phones I can shoot 4k
let me shoot let me just toss that video
onto a TV that could support 4k if you
have a 4k TV yep the a9 processor would
be able to do that for the new Apple TV
again mass production according to this
report and rumor to begin in early of
2016 um there's still a you know they
got rid of the optical output on there
someone just gave it like a sad face on
periscope like no optical really yeah
there's no optical out visual that's all
right yeah that's just a trip I mean cuz
everyone surround sound has optical
thank you I'm i did so i had to like i
did a little reno would you have to do
I just basically for you know I used to
have it separately go through the
optical audio but now I just basically
forced it all through hdmi okay but i
like it works like that but yeah the
optical is meant for that yep even
people have like headphone sets yeah
they just plug pop right in and stuff
like that yeah so that that is still
missing according to the report also
Apple watch sales Apple watch sales
supposedly according to this report
enjoying a modest growth according to
IDC they estimate that around 3.9
million Apple watches have been sold in
quarter three this is based on their
data that they've been gathering in the
wearable sales market uh last quarter it
was 3.6 million I just I just got to go
off and say like as time has gone on I
really thought that the Apple watch
would be able to do more yeah and it
just hasn't there's just not developing
for now I think it I'd argue I don't
want to get people all mad and
frustrated but as of now as a platform
there's no momentum hmm but that number
sounds like a pretty decent number
though 3.6 million it's gonna be it's
the best it's the best for any smart you
know smart wrist watch device yeah per
se but you know my whole thing of I used
to still like this because I'm like oh I
love how it looks but as I just use it
less and less and less I'm just like did
I really spend that much anything like
and it just sends me messages and then
like calls once in a while but I put on
do not disturb almost all the time
because I don't want to get bothered by
that it's rough come on Apple developers
make something to get Brian excited
about his Apple watch like I've really
tried really hard there's like this game
called spy watch and it's like a text
based game where you're like you're like
a spy and you know it but it's I'm not
gonna interact on this screen that much
I know it's just hard I I honestly when
I look at Android wear I just think that
they're doing it not that either
platform has really taken off but
they're just doing a little bit more an
apple just relying on the whole fact of
hey we've got apps we've got apps but
the apps aren't that great you can you
can shoot video with the Android wear
camera right you could or you can watch
video on it but I think you
can also take pictures at least with
some of them I mean you can with the
Apple watch they did get support for you
to watch vine videos on it nice that's
what I want to do in my free time watch
vine videos on my Apple watch success
that's like probably a quarter of a
percent of the human population that
even has an Apple watch I just I told
you into deleted vine off my phone
that's like that's like one guy you were
that guy somebody is doing it anyways uh
the growth for it is picking up a time
but this is rough estimates again Apple
has yet to officially announce any
physical sales announcements of the
Apple watch really yep they have never
done it to this point they haven't even
said we sold ten million which is
typically like a decent bent date and
they let out they always a good drag so
much they say Apple sales Apple watch
sales are increasing it's the first
thing they say and every one of their
press conferences i just asked around
every ask your friends I don't have a
single friend who loves their Apple
watch yeah like I don't they're like
yeah it's all right that's what you get
that's all right we can talk about this
topic this crib it's cool it's cool also
just some cool news for Apple TV lover's
amazon prime video allegedly according
to a tweet from a developer could
possibly be coming within the few weeks
by the end of the year amazon prime
video coming to the new apple TV amazon
has never been on apple TV 2 this point
a lot of people thought there was a beef
between the two companies Apple has said
oh we are open the developers were open
all platforms to develop for us
according to a tweet from ben when's his
name I can't it's just passed me off the
top of my head
I'm sorry I'm going to find this damn
damn Boston weeks damn Boston weeks
received a tweet from amazon saying that
they are working on an app and it should
be ready by the end of the year I like
stories like this we know to two major
players become friends temporarily until
there's some licensing issue is trying
they're like maybe we should get on that
platform to try and make some money cuz
yeah we need that money also a last
story here Sony working on an app to
stream ps4 games onto your Mac or PC to
play yes is badass yes gaming on the mac
platform in general is pretty weak it's
better but nothing nothing compared what
PC gamers got going on they have
everything they get every do they have
it all they really do so Shu Yoshida
from Sony when the tops over it Sonia
said that they are working on an app
they haven't released in a day but
remote play has usually been limited to
where you can play on Sony hardware so
you could use like a PS Vita to remotely
play a game like let's say your ps4 is
on your living room and just want to
like hang out in your bedroom yes you
could do that you could use Sony tablets
with remote play as well they're gonna
adapt they're working on adapting this
to mac and pc i'm so stoked so holes i'm
about to buy a ps4 i just sold my PS
triple let me tell you ps4 i was playing
the Uncharted multiplayer beta last
night for like three hours straight dude
three hours d I'm gonna get the
Uncharted the Uncharted bundle when are
you gonna give you ninety nine ER what
are you gonna get it though I'm gonna
say it like probably a little after
Christmas okay I was gonna say if you
get it this week you could still get
into the multiplayer beta oh it's
awesome let's go yeah I just need
battlefront and I'll be able to die okay
that's that's not that's not a bad thing
at all alright so that's gonna kind of
wrap up our stories we know that again
this shows all about you all we want you
guys to call our show I forgot to give
you guys the number at the begin of the
show typically when I do that we still
get a lot of calls though yes 1 800 61
62 63 8 is the phone number to call us
leave your name where you're from and
just get your message some of you kind
of your stretch it a little bit I'm just
saying I'm actually
have to edit one of your calls right now
so should we get to the calls me to it
all right hey guys Ryan from oak I'm
from sorry Toronto Canada and my
question is well I have an ipad pro
currently and I'm a student and was
wondering if you guys thought that would
be beneficial for me to get the Apple
pencil to take notes and stuff thanks
result my gut reaction is I like the
underdog people use paper dollars for
that pen well he already has the ipad
pro right yeah the good thing about it
is that based on tests and people
comparing the comparing you know surface
pen and apple pan the apple pan does can
get get you that really precise detail
when it comes to handwriting if you want
to do that that's fine that's your
prerogative I do think that actually
physically writing notes down whether
it's on paper or now with an ipad pro
you actually remember it better just
typing it out definitely cuz when you're
typing you're like brainlessly like like
yes and I don't retain personally I
don't retain things as well yeah you
have that physically ride it yeah if
that's your motivation i would say then
go for it if it's i'm not saying for
people listening or what about paper and
pencil yeah use a paper and pencil use
that actually is probably but now these
days as this question has changed I do
think writing with the physical pen
Apple pencil would accomplish that same
feat if you want to do it yeah I prefer
paper just like quickly browse through
all my notes you know and also there's
no shortage on paper in this country so
we're all good on that sure about that
save yourself you know save yourself
ninety-eight dollars well you can either
save a tree and not use paper and
contribute to like mass amount of
landfills with rare earth metals yes and
gladly means yeah or you could just go
back and get paper that we can actually
recycle and use yeah well fan of paper
I'm a fan of physically writing it down
on paper like me apples next product
Apple paper I'm going it will be it will
be I'm going to a little press
conference this weekend I'm bringing a
notepad I that's just how I work it's
just easier though
easier all right next call okay here we
go hey guys this is diego here from
Chicago and as far as the Apple watch I
know a lot of people who are actually
waiting to see if the next watch is
going to be connected with LTE let me
know what you guys think love the show
Diego thanks for calling uh you know
there's rumors about that will it make
it more useful to a certain degree like
quite honestly with the Apple watch I'm
more concerned of them actually putting
a real true GPS chip in it it doesn't
have that it's still dependent on the
phone so anyone who wants to do any type
of fitness or trail running has to have
the phone in their pocket and the watch
completely idiotic the Apple watch
itself needs a Wi-Fi chip so it can be
totally dependent without you know even
when you're in your home we have enough
Wi-Fi now these days that that would be
a huge boost to it LTE the big thing is
that you're gonna have to pay for
another data plan I don't think you
really need to you know do because
people that are using their Apple watch
aren't using it as their single
standalone dedicated device yeah it's a
complementary device most of time you'll
have your phone in it but there's a few
times where you go running or exercising
let's get rid of the phone so put the
technology in there that makes that
happen and if you're around the house
you know find your phones in the corner
that's not a big a deal but make it as
as least dependent on a data connection
as you need to you don't want to pay 30
40 bucks a month just for your watch no
who wants that but if Apple does do this
and then they make that watch just a
standalone device you don't need the
phone or anything then you know it could
be compelling reason to buy it could be
if you want to talk to your wrist all
the time and take calls you think that's
cool yeah all right i'll let solid i'll
let you do that all right next call hi
my name is Andrew from Michigan and I
just had a quick question for you about
the ipad bro i recently purchased one
and i'm just wondering if you think that
Apple is going to make any kind of
adapters for the Lightning port I've
been reading that if USB 3.0 compatible
instead of just us the 2.1 during if you
guys think that Apple is going to do
anything
future for adapters maybe even something
that would allow us to some what's like
a USB drives into an ipad pro via an
adapter so thanks for this call this
calls right on the money the ipad pro
port lightning port does support USB 3.0
i think it'll be up to a third-party
manufacturer i don't unless here how
about let's put this way my body my
brains going all over the place apple
will release an adapter for this to
support USB 3.0 a pro level app and
maybe their own like hard drive that
they produce yes exactly that they are
then then they I think that's when they
would be really compelled to do it now
let's pretend that doesn't exist it'll
be up to accompany a third party company
to make this adapter they're gonna have
to pay apple a licence fee to even make
this little adapter cable that might be
the most discouraging I think ultimately
someone who's using the iPad pro for pro
reasons is going to buy the 128 gig hard
drive we know that's really not enough
if you're going to do 4k video support
so if there is a final cut pro video
product or a true now i'm not talking
about pinnacle which is on there a true
pro video editing app that you can
really use with the ipad pro even you
know audio like logic pro yeah that
requires more hard drive space i think
that would be more compelling reason to
be able to latch on external hard drive
for that even an actual high-end pro
photo editing suite but it's called the
ipad pro and it can't do pro things it
can do pencil things like come on so i
think someone will come up with it and
this product like we've kind of alluded
to is still a little half-baked it says
pro but it doesn't really feel pro there
needs to be new things done with
software and from your n that hardware
element could support larger storage
space to complement some of these apps
that just aren't there yet that's how i
see it potentially playing out i don't
know if it will not depend on how Apple
envisions what they want to do with the
product but as i use it more it's really
just a big guy it's just a big bigger
ipad it's i've been doing that keyboard
case for a while and it just it's like a
it's not really doing much for me
it's keyboard I got all that the old
case on my old iPad I just got rid of X
is too much of a pain the ass like fold
and you all the weird stuff yeah so this
ipad pro smart keyboard is like advanced
origami when you put it that's the best
way i can yeah anyone who uses it knows
where I'm talking that's advanced organ
I saw someone messing with the other day
I'm like that looks not easy to use it's
not like you just open it up and stand
it now you have to connect this end the
right end and it's like plaid think
about the influences stupid okay next
call this is last closing all right hey
guys it's evan anderson I'm from Truckee
California just wanted to tell you guys
that I was at an apple store in

love the show keep it up by we got Evan
on the street mang yeah he's our
reporter on the street is that you know
if you guys can confirm so i'll be
talking about this is when we were

charged it right yeah thanks thanks
