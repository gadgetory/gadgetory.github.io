twist today with the feds calling off
the latest court hearing saying that
they might be able to hack that iphone
without apples help after all the FBI
has told the court it has been offered a
new option for accessing the data on the
iphone 5c belonging to San Bernardino
shooter Syed Farook in its motion to
cancel tomorrow's hearing the FBI said
an outside party demonstrated to the FBI
a possible method for unlocking farooq's
iphone testing is required to determine
whether it is a viable method that will
not compromise data on farooq's iphone
the court has given the FBI until april
five to test out its new and unnamed
method and find out whether or not it
still needs to pursue apple in its
demand to create a special version of
iOS to unlock this phone just this
morning at Apple's launch event for the
new iphone SE and ipad pro Apple CEO Tim
Cook kicked things off by discussing its
battle with the FBI we need to decide as
a nation how much power the government
should have over our data and our
privacy we did not expect to be in this
position at odds with our own government
but we believe strongly that we have a
responsibility to help you protect your
data and your privacy so is this a
win-win or a lose-lose for security does
Apple really win if the FBI can hack its
older iOS without any help or does the
FBI really win after such a public
tussle with America's biggest
corporation I'm sure there's more twists
and turns as the april five deadline
approaches so keep up with all the news
