controlling a Range Rover with a
smartphone and an archaic console by
Sony and Nintendo has been unveiled Oh
amazing tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the Internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show who known universe I'm Ashley
scale that Jamie's always Kel anonymous
the man the myth the pizza uh happy
weekend is over day you said you had a
pretty good fourth of July which was
nice I had that stupid hot dog pizza
that they just introduced here in the
States I'm surprised you're still
standing I hated that was it disgusting
well not for like the moment the moment
the pieces touch your tongue and you
chew like once twice you're like hey all
right and then it has to be a part of
your body and it's just disgusting and
it's not so with pretzel bun to so like
it was like extra salt much yeah I drank
like 14 gallons water afterwards just to
heal myself so that was my fourth that's
two extra gallons and what kale normally
drinks in a day it's pretty pretty
serious all right guys let's have
deadlines do here I we here we here open
phone line somebody's calling somebody
okay I'm gonna give you one guess as to
where this took place two robots got
married uh Mars close Japan so the
world's first robot wedding happened and
well I think that's there's not much
more you can say about it but we have
some footage it's this is insane it's a
it's an actual robot wedding between two
robots not like a person trying to marry
a robot or a doll or whatever the bride
is ukuran looks really humanoid modeled
after and a pop star in japan and then
the groom which you can see right there
the red froy's on they were escorted up
to the front that's him trying to kiss
the bride there need a little help from
the human yep there you go all right
great work the humans also had to recite
their their robot vows they datos
because you know people don't speak
robot yet um they could cut their own
wedding cake like you saw and this is
the reception they have little robot
backup dancers there was a hundred or so
attendees they pay to each paid about 80
bucks to attend this robot wedding but
in Italy not legally binding these two
are not actually married because robot
rights is not a thing yet and they they
don't recognize robot and robot
marriages in Japan so that's they're
gonna have to wait a little bit we still
got a long way to go worlds we got to
get those robots man there yet not there
yet um this I just saw this story just
thought it was a amazing and perfect for
the show and be you know the big
question for me is actually our hashtag
of the day which is TD wed bots which is
what do you get the happy couple what do
you what's the what do you what gift you
get them are they where were they
register I'm still trying to process the
story I know it's really can't really
answer this question it's a little bit
crazy I like I can't help my brain hurt
I feel like maybe they was registered
likely vehicles what religion of
marriage was it that they married under
I'm gonna go pastafarian all a go did
they have a honeymoon where would they
go where did they meet and on the
internet or they could calm down I'm
gonna answer all your questions ok well
own good but complete speculation they
clearly they met Annie I know I know how
they're compatible but it's probably
because they're programmed that way that
does he have like a USB to shave like a
USB port and he has like a us probably
and yeah okay yeah man i'm gonna guess
yes but yeah just so i just what a way
to what a way to start the week with
robot love robot weddings the first the
world's first as far as i'm aware robot
wedding so strange I'm really unsettled
by this I mean why would they want to
get married anyway anyway well I don't
know nobody you know I find that weird
nobody actually asked and do they say
till death do us part or did they say
something different till dismantle do
they say till like we boot that like we
shut down boot down yeah there's a lot
of questions i would pay eighty dollars
to go to this by the way a hundred
percent i pay 80 bucks to go to robot
wedding i'd pay maybe a little more but
yeah so that's your hashtag today what
what do you get a robot couple for a
wedding gift what's owed you obviously
had an answer to this I mean I feel like
I'd get him well here's the thing i
would i feel like i might get them
something for their home but like
they're robots so
you can't really get him a toaster that
feels insulting so what do you get them
I mean I guess I would get them like a
yeah I don't really know it's a great
question I'm glad I thought of it
because I don't know the answer I may be
like antivirus software so that I don't
get any you know get sick it's good yes
sick sick okay perfect perfect okay so
let's move on to a marriage of a
different type yeah tell me about long
long ago it was it was said it was
actually true that Sony was going to
make a consult with Nintendo this is
something that that they've been talking
about doing but the plan fell through
because Nintendo decided to work with
philips instead but there apparently was
a console made well a reddit user has
apparently found that console we now
have it to actually see for the first
time here it is this is the play station
oh that's that's kind of weird that they
such a familiar name yeah so uh so this
man claims he's the son of a businessman
who knew a high-ranking Sony executive
back in the late 80s Early 90s and
posted the images of this prototype
console on reddit and assembler games
let's go check it out so this is not
only not only does this play console do
like cartridge discs like Nintendo DS
yeah cars but it plays cds like Sony
wanted to so there is a boat there's
like wow here's all the things we want
to put it all in there and you can see
it has like a super nintendo controller
Wow so yeah we've never seen that we've
never seen a console like this before
uh-oh but yeah I mean we've heard rumors
about it though right it's been a rumor
for a really long time now the guy that
found it he doesn't have a power
connector for it so he's looking for
that so that he can load this up it
doesn't look like you have to have any
games for it but if he can find the
power thing we can see like maybe menu
some users may see what what they were
doing but the first and only time we've
seen this super cool I I don't it looks
like a monster like it looks it looks
like a misguide monster it looks like
like kill me cuz succeeds cartridge I
can get a job
and it's yeah look you can tell that
it's all because of the way yellow Dow
um yeah so there's nobody screaming fake
by the way nobody's good faith and just
like yeah they mentioned that um the guy
was like oh I got it from my dad's
friend Olaf which there was a guy that
was in charge and antenna back then and
love for something like that so there
you go weird now so if i recall
correctly and this is just for your own
sake as as nerds fellow nerds uh it
wasn't it might it wasn't III because it
hadn't started yet but Sony had come out
and was ty had talked about like their
vision of what this machine would be and
then literally like I think hours later
Nintendo was like yeah about that we're
not we're not gonna be we're not gonna
be doing that we're gonna be going with
Philips like yeah dad yeah it was just
like no we're just and Sony was super
embarrassed by that and actually that
falling-out became the PlayStation like
that's why Sony decided to make their
own console so this is like a pretty big
piece of video gaming history that we've
never seen before which is so cool well
and it's the first time we ever like
heard of those two even talking to each
other it's like great and also they
didn't move on wait so they it was it
was they went on to do the super
nintendo though right yeah like Nintendo
went on to do SNES and then uh and then
Sony had to go back to the drawing board
because Nintendo did a separation of
cons of cartridge versus seen a CD right
what like broke off and they each did
their own yeah then Nintendo kept going
with cartridge Sony said let's just keep
our CD reader to the future can commit
more information right right so there
you go yeah super interesting stuff I
mean this was the thing that was long
rumored and nobody like you said no one
had really ever seen a prototype and I
think they I think the estimate like 200
of these might exist and a lot of them
have probably been destroyed at this
point so this is like insane that this
is even shown up at this point in time
it's amazing okay last story and then
we'll get into a break and and then
we'll come back with back rockets so i
want to show you this jaguar land rover
just showed off this prototype range
rover sport and it's special because
you'll see the guy gets out of the car
and he pulls out his phone and he's
controlling a full set
car with his phone which is crazy not
great Bob uh not great Bob so this is
really fascinating they okay you're not
going to be whipping around on the right
you're not going to do to any real-life
racing for this that the example here
that they've given is sort of
off-roading that instead of having to
continually get in and out of your car
every time you kind of make a move if
you're off-roading you would be able to
do this instead so you can sort of see
exactly where the car is going and
adjust um so it goes up to four miles
per hour and this is what I would use it
for right here getting in out of tight
parking space someone parks real close
to you just back the Carl it's fine you
can be you can't be like two miles away
sadly this will not be like James
bond-esque remote-controlled cars like
all that crazy stuff it goes for miles
per hour like I said and also you got to
be within 30 feet of it so you got to be
pretty close and if you get out of that
range automatically stops they also show
this which is an autonomous three
three-point turn let the car conduce if
you need to do a u-turn you just set
that up and it does it for you they did
a whole bunch of a whole bunch of stuff
and I just found that really fascinating
that they're like hey let's let's find a
way to remote-control a full-sized
crossover with your smartphone mm-hmm
looks like you could also use it for
things like backing up to a trailer so
that you hook that up because it's
really not like Center those those
connections yeah and also really
important if you're gonna want to ghost
ride the whip so that's that's always
good a hundred percent we're gonna there
listen I think that's probably the
number one goal there's three people to
watch the show the know what ghost ride
the whip me and we're two of them so
there you have it I said that watch I
don't watch the show oh you don't watch
the show oh okay well that makes one of
us um so yeah that's a that I just saw
that I thought was super fascinating and
I kind of love this idea like you were
saying sometimes you're trying to back
into a space or otherwise like figure
something out with the back of your car
a camera doesn't really cut it sometimes
when you just want to see it so this is
kind of a neat little piece of
technology and a really fun project it's
super cool I'm glad that they put some
governing on it so that you're not just
like driving it on the forward I'll
watch this piece it's like oh yeah this
just throw somebody that's going i could
totally sit on top of your car and drive
it or
nobody back to dad that's super cool I
like this what cars it again that's a
it's a range rover range rover sports a
prototype so we'll see if they ever
integrate this technology and with their
cars I would imagine so that life scares
so many people I think a lot of people
be terrified of this um I give like run
away from my car me driving no I know I
know I want this if you could do a
really great little video to pretend
like your cars Christine like it's gonna
run you down but it only did going four
miles an hour so it wouldn't be that
terrifying okay we're gonna take a quick
break but before we go you have to see
how many iPhones it takes to stop an AK
74 not a typo not forty-seven
seventy-four and AK 74 bullet so check
this out we'll be right back
welcome back to the show I promise you
kale is not drinking a 40 otherwise it'd
be in a paper bag you gotta hide it it's
Monday uh which it is Monday I'm sorry
which means that we have to talk about
crowdfunding so this is back at Hackett
kale I found the best crowdfund ever for
you ok you're really into VR yeah you
want to make VR content Oh so I'm going
to let me yep you can now do that so you
can let yourself do it because of
spheric am too so this is farrah cam 2
this is their Kickstarter video oh my
god what's wrong with this guy there it
is it is a little tiny tennis ball sized
4k 360 degree VR camera this is crazy so
here's what's on board 6 image sensors 6
lenses a Wi-Fi button and on and off
button a micro USB port a tripod mounts
for microphones 6 micro SD card slots
all on board this thing that's the size
of a tennis ball hate that dog is a jerk
um so he's just soulless take this guy's
just sleeping he yeah he says be there
so now he's gonna be able to go back
anyway resolution on these cameras 4k
okay 4k 4k 360 degrees yeah it says that
it's they shoot in raw you have the
ability to shoot raw which is crazy good
um and it has Wi-Fi and streaming baked
right in viewing and sharing content on
your smart phone and desktop super easy
there's a mobile app you start and stop
recording with it monitor the view while
you're recording you can do that you can
transfer view edit and send and
otherwise work with your video really
really easily they're saying it said
that they have the software will sit
together your videos seamlessly you
won't have to worry about it you don't
have to sit there and like focus on
everything um looks pretty awesome how
much is it it's a little bit expensive
this is no this is unbelievable but yeah
you did it well guess there's no what
people wanted we don't want to put like
50 GoPros together now we don't want to
have to create some tennis ball size oh
yeah and then we worked you know when
you have to like put GoPros but no this
is perfect one device and people gonna
make great videos yet but of course
they're gonna have to pay
a how much how much would you pay for
this let's do it let's do infomercial
kale anonymous how much would you pay
for this product would you pay a
thousand dollars would you pay five
hundred dollars did you pay two thousand
dollars I pay 400 max 400 max uh you're
gonna be waiting a while my friend
because this camera as of right now they
are in their second round of early bird
and if you want just the camera is 1399
1400 bucks yeah but there's a lot of
technology in there I know it's really
really impressive so it's not ready for
consumers but people are gonna be
picking this time I disagree I disagree
that's not true because people pay a
thousand dollars for a phantom for the
for the DJI phantom that's it that's not
even a 4k camera it's a 1080p camera on
a drum yeah but you're talking about
prosumers so you're talking about yeah
people that make these videos and make
money off of it this isn't like what
happened my mom's not gonna pick one up
and like bring it to go to the lake it's
gonna be like it's gonna be my friend
who has a drone has professional cameras
and adds this to his list of things that
he owns no I think like my dad for
example would probably buy this and take
it hunting with him like he does hunting
trips and I feel like this is something
he might buy like people who have a
little bit extra spending cash who like
have hobbies like that so like maybe
somebody who goes out fishing or you
know sail boating or whatever kayaking
you can do all that stuff like I would
imagine it would be stuff like that but
if you like the 4k DJI phantom is like I
think about the same price it's like 12
99 or 1399 so to me this seems like just
early adopter as opposed to prosumer
like I don't think it's necessarily
people who are gonna make money off
their content there will be a lot of
that I think you're absolutely right
there but I do think there's going to be
early adopters who are like I just
really want to get in on this VR game
and I'm willing to pay a premium for it
producer Logan was showing just showing
the Kickstarter on on their website they
asked for a hundred and fifty thousand
dollars already past that there are
nicer than 50 likes I think 3,000 or
4,000 yeah 154,000 with 23 days left so
they are they are just cruising right
along so this will absolutely get made
and and it I mean it looks awesome this
is great I think we needed this giant
step already so they're people like
GoPro will step up and all
the other camera companies will step up
this will be our great access point to
start making the air content now just
easy as easiest stuff on our sauce or 3d
content I mean was that part of it I'm
not 3d but they did like they have a
whole bunch of the cool thing is is they
actually have a whole bunch of different
arms and mounts it's a standard tripod
mount but they have a whole bunch of
them and they also have these okay if we
go back to the site scroll down a little
bit there they actually these arms that
right there yeah they have these little
arms that are specifically for like
putting it down and they're not they
don't obscure the view of the camera
that's really crazy which is awesome so
protected your camera aprea protects
your camera without getting in the way
of your view which is so cool I think
that is brilliant like I I love it I if
I had the money i would a hundred
percent back it what about you yeah oh
absolutely yeah I can't wait to see the
first like filmmaker that gets his hands
on this whether he uses it whether he
uses it for actual 360 stuff or he uses
it so that he can have a shot without
fail that he can move the angle right to
anywhere because of its 4k and he has
like an explosion but he wants the
camera to move this way he can just
basically pan or the images that he has
so yeah no absolutely how I don't you
know I you're right what is it 12 used
to 12 or 14 it's 1399 yeah i just heard
of yeah i yeah i totally think that
that's not that's not bad at all All
Things Considered I mean the other the
alternate buying all those GoPros would
be four times as much yeah exactly I I
again don't think I'm gonna see any of
my like lower end friends that don't
already have camera equipment buying one
of these but yeah but yeah definitely
anybody that's like into this stuff
notice that a no brainer I can't wait to
see what kind of content like if
somebody brings us to comic-con awesome
yeah super cool and just FYI spear cam
if you want to just like send us one to
try we can like show people stuff I
actually would like to see stuff like
this I Lexie content made as like extras
and special features for movies so like
behind the scenes stuff r you walk
around the set like all that's that's
the stuff I want to see a VR and I look
I would I like I would be willing to pay
that you know twenty dollars to buy as
opposed to just renting or waiting for
netflix or whatever I would
pay that money to have those types of
extra features as opposed to just like a
two minute you know gag reel it's like
okay well fine give me the two minute
gap girl but also give me a couple of
gag you know couple of gags like where
I'm on the set watching them film and
they mess up and then I can like see
that that would be awesome ya know I
really like the idea of getting a cool
set visit also if you went to Disneyland
they do the fireworks and that's all
around you if you could do that for the
seven so I'm sure we got millions of
ideas to send it over just just let us
borrow it will give it back I promise we
won't give it back no we will give it
back kale might not but I would promise
what I will get it back to you okay so
now that we've talked about that
delightful Kickstarter we have to talk
about your user feedback I have an
update on the US vs japan robot
challenge oh yeah i heard about this uh
challenge accepted japan has given in
they said okay we're gonna pick kurama's
vs mega bot it is happening it is gonna
go down but more importantly they've
decided the terms of which the fights
gonna Harry there is a catch there is a
catch hand-to-hand combat only robot
hand to hand combat only no guns
obviously no explosive devices they want
to keep everybody safe but it will be
you don't listen in any universe that I
can get a giant robot fight I will take
it and so this is totally cool yeah the
video is short and sweet it's a mad long
and and he's like she's like he in he
says he goes we can't let America win
and then he goes would this gotta be way
cooler oh yeah he says it's super
American like have guns on it yeah so
yeah he's got a good point to robots
standing there just shooting guns at
each other's pretty stupid so he wants
them to go toe-to-toe and bash yeah crap
out of each and he says giant robots are
Japanese culture I mean this is he they
are in it to win it so it's melee combat
that's going to happen hand-to-hand
robot fight they want he said they're
gonna knock out this robot and turn it
into scraps and whichever there we go
and whichever robot wins that's where
I'm going to move to live forever
because I'll feel the safest so that's a
good point hand moves
move with my robot overlords over to
Japan yeah and hopefully I think they'll
probably also get free denny's for life
the winner the robot winner will get
free denny's for life free breakfast
okay so we asked you guys who you think
will win and help that this is happening
this is even better Dustin wrote in and
said that since there is not a Canadian
entry I will cheer for team USA go team
USA you were feeling very baby factory
mm-hmm a Canadian it just right into
Canadian loser robot do you think they
would make one he'll be really polite
that's what I'm thinking super polite
robot it would polite you to death play
it apologize you to death they were just
like I'm sorry Rick wrote in and said I
really doubt that there will be an
actual fight risking lives of pilots
even with paintballs will guess what
Rick it's happening it's not going to
risk the lives of the pilots but it's
gonna happen it's happening now it is
happening Brad rights and it says
America for the win the robot needs a
squadron of mini-drones that it lunches
and they attack from all angles like
that that's sort of similar to yours
you're like just yeah bunch of other
robots come fight it I've been watching
a lot of battle bots so I'm really I'm
really into this as long as there's a
lot of destruction I just hope it lasts
longer than the matches and battle bots
which is like a minute or two I think
about 20 minutes 15 to 20 minute match I
don't get anything longer than that I
get a little bored cuz it then it means
they're probably really slow but I think
like 15 minutes is about what I would
enjoy yeah and then also innovation
required rodents at EMP guns
anti-gravity thrusters for air combat
and transforming into mini individual
robots on disintegration do to impact
just like it was like an Iron Man yeah I
like that I liked all of that happening
is pretty good um so yeah you guys
obviously crushed it really good
feedback and then and then we have our
very last pieces your feedback which is
our phone tog refer the day
for those of you not here in the United
States of America was America's birthday
this weekend was the fourth of July we
like to celebrate here in America by
blowing stuff up mostly fireworks
sometimes other stuff but mostly
fireworks which is why John wrote in and
he said hello Ashley and kale you might
remember me i'm the guy who sent in the
grasshopper photo a few months back
these are some pictures I took with my
Moto X 2013 from the fourth of July
fireworks show in chamblee Georgia I
went there with my friend to watch some
explosions in the sky I know that a lot
of pictures have a fence in them but
that is the closest I could get to them
since it was a packed place I hope you
like them all but I understand there can
only be one featured for photography of
the day great show watch every episode
every episode enjoy John wait what do
you mean a lot of photos have offensive
oh that's of the ones he sent an album
of different fireworks pictures and I
had producer Logan pick his favorite so
he picked this one but um great pictures
and on a moto x 2013's couple years old
which is pretty rad looks good looking
good john h yeah very cool nicely done
super great and i actually like the
fence I think I preferred it makes the
shot more interesting yeah it makes it
unlike every of everyone else's yeah
it's a foreground it's like there's a
nice looks like we're like in jail while
you took this picture Shawshank
Redemption July like it yeah man must be
tough being we got freedom on the
outside you got sent down the river John
terrible all right that is it if you
want to email us your phone tog raphy or
a story idea you can email us tomorrow
at cnet com you can also find us on the
internet mostly Twitter uh we're at
tomorrow daily and on our personal
