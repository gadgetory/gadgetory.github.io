time for episode 149 of the 359 podcast
and today i am here with Roger Cheng and
Alfred and good morning guys what is
going on the show today morning morning
we've got a busy day when we talking
about the Apple watch Tim Cook is
defending it he's out there saying that
record sales that sales ever as sales
ever so we'll well break it down for you
to see if that actually true or how much
water oh that's that already been really
hold but that claim to test yes next up
a firm is out there with a possible
reason or explanation for the explosions
with the galaxy note 7 we'll talk about
that and then lastly will dig into the
review of Google Wi-Fi the new wife by
home stamp for spoiler it's very good
there you go so as usual if you have any
questions on these topics leave them in
the comments section or producer Brian
will you pick out the best we'll try our
best Ephram already let's do it this
thing underway and recording of the
podcast will start in three two come to
the 359 we talked about the top Texan of
the day and all the other crap we want
to throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm Alfred
Aang so the Apple watch isn't a flop CEO
Tim Cook says that the wearable set a
record for the first week of the holiday
shopping season a little dubious since
he's never broken out the actual numbers
for Apple watch but is this encouraging
note uh I don't think it is I think the
SmartWatch market is kind of I think the
entire market is a flop right I think I
mean I don't think he's lying when he's
saying that it did pretty well during
the holiday weekend sale only because i
think you know smart watches are a
pretty good gift right there one of
those things where you don't want to buy
for yourself because i don't i can't
justify getting a smart watch bracelet
but if somebody gave me a SmartWatch i
think it'd be pretty cool i mean i think
the timing is a little dubious you know
IDC just came out with report yesterday
saying that smartwatches aren't decline
as fitness trackers are on the rise this
is in my mind this is apples Tim Cook
taking back some of the narrative of the
fact that the Apple watch hasn't done as
well as expected by saying by throwing
out this little tidbit saying record
sales getting people excited about Apple
watching the thing is how do you say
record sales though when you've
literally released no numbers that's
just that's so that's the thing that's
the thing company that's the game the
company's love to play
especially if they don't give out
numbers because they can really say
whatever they want yeah come have to
take it at face value right I'm not
saying apples lying but maybe the
numbers were pretty low last year there
had a low bar to cross so I mean I do
think you know again like I said I do
think the holiday week kind of helps
considering like they did have like some
pretty decent black friday deals maybe
that's what limit that to that was a
part of it all right so next up a
possible reason for the Galaxy Note
seven fires and I know this is a dead
horse but we want to keep eating it
manufacturing engineering firm
instrumental to tear down and found that
there was no room for error when it came
to the space around that battery I'm
batteries tend to swell a little bit
when they're fully charged so that
aggressive design meant that when it was
true when it was actually expanded fully
charged there was much much higher
chance of a causing fire that makes a
lot of sense considering you know
Samsung's original remedy for it was
this patch that basically made it oh we
can only your full charges at 60 / yes
yeah yeah well think of it is is I'm
still a little concerned about at this
point it's been a while now Samsung
hasn't said anything about the the
battery issue they haven't disclosed
anything wondering if they're they're
hoping that we all just forget about it
yeah I mean the most leave discloses we
don't really know much Ryan we can't
figure it out so I you know I I do think
it's good enough these third parties are
taking a look at it um I think it's
interesting that their thought is you
know they tried making a phone so good
that even they couldn't um well stain it
so good may not be the best way to put
it right it's so thin they were obsessed
with thinness yes getting this packed
into a small phone and that obsession
flew too close to the Sun and burned up
yeah literally all right lastly um well
we reviewed the Google Wi-Fi today and
we're calling it basically like the best
Wi-Fi option that you can have now some
of the good points for it so far I've
been how easy it is to manage and set up
from a nap on your phone and to me
personally I do think the mesh Wi-Fi
network is one of the coolest things
yeah that I've seen I mean it's not like
this is the first time that I've ever
seen it but I do every time I see it I
just think this is you know I don't have
to worry about getting like worse
internet when I'm in my kitchen versus
grow and who these mesh Wi-Fi systems
have been somewhat complicated to set up
I mean you kind of have to be a little
bit more technically sad yeah to set it
up more so than you know sending up a
home Wi-Fi router so having Google Wi-Fi
do this or make this as simple as
possible is really a good step and the
same deal like I mean I have an
apartment and on one side apartment my
signal just isn't as good as it should
be I do wish that it was also a modem
though just because it's like right now
I I'm paying like that like weird rental
fee yeah cable company well I have that
also just by my own well I have that's
the grip I have a fios is because I I
can't actually get my I can't use my own
money yeah like I have to use their
modem yeah the pay the rental fee which
always knows yeah that's frustrating so
I do we should have that but for what it
is it's it's a very good product alright
for more on these stories check us out
on cnet I'm Roger Cheng I'm Alfred Aang
thanks for listening the first question
in the chat today is from Hugo should i
skip my study time to listen to you yes
yeah what are you even studying for yet
come on man what are you studying Hugo
we're cute yeah this is like holiday
break for a ruined school no no no no my
god sorry I'm like oh it's only december
i remember rogers old haha and just back
from vacation so in my mind I'm still
kind of semi on vacation mode Alan wants
to know how does the google Wi-Fi stand
up to the high end routers at pros use
uh you know what it's it's it's not a
router yeah that's the thing sort of a
mesh now it extends the router that you
had if you've got like a pro you still
have to have a base level and the google
Wi-Fi I mean mega best pro level router
probably has better range than yeah your
basic one but if you have a large home
or if you're trying to connect to it
also kind of buildings on what your
internet speed is if you have like a
normal like internet speed it's like
there's really no point I'm assuming if
you have a pro router then it's gonna be
like pretty quickly as it is for sure so
it kind of depends on like what the size
of your home is I think one of the
bigger selling points for Google wifis
the just the ease of setup for it though
how about putting a side-by-side with an
apple airport I think n it doesn't
really stack up right the airport is and
i have an airport apples and oranges if
you will yes testing a limited rate app
l'a√©roport Haslam
it's it's a router so it's it's not this
mesh network that Google Wi-Fi is the
idea of Google wifis you've got multiple
hubs you put around your home and that
extends the network again so you've got
a better signal everywhere that being
said that I mean if you're an apartment
like my size I don't know how relevant
that is right just because it's so time
you live in brooklyn's yea I'm guessing
your home is it's it's tiny yeah so like
at this point I'm like I live in the
burbs so like I kind of need one these
mesh net what yeah but my router is like
so bad that like even when I go in like
if I just try using my laptop and like
my kitchen or like another room like
that's not my living room it works but
it's like slow as hell yeah yeah like my
phone on like LTE is faster yep so
michael says that the Apple watch is by
far the most popular SmartWatch but is
because of the brand not the device yeah
that's true I would say yeah yeah I mean
also the competition's been pretty weak
right yeah I mean Samsung has been out
there they've been pushing it pretty
hard but I I think I see a lot of gear s
I would make the argument though is that
like you know apples kind of the only
smart watch company out there not
company but like they're the only ones
pushing the SmartWatch is kind of like a
luxury item right whereas others have
been trying to go for as like a utility
kind of like device yeah and that's why
they're losing to limit bit and all
these a lot yeah exactly a lot of them
are pushing this as sort of a fitness
tracker alternate yeah like but it's
like three or four times more expensive
yeah Fitbit so yeah definitely it would
be great if Google Wi-Fi was a
Combinator router modem so do you think
Google will actually venture into that
realm and make their own router to
complement this I mean technol it's
already i think modem is what that it
doesn't have which I to animate sorry
sorry yeah I I wish they would but i
also don't know like how big the modem
market is out right now do you really
think i mean i don't know about you but
I kind of just take the default one
that's given to me from what writer I
kind of hell but I pay like an extra 10
bucks a month for no but I gotta have to
because it's like hooked into what it
uses a coaxial connection I mean just
all the good routers that I like I
always do the math on these things where
I'm just like okay well if I get a good
router no sorry if I get a good modem
which is like about like 120 dollars
really good decent
and then it's like okay I'm only gonna
have like time warner cable or or you
know files for about a year anyways and
is one of those things where it's well I
might as well just pay the extra ten but
then I don't get to keep it but then
it's it then comes the issue of you know
if I switch to a new company and they
say oh you're like modems not compatible
with our like system which is happening
or so it just it all just is very
frustrated with microphones I don't
think I could bring I can't use my own
yeah I give him five bought one yeah
they're like nope sorry it's so
frustrating an ideal world we wouldn't
even need modems and things would just
be Wireless I mean eventually 5g man
yeah yeah that's the world of 5g but
we've got some time for that we have
many many many many years so yeah I mean
with that in mind I would probably
assume you know Google's probably not
looking into the modem market yeah I
mean I think they're looking more at
wireless solutions as opposed to
something that's that's hooked into your
face yeah connection yeah home network
is kind of a waning concept I would yeah
even look even guys like Verizon 18t
like their their vision is to connect
your home and without any wires and then
speaking yeah for them yes being on that
note though with Google Wi-Fi i would
assume that the best you know usage of
it would be in like malls like not even
homes but just like you know like think
about how big malls are right well malls
I believe used more professional grade
yeah vendors right they have like you'll
see those giant modems not attached
throughout the mall um creating its own
mesh network I think that's a little bit
more business great like Google Wi-Fi
probably can handle the kind of capacity
that's requiring them all yeah going
back over to the Samsung will take a
couple more questions before we have to
wrap it up if it's universally a battery
problem why has only a fraction of like
one percent actually quote-unquote
exploded makes no sense why is no one
talking about the third party cheap
charging cables I mean that's that's a
good point that except excellent point
that definitely I think makes that
betting increases the risk of an
explosion I think the fact that it's
just a tiny fraction it's not guarantee
that these phones are going to blow up
but I think it's just a matter of the
design the way it's all packed in
increases the odds of it yeah doesn't
mean that's guaranteed there's a lot of
faction
to play here but it's simply one more
concept of a liability right in this
case and also it's not least it's not
like these charging cables are joined to
other phones though well that's thing
beat well Dave yet we've heard a lot
about it to some buddies these
applications to fill ya third party I
mean usually these like unknown third
party accessories for one I think you
should just never buy them never use
them but they do contribute to the
problem I know but I don't know if it
seems like the note 7 problem is more
isolated to specifically to the battery
it's not it's not the cable the cable
stuff is sort of standard problem
throughout the industry yeah the node 7
problem is its own issue I mean I have
more than a few amazon basic cable's
floating around my home because they are
very cheap and now I'm really starting
to reconsider my decisions after seeing
what's going on are those things my five
for iPhones are they mfi I don't
compatible like you know if you buy a
third party one will usually say a math
I were made for iphone or made for ipad
that usually maybe I should start paying
better that's more the sort of the seal
that Apple grants to third parties
that's sure is that this actually works
as a problem wasn't that part of the
problem they were manufacturing fake
yeah so some of them were so yeah and if
you do yeah a lot of the counterfeit
stuff that I that I've seen from that
warehouse yeah so they they also had
fake boxes and like fake labeling on
that too so yeah it's really already
else yeah it's pretty easy to make a
label up yeah yeah one more can you
hardwired the Google routers through the
house if cat5 is run throughout the
house are they explicitly wireless I
know that they have an ethernet port on
they do have a corner yeah okay sorry
this dress I mean that would be a lot of
trouble though your warrants what's the
point of that oh yeah I mean you can but
it just seems like a lot of trouble to I
guess guarantee what he sayin he's
already got that kind of pre run and
thinking about updating hard way yeah
yeah they all have supplement we all
have yet reports yes I take it back one
more one more broad sweeping what are
your predictions for companies in 2017
Apple Google Amazon wow that's a very
well uh I think I may be covering this a
little bit more before
we wrap it up yeah we see on season but
maybe put it in the back your heads for
now yeah that's something to think about
it might come out the iphone 8 maybe I'm
phone x iphone ex that's my bold
prediction they're gonna be branded and
well well do and i also do you think
Samson's going to come back with a note
8 from every indication from them I feel
like they should scrap the whole brand
but I think they're gonna come back um
i'm looking for a ten try to erase their
memories of of exploding phones and then
yeah i think google is going to try to
research tablets a little bit more of
this whole Andromeda thing no i think i
think their next big priority is getting
the the wearable like we talked about
crappy the wheels are right now getting
the watch sort of back on track because
they kind of dropped not drop the ball
but they've kind of they've
deprioritized android wear this year and
i think we're gonna see them
tri-valley's build back the market
similar what they did the pixel phone i
think we'll see some sort of pixel like
watch revy saying the pixel stuff is
going to blow up next year figuratively
oh oh yeah Matt not samsung Angela yes I
think I already doing easy joke I know
we made yeah it's already been hailed as
like what the best android phone this
year I mean yeah well you know what like
their best android phone title changes
every month with like the newest android
phones yeah alright we've gotta wrap it
up there we do i want to put one pitch
