Center where team moon express is
testing a prototype version of their
lunar lander it's all in pursuit of the
20 million dollar Google Lunar XPrize
awarded to the first team to land on the
moon cover 500 meters and send a
high-definition video back to earth all
the while moon Express wants to be that
team we're doing our first pad test
today so it's a very exciting day the
vehicle is all integrated we have
propulsion that came from a propulsion
development facility in Huntsville
Alabama our avionics and our design and
our structures came from our
headquarters and not do it now so Ames
and we have our facilities here at the
Shuttle Landing Facility at NASA Kennedy
where we've integrated the vehicle built
it and now we're testing it is a version
of our Lander that has some fidelity the
flight systems it's not 100% fidelity
our idea is that we gradually will
reduce risk with ever increasingly
complicated flight test articles and so
this is our first one and we're doing it
specifically to reduce this risk and
hopefully win some of the groover watch
prize money the point of the test is to
show that the lunar lander can both take
off and land again on the moon and
that's important because Moon Express is
taking a very different approach to that
500 meter window that I talked about the
teams have to move 500 meters either
above below or across the surface of the
Moon how they do that is up to them and
Moon Express has decided that rather
than building a robot they'll simply
take off move 500 meters and land again
thus completing the mission objectives
so we're flying a fuel tank we're using
modern structures modern materials and
exponential technologies that have D
materialized a lot of the avionics down
at a very very small thing so we have a
small vehicle that once it's in Earth
orbit it can make it all the way to the
surface that would by itself my name is
Eleanor crank here I've been expressed I
am a GMT slash flight software engineer
writing software for an application is
going to go so far away I mean it starts
off with a little unreal until you start
making more and more progress and
realizing like oh man we're going to
have to actually let this thing go at
some point once we get close to the
surface of the moon we start wanting to
use ground relative moon relative
measurements in order to figure out
where the spacecraft is so we'll start
taking radar pings of the surface of the
Moon and then again start using imagery
to do feature matching and determine the
velocity of the spacecraft with respect
to the surface so we'll be testing the
dynamics of the vehicle how the
propulsion works and how the avionics
works and controls the vehicle and
behind me is our Mission Control Center
we're conducting those tests today we're
still waiting to hear back from the
judges on whether or not moon Express
did complete their objectives but it's
another test in the bag and a long way
to go before they get to the moon and
hopefully go chasing after that twenty
million dollar XPrize everyone do
something good yeah we go I'm Tim

Lunar XPrize
