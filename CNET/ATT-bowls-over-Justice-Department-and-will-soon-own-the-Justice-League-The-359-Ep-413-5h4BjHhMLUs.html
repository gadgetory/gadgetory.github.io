Ben Fox ribbon I'm Afra dang 18 t scored
a huge victory yesterday when a judge
ruled that it was able to it's able to
complete its acquisition of Time Warner
for eighty five point four billion
dollars this was a complete victory for
18 T over the Justice Department which
had sued to block this deal the judge
basically criticized the Justice
Department for such bringing such a weak
case and suggested to them that if they
want to you know stay this decision that
the judge wouldn't even do it so no
concessions basically a complete victory
18 t is free to basically remake how the
media world's gonna look like and it's
gonna look a lot more like Comcast right
Comcast did this with NBC Universal many
years ago and now AT&amp;amp;T is gonna look a
lot more like that I would probably say
that's exactly right Comcast both as a
service provider as well as runs NBC
Universal so both content and an
internet provider 18 t is now gonna be
very similar the ironic thing is if the
Justice Department had just asked for
certain concessions like maybe there was
they probably would've gotten them they
got them from Comcast combo has had to
agree to certain net neutrality rules
for several years after the demerger 18
t is basically getting this deal with no
concessions I feel like didn't they ask
for concessions and AT&amp;amp;T said no sue us
so that's what happened basically the
Justice Department went overboard they
said well well we'll consider this deal
if you sell off big parts of Time world
like CNN like the matters that was core
to ATT strategy Comcast didn't have
those kinds of concessions they
basically I just had to agree to do
certain things they did have to sell a
lot of assets oh yeah so they're
basically 18 t with the complete win so
AT&amp;amp;T streaming service vs. Netflix
coming out well there is a DirecTV now
streaming service that they're already
pushing very hard now they've got the
added ammunition of Time Warner's
content on top of that mmm so this isn't
just about 18 T Time Warner this is
potentially gonna kick off a number of
deals Comcast has already said that
they're prepared to make a bid for Fox
already has a deal of Fox that if you're
a big comic book fan following all this
stuff Disney owns the Avengers Fox has
rights to x-men the idea was if those
two merged would be able to get some
sort of super Marvel crossover there
above Comcast whoops in buys Fox instead
we're not gonna see that so how does
this AT&amp;amp;T merger kind of open the door
for that though
basically Comcast had said a few weeks
back we're prepared to make a bid for
Fox we're just waiting to see what
happens with the AT&amp;amp;T time order
decision and the fact the decision went
so overwhelmingly positive for 18t
basically opens the door for a bunch of
companies to look at other companies for
acquisitions right and that includes our
parent company CBS Viacom discovery
Lionsgate and CMC there are a lot of
smaller players out there that need to
bulk up to a certain extent to go up
against Netflix Facebook Google I mean
those companies are gigantic and little
ocbs we'll see what happens to our guys
all right lastly III still going on
Nintendo came big yesterday with several
announcements but we wanted to talk
about Super Smash Brothers ultimate
Alfred your huge fan tell me why we
should be excited so this is going to be
the largest Super Smash Brothers
ever it's got every single character
coming back about 65 Wow yeah 65 and
that's including two new ones they have
Ridley and from the Metroid series he's
the big dragon that you saw and then
inkling from the new splatoon series but
they've also been adding a lot of new
features that make it a lot more
competitive now that was a big criticism
that they've had I can talk about this
all day but I think we've run out of
time I mean bottom line like why are you
so excited what are you most looking
forward to in this game it looks like
it's actually competitive again like
there was a lot of criticism with like
the old ones where like they would add
in these new different features that
like kind of made it like not fun to
play let seems like the opposite of what
you should be doing yes
all right four more of these sort of
check us out and seen it I'm Roger Chang
I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Afra ding thanks
listening
I had a quick question
so with shielding are we back I don't
know Brian is there bad we're back never
left so what's it like I I read
something with perfect shielding or
something can you explain the tweets
that he sent out I don't know I just
read I read it something like
omega-level thing okay explain which
I'll explain I'll do it in the order
that they came in so perfect shielding
this is a concept that like you've seen
in other games like Street Fighter and
like the Dragon Ball Z fighter that's
come out to where like you can block an
attack but if you time it perfectly then
you have a better window of opportunity
to counter-attack they didn't really
have that and like the old super smash
brothers they had it in melee which was
the one for the Gamecube where if you've
timed the block perfectly it like
reflected an attack and you had like a
small a small window like there were a
lot of mechanics in this one that like
were and like the old competitive games
but to see Nintendo like directly
acknowledge that and bring that into the
game that's like pretty important just
because like for a while they've kind of
been shunning like the competitive
community yeah because it's more so like
oh we're like we're making like party
games these are like for you to have fun
it'd be like imagine if somebody played
like Wii Sports competitively mmm like
I'm sure that is a thing somewhere but
like for Nintendo to acknowledge that
like if they hosted their own like Wii
Sports tournament or something like that
that that would be like huge Nintendo
also introduced a GameCube controller
right yeah so that's the other thing too
so most of the competitive scene has
always been playing using GameCube
controllers so they didn't know if it
would be coming back for this one for
ultimate because the whole idea like the
way that the joy Kahn's work and all
this stuff I mean they introduced an
adapter for the Wii U version of it but
they didn't know if they thought like
that might have been the last one so
they're really like trying to appeal to
like the competitive scene with this one
just based on the people that they've
invited all the and his Super Smash
Brothers played competitively now yes
okay yeah I'm really kind of third at me
up there hoping that this is you have
the theme our key competitive game yeah
and then for like the Omega level stuff
that I was talking about so when you're
playing Super Smash rather
you can pick all these different kinds
of stages yep but the problem was in the
originator of melee one was that like
you could only even though there's like
25 something stages you could only
really pick like four or five of them
because a lot of the stages have all
these like stage hazards like a racecar
will come in and like hit you or
something like that because it's
supposed to be a fun party yet right
right so Omega level was something they
introduced in the Wii U version where
it's just a flat playing field it's a
completely flat and like that's kind of
what final destination was in the
GameCube version but like people only
played on that it's like really boring
if you just play the same stage over and
over again so they did a mega level
stuff for the Wii U version where every
stage can you can turn it off so there's
no stage hazards or anything like that
but then that started being boring too
in the sense that like well we're only
playing on a flat level that's why the
battlefield stuff that's new in this one
so now there's Omega levels and
battlefield levels battle feels the same
thing but it's just there's a flat
platform and then like three different
platforms and like a triangle shape that
you can like jumper okay sounds pretty
awesome play a topic that's near and
dear to your heart
I haven't played smash since 64 but i
used constantly ryan do you have any
questions no i just wanted to announce
that welcome everybody to the brand new
podcast seen it as launching called
smash net hosted by operating every
single day seven hours long he's about
that he would do it to see Alfred so
into something it's freaking me out a
little bit
he's freaking him out a little bit yeah
the Grinch's heart grew three times that
day like it looks like he's gonna be a
good game I haven't gotten my hands on
it yet but those are some rare
enthusiastic tweets from yesterday I
know yeah it looks like an awesome game
let's go ahead and farm it out to the
chat what were your favorite takeaways
from e3 I know several people are
talking about Forza and then how
pathetic was kind of met until Todd
Howard people like Todd Howard I don't
know who that is
sorry everybody and who's your favorite
player and smash and let's start with
Alfred on that one
I play Pikachu a lot like consistently
in every game these Pikachu's is like a
fun character he's fast and like yeah I
like Pikachu I so I used to play the
link a lot but that was like the n64
version those like the last version of
smash that I had played Mario sorry
you're gonna make fun of my are you yeah
whatever I switched to me I switched to
Falco for a bit in melee which is star
Fox's yeah yeah co-pilot knife it was
annoying wingman is the bird easily the
arrogant man I have played a lot with
Captain Falcon to which like you know if
you can land the Falcon punch it's the
most yes okay it's literally like f0 and
then that series died out yeah it was
like Oh
cuz Captain Falcon wasn't even in the
game right wasn't it was was first from
the game guys a racer it was a racer he
never fought was the thing it's weird
because like there are so many
characters now that are much more known
for being in smash than were ever for
the original game which is like like
yeah G characters there that made it in
like Fire Emblem Karen yeah I don't know
that was me yeah I liked Marth yeah
that's actually a really big deal so
with Fire Emblem before it was even in
the US but like Fire Emblem like March
or get introduced yeah and melee yeah
and then that actually helped like Fire
Emblem sales like skyrocket and like the
question like that's like why the series
is so successful now Wow
don't you think it's weird that they
have the Mii characters to like do they
do anything interesting yeah I mean you
can like play with them and stuff like
they have their own like certain set of
moves and then you just like put your
own face on it or whoever you want it to
be oh so you play as yourself or
whatever me that you make some people
like if they don't have the character if
the character that they wanted is not in
the game like there's they'll make it
yeah there's many costumes that you can
do yeah they all fight the same way so
like there's like some that you're gonna
get like a waluigi costume for it
because he's not in the game
there's one we're missing all right do
the questions yeah I'm from Mike Shaw
I have Direct TV now got in on their
introductory offer so I'm grandfathered
in at $35 a month for over 100 channels
an 18 t on grandfather me now that the
so this deal is not gonna affect that I
think that that's ultimately an 18 t
policy I imagine if you dig through the
fine print you'll see that they do
reserve the right to change things up
they always have that for legal reasons
but there I mean they generally have
been aggressive with pushing DirecTV now
I imagine they'd want to keep you on as
a customer and so I wouldn't be too
concerned about any real radical shifts
at least for the foreseeable future I to
add into that and maybe this sounds too
optimistic but do you think the DirecTV
now is gonna get more channels for
somebody like Mike because Time Warner
is gonna get added in you know I'm still
struggling to figure out what the
immediate impact of this is I mean
they've already got an HBO bundle he's
signed for the elimin to plan you get
HBO for free now and so they've kind of
had a cosy a relationship with Time
Warner already for instance they hold
their their annual entertainment
conference at the Warner Brothers Studio
and so I don't really know if this is
gonna lead to any more channels because
a lot of the Time Warner stuff was
already brought in so if you're a druggy
V now customer you get most of that
stuff it's really whether or not DirecTV
now can sign deals with some of the
other studios that are part of its
network hmm from Mike Brown what does
this mean for Game of Thrones and
possible prequels ah well the game of
thrones will still continue to be on HBO
you'll be able to watch it 18 t will own
these oldest content but I don't think
they're gonna do anything radical to
shift things Game of Thrones is a huge
franchise
those prequels are probably gonna be
blockbusters no matter what and I can't
imagine 18t would do anything to mess
that up
they call in the dragons using 18 like
the service dies out like oh wait I've
got a sprint they replace the Iron
Throne with all like just gonna it's
like a cell tower from Tyler Nichols do
you think the Disney Fox deal will
really go through I really want to see
an MCU Fantastic Four I think we all do
Tyler absolutely I'm a big fan of well
I'm not a huge fan of Fantastic Four but
I'd love to see them done justice in
film which hasn't really happened yet
but it's unclear if Comcast is coming in
and they're basically coming in with a
promise of a much larger bid than what
Disney put in so if Comcast buys Fox
then basically that crossover is done
and I know there's a there's a lot of
excitement over Avengers and x-men
getting together but that's do you
personally think and this is a lot of
speculation on on this part obviously
but Josh boy does asks would Disney or
Comcast be the more likely candidate and
I know you just spelled out how Comcast
put the larger bid in but is it really
down to dollars and cents is there other
things like the audience reach that they
can use to incentivize this deal who do
you think really got the upper hand in
its it's hard to say because Comcast
hasn't officially rolled on offer yet
it's believed to be richer than the one
that Disney wants to offer I think it'll
come down to which deal has a better
chance of getting approval from
regulators and that's not it's not about
customer reach it's ultimately like who
can get the deal done and I've heard
arguments on both sides were both
Comcast and Disney but it's at this
point a little too early to speculate
all right sir enjoy thrown shade as per
usual we all know that the MCU is miles
ahead kind of a checkmate against the
DCE you can AT&amp;amp;T actually bring
something worthwhile and comcast
cellphones
this is all just be rocking iPhone
cyborg is just a giant phone 80 is not a
Content company yeah that's so why would
they do any differently that no concern
I mean this company will be run by an
18-2 executive John stanky
exactly oh yeah the stank I don't think
been very mature guys he's gonna buy us
now he's a telecom guy he's a network
guy but he will be running the and he's
been running ATT entertainment as is now
but he'll be taking over for a Jeff
because the the time war CEO what
happens for that guy he basically runs
off and buys an island right with all
the money he has well done so I think
he'll stay on for a little while from in
an advisory position but then he's off
with his his parachute he's going
parachute but it's it's unclear I got it
we don't know what expertise 18t will
bring to to Time Warner in terms of
especially from a Content perspective
because these are these are telecom
executives they're not entertainment
executives mm-hmm I mean that's kind of
like with Comcast and NBC though right
like they didn't they for them it was
more so like Oh check it out like you
can now like watch the Olympics on like
your podcast app something like that so
isn't it more of like a reach definitely
more of a reach more integration that
content into its various services and
yeah if you look at how Comcast has been
run like they they've generally done
pretty well I think that run fairly
independently and like Universal has
been a pretty successful studio since
Comcast took over thanks in part to Fast
and Furious the franchise right and HBO
is like the Golden Goose in this whole
situation
yeah so yeah the expectation that AT&amp;amp;T
would try to like mess with that too
much to me seems really unlikely and
that's funny I'm keep doing unless
they're the ones who like push the pedal
on more Game of Thrones prequels like
let's just greenlight basically the
entire it network if it has Thrones
prequels I don't know it could happen
yeah at this point it's really early to
say what they'll do or if they'll do
anything so one one element that we
haven't thrown out there yet is
president Trump so do you think that
because President Trump had argued about
this deal publicly and has complained so
consistently about CNN right that that
had any indication about what the judges
position was because of like if the
Justice Department decides to appeal
could could it be viewed as political or
what have you there was definitely a lot
of speculation about what they're not
this was politically motivated
ultimately I think the judge sort of I
think he he didn't take those arguments
at all he didn't he didn't allow for any
of the Trump stuff to be admitted in the
course so I think he made his ruling
solely based on the merits of that deal
and yeah because I don't think anyone
will 18 t might have been and might have
benefit from that but the Justice
Department in Trump obviously we're not
benefited from the Trump factor being
part of that case because that wouldn't
really hurt them but as far as we can
tell politics didn't play a role in the
ruling
gotcha here's one more good thought to
consider we automatically kind of go to
the whole Justice League and comic book
franchise assets because nerds but there
are lots of pieces to these puzzles to
these mega corporations broadcast
networks serene joy asks do you think
Fox's broadcast rights to the FIFA World
Cup will be a pivotal aspect of the bids
considering that US Canada Mexico won
the 2026 World Cup host ooh that's a
really good question
I imagine that yeah that that'll play a
big role those are those are valuable
rights let's see the International
actually makes it to the World Cup
because they're not i but i imagine yes
that's that's a big fat big factor in
the calculation for for both companies
anything else we can think of that might
also be mega contender like I'm kind of
wondering that if there did the bid
swooped in and just nicks the DCE you as
in exactly done particularly well like
well we just see the Justice League go
away well I don't think they bought I
don't think they go see you know I mean
it's it's part of the package I mean if
if I were John stanky for a day I would
the first thing I would do would go
anything all right
let's reboot the DC you know we need to
start all over
it's a complete mess but only Wonder
Woman stay yes you're right what are you
six around you know rehearsed her film
didn't really I feel like it didn't
really hide that much into the rest of
the like you could probably act was a
good reason yeah so yeah reboot
everything but one Roland
because one of the woman's pretty good I
mean that's what DC does is just kind of
reboot stuff over and over again that's
that's the comic-book industry right
true but DC are kind of a granddaddy
like look we complain about how the DC
movies learn as enjoyable or successful
as the Marvel ones but don't they make a
ton of money yes well so the Justice
Justice League film while it did make a
lot of money from an absolute
perspective it did it done progressively
worse mmm the Justice League I think did
worse than Suicide Squad did worse than
Wonder Woman but you know like though
and that was expected to be like they're
there big fella meaningful film with
Superman and Batman like two of the most
recognizable characters in all pop
culture and it's somehow does you're
forgetting Superman do like really well
they're forgetting the reviews are
negative and it didn't it didn't
generate interest for next films like as
evidenced by the Justice League mmm a
reboot a teen teen reboot the Justice
League and all DC you heard it for
Wonder Woman thank you you heard it here
first all right I think that's about it
I'm gonna get a call from you teen teens
can aspire so hard we are at a time
thanks everybody and thanks for being
patient with us during the rocky turmoil
scheduling here but we're back we're
good
