your Google ishes for all the happenings
inside the world of Google let's jump
into the show and the tech world is
still buzzing about the Apple watch that
even upstage galaxies s6 and s6 edge
release and the latest estimates from
slice intelligence point to Apple
selling 1 million pre-orders over the
weekend which is more than all of the
Android wear devices shipped out in 2014
now the numbers are small and that's
really more indicative of an entire
product category that still has to
figure itself out but maybe there's a
place for these devices that act as a
fitness band that also tells time that's
what a sous is trying to do with their
VEVO watch that will bring an impressive
10-day battery life to its fitness
centric watch with more details coming
this week at the Milan design week now
android wear might not be making a big
impact on the market just yet but
according to comscore android is still
the market leader with 52.8 percent of
the mobile OS share market with Apple at
41.7 and Microsoft at three point five
percent and if you feel left out of the
hole all gold everything watching
smartphone trend for just four hundred
dollars Vietnamese based Kara Lux will
bling out your galaxy s6 or s6 edge with
24 karat gold plating just around the
sides and it's about a three hour
process just in case you want to do that
alright according to a Wall Street
Journal report a small team within
Google X projects is working on battery
tech led by one of apple's former
battery experts dr. ramesh bhardwaj now
the group has only four people it
started in 2012 and the team is not only
working on improving current lithium-ion
tech but also developing solid-state
batteries as well we know battery life
is one of the real first world problems
that gadget lovers constantly face so
the goal is to make improvements that
can be integrated into many projects
like phones and tablets or bigger ideas
from google like glass and project loon
alright Google's project tango is one of
their killer projects we've talked about
that combines 3d motion tracking with
depth sensing to let your mobile device
know where it is and how it moves
through space it's still being sold on
an in
only basis but some users are receiving
emails offering the tango tablet at half
the price now the dev kit was previously
being sold for around one thousand
dollars but is now being offered at the
special price of 512 before Google opens
up sales more broadly to the general
public now the galaxy s6 and s6 edge
continue to impress in reviews and are
being touted as the best phone samsung
has ever designed to date which really
is exactly what Samsung was trying to do
samsung expects the supply of the essex
edge specifically to be constrained at
launch due to difficulties manufacturing
the device the essex is really the first
great phone of 2015 but there's plenty
competition that wants to be in that
conversation such as LG's highly
anticipated g4 phone which will launch
on April to 28 now leaked photos already
have shown off a stitched leather like
backing in multiple colors as well as a
hard shell backing with the geometric
surface LG itself recently revealed it
will come with a 16 megapixel camera
with an f 1.8 aperture the widest
developed by LG the front side will
bring an 8 megapixel camera and we
already know it will come with a 5.5
inch quad HD screen and an all new
interface alright the league shots of
the Sony Xperia z4 keep on coming this
one in black there's still no official
announcement date but the amount of
leaks point2 sooner rather than later
and if you want to brag about having the
biggest and baddest smartphone screen
sharp is touting that production of
their 5.5 inch ultra HD 4k resolution
screen will start in 2016 with a massive
806 pixels per inch now even if you
can't even see all the pixels from your
turn 2k displays and many people
consider it overkill get ready for more
coming soon to a phone near you alright
that's going to do it for this week's
show you can always email us at google
issues at cnet com or tweet me a brian
Tong and i'll respond thanks for
watching it we'll see you next time for
some more of that Google Isha's
