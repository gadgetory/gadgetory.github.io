show that covers everything related to
alphabet Inc if you don't know what
alphabet is you haven't been watching
this show I'm your guide ayahs actor and
most of you are the audience of
majesticness some of you are in the
angry audience some of you are in the
bad audience but either way I appreciate
you being the audience today we're going
to focus on Google things we'll talk
about fortnight again the note 9 is real
and notch's but first up the pixel can't
stop leaking let's head on over to pixel
Park a video popped up online showing
off what looks to be the pixel 3xl yep
still got that deep not and a big fat
chin
it looks like it's running Android Pie
as the person thumbs through the
settings you can see an option for
squeeze and release for assistant that
suggests you can launch assistant by
squeezing the phone sides like the pixel
tubes active edge feature the model in
the video has 64 gigabytes of storage
the white back looks like it's glass it
even has the Google G on the rear
there's a green power button or pizzazz
on the bottom is a USB C port and a SIM
slot it also looks like it has an
always-on screen the description of the
YouTube video says the pixel 3 XL has a
snapdragon 845 processor 4 gigabytes of
RAM and a screen rest of 29 60 by 1440
there are also pictures online that show
us PC earbuds and a headphone jack 2
USBC adapter which would be included in
the box hey Google if you're watching
this how about just jumping the gun and
released the pixel 3 now we've got like
50 days until the rumored October 4th
launch date go all Don Draper and change
the conversation anyway fortnight's is
out for android if you play the game on
the upcoming note 9 or the tab s4 you
get an exclusive skin called
galaxy also remember you can't get the
game in the Play Store you'll have to
head on over to fortnight comm let's
head on over to Android Avenue
Samsung held its unpacked event and it
was crazy underwhelming the note nine
starts at $1,000 for the 128 gigabyte
model and cost a whopping one thousand
two hundred and fifty dollars from the
top-of-the-line nine is it amazingly
different than the note eight not really
yeah the note nine has a bigger screen a
huge battery faster processor and more
storage by default the biggest
difference is the stylus the new snazzy
S Pen has bluetooth and can act as a
remote for your phone the pen gets
charged by the note 9 if it dies it
still works as a stylus one minute of
charge gets you three minutes of
bluetooth usage hey that's a neat
feature but it's not a must-have feature
also pretty much everything that was
leaked about the note 9 was true
honestly the more interesting stuff was
that ridiculous looking speaker called
the Galaxy home and the new Galaxy watch
but since that has little to nothing to
do with Android it has no place on this
show
Android police reports that a new
Android phone is coming from Palm
they'll be available on Verizon network
take a look at the picture Android
police says it's codenamed papito
because of course it is papito
what have a 3.3 inch screen yeah you
heard me right it is 2018 and we're
reporting on a rumor that palm is
introducing an Android phone but there's
more it would be running a Snapdragon
435 processor and pac-3 gigabytes of RAM
but Peto also has a tiny 800 milli amp
hour battery for some reason what is
happening also wasn't palm dead didn't
HP heat them up and run palm into the
ground
I had to Wikipedia this turns out the
palm brand was sold to TCL in 2014 or
2015 in news you guys told me you don't
care about the red hydrogen one phone
will launch November 2nd on AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon if you preorder the phone and as
you told me you have not you'll get it
October 9th if you're new to this show
the red hydrogen one phone is an Android
device that claims to have a holographic
display our fantastic audience now known
henceforth as the alphabet citizens have
compared the idea to the Nintendo 3ds
and are not impressed
I personally
to believe over at the Android
developers blog Google is laying down
the law on notches the post says devices
may only have up to one cut out on each
short edge of the device that means that
you won't see multiple cutouts on a
single edge or more than two cutouts on
a device you won't see a cut out on the
left or right long edge of the device
within these constraints devices can
place cutouts wherever they want yeah
you tell them Google on to comment Cove
this is a partner show where we shine a
spotlight on the best audience the world
you guys Jasper says can you please give
me a shout-out sure
what up Jasper and zero five one d3 says
when's the last episode of this show
can't wait and zero five one d3 keep
watching every episode is the last
episode
Fujin crypto report says what do people
use the note for anyway it seems very
large not very aesthetically beautiful
and possibly a waste what is its purpose
and target market how many are sold
compared to other phones hey foo John I
actually use a note as my personal phone
one day I was writing out some thoughts
on cocktail napkins while my pixel 2xl
was also there
I was mind mapping I stared in my phone
and the napkins and thought why on earth
can I just write on my phone so I traded
my pixel for a note so maybe it's for
weirdos like me thanks to everyone for
their comments if you didn't know I read
every comment and respond to as many as
I can
