dimension I'm Bridget Carey with CNET
and this is a first look at Mattel's
upcoming viewmaster this is an updated
version of that classic toy but this
time it's in virtual reality Mattel has
partnered with Google and Google's
cardboard virtual reality technology
essentially this is a very elaborate
case for a smartphone you'll be able to
fit many types of phones in here not
just Android phones but even iPhones
that's the goal and with an app from
Mattel you'll be able to go into a
virtual reality world now this is just a
prototype of what it will look like when
it comes out in the fall the demo we got
was in a cardboard case Mattel has made
this nice plastic case so kids obviously
can't drop it and break it maybe parents
feel a little more safe handing their
kid a smartphone with a case like this
but essentially the technology is doing
the same exact thing that you have now
with Google cardboard when you activate
the app you're seeing two different
images and through the lenses it's
creating this 3d world instead of those
classic wheels that you fit in this
doesn't go in the holder this is really
just a plastic collectible that the app
recognizes when you look at it by
pointing your view master to whatever
icon you have it'll activate a world
where you see dinosaurs floating in
front of you maybe you'll see a solar
system it's a way for Mattel to sell
collectibles you'll get a pack of four
for $15 the viewmaster itself will be on
sale for $30 I'm Bridget Carey and
that's your first look at Mattel's
upcoming virtual reality version of the
viewmaster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
