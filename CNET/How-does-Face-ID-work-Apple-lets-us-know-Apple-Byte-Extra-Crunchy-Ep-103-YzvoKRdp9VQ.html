my name is Steven Beecham and you were
watching the Apple byte extra crunchy
podcast with your host mr. Brian Tom
what's up everybody I see you I see you
I hear you welcome to the show it's
episode 103 Apple byte extra crunchy you
know we keep it extra Munchie
you guys gals crunch that crunch at
beach that was weird that sounds weird
yeah it was gross I heard what it sounds
like when you eat now just thanks man
print pretty team pretty team something
like that all right
okay everybody guys and gals you'll make
this show what it is call us
1-866-376-8255 okis on photo and facial
analysis this is a according to
TechCrunch Apple does did confirm it by
basically saying in quote Apple buys
smaller technology companies from time
to time and we generally do not discuss
our purpose or plans now what makes
Regained interesting and special
is we know in case you haven't kind of
played around with Apple's Photos app
you can type in the word like in the
search bar at the top you can type in
dog you can type in sunset and it does
have some ability to analyze photos and
show you those types of photos on the
spot but what regain does this kind of
takes it to the next level and they've
developed a computer vision API that can
actually extract what they call
game-changing insights and what do I
mean by that well for example you might
not you instead of saying a dog or
sailboat or lion it's finding the
specific one whether it's based on color
even specific types of boats but I
thought was really cool is it can
actually detect faces duh but it can
actually sort them by their emotion like
happy sad maybe neutral or so it's kind
of taking this not only do you have
facial recognition of people now we can
start talking about what their
expressions actually are so it's getting
even deeper and this could have some
really cool implications because you
know they talk about how can identify
gender and age and emotion I'm not sure
exactly what age meaning young or old
that's interesting but this this these
api's and this technology that they have
could also unfortunately be applied to n
emojis or or let's let's think bigger
and think about just facial the the
front-facing camera hopefully there's
some more things that it can be that can
be done with it
beyond and emojis so can I be like find
me a picture of my dog chasing a bird or
something like that and you'll be able
to find a dog chasing a bird like I'm
seeing a picture right here there's like
ah there's like some animal I think it's
like an antelope or something oh that's
a gazelle
yeah and it's like it's running by some
zebra or something so you can you can
cut maybe get very granular and ask
questions like that cuz I know Google
does this and like I can ask you know I
can like search like the beach and like
Google photos and then it'll show me all
the pictures of
I took my family at the beach and you
know I probably like a park or something
or you know so this is a little more
this is really cool yeah it is cool and
the other place where this could come in
handy I don't know how many of you guys
and gals all use this but I use memories
like way more than I ever thought I
would that feature were they like
mishmash a bunch of pictures and photos
from a trip or an event man and I like
I'm sorry like I'll keep it real with
you sometimes I'm looking at that stuff
and I'm getting a little I'm again a
little emo I'm getting all up in my
feelings sometimes when I look at that
stuff I don't know about you but yeah it
made one for my son which is crazy
Google Google photos made one for my son
so it's a lot of pictures of him growing
up since he was a little baby and it got
me you know when I was watching it but
it's totally funny because the algorithm
is still a little left up because I shot
like this gangster rap video like last
year and it keeps like appearing in
there so it'd be like kids pictures of
my kid at the park and like riding his
bike and all of a sudden be like these
two dudes are like doing gangster rally
like a second oh you showed me that yeah
yeah it did it again just like when the
last like week or so it made another
video here's the thing that you need to
check you need to check if the memories
if the memories video you that it made
it could have actually been from a
specific point in time and not just your
like your son's might have been in a lot
but it could say memories from the third
week of July and that just happens to be
in there that's why it might be in there
could be could be yeah you're just
saying so okay anyways yeah so it's it's
cool though I really like this this is
one of those small acquisitions we won't
see but I just pray I pray so hard that
they do more than an emojis with this
acquisition of regained I'm just gonna
I'm gonna put my hands together and just
be like come on don't don't kill me with
this all right so that's really cool
another story that dropped early this
week really pretty much I think just a
day ago or so the FCC getting pressure
from the National Association of
Broadcasters is asking and not only
asking urging Apple to protect the
safety of Americans by activating
the FM radio chip in iPhones now this is
I think I'm for that I think I am
climbing up
I am totally for that here's the thing
according to Apple based on the chips
that they are using they are saying this
is a quote and a response from Apple
Apple cares deeply about the safety of
our users especially during times of
crisis and that's why we have engineered
modern safety solutions into our
products users can dial emergency
services and access medical ID card
information directly from the lock
screen and we enable government
emergency notifications ranging from
weather advisories Amber Alerts etc etc
iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models do not have
FM radio chips in them nor do they have
antennas designed to support FM signals
so it's not possible to enable FM
reception in these products that is from
Apple we know write FM radio
that is an important way of
communication and disseminating
information because there's gonna be a
time where these cell towers they're not
gonna be working I know that in Houston
they kept them up and running which was
incredible and amazing right that was
really the link that most people had but
again you can't expect that in all
different kinds of countries different
types of situations where technology is
not in place that is not nearly as
advanced or the system just gets
completely knocked out an FM radio
old-school tech still matters yeah like
they could definitely use that in Puerto
Rico right now who has no communication
and I don't think they have any
electricity or anything but um yeah
we've always been told by those wind-up
radios you know and I have lined up
radio but it would be awesome if I had
my iPhone and I can just listen on my
iPhone to use like solar powered or
something during a natural disaster but
that's a bummer that they can't just
activate them well let me take let me
take everyone back because it instantly
when I heard FM radio and Apple saying
that they couldn't do it it reminded me
of a little ditty from back in the day
called the iPod Nano now if you remember
the iPod Nano the at least the 6th gen
I'm not sure if the fifth gen can do it
it was a little square right you could
clip it on it had us
Green the thing about this product is
that you could listen to FM radio on the
iPod Nano and let me tell you how and
why you could do that when you plug the
headphone into the headphone jack the
headphone acted as the FM radio antenna
that's genius that is all right what
phones do not have a headphone jack that
could support an antenna in the
headphones that iPhone 8 and upcoming
iPhone 10 so all I'm saying other
companies are making great phones
I'm not pooh-poohing on Apple right now
everyone knows this people that listen
this know we all are coming from the
same perspective we love Apple we love
technology but other companies are also
doing things samsung has a headphone
jack
in a all screen OLED curved display that
is also ip68 rated so it can go
underwater has better water protection
than Apple it has a headphone jack in
there and they could support FM radio
because they could plug that headphone
in and use the wire of the headphone as
the antenna that's a genius um so does
Android do that now like I I really
don't know I you know what off the top
of my head I don't know but I believe I
feel like they'll at least with the s6
and the s7 they had an FM radio app so
I'm gonna I'm gonna go out on a limb and
say yes but people that can correct us
right now whether in the chat or not can
tell us no but I just found that really
funny how you know apple says yeah we
don't have any way to support an FM
antenna
oh poor son that's really it's really
smart that you figured that out man
that's funny so um there there you go
the request the request is in bring back
the headphone we have a legit we have a
legit need for it now big time
the FCC all right as we talk about
iPhone iPhone stuff a lot of issues have
started to pop up we're gonna talk about
some of these issues just to educate you
all and just let you know what is going
on the
first one is specific to the iPhone 8
and 8 plus reports first started coming
out of the verge that said hey there's a
static noise issue that is affecting
iPhone 8 and a-pluses specifically in
the earpiece and Apple has confirmed
that in that is true when you're on
calls you might get this gnarly nasty
static sound on your iPhone 8 knife own
8 plus they are working on a software
fix it is not part of the latest updates
that have been released but it is there
it is a known issue that they're working
to fix on and this is the other thing
when we talk about iOS 11 a report
recently came out that the adoption rate
with iOS 11 is really is really advanced
it typically is people that are Apple
fans want to adopt it and just bring it
on no matter what version of the phone
you have and we got a lot of calls from
this and I wanted to kind of answer it
within the show of when is a good time
to update your phone or what's the right
time now iOS 11 up to this point and I
think it has updated but the last time
analytics were collected by Mixpanel it
was around 25% of the user base of all
iOS devices had updated to iOS 11 that
seems small man
one week after no do if you if you talk
about Android because they're so
fragmented they'll be under they'll be
less than 1% oh I see yeah because
people are really far back versions so I
just clicked on a link the latest
Mixpanel
update says it's at 28 point five five
percent of iOS users are on iowa's 11
but that also comes with its caveats
with its issues and problems the biggest
issue everyone is talking about it's
what we want to talk about is battery
life issues with your phone so people
once they put on iOS 11 they were happy
and I recall this happening honestly a
little bit in iOS 10 where when you
first installed iOS 10 battery life was
really cruddy and what was happening it
was optimizing your phone in your iOS
behind the scenes but what we found is
it's actually lasted longer than a few
days and a lot of people that have
iPhone 6 is iPhone 6s and some iPhone 7s
but you don't hear it as much for my
phone
their battery life is literally going to
crap now our security like when I say
crap I'm talking about you could lose
you could drop your battery within just
a few hours like more than 50% some some
crazy stuff like that is actually
happening and this is not isolated a few
people we put out the question out there
on on the recent Apple bite video
podcast and everyone's saying like
Iowa's 11 is killing my battery only a
few people said it didn't according to
security research firm Wan Dara they
analyzed the performance of 50,000
moderate to heavy iPhone users on iPhone
and iPad that were both using iOS 10 and
iOS 11 now there's a chart down there if
you scroll down based on what they found
and the results were not very glamorous
or pretty at all devices on iOS 11 burn
through power at a much faster rate than
those running iOS 10 taking an estimated
this is with use 96 minutes of use to
drain a full battery this is like
actively using it with iOS 11 versus 240
minutes for iOS 10 that's a big deal
I've literally had people say I've been
using my phone and it dropped from 100
to like 40 percent in a few hours I was
using my phone last night and I dropped
from 26% to like 5% it felt like in 45
minutes to an hour I'm like that's
extreme that's that's really extreme so
Apple did release a little update iOS 10
sorry excuse me
iOS 11 point 0.1 that was to address a
Microsoft Exchange server error with
emails it hasn't addressed the actual
battery life issues they've released a
public beta for both iOS 11 Mac owes
High Sierra 10.30 2.1 in TV OS 11.1 but
i want it i don't know if people are
writing comments in in the video in
youtube and livestream but a lot of
people are still telling me they have
major issues specifically with their 6
and 6s yeah this this makes me scared to
update I have an update in mind yet so
I'm kind of gonna wait yeah I don't
think you should I'm not going to
because I have the 6s but I'm looking at
the chat room I'm not seeing a lot of
activity right now
but people can snow you know I it's just
that on our video we posted it everyone
is coming out and saying I think the
thing that and people had asked me this
in the phone calls and we decided to
kind of bundled in here this is kind of
best way to think about when you upgrade
your operating system and Apple has done
that is been merciless in doing this I
in general I really think the best the
only type of phones that should get the
latest software update that typically
helps it perform better in general I'm
saying is if you have a phone from the
year before so if you're an iPhone 7
user I would say iOS 11 is an ok update
now again it's actually been very buggy
in general there's been a lot of like
display alignment issues with iOS 11
where sometimes the time and the my
signal just doesn't show up at the top
it literally like on when I use male and
when I'm using messages it's just
completely white and I'm like what and
there's a lot of things that are out
there that people are talking about how
much more buggy it is and we start to
kind of see that in general and I think
it's just because there's so many
devices out there and also Apple is just
doing too many things but if you have a
phone that is 2 years or older compared
to the iOS release so let's say you're
on a 6s or 6 honestly would not
recommend upgrading to the new operating
system because it is typically hammered
the performance of those devices that
aren't Hardware wise as well-equipped
and optimized to handle the newest stuff
and the new bells and whistles that iOS
the latest iOS demands
I just don't think if you have a phone
that's 2 years older or more you should
really upgrade your phone in general
because you're not gonna get as good
performance you just aren't I've done it
before it doesn't work as well yeah
we're starting to get a lot of comments
in the chat room now like divine
feelings says iOS 11 is really killing
my battery
Daniel Byrne our Daniel Bernard says yep
mine sucks now and then Justin loving
says new operating system means bugs
they'll never they'll get it worked out
so I mean you know you've said I've
learned this from listening to you Brian
it's you know usually wait like a week
or so before you do
and I did I saw that they were already
patch updates happening so I'm like okay
they're fixing little things here and
there so I might still wait like another
week or two before I update my phone and
then of course CNN L has all these
videos like here's the changes you need
to you know here's setting changes you
want to make right away after you update
me I mean they're usually helpful and
like little you know little things you
know they're helpful but then you
cripple aspects of the phone like okay
fine turn on your brightness that's
normal but when you tell when you tell
the phone don't fetch for email as often
I mean if you're getting an email every
second that's gonna be an issue and some
people there's in the mail settings
there's kind of an auto fetch right we
love this every time an email gets sent
and the server gets pinged we know about
it it really shouldn't take up that much
more battery if you leave the fetch
feature on it just shouldn't kill your
battery where you where you literally
lose like 30 40 percent in a few hours
like without really that sounds like a
nightmare man you get to you know you
get in your community one's already dead
almost and then it you know what it and
then people get pressuring upset and
some people like wait was it me as my
battery messed up is it what's going on
that's why we have this lovely thing
called the Internet imagine the days
where the internet didn't exist where
you can post something and like try and
find out if other people are having the
same problem right so this is a real
thing and it's happening and so the
classic thing is always off you have a
phone that's two years old and you
update the latest iOS it's gonna hammer
your battery you're like I need to get a
new phone and voila a new phone is out
perfect I'm magic it's magical
perfect timing brother alright so I just
just be aware of what's going on with
that before we take a break we do want
to talk about a little bit of the iPhone
X coming out we've talked about kind of
how it could be pretty hard to get I
think it's gonna be a lot harder than
people think this is the latest reports
are talking about how pre-orders are
going to exceed the actual demand or
sorry pre-order demand is gonna exceed
the actual quantity that's going to be
available for the iPhone 10 so let's
talk about reports that are coming out
of supply chain from multiple outlets it
started with the Nikkei Asian review
others picked up on it digit times Wall
Street Journal but the Nikkei Asian
review reports that yield rates
basically the percentage of components
that meet Apple's quality requirements
is lower than expected for the 3d sensor
part that is part of the whole true
depth sensor at the top of the iPhone X
so the 3d sensor is not being produced
there's not enough in quantity that are
being produced and what is what is
happening is they're saying that they're
basically producing complete phones
somewhere less than 10,000 units per day
now that might sound like a lot oh wow
10,000 phones but in actuality that's
not a number that Apple tries to hit
when they're saying hey we're in mass
production we know that pre-orders are
starting October 27th right so we're
about a month away according to
estimates based on this projection
Foxconn has roughly made two million
iPhone tens to date and they should
expect to hit 10 million in October with
40 million total by the end of the year
well a lot of projections of the
pre-orders of the iPhone 10 based on
people that held out and how many users
are out there and ready to upgrade
they're expecting it to be 50 at least
around 50 million pre-orders for the
iPhone 10 so what does that mean you
might be on the pre-order but you're
you're gonna get your phone sometime in
the early 2018 that is a misnomer man so
look you want to wait in line you might
have to wait in line like legitimately a
week just to get a chance to get that
phone before anyone else and I'm gonna
cross my fingers and hope that I can get
in that group in that first batch of
online but I bet you most of us are not
I could be wrong but I bet you most of
us are not yeah and a lot of people are
not gonna get the color that they want
they probably won't get the the correct
storage size that they want like I saw a
lot of people settling for the wrong
color on the last iPhone so yeah
rose-gold everyone'll get space gray
whatever it was the it was the jet black
or whatever the piano black finish that
everybody wanted yeah yeah yeah I got it
and I have a case on my phone and I
never see it really never see it got me
two serves no purpose whatsoever just a
couple other quick iPhone 10 tidbits
this was really cool Apple released a
what they call like a white paper
document detailing face ID specifically
and I think this really gives some good
insight on how face ID works and how
it's a little different than others
here's here's some of the interesting
parts of it on the outline when face ID
is disabled first of all so I'm gonna
kind of go down the list when it will
not work so here's here we go the device
has been just turned on or restarted so
face ID is disabled right you have to
enter in your passcode the device hasn't
been unlocked for more than 48 hours
it'll instantly prompt the passcode the
passcode hasn't been used to unlock the
device in the last six and a half days
and face ID hasn't unlocked the device
in the last four hours if the device has
received a remote lock command
museum-like iCloud or after five
unsuccessful attempts to match a face it
will also lock you out as well as
initiating a power off emergency SOS by
pressing and holding either volume
button unfortunately neither none of
these conditions is what caused the
Craig federighi phone to to hang up on
you know I'm I'm just I'm honestly I
think I think people walking by picking
it up are the ones that screwed that one
up honestly I think that's what happened
I'm just I'm just digging in there some
people are you me like dude what the
hell man what you hate on apples so much
I'm like it's a joke chill it's like
chill these jokes hey so it has Apple
done this before where they had to like
put out like a giant explanation of how
I I D you know their security works
sometimes I think that face ID is so new
and there's really a lot of questions
around it that it's good to have an
explainer there's there so I'll get into
it after our break but there's times
where I would like certain things
explained
that Apple doesn't touch on the key no
and then we have to figure it out and
find it out on our own like I hate that
crap it's just it's it's annoying so
here we go um we're also gonna I'll talk
about kind of how Apple also describes
we talked about sorry face ID and what
what causes it to lock you out but
here's kind of the technology of how it
works under 8 so to counter both digital
and physical spoofs meaning to prevent
photos or masks from working the truth
this is from Apple the true depth camera
randomizes the sequence of 2d images and
depth map captures and projects a
device-specific random pattern now a
portion of the a11 Bionic chip neural
engine with a secure Enclave transforms
this data into a mathematical
representation and compares that to the
face that is enrolled in the machine in
the phone this enrolled facial data
itself is a mathematical representation
of your face captured across a variety
of poses they go on to dig in a little
deeper let me just pull up the document
really quickly about how we talked about
ok what if you're wearing makeup or what
if you change your hairstyle it will
actually match your previous face at
least recognize that you have a new face
let's say if I shaved off my my goatee
or got I don't know if it can see my
eyebrows let's say it sideburns let's
say I shaved off my eyebrows it will at
least actually match the previous image
that has with it you new image be able
to identify that that is your face and
that there are some significant changes
and then update it within their system
when it looks at it and then it'll take
a picture and send it to regrain as I'll
I browse photos and be in the searchable
regrain database it does confirm that
this works with hats scarves glasses
contact lenses many sunglasses
furthermore it's designed to work
indoors outdoors and even in total
darkness yeah you know when when you're
saying it sends like is it a throwaway
code like you're saying it sends a
specific
like some sort of patter I talk to
updated they so I there's must be some
sort of authentication going on with
that as well they didn't they did they
kind of threw that out and it didn't dig
into it deep enough but it's really
interesting and like people are saying
manna fro Shamal in the in the room is
asking like really curious how would
work with twins I mean there's even
still subtle differences between twins
but I'm really curious how it actually
works like with twins twins twins
definitely they look different as they
age older but I got we got to do twins
using face ID I I know some twins we can
get in here
yeah I know some triplets but that'd be
hard to round them up cuz they're all
over the country but um this kind of
reminds me of Apple pay where you know
it sends like a throw away one time used
code for when you're using your phone to
buy purchase something it kind of sounds
similar like they're using like the same
logic around that I don't know it sound
familiar to you
I'm not sure but like I guess I just
don't understand you know they didn't
get into it but what was that randomised
pattern that is built off of your
doesn't project something on your face
that aligns with what is in the system
yes but what exactly is that pattern
that they referred to I don't know I
really don't know yeah weird but it's it
gives it shed some light on what makes
it really interesting and what makes it
very specific so look again no matter
how cool that tech is I still think it's
gonna be a little slower than touch ID
it just has to be right now yeah it it
but it'll be interesting well so we'll
see I I it is the most intriguing part
of the iPhone 10 and it's just gonna
come down a day to day use and how it
works out okay so my friend should we

church with the direct
of the movie when we were in a
junior-high Jon Chu oh wow that's cool
man horrible buddy is like he's a Big
Mac Apple fan like every time there's a
product release
we're like texting each other as the
freakin countdown is happening so he's
super high I'm super hyped about it's a
big deal it's a big deal
nice ok shall we continue with the show
my friend let's continue I just wanted
to touch base so I am going to release
an Apple watch series 3 LTE review video
today so which is Friday for people that
are listening later on so you guys in
Gao should all check that out I don't
want to get into it too deep but I've
been using this thing for my goodness
non-stop four or five days I've
literally used the watch for three days
without my phone at all to push it to
the limits uh I'll tell you the some of
the things that I don't want to tell
everything that I talking about in the
video but the battery life on this Apple
watch is dope I've been able to get
through an entire day easily and a lot
of these reviewers they were just trying
to max it down like ah you won't really
get through a day yeah because you're
trying to like put it through it's
rigged the test but I want to use it in
my daily life I take phone calls on it I
text message back and forth I used it at
the gym for an hour while listening to
music and from 9 a.m. to basically 9
p.m. I still had 22% of battery left on
it I was like impressed that's pretty
good I used I used the crap out of it
another day I had like 30% on it just
depends on how much you actually use it
so that's one of the highlights it's
killer for workouts but I think the
biggest issue that when we talked about
Apple being transparent or explaining
some of these technologies in their
documents when they pitch the Apple
watch they said hey it's gonna be able
you're gonna be able to send and receive
messages and we had found after going
through it that and asking Apple for
official confirmation is that if you
have your phone with you and you're next
to the iPhone I've started the Apple
watch you're going to be able to get AI
messages and SMS messages from non
iPhone users that makes sense
but if your phone is often you're away
from your phone and your watch is
connected to LTE and lt only not Wi-Fi
or anything like that your your Apple
can only accept iMessages no non-iphone
SMS messages can get to you on your on
your Apple watch that way which is I
have a lot of people that are on Apple
you know Apple hardware but you know
there's there's other people that do not
have iPhones and if you want to get
message from you won't the other thing
though that kind of work around that is
that if you keep your phone on at home
when you're away you should be able to
and we've tested this you'll be able to
receive SMS messages and I messages so
ultimately just don't just have your
phone on whenever you're away wherever
you go and it'll be okay
so just have it sitting on the room just
have to be connected to Wi-Fi or
anything like that yeah on your phone it
has me on connect really connected to
the cellular network but it it sounds
silly but it is really like when I was
working out and I was like listen to
music in my wireless headphones and I
was worried you know it's like like pump
in that iron bro like sweatin but then
you sweat but then you like get a text
message you respond to it you take a
call while you're listening like when
everything is literally on your wrist
and it and it and it does work for those
moments it's crazy man it's like wow I
felt like although I can't use it for
everything I felt like it was it's legit
in that way and if you're someone that's
looking for that you're gonna be happy
with it it's the actual there's other
caveats there but I think it's it's not
for everyone but if you like to work on
you like to be on the go and you want to
do that once in a while it's pretty big
it's pretty sweet but most the time
everyone has their phone with them the
thing that I missed the most by going
all Apple watch is that there are times
where I I don't have my camera on and
our phone is our camera and because it
is it really makes the phone necessary
to bring with you like if you care about
social media or you're on snapchat or
Instagram stories or all that stuff you
want your camera with you well you can't
move around with an Apple watch without
a camera so I think most people will
just have their phone with them and if
that's the case don't get an LTE Apple
watch just get a series three if you
want up great or you'll
honestly like more than happy with the
Apple watch series too and I think for a
lot of people honestly even if you have
a series one unless you want the speed
bump which is great and the Siri
interact ability with this is awesome
now I've never been the biggest fan of
Siri but it does work great on the Apple
watch series 3 because of the power it
allows you to do it natively on the
device it's it's worth the upgrade so it
it's it's really a truly a device that's
not for everyone and it never was in the
first place so it just depends on really
what's your use case but it's it's a
good product it's a good product
that is a bummer about the photos though
I mean when you're out and about you see
stuff randomly you just want to take a
picture that's a you know that's exactly
saying that is a bummer the good does
all right get that together give me that
giving it give me that dope camera on
there just to get it be like get that
perv camera on there p.m. all right um
let's just jump into the calls I think
we're just gonna skip some stories
because we just want to crank through
your calls because we don't want to we
don't want to make the show too long
Balt lives cool yeah alright thank you
guys for all calling we had a lot of
good voicemails we had a lot of
voicemails this week but we narrowed it
down to some of the highlights so here
we go
penny Beach what's up Kong it's mean J
Mack from Brooklyn we'll have the show
love everything you guys are doing so
check it I just got home after getting
the Super Nintendo classic waited like
about five hours in line and after doing
that I'm thinking about the iPhone 10
with that said if I forego doing thing
up for the pre-order what are my chances
of getting it like a week or two
afterwards or Brian do you think it's
just better to wait till 2018 for the
next set of iPhones given all the new
rumors leaking out for two sizes of o
LED panels and so forth anyone looking
forward to your answer keep it going
guys love the show peace I think it
depends on what phone you have right now
if your if it's worth upgrading for you
or not if you have an iPhone 7s and
you're not really excited about the 10
I'm sorry when I say 7s you know
an iPhone 7 I don't think you need
upgrade right now I think you're gonna
hold out because it's it's it's a nice
upgrade but you know I I'm gonna get the
10 I'm not gonna lie to you all but I
feel like it's a 9.5 instead of a 10 I
really feel like it's the iPhone 9.5
because I couldn't get that under the
glass fingerprint sensor that's okay
that they couldn't but I feel like this
is more like an iPhone 9.5 so if you
have a 6 or 6s and you're really looking
to make a big jump then do it but if
you're on a 7 and you're kind of like I
think most people are excited about the
10 and then they realize I'm probably
gonna spend $1400 for this thing and
then they realize it's it's hard I think
it's a it's hard it's just like what
it's just like what people have said
imagine if the 10 didn't come out and
all Apple had to offer was the iPhone 8
and 8 plus like literally Apple would
have been hammered by by pressed media
it was it's basically an iPhone 7 with a
glass backing and a little bump it's
it's kind of bad you know but they did
that they knew that what's happening so
that's why they got the 10 out yeah so I
think he might end up having to wait til
early 2018 anyway it's based on the
story we talked about it earlier where
you know they're not gonna be available
right away
unless you're get in real fast on that
internet on the pre-order on the
internet so truth true good luck on that
one man okay here we go next call this
is Brian from Boston he's trying to ask
about equipping devices with lanyards
like when I am my iPod Nano broke I got
a refurbished
from the Apple Store iPod Touch 5th
generation because it has lanyard and I
guess they don't make the new ones with
that but then I realize the old remotes
for the Apple TV's you can actually like
put in a lanyard and the lighting cord
so it so it works kind of like how the
Wii remotes work and I was just
wondering I wonder if they could like
put the put a linear like that a
lightning port for other devices like if
you're running with your iPhone and
stuff what make it more secure I just
thought that would be easy thing that
could do
all right thanks that that scares me
like running running with a lanyard in
your lightning port of your phone
hanging off your neck I will tell you
that a company called canoe that made
this really cool kind of mini tripod
stand they have what they use to get
inside of your phone is like a plastic
kind of tip that goes inside the
lightning port well what can happen is
as it wears out it over time it
sometimes can actually get stuck and
broken in there because it it creates
such a sturdy connection like I actually
had one that got stuck in there and I
had to like extract it with like
literally like a I got pin to like poke
it and pull it out and so to get a
really true sturdy connection that
lightning port what is out there is just
not you just can't do it I you're better
off wearing an actual lanyard necklace
with the iPhone in a pouch if you really
want to run with it that way now if
you're someone who wants to put on your
wrist then get a case with a wrist strap
but I wouldn't trust a lightning lanyard
port anything on any of my devices
yeah that sounds dangerous and it has
anyone else noticed that the Lightning
port kind of you get it gets loose you
know like my cable kind of pulls out
real easily now and it gets jostled and
sometimes they'll be plugged in it's not
even charging because it's loose in
there that seems to be happened to me a
lot too so I'd imagine that would happen
with one of those little lanyard things
he's talking about so man if I had
Photoshop I could make a really funny
gif of what you just did well I'm sure
one of the fans like oh yeah
all right hey be careful be careful you
know who you're with this is Beach and
Tom baby Internet is dangerous man
ok next call here we go did I replay
this do know Charles Patterson I was
just wondering what do you think about
the have the carrier's their new Apple
watch is not getting every carrier in
the world like in Australia
there's only two of them main ones and
then the rest are still coming thanks
hmm it's only a few carriers so what it
is it really comes down to technology I
like how he just called and they said
his name is like boom so he answers the
phone like well I'm gonna start to psych
the phone to I'm gonna be like Steven
Beecham to talk so what the answer to
question is the ECM technology is
actually not compatible with all
carriers it's not and that obviously
it's not an actual chip it's built into
the device it is it takes up less space
but because of that there's less because
of the less space right it's a different
kind of chip and so it doesn't support
all the bands it doesn't support every
carrier out there it's still new and so
that's why you don't see it with with
the Apple watch you don't see across the
board carrier coverage it's really more
of the technology and not because they
haven't struck deals with the carriers
yet okay cool all right we got two more
okay I just wanted to give a shout out
thanks for always putting these out but
um just wanted to know what's cool about
ionic 11 so far I think it's pretty
great yeah I am noticing that every time
just a little bit every time we push out
a software update it gets a little more
buggy I mean it used to be you can
always expect bugs when iOS comes out
every year but it's getting a little
more like you can and I'm not gonna say
although Steve Jobs is rolling over but
like it comes to the point where it's it
are noticing a little bit of attention
to detail drop but not much I still love
iOS 11 C good but I think it has a great
point I that's C that's a legit balance
like look at things and that's that's
the type of stuff that we appreciate
it's it is more buggy than we've seen
before and it's it's not horrible I
think the biggest issue really like we
talked about is the battery life that is
affecting a lot of people not just like
10 percent or 20 percent I feel like
it's affecting like 50 percent of users
if not more but to his point yes iOS 11
in general is bug you're like literally
when I'm in the mail app my
my wife I am battery in time disappear
like what is that all about that's never
happened ever before and there's been
some weird alignment issues even with
your notifications and all this up it's
it's I don't I don't know what's going
on there and it just the quality control
in general it's a combination of yeah
them doing too many things but it has
dropped off it there's no there's no
bones about it it's dropped off it's
gotta be hard to do man I mean there's
so much stuff in iOS now it just keeps
getting bigger it's like a it's like a
universe it's just expanding and
expanding the span yeah and they have to
like somehow refine that and then make
it different and make and prove it and
then put it into a new you know it's
like a new hardware it just seems like a
really daunting task so I'm surprised it
even you know it even works 90% of its
like a better credible you know player
profile in on our periscope he had
talked about how his screen will
sometimes just go black with iOS 11 and
he's updated it player profile in also
earlier while we were taking call says
oMG who screens these phone calls
we both do as a team all right okay we
got one left and it's a shorty kind of
here we go
Tyler McCarty
hey guys wanted to touch base with you
guys out here in the beautiful Atlanta
Georgia Hotlanta hey my question is in
regards to the Apple watch I'm getting
ready to receive my new Apple watch
Series 3 with LTE and I've seen where
you guys have talked about needing the
ear pods although I know that do I wait
and give the air prize later on whenever
they upgrade to the you know charging
wireless charging thing they've
displayed at the keynotes I've already
got the power beats 3 and I know that
they should sync with my Apple watch but
just want to hear your feedback on it
appreciate the show guys enjoy y'all
goin freedom I feel like you question
man
freedom yeah if he does the power beats
3 you know he already has a more than
capable headphone set that syncs over to
the Apple watch that uses the w1 chip
that is super fast and responsive if you
if you have money to burn yeah go ahead
and get him now but I would I would just
wait it out like you already have great
headphones that work just fine yeah but
if you look there there is an appeal
like you said Beach like you kind of got
sucked in the whole thing like damn I
kind of want Apple earpods I don't they
look really dorky but I kind of want
them right I totally do so you'd be like
that one dude that was in line for five
hours for the NES classic and then that
now he's ready to get in line for the
iPhone X no iPhone X just you know just
go spend money baby just do it baby
so I think you're fine where you're at
but you know I have work out I have the
I do have the power beats three the ones
like over my ears for for working out at
the gym but the air pods actually sound
better than them so I'm gonna be with
you I'm not a big fan of those that hook
over your ear like they just go fine I
am I am fine fine I am uncomfortable for
me I don't know I don't dig him I want
the air pods alright that's it Brian
we're done man all right bro uh remember
everybody you guys and gals can call us
