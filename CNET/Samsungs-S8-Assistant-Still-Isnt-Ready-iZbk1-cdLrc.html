Samsung's virtual assistant Bixby has
been delayed again the good news is is
that if you do have a Galaxy s8 you're
not entirely out of luck the excellent
Google assistant is already available on
your device Bixby voice was announced as
a feature on Samsung's Galaxy s8 but so
far it's incomplete in english-speaking
countries vision home and reminder are
all available but key features like
voice control are only available in
Korean this is an important launch for
Samsung which is already a little behind
the eight ball when it comes to Virtual
Assistants Apple Amazon Microsoft and
Google all have assistance already
available and so Samsung is gonna have
to step up its AI game
it appears the English version of big
speed doesn't have enough data to teach
it to function properly which is a major
disadvantage to its competitors who all
have massive amounts of user information
and install bases to learn from Samsung
hopes Bixby will start on phones like
the galaxy s 8 and then make the leap to
its smart appliances and televisions
something a little bit different than
the competition this could end up being
sort of a chicken-egg situation for
Samsung where people don't quite want to
buy into the s8 or the Bixby family of
devices until they have a phone that has
it natively and then Samsung may not be
able to actually make Bixby very good if
it doesn't have that user install base
so whatever ends up happening Samsung
better figure it out and fast for
cnet.com I'm Ashley's gonna be good
