premium YouTube and ordering gorditas on
our turbos I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your scene that update how much would
you pay to watch youtube without
advertisements YouTube's looking into
different ways to make money and that
includes paid subscriptions the news
came at a recode tech conference YouTube
has also been working on a music
subscription service and last year
youtube lit a few content owners sell
subscriptions for shows including Sesame
Street maybe we'll see other shows sell
episodes on youtube or content creators
could earn more income from fans that
pay for subscriptions to skip ads you
see the video game streaming site twitch
which was bought by amazon has seen lots
of success from paid subscriptions where
viewers don't mind paying a few bucks to
support the channels and personalities
they love when new smartphones are
announced you tend to hear lots of talk
about their size and help then they are
their screens and cameras but what
consumers really want is an improved
battery Motorola is answering that call
with the droid turbo the smartphone's
biggest feature is a battery that lasts
for forty-eight hours and it charges
fast too the phone is said to give you
eight hours of battery life after
charging it for just 15 minutes you
could only get the turbo at Verizon it
goes on sale thursday starting at two
hundred dollars with the contract and
speaking of smartphones Apple CEO Tim
Cook said more than 1 million credit
cards have been activated with Apple pay
in the first three days it went live now
some retailers are pushing back against
Apple pay and NFC technology and instead
will promote an app called currency
unlike Apple pay which keeps your
payment data private from retailers
currency will be able to track what you
buy and it works with loyalty point
programs currency is also a way for
retailers to save money and avoid paying
credit card companies a transaction fee
because it only takes payments from your
checking account the currency app isn't
fully launched yet but people have
already flooded the itunes app page with
negative comments bashing the app and
bashing the merchants that supported for
standing against NFC and Apple pay
documents for the app reveal that it
requires you to give a
disturbing amount of personal
information including your social
security number meanwhile Wells Fargo is
hoping customers won't be discouraged
it's giving twenty dollars to customers
that use Apple pay with a wells fargo
credit card and there are other
retailers doing their own thing with
mobile payments Taco Bell just launched
an app that lets you order your fourth
meal ahead of time and pay right inside
the app when you approach the store your
orders sent to the kitchen and you can
pick it up inside or at the
drive-through Outback Steakhouse will
launch an app next week i'll let you
reserve a table ahead of time that's
your tech news update if you crave more
