Netflix challenger steps into the ring
I'm Jeff Bakalar filling in for Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update Mac
users can now upgrade their operating
systems to version 10.8 and our official
cnet review praises mountain lion for
its cloud functionality and useful
updates to some core apps however a
lackluster game center and a dictation
feature that requires an internet
connection are a bit disappointing so
should you upgrade well if they're more
than twenty dollars we probably say no
but the price for this update is just
right apple also announced its q3
earnings and while ipad sales soared a
drop an iPhone consumption caused the
company to fall short of growth
expectations you can probably chalk that
up to the fact that everyone knows an
iPhone 5 is on the horizon but then
again here we are feeling bad for a
company that's reporting twenty three
percent year-over-year growth Netflix is
about to have another competitor later
this year redbox is teaming up with
verizon and going by the name redbox
instant by verizon yes they can do
better on that name it'll be a hybrid
service offering movies for streaming
and downloading in addition to red boxes
already 30 6800 kiosks still a lot is up
in the air about how much the service
will be what studios have signed on and
last of all it's going to be really
tough for red box to make a dent on
netflixs market share things just keep
getting worse for nintendo these days
III left most gamers unimpressed with
the company's outlook and now Nintendo
is reporting nearly a ten percent
decrease in revenue year-over-year all
this is on the heels of the update to
the 3ds the 3ds XL that will be released
in August but we're not sure that bigger
screen is enough to entice new customers
though because people won't buy portable
consoles unless there aren't great games
to play up until now the 3ds has only
offered a handful of must own titles and
of course the exploding mobile games
market and other competition isn't
helping either and finally JC penney CEO
Ron Johnson
announced that the retailer will switch
to an all RFID sticker platform next
year allowing for mobile checkout from
anywhere within the store this plays
into the company's efforts to use new
technology to improve customers overall
shopping experience and hey if it stops
me from having to wait in line while
somebody writes a check for a pair of
socks I'm a happy man this has been your
update for what's going on in the tech
world today for more on the stories from
our show visit cnet com / update don't
