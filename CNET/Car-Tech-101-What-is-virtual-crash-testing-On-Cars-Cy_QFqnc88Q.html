new cars crashed intentionally with
great precision and measurement to
determine how they'll behave when you do
the same thing to them with far less
precision and intention but the setup is
exacting and tedious a given car can
only be crashed once and there isn't
time to crash every model of every year
of every make of car enter virtual crash
testing which stands to perhaps
revolutionize this spectacle of auto
crash worthiness cars and their parts
are all designed on computers these days
via CAD computer-aided design the design
is just a file of data that same data
which exists about every part every
panel every rivet screw and weld and
even the amount of gas in the tank along
with any crash you can imagine can be
fed into a computer a serious computer
running 10,000 cores across 200 or so
cpus and gpus turn off the lights come
back in 10 or 20 hours and see the crash
that never happened it's amazing to look
at the realism but more important are
these three gains its repeatable no cars
were harmed in this collision that means
you can run it over and over with the
cost and set-up time of real tests
remove its peelable you can peel back or
make invisible any portion of the car to
see how a given sub assembly performs in
real time can't do that with a real
crash test and it's variable find a
weakness redesign that area via CAD
upload the new design data run the crash
again see if it's now fixed no need to
retool and create a new part for another
crash test so why are we still crashing
cars for real well virtual crash tests
aren't complete they're about 90 plus
percent accurate and data full a gap
that should be closeable risk does move
slowly car makers insurers and
regulators aren't the types to jump
overnight to a new method where our
lives are involved it still takes too
long that half a day to a day of data
processing per crash test needs to come
down and widespread adoption is needed
not every car maker uses this technology
nor are they using a standardized
version of it nonetheless virtual crash
testing looks like it may due to the
of crashworthiness what the computer did
to photography more car tech demystified
