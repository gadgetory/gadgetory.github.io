Vegas we are the 404 show live from the
cnet stage here at CES 2013 I'm Jeff
Bakalar and I'm Justin you and we want
to tell you guys just a little bit about
our show real quick we're seeing it's a
scathing pop culture and tech program
every day we sort of make fun of the
internet and we have a great time doing
it you can check us out every single day
monday through friday at 12pm eastern
time cnet com / the 404 you can also
follow us on all the social networks
Facebook Twitter Instagram and snapchat
if you're feeling freaky yes we feel
freaky all the time let's get to our
guest for today's show she is the
creator of the YouTube hit the guild and
has appeared on an array of film and
television programs including Joss
Whedon's Emmy award-winning internet
musical dr. horrible's sing-along blog
this year she's the entertainment
matters ambassador here at CES ladies
and gentlemen please put your hands
together for Felicia Day hello Felicia
there you are I like to forget to give
you a sash CES is this year oh hey
there's a man there was a man in my
pants um CES made me this because I was
tweeting the last couple months that I
was ambassador I'm gonna breeze my all
my privileges and I needed a tiara and a
sash and last night at the party the
midea lake party they gave me a sash and
I said could I wear this when I do all
the press for you guys and they were
actually cool with it so I just say
thumbs up because I did not think they
would be cool with it that's pretty are
there any special powers that come with
the sash I mean there's going to be a
lot of responsibility there do you get
to cut in line at the bathroom or i
would like to abuse any power that i
have regardless of whether i'm wearing a
sash or not so cutting line getting I
mean I did cut in line at the at the
razor booth I was like can I can I see
the edge please just flash your sash and
you're like hey ambassador it actually
kind of devalues me
a girl wearing a sash does not maybe get
you all the places you wouldn't be here
but the good thing is I get to go see I
I picked out a bunch of things that I
wanted to see I got to you know get
tours of things and hopefully if I park
anywhere I don't get a ticket very good
you just leave the session on your car
and then yeah equivalent of a hand again
so um so you are the entertainment
matters ambassador here at CS what's
that mean what's that all about uh yeah
it's a cool program where i get to
highlight or just kind of represent the
cross-section of entertainment into
technology and there's so much of it
this year i think is a particularly
important year for it not only are their
tablets everywhere sure and screens
everywhere i mean you have to put
something on those screens and that's
why content content and the things that
people are consuming is becoming even
more more important and there are a lot
of tracks here with variety and AOL that
are doing seminars and things about you
know making content for digital and
other platforms and other screens and
then there's the iaw TV awards which is
the international academy of web
television it's highlighting web video
and sets tonight the the awards are
streaming live tonight so I'm I get to
wear if I'd a nice dress I'm nominated
my channels nominated so yeah that's
gonna be really great alright excellent
oh you know obviously this isn't on any
of our first CES is we are veterans now
and I think we've all kind of gotten the
hang of what to bring and how to survive
but I know a lot of people for them this
is their first time coming to CES and
it's kind of a daunting thing to walk
the showroom floor I find that waving
your arms in a windmill whereas you walk
around really helps to clear the crowd
yeah i mean i would say like
automatically put a blinder on any
iphone case yes there is literally every
icon case i mean not to insult iphone
cases because there are so many i
yeah you can only put one on your phone
at a time I know I only 02 and they were
both briefest do you would you switch
off between them just like oh you know
wednesdays and thursdays I'm gonna do
one girls change their purse I just use
mine until there's so much garbage or
the bottom of it have you seen the
people who they use they change their
iphone case depending on their wardrobe
those are the girls I admire and can
never aspire to be it would not yeah
you'd
I mean listen it's hard to put an outfit
together I actually tried to put outfits
together without showing up with like a
free gamer shirt and dirty jeans here so
I put a little effort in it actually is
a lot of creativity I don't want to
discount anyone but my tips would be to
be really targeted for the last week or
so I've been you know just looking at
news coverage and following the brands
that I really like and see like what
exactly do I want and then it's it's a
little bit like tower defense you have
to be like okay in this area I can do
this in one it's in two hours i can go
here and like a group of these five
things and then i'll go here because
honestly it's like nothing I've seen
before like comic-con is nothing
compared to all forget the floor
carnival it is it really is so you
definitely have to prioritize where you
want to be for sure yeah definitely um
we were reading an interesting article
on sina com that basically said that the
locals were complaining about the CES
demo saying that techies aren't social
yeah what a lot of cabbies talking about
how a lot of their business just
completely stops around 10pm which is
normally for vacations I didn't know
people from Vegas are called vacations
you sounded a little bit offensive I
can't had something to do with you know
I was gonna say that it sounded like you
were saying yeah hey like vegetarian
yeah um but yeah they're saying that
vacations don't really go out at night
especially around CES because maybe I
don't know they're too busy working or
if tired themselves out from walking the
floor maybe they smoke too many
cigarettes on the floor it's possible
what you have to say about that I don't
know I mean I can't defend everybody I'm
not very social i went to better to love
him yeah maybe i'm just the problem here
part of the problem is where we say um
alright we want to get into a new
segment that we're gonna try out maybe
you can help us out with it okay every
time we come to CES we try out new
segments last year we did something
called tech confessions that didn't go
over to on iOS alright well it was okay
this year it was downloaded into
oblivion this year we're gonna try out
something new we're focusing on the
press conferences that happened last
night did you catch any of those no but
I heard some very weird things I saw
some weird things on twit
when I woke up so Twitter imploded
people lost their minds they thought it
was a big parody it was real everything
we saw last night really happened so
that leads us to a segment that we're
going to call that just happened we have
there we go that just happened there you
go okay it's happening right now so
we're going to show something from the
Qualcomm press conference last night you
have I love that you think this is like
me reacting to something it's because we
actually need to be at least organic
reaction Aria let's play that first one
right now from Qualcomm coming up with
the next billion-dollar idea check this
out imagine funny cat videos meez
Gangnam style boom dude it like it oh
man it's like it's like one more
empowered or more connected than any
other generation in the history of man
dude it's it's like we've evolves we're
like modern nomads can you take it
happen what I just said almost all of us
back I think ten years yams if we're
nerds have come how do you feel about
that as a diplomat I was missing
yourself you have to be diplomatic Eric
Foner I mean he seemed pumped up pumped
up but uh I mean I can't follow the guy
i mean here's the thing when you're on
stage you're playing to thousands and
thousands of people ah the graphics look
cool the graphics did look cool yeah
that was a very safe answer I am an
ambassador you are an ambassador you're
very good to know that Qualcomm has such
a great idea of what kids want these
days the grasp on what how kids act yeah
like I rename our generation generation
em that was the big focus of the
conference that true yeah what happy to
go all the way around from a to 8a tell
if te skip every letter one right to em
it's unfortunate but um you know I want
to get into a little bit about more
about what you do you're responsible for
the web show the guild I'm sure we have
some fans in the audience who have seen
the guild round of applause for the
guild everyone psyched about that
awkward it's it's in the sixth season
already we actually released our finale
episode today
my youtube channel geek &amp;amp; sundry right
so that's where I produce a whole slate
of contents I run a network which is
crazy but we released a guild season 6
on that platform and today is a finale
so go watch everyone go check out the
finale of the guild season 6 60s that's
that's amazing we were talking before
that that that's longer than them than
most sitcoms get on regular TV what is
it how does it feel to just completely
shame them it's uh it's it makes me
really proud I mean it really has been a
phenomenon and the fact that we we've
still been we shot my house again I mean
really it's a it's been a journey that I
don't know if you can't really compare
it to anything else and we've really the
front the fun thing about it is that
this show has you know grown with what
social media is like five years ago I
joined twitter before any other actors
or anything we're on there and it was it
was really knew I did it because I tech
people I admired were on it I was like
this service kind of seems fun and the
minute I got a mobile phone in my hand
it just became huge so and now people
just take it for granted that all these
things that we are so used to you know
exist and these were just literally like
baby things when we first start the show
and whenever I saw a new technology that
I enjoyed I would use it to grow the
show so really the show has grown with
the internet and it's been an amazing
journey and I that's kind of a cool
thing about being the Ambassador between
entertainment at Tech because that's
what I love I am an actor but I've
always grown up on games and technology
I was a prodigy addict when I was like
12 I posted fanfic for Ultima games on
the prodigy ultima board like that's
what people need to appreciate how
insane that is that you're admitting
that right now well yeah I got my hair
professionally done so I feel not a
shame but um but you know it's been it's
something so literally it's the world's
are melding and like when you go to the
floor here you see people with their
ideas and they make me wacky crazy ideas
but really now is the time if you have a
wacky crazy idea to get that idea made
because the the barriers are so much
lower and whether you're making content
you're making entertainment are you
making the tech that is serving that
content and
and and that's what's exciting to me you
can invent the new world it's pretty
cool because if you watch the first
season of the guild and then sort of see
how its evolved yeah not just in terms
of you know the content but just
production value wise the the leaps and
bounds that the show has made really is
an unbelievable sort of you know
evolution to watch yeah we've been on so
many platforms we were we started on
YouTube we were funded by people on
paypal before Kickstarter started and
then we were really fortunate to go to
xbox and for four seasons did our show
there and then we came back to YouTube
to kind of do this season yeah it's
literally just everything has grown with
the show and that's why i love you know
there are a lot of opportunities for me
to just become an actor but i love
making stuff online when i can be one
click away from the person who loves or
hates me but uh that's just what i love
I mean you guys do the same thing right
that's why you do this that's why a few
more people watch your stuff though we
have to if they're like siphon off some
of that you probably have some viewers
to spare maybe you can it's all a
communal pot right I like that answer
you know technology addiction is
something that you you know obviously
talked about a lot on the show and
something that I think we all have in
common coming to CES every year got the
itch maybe there's a story on cnet
earlier today I don't know if you read
this but Christmas check wrote a story
about a father in China who actually
hired digital hitman to kill his sons
character in a video game that he felt
like he was playing too much and wasting
his life on oh how you feel about that I
mean technology addictions crazy these
days do you think that was the best
route to go or maybe you should have
sent her to one of those addiction camps
or maybe you should have just SAT him
down and like hey stop doing that yeah
maybe cuz like he's just get a respawn
right it doesn't seem like it seems like
a dude who doesn't understand games this
sounds 35 years old by the way oh okay
well that's another thing that I like I
mean I do you know having been i created
the gill because i didn't think that
people represented gamers in the way
that i experienced gamers and it was a
very small you know online gaming was
much smaller 56 you know 10 whenever i
do many years ago and i thought that the
best of the world could be encapsulated
with the internet because you don't have
to feel isolated if you don't like
something that everybody else doesn't
like you can find other people who love
what you do and you can celebrate it
with them and you can feel included
and accept yourself in a way and you
know having started from there and I
still love the internet i think it's
it's very much can be that but there's
also the other side of the internet
where people can isolate themselves into
only hearing what they that they think
they believe sure and they don't ever
grow out of their cage in a sense I mean
that was one of my resolutions this year
was to change all my RSS feeds and I
know that that's really stupid but like
I want to become I want to grow as a
person I don't always have the same
input and just be preaching you know
preaching to the choir myself I have to
expand my worldview in order to be able
to do that to the people who listen to
me and I think that's something we just
have to be conscious of that we're not
isolating ourselves and like our truths
are not what everybody else believes
because we're just listening to our
truths over and over again right on
that's that's some lofty aspirations
though I'm going to try and do the same
myself a couple hours again we have to
take a break when we come back we're
going to talk some games with Felicia
Day stick around the 404 show will be
back right after this break
you
back to the 404 show live from Las Vegas
we're a round of applause for Felicia
Day right now I'm fan today that's the
Ambassador way mistress arm arm that
hand gets encapsulated in glass every
night I'll have you know creepy um so
we're back here on the 404 show with
felicia day I think it's time for
another that just happened arielle
please show us what's next i'm here to
show you something pretty special yeah
and you're a bird khatir today uh-huh
yeah I'm also a bird khatir today yeah
hey flap those wings okay just happens
you're right wow so big bird making an
appearance at CES i I've had the
unfortunate circumstance to work with
that guy he's a dbag not a skinny I just
can't afford to do this oh no I just
heard my diplomacy no no no he's just a
diva he has a lot of writers in his
contract vinum only only yellow M&amp;amp;Ms
only did you know anything oh it has to
be yellow really yeah Wow listen would
you learn today today I learned big
birds a douche bag what clarifying that
big bird himself showing up was the guy
dressed in a skin suit of big bird like
a texas chainsaw massacre in Thailand
big bird out yeah that was weird you
killed somebody wrapped his skin around
your head a whimsical homemade quality
to it yeah absolutely all right that
happened so let's get into a little bit
of gaming discussion because and I just
want to apologize to Justin for people
don't know on our show whenever we talk
about games that's when Justin goes out
and has a coffee yeah you know takes a
little break I want to know what you're
playing now what did you play last year
that you really loved what are you
trying to blow what are you looking
forward to answer all that right now
right now um last year um well I love
dishonored of course I only killed three
people which in retrospect it's like why
was I so lazy why not just clean up a
little bit after myself and get the
achievement so that's a ghost
achievement right the yes
did any fans have dishonored in the in
the rain today no no one played
Bethesda's the game of course they did
they're in the back come on guys that
was a good game that was a great and
that was my number one game of twins
whoa girl building I really thought the
mechanics were really fun i love the
stealth mechanic i'm a member of a
sniper because i really i get like
really flustered like a far cry 3 i just
started playing that and i don't know
how much farther i can go because I
pretty intense I can't stand the peeling
of the animals and like when people come
up me I'm like kind of spazzing out I'm
just shooting everywhere you know I'm
much more like eyeballs creep up and i
will pick them out and i will still kill
all of them right which takes like 10
times as long but it's so much more
satisfying oh my god those animations
are pretty awesome right now I would
have to give that game that I mean but
as far as like the peeling of the
animals it's a little I want to explain
that to Justin because that sounds
awesome know that we're talking about
video games is a very terrifying you
kill a lot of animals there's animals
everywhere you kill them you skin them
it's all the hunting and like for some
reason if this was like a bear in Skyrim
I'll kill 40,000 of them but like what's
line though just merge genocide bear
genocide exactly but one dog in Far Cry
actually maybe it was cry I think I
can't do this well you're not so said in
far cry when you kill a dog it goes like
yes yeah that's it you're like peeling
it yeah and the guy you skin everything
so falling so you skin you skin these
animals so that you can carry more guns
right now so that's obviously so this is
a wallet you wanna carry you can't
possibly have another pocket right
exactly he the guy he's got a very
limited you know sort of inventory you
know we finish back a little bit right
little brother though o.o his brother
was I was like he was a hot guy than in
the opening thing spoiler he gets killed
I was just like no I would have played
that guy my wife saw that scene I by the
way the boss the villain in that game is
out of control oh yeah no the writing is
really good I was what I was playing it
my wife was watching and when he got
killed so early she was like I can't
watch this it was me it was Ted so uh I
actually um I've just finished the
skyrim dlc okay odd dragonborn and then
and I love that game so much I will sit
there and just like sort tomatoes
sometimes and I just I just installed it
for the pc because i played on xbox
number he's always like okay you're new
but I'm like well shut up because people
are so they get really bitchy oh yeah
they get really upset when you post
anything about Apple Oh Android boys
will just you know they'll be very mad
at me and then you do android on the mac
people be mad it's just like okay guys
back off I'm not going to play on PC
it's so good on PC because you got all
the mods for sure and you load in and
out so much faster through doorways so
like now I'm starting from zero after
two hundred and twelve hours in Skyrim
xbox two hundred and twelve hours yeah
you got that you're able to come out to
this show is good i've included every
quest every single quite like a hundred
percent rest no i have a couple of like
kill that dragon and kill that vampire
but you know like make that you know
brew in though i'm a good backspin
alchemy excellent no no blacksmithing
blacksmithing i can make everything i
have a bow and I name them you know I
need them things like icy hot it is fire
and ice damage then where are we need
more women like you in the world I think
they're out there they aren't there they
just they just you know they have a
voice you didn't yeah she set the Lord
just how yeah exactly right anyway and
i'm looking forward to bioshock a lot in
simcity sorry i love the city bringing
some city back which is we have sim city
fans in the in the audience today no one
has ever played a video game there we go
step 5 I mean come on give to the foot
SimCity uh this has been in production
for years I know it's finally finally
ready to see the light of day have you
played it all yeah no but I'm angling
I'm angling you know so what else so
cause I think so so what else in 2013
has caught your eye Bioshock obviously
for me that's definitely where you at la
yeah I did play a little bit in LA and
I'm like this is unbelievable yeah those
guys just they're on a different level I
mean it's it's just consummate
storytelling I think that um you know
there it's evolving so that story is
very very important especially in these
epic games and they're basically the
same footing is like a triple a movie
right now Triple A titles budget as well
yeah the budget too but with the kind of
storytelling and attention to detail
like these games are you know they
forever absolutely uh we get a lot of uh
do have a huge sort of demographic that
listens to our show some people are not
gamers some people are hardcore for
people who maybe are just trying to get
into gaming people like this guy who he
picked up a place is hard blowing into
this is I was a big pc gamer back in the
day I played Warcraft but I always just
sent the peons out to go harvest like
wood and steel and bigger Kilties
exactly yeah I didn't I didn't do
anything finally related a big farmer
yeah your firm I love for me too I was
addicted to puzzle pirates there's a
java game it's actually the secret of
the guild is not it's it's about wow a
little bit because I was a huge wow
addict but before that I was addicted to
puzzle pirates which is basically you're
a pirate and you have a guild and you
sail the seas and you and there's a lot
of resource gathering and I love
resource gathering that's why i love
tabletop games now too because they're a
lot of resource gathering games and i
would recommend you know there's a lot i
would definitely recommend xbox because
that's the thing I'm most comfortable
with and they have a great day arcade
games are the best at castle crashers I
love steam as well like I'm a huge team
addicts I've spent so much money on
Steam especially their sales and you
know games like trying try to like look
small ones like that i think in anything
by popcap i recommend those are the kind
of the entry level games that i
recommend to people because i understand
the intimidation i never had a console
before i was in a dull and when i picked
up my ex why I was like I don't know
where all these buttons are but you get
really comfortable really quickly and he
just had to have the confidence to not
give up so you don't to jump into call
of duty or something that sets the worst
very humiliating experience particularly
yeah alright very cool before we say
goodbye i think it's not for one last
that just happened let's check it out
you should be scared let's see where we
have up next here
yep hop to the top we got a hip hop to
the top I got more so than i can control

know what the hardest thing to do as an
actor is to commit and I have to give
him I am committed yeah how many
practice sessions do you think it took
for him to get that rap down to it seems
like that was very well-rehearsed I
could give him that right I kind of a
