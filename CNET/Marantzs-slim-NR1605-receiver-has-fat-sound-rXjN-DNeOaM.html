Myr answers line of slimline receivers
with a form factor that's half the
height of regular receivers these models
offer up-to-date features and plenty of
power for most systems the NR 1605 is
the newest flagship in the line and it
offers new features like Bluetooth and
Spotify connect plus excellent sound
quality the build quality is solid - and
these ceramic edges give the receiver a
sophisticated air but sadly there aren't
any source selection buttons just two
slower selected are the remote does have
direct selection though the features are
plentiful on the NR 16:05 with eight
HDMI inputs the cheaper NR 1504 only has
six and they have 4k 60 Hertz
pass-through plus the receiver has
onboard Wi-Fi with airplay and a front
panel USB port this Marantz has 50 watts
of power per channel which should run
most speakers at reference levels in
stereo mode if you want more power you
should consider the sr5
$99 sound quality is what the marantz is
all about and unlike similar receivers
from Onkyo and Ponyo this is geared
towards music first but that said it
sounds equally authoritative with movies
as well if you're looking for a slimline
receiver with plenty of features and
great sound the $6.99 Marantz NR 1605 is
a very good choice
