and ipad users have Siri and now windows
phone owners finally have a voice
assistant of their own i'm dan graziano
i'm going to show you how to set up and
start using microsoft's brand-new
cortana voice assistant Cortana comes as
part of the Windows Phone 8.1 update
which will begin rolling out to devices
in late 2014 to access Cortana press the
Search button or click on the Cortana
icon in the phone's app drawer if you
long press the Search button Cortana
will launch in listening mode you can
use the voice assistant to set up
reminders check the weather or find the
score and schedule of your favorite
sports team but before we do that let's
get more personal and get Cortana to
refer to you by name inside the app
click on the three line icon in the top
right corner of the screen this will
open the notebook scroll down to
settings check the box that reads have
Cortana call me by my name and click on
the set my name option Cortana learned
from you over time and will eventually
figure out where you live and where you
work but you can actually tell her these
things sooner enter the notebook and
click on interest to let Cortana know
what kind of information you would like
to receive for example I love the new
york sports teams so i'm going to tell
her to give the information on the
yankees and the jets in the notebook you
can manually set time and location-based
reminders enable the windows phone quiet
mode and set your favorite places such
as your home or your work you can also
enable traffic updates in the daily
routine section get information for
upcoming trips in the travel section and
one of my favorites get suggestions for
finding places to eat at meal times in
the eat and drink section the next time
you open Cortana you will be greeted
with a stream of relevant information
such as stocks and news among other
things over time she will begin to ask
you even more questions like what do you
do during the evenings what kind of food
do you like and what you're most
interested in Cortana will then use this
information to enhance the
suggestion she makes to you so now that
we have Cortana tailored to your
specific needs it's time to start using
her just like Siri you can use Cortana
to search for pretty much anything
whether it's on your phone or on the web
you would have her open the settings
menu turn Wi-Fi on or even text or call
a friend for example after asking how
tall a Braun James is you can then ask
what team does he play for Cortana will
remember that you're talking about
LeBron James when will give you an
answer rather than executing a web
search for the command what team does he
play for another cool feature is
Cortana's ability to listen to your
music and tell you the artist who's
playing this can be done by clicking on
the music icon and playing your favorite
tune of course there's a lot more
Cortana can do so be sure to check out
my article on how to dot cnet com you
can also reach out to me on Twitter with
any questions or comments i'm dan
