the Apple bite for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple is that
time of the year where we look back
before 2018 gets here and recap the best
moments for Apple in 2017 and you know
there were good ones and bad ones the
bad ones that's for next week but these
are all good apples for this year all
right first up it took three years to
get here but the Apple watch series
three LTE was one of the highs for me
this year not only did it finally bring
an independent Apple watch that didn't
require a connection to your phone but
watch OS 4 and all of its improvements
made this an Apple watch that I can
completely get behind now there's a
smarter Siri better app navigation and
user interface a faster processor you
could feel and a battery life that
easily lasts a day for me when I'm doing
everything it can offer including a
one-hour workout now you know what some
of you think I'm a flip-flopper because
I wasn't a fan of the first two
generations I was there in the beginning
and the product wasn't good enough then
but you know what it is now so check it
out the Apple watch series 3 LTE a big
winner for Apple this year alright next
up the iPad pro has always been a
favorite of mine but Apple finally made
it a unique product that can stand alone
as its own thing with the addition of
iOS 11 navigation specifically built for
this device makes it special and let's
not pretend it can even come close to
the functionality of a surface pro
because it can't but after three
straight years of declining sales the
iPad pro helped turn the ship back
around for Apple with sales up for the
first time since 2014 so get this
innovation with hardware and software
together to a loyal fan base makes a
difference in sales who would have
thought it you know what I think we're
seeing a pattern here so keep it up
Apple and you all know I didn't go easy
on the air pods but I was fair come on
it's a really really good product it's
not great yet and you know what they
still look ridiculous but the people
have spoken and they didn't care how
they looked according to NPD group since
it's December launch I'm gonna count
this for 2017 air pods
accounted for 85% of totally wireless
headphone sales and it was one of the
top sellers for Black Friday weekend
despite
not having any major discounts we're
talking about a product that was
backordered for six weeks from its
December 2016 release until July of 2017
you know you can never underestimate the
power of the Apple fan base because the
people just wanted air pods and it was
another win for the fruit guys and what
was another win for Apple this year say
with me everybody and namo jeez it's
arguably the cutest and lamest feature
we've ever seen that was exclusively
available for the iPhone 10 I could have
put it on my losers list as well but
what did everyone do right when they got
their new iPhone they sent off and
emojis then an emoji karaoke blew up for
a hot minute that was just another form
of free viral marketing for a company
that already has us by the apples now
I'm not gonna lie I bought into it as
well love them or hate them Apple might
have the most advanced facial
recognition security on a phone right
now but people are using it to talk as a
poopoo face it was still the most buzz
worthy feature in any phone this year
and that's another great moment for
Apple in 2017 so I want to hear what do
you think I missed where's the iPhone 10
was it really one of their best moments
maybe for you it was but let me know in
the comments what do you think right
down here
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show next week we'll have our
worst moments of 2017 so you all can
email me at the Apple byte at cnet.com
or tweet me at brian tom thanks so much
for watching we'll catch y'all next time
for the bite of the Apple
