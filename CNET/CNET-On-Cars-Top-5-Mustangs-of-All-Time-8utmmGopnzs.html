to do a definitive top 5 list of
Mustangs but the best you can do is take
5 great ones and leave out 10 more great
ones but let me give it a swing I'm
Brian Cooley with my top 5 list of
Mustangs by their magnitude of legacy
here we go number 5 the 69 boss 302
built to answer Camaros growing threat
to the Mustang the small-block boss was
a 302 Windsor block with 351 cleveland
heads
that's for geek speek for a great
breathing engine fake side scoops were
taken out a blackout hood deck and rear
transom was put in and fastback was the
only body style they made just 1,600 of
these so they were almost instantly
collectible flash-forward today and that
first boss inspired the modern boss 302
which is my favorite current production
mustang number 4 the 67 Mustang Fastback
the 67 was the first restyle of the
original mustang but it became really
famous in its own right for being flown
driven by Steve McQueen in Bullitt often
still credited as having the greatest
chase scene ever film flash-forward and
you can thank this dark Highland Green
fastback for inspiring the great film
chase era bullet in 68 French Connection
in 71 and the 7 ups in 73 all of which
by the way were either choreographed
driven or both by Bill Hickman the guy
driving the black charger in bulletin
number 3 the 79 Mustang this was the
dawn of the Fox Body Mustang named for
the internal code of its underlying
platform it rescued Mustang from the
doldrums of mustang 2 and became
arguably the most popular generation of
Mustangs ever running for some 15 years
flash forward today and you can thank
that car for the Mustang period because
had the 79 to 93 car flopped Ford might
have gone ahead with its planned
replacement for the Mustang the
front-wheel drive car we came to know as
the probe number two the 65 Shelby gt350
this was the first year you could get a
Mustang that had Carroll Shelby's touch
in a unique partnership between a car
maker and a hot-rodder
with more power better brakes and just
one color white with blue stripes the
306 horsepower original Shelby was high
on grit and low on BS flash forward
today and the modern era of Shelby
Mustangs are much responsible for
reigniting the big-block muscle car wars
are Renaissance that includes Camaros
and challengers the number one Mustang
of course is the first Mustang the 64
and a half or 65 no car ever had this
pop-culture appeal sales were predicted
to be about a hundred thousand in the
first year that actually happened in
three months and a million of the one
out the door in eighteen months these
Mustangs were very simple built up from
a lot of Ford Falcon parts to be honest
but with a look and a role in the
industry that made them something of the
iPhone of their day a must have great
design icon that changed things forever
flash-forward today and any time you see
a sporty affordable four seat car with a
shortish deck and long ish hood there's
a little debt to be paid to the original
Mustang for more top fives like this
stay on top of high-tech cars and modern
driving at CNET on cars.com i'm brian
Cooley thanks for watching
