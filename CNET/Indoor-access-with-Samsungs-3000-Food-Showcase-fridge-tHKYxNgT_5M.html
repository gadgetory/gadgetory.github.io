this is the Samsung food showcase
refrigerator model number rh2 9h 9000 SR
now Samsung sells a couple of different
food showcase models at this point this
is the 3000 dollar model and it's a 36
inch wide twenty-eight point five cubic
foot capacity refrigerator with eighteen
point four cubic feet of that dedicated
to the fridge inside is a pretty basic
build about a lot of exciting features
no humidity controls on the crispers
down here no uh turbine no spill proof
shelving not a lot of places to move
those shelves no shelves you can fold up
out of the way nothing like that but I
close the fridge and then open it again
from the bottom half it opens this food
showcase door and this is just the front
shelving inside the door if you have
access to by opening this front panel
now that's kind of a neat novelty but
I'm not sure that it's that practical
you're not really getting that much more
by opening the food showcase store to
access those indoor shelves it does make
those lower in door shells a lot more
accessible for kids if you wanted to
store juice boxes or pudding cups there
so your kids could get to it it's a nice
place for that performance-wise the
samsung food showcase refrigerator did a
nice job in terms of the actual
refrigerator capacity those main shelves
inside the body of the thing but the
indoor shelving and those drawers at the
bottom didn't do as great they were a
little warm in all of our tests
especially the bottom half of that door
temperatures were 10 degrees or more
above our target temperatures and well
above the 40 degree benchmark that the
FDA set for food safety so I'm not a big
fan of that you wouldn't want to store
any delicate ingredients in the door
here you almost certainly want to put it
in the body the fridge to keep it
fresher the bottom line is that this is
a great looking fridge that doesn't
quite deliver in terms of performance or
features so for that reason I'm probably
passing on it especially given the fact
that there is a model that costs about a
thousand dollars less it looks just like
it has a slightly smaller capacity and
that's about all you're losing I'd
rather have that than this or you might
also consider one of LG's door and door
refrigerators that's a similar feature
to the food showcase here and we liked
it a little bit better it's more
intuitive and didn't compromise
performance quite so much thanks for
watching and check out the rest of our
refrigerator reviews at cnet.com for
seen that appliances I'm right Chris
