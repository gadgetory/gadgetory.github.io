unveiling a brand-new product that
brings together beefy amazing sound and
elegant design are you ready
listen hi makes me play music
all the sound you just heard came from
these 160 Galaxy homes so when we
designed this speaker we set out to
deliver high quality sound
thankfully with AKG every aspect of
Gallo's young is engineered to make your
music sound amazing
it has elegant circular form factor
what assists me to high range speakers
that send the sound in every gesture in
and it has a sub woofer that provide
deep rich bass as well and with the
harmonies natural sound processing you
get a realistic surround sound
experience that feels like you are right
in the middle of the live concert we've
also integrated Harman sounds tear
technologies which it detects your
location and optimize sound based on
where you are in the room just say hi
Bigsby
sounds dear and the music is directed
right at you
as I mentioned before the galaxy home
had also has Bigsby and them smart
things have built right in so it gives
you instant access to their largest open
ecosystem of smart devices using only
your voice so it is as easy saying hi
Bixby the galaxy home also has a or get
eight microphones for far-field
for circulation they'll pick up that
voice command from clear across room
this is just first look at this amazing
speaker we are excited to share more
details about it soon
so galaxy home is perfect example of how
is how we are expanding our ecosystem of
intelligent devices we are also
expanding services as you I showed you
earlier these expansions are only
possible with a scaleable AAI
problem which is fixed fee and we will
be sharing a lot more about our vision
and a detailed technology beyond it at
the Samsung developer compris I really
really hope to see you all there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
