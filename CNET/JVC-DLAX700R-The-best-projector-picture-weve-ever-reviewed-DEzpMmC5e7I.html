and in front of me is the most expensive
and also the nicest projector we've ever
tested here this is the JVC dla X 700 R
this is the second most expensive JVC
projector for 2013 2014 it uses the
company's new Egypt dila chips all that
stuff as a mouthful so we'll start at
the beginning this is not a 4k projector
unlike some competing Sony units which
are even more expensive than this one it
uses JVC's egypt technology which takes
the 1080p native pixels inside this
projector shifts them slightly to
improve picture density all things
consider we didn't really consider that
part of its technology all that
impressive we'll get to that in a little
bit but still it's an excellent
projector overall feature wise it
includes JVC's patented suite of
excellent on-screen adjustments you can
go and use the remote control to tweak
stuff like lens shift all the other
focus and zoom that you need to do to
set up the projector so setup was really
easy another thing I really appreciate
it was the quietness of this projector
it's really silent when it's running
unless you're using the high lamp mode
which most people in a home theater
situation aren't going to want to use
the projector can of course accommodate
anamorphic lenses if you need to and it
has lens memories to work with those
lenses and get everything set up again
in a pro level pretty much as good as
you can expect this projector is THX
certified it also has ISF modes so if
you have a calibrator coming over which
I definitely recommend with a projector
that's expensive he or she should be
able to get the ultimate picture quality
again with your dedicated screen and
dedicated room of course that's a
downside of a projector like this you're
going to need to buy a relatively nice
screen to keep up with it and also have
a completely dark room to get the best
picture quality out of it once you do
that the picture is superb
this projector is definitely better than
the step-down JVC that we looked at the
X 35 although it's not leaps and bounds
better the black levels are a little bit
darker the one thing this does a little
bit better than that projector is it
gets the brights brighter so you get an
even more punch in contrast
despite keeping those excellent really
deep black levels which again are as
good or better than any projector we've
ever seen
combine that with the excellent color on
this projector and you get really an
eye-popping superb picture that's the
equal of pretty much any other display
technology out there except for maybe
OLED
we mention at the top where every shift
really isn't a great improvement it does
increase pixel fill so if you stand
really close to the screen you won't see
pixel edges if you turn it on but most
people aren't going to sit close enough
to actually appreciate it on the
downside we did see a couple extra
artifacts introduced by e-shift so I
think that real video quality sticklers
are one I'm going to keep it turned off
on the flip side it doesn't have all the
resolution that we'd expect from a 4k
projector of course it doesn't have all
the pixels either so again if you're
going to invest in a projector this
expensive you might want to know that
the 4k projectors which a little bit
more expensive even than this are going
to give you better detail of course
you'll only get that extra detail with
4k sources which at the moment are
incredibly rare and of course there's no
guarantee of those projections are going
to match this JVC when it comes to black
levels in color which are much more
important than resolution anyway even on
extremely large screen despite its
expense over this projector does not
include 3d capability in the box you're
going to need to buy a separate emitter
which is 99 bucks as well as separate
glasses JVC's are pretty expensive at
about 150 but this actually works with
other third-party glasses that cost a
little as 20 bucks as you can see the 3d
emitter attaches right to the back of
the projector here there's also two HDMI
inputs rs-232 and Ethernet for mode
control so beyond all those details the
real takeaway here is this projector is
superb it has excellent picture quality
and that's really what you want to get
if you're going to spend this kind of
money of course if you don't want to
spend this kind of money the step-down
JVC projector is extremely good as well
and again an extremely good value with
less than half the price that's a quick
look at JVC's dla X 700 our projector
I'm David cat smart from Cena
