seenin appliances and we are at the
housewares show 2015 in Chicago and
we're taking a look at axes latest
lineup of oXXO on electric powered
appliances starv which i think is the
barista brain 12 cup coffeemaker and if
you take a look at this machine you're
gonna know it definitely means business
so one of the features that's really
cool about this is it brews 12 cups at a
time you can also basically set how much
will brew depending on how much water
you put in there's a scale in the bottom
you can also set the temperature so you
know exactly how hot your water's gonna
get and because you can set the
temperature this Brewer is scheduled to
hopefully get a SCA a seal of approval
for the golden cups standard so other
coffee makers definitely enjoy that
status and hopefully this one will soon
what's really awesome is it has a scale
on there so you can see how much water
is actually in the carafe you can also
directly pour water into the carafe by
flipping this lid open like that and
pour water directly inside and then
what's wild is this whole chamber has a
pump that essentially pushes water
that's heated to the right temperature
through the spout of the pitcher here
into the brewing chamber right here
which accepts standard basket style flat
bottomed filters it also is big enough
to accommodate the amount of coffee
grounds that you'll need to get the
right concentration and correct
extraction that the SCA will recommend
so if want to get our hands on the
October ISTA brain 12 cup coffee maker
you're gonna have to wait until the fall
of 2015 it will have an expected price
of $2.99 I'm Brian Bennett for CNET
appliances
