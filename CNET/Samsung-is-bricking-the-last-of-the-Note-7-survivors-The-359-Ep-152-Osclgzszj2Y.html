my name is Brian and this is episode 152
of the 359 podcast with Alfred Aang and
Mike Sorrentino good morning guys thanks
for being here good morning thanks for
having us how's everybody doing it's
been pretty good his first snowfall of
the season it lasted all of like three
minutes I didn't even notice it I was
asleep the whole day I sprinted outside
and got myself an Instagram picture it's
still freakin cold though like yo so
cold I like snow more than rain at this
point I'm we're already off topic yep
what are we talking about today so well
today our topics are Samsung designing
to another move to kill off the note 7
this time maybe finally for good with a
software update one of the most pirated
shows ever could be Amazon's grand tour
which only has three episodes so far
it's already been pirated you know more
than 10 million times bastard soon and
Super Mario run if you're on airplane
mode you're probably not going to be
able to play it so that to me he's
already sinking the game but I'm already
broken hearted I'm already out all right
um so as always if you have any
questions leave them in the stream and
we'll be sure to answer them after do we
want to get started or let's go ahead
and get this thing started right back to
answer questions after we get done
recording the podcast so send us in your
Greg comments questions and all your
best Jeremy Clarkson impersonations I'm
going to talk to you in three minutes
and 59 seconds from 32 welcome to the
359 where we talk about the top tech
news of the day and all the other crap
we want to throw in I'm Alfred dang i'm
mike sorrentino samsung announcer to be
releasing a software update to turn the
remaining notes evans out in the world
into essentially a very expensive
paperweight this is happening after a
global recall in September when the
phone sudden burst of flames killed off
the line a few stragglers decided you
know the phone was so good that it was
worth keeping but now Samsung is pulling
the plug on the software to you know
rendering basically these phones useless
should they have shouldn't they have
done this earlier like in September but
people are still using them as phones
that's the one thing that a verizon in
the u.s. is not going to do it because
they don't want to have people stranded
over the holiday season the other
carriers will do it looks like after
christmas into the new year maybe it
won't be as big of a deal but it
it's now a federal offense to even had
them on a plane gently that but the
thing is why would they wait until now
to do that shouldn't that have been the
thing like during the recall I'm
actually surprised it even happened at
all these things I feel like to take the
stretch and stretch and stretch and it's
interesting that they were being so
aggressive to try to get the rest of
them back in before any more battery
issues I mean they had been doing it
incrementally I mean one of the earlier
patches was essentially we're going to
keep it at only you know sixty percent
or so I was still surprised I talked to
a few of our listeners um when they did
the recall and then you know we had so
many comments saying we're going to keep
them essentially I just had to talk to
them and ask them why a lot of them have
very good points out it was you know one
of the best phones of twenty sixteen
minus the fact that it exploded but you
know it was that good of a phone and
then I don't know if it was you know
there were too many people out there
that had these devices that Samsung
decide are we really needed to pull the
plug on this and those people probably
want to put those phones into airplane
mode right now in order to keep the
charging ability yeah at all well up
next so Amazon's grand tour has been a
huge success for it's a streaming
service but it could also be the most
pirated TV show ever there's only been
three episodes so far the first one
illegally downloaded 7.9 million times
6.4 million and 4.6 million on the
second and third episode you know was
this expected with all the success of
top gear a lot of people love that show
yeah i remember back when i was in
college in a two thousand five ish the
top gear was pirated and all over cuz I
when it makes everything that was PP
danica za going back so in some ways
it's not that surprising also amazon
prime isn't available everywhere at this
moment whereas netflix kind of has a
global footprint right now it'll
probably take a while before amazon can
legally distribute the show and people
don't want to wait sometimes i was very
surprised i didn't really know about the
whole you know the ferment for top gear
but i did watch grand tour i watched the
first episode I don't know a thing about
cars but you know it's a really good
show I could see why so many people
pirated let's just see if it keeps the
pace because right now it is going down
you know from from nearly 8 million 24.5
yeah but it'll probably take a blah
it'll probably a while and then once
it's going everywhere you
chillout me you think the pirate is
piracy raid on this will surpass top
gear yes because it's the newest thing
right now and there's more everyone has
faster people have faster internet now
so they're able to get more it's a good
point and finally Nintendo confirmed you
can't play Super Mario run offline that
means those dreams that I had video on
my commute or on airplane mode those are
officially dead do you think this means
that you know Nintendo's mobile run with
this it's gonna fall flat before even
it's so weird because the 3ds and the
d/s and inattentive traditionally has
been very slow with getting into online
gaming as it is so the fact that they're
like oh now we're gonna require internet
connection for you to play this game I'm
hoping that there's a secret tiny
offline mode that maybe it's a little
more overblown than we think but
otherwise there's no what am I paying
for it with ten dollars I can't like
it's a heartbreaker um you know and so
for these stories and more check us out
on cnet I'm Alfred ring i'm mike
sorrentino thanks for listening
absolutely heartbroken about i cannot
leave it i I I mean Nintendo's been
notoriously a very conservative company
over the years and yeah they're trying
to protect their brand but you can't
protect a brand that nobody has like you
know man it's just I mean I get it for
you know Pokemon go where it's like it's
a matte base then you definitely need it
need an internet connection that's an
online game yeah I don't need that for
an infinite runner yeah unless it's like
augmented reality infinite running which
is kind of cool no cuz then you'd have
to actually run all right that's not
that's not fun and if there is
consistent DLC I could understand it may
be in that case cuz there's some free to
play titles that act like that but this
is a you get made a demo ish for free
and then ten dollars for the whole game
so it's weird that Nintendo's not
letting you have the whole game but
there I mean it comes out this week i
believe so I'm really hoping that when
it launches I mean learned it's not as
bad as we think that innovators there so
yeah it's well frustrate well in tendo's
logic behind it is that essentially
there's going to be like updates
continually coming in and then you know
new levels and stuff like that sure then
I'll synch up when i get home on i-5
that's what i don't understand like why
don't you just do that and then the
other one that they kind of in
it was a toad rally where you can play
with other people but that I mean we
talked about it with Scott last week
those are more ghost runs if anything
you don't need to be competing with them
in real time if all you have is there
like Time Trial you just play off of
that you know so I don't I don't
understand it at all and it doesn't like
it's not like that benefits Nintendo if
anybody tries to benefit the the
carriers because you're going to murder
your data murder it companies are
acknowledging that too that like Netflix
launching their downloaded downloaded
collection of movies and TV shows that
people don't want to spend all their
data or just aren't going to have data
but want to use their subscriptions
anyway well you know remember when
Pokemon go is really big and then
t-mobile came out with one of those like
binge on plant specifically made for
Pokemon go like I can see something like
that happening for Super Mario run to
hopefully it's nothing more than a tiny
de connection stream to say oh you're on
the internet using a legal copy and not
like I look up and find out that a 100
megs was used or not no purpose other
than you were online it makes notes
unless it's an MMO I don't see why I
need an internet connection for this
thing precisely just imagine that for
every game that you've ever played on
your phone that you needed to be online
for it mmm so let's go back to the fiery
elephant in the room many people in the
chat are still adamant about hanging
onto they still have them they still
have them and they plan to keep them
because they are curious to see if maybe
not taking the update or working on some
semblance of a custom rom will be a
workaround for them I mean that makes
sense yeah I mean people like one of the
selling points of Android is that it's
very rootable and you know to avoid that
update i can see people a lot of people
doing that when was the last battery
report do we remember we know we had one
last week but it was officially from
samsung it was for a third-party
organization that was just saying so
with a grain of salt yes but it was
basically saying that Samsung packed so
much into the into it and we tried
making it so thin that it only had a
very slim margin of error right and
because of that it you know all these
yeah but when was the last documented
quote-unquote explosion do we have oh
one of those yeah that i'm not
particularly like confident but it has
been quiet benefit of the doubt I mean
maybe it's been quiet
because it's been officially recalled
there's so many of them are dead in the
water right now and you just hope like
for those of you out there it sounds
melodramatic but you're taking your life
in your own hands we can only hope that
we are ok after all this I mean yeah one
of one of my we're gonna say even if
you're using it as a dedicated mp3
player and you never want to put it
online ever again I mean it could still
battery leak and it's a and every
carrier is willing to give all the money
back for someone who bought the phone
one of my friends actually still has it
and I've told him to he can get the s7
edge I told him to just do that and he's
it has the same camera and everything
and as the it's almost essentially the
same phone but he's he's seen it and
he's sworn that the camera quality on
the node 7 is better so it might be like
a placebo effect kind of thing we're
also only like three months out from
because traditionally those galaxy
phones gonna nounced at Mobile World
Congress in February yep two months away
yeah and then we'll probably know with
the s8 is at that point and then you
could put the money toward that but as
far as people you know trying to do
workarounds and not accepting the update
or you know routing their devices or
anything I can't advocate for any of
that you know what you do with your
device is what you want to do well it's
just I don't think that's a good idea at
all I would agree with that I'm what's
what's I mean it's you only gonna have
to kill time for a little bit and then
we're sure Samsung is going to come back
with something bad and better yeah and
if people are saying that these phones
are you know incredible they're the best
phone in 2016 I guarantee you that
there's gonna be a better phone and
maybe the next four months I mean come
on Samsung has had one little slip-up
yeah they'll come back and impress you
again better safe than sorry that is how
technology works yeah but I mean I
understood people wanting to straggle on
and hold on to it maybe around
sentimental value well even that but I'm
saying like around like September or so
you know before when this was first
announced because it was just oh we
don't know when the next Samsung phones
gonna come out there's so long from now
but now it's they're gonna it's gonna be
like pretty soon from now so it just
seemed kind of senseless to write still
hold on to it and there's like plenty of
good devices out now like back back then
you know the v20 still wasn't out the
notes and I'm sorry the the pixel still
wasn't at right time you know all these
great Android alternatives because I
know a lot of people but the pixels ugly
yeah
we had a comment or ask if that we
thought to be a no date or galaxy SI and
we don't really know yet but like it's
pretty safe bet and i don't i don't
think they even killing the note line
now it's my feeling kind of surprising
to me like they'll come out with a phone
with an S Pen they might change the name
of that phone cuz that's easy but I
that's what I mean a lot of phone makers
will they'll make these plans two years
in advance and it would be unlikely to
me that they would have probably already
done work for a 20-17 version of a phone
I mean it could mean a delay for the
note 8 the only because a lot of these
devices tend to build off the last
generation and then you know I'm pretty
sure they don't want the same screw up
with 17 this time around I think
everybody in the chat who is a samsung
van agrees that they should bring back
the removable battery and never deal
with this again I was a big fan of the
removable battery who wasn't um but I
you know also fell victim to a lot of
fake batteries not a lot like two or
three and then I finally got like a
decent one um wait I was a big fan with
a removable battery only because now i
use two phones but just to like oh this
phone's dead i don't have a charger on
man we just get this one out um but
before it would be of my battery's dead
i don't have a charger i have another
battery on me and it was so much like
more useful that way i do hope they
bring it back though I imagine they
would cuz s6 they skipped they got they
skipped they got rid of the ruble
battery and the SD card they brought the
SD card back for s7 and some of the
newer phones still are even in whether
super thin they managed to find a way
that you pull out the bottom and yeah
battery in so maybe and how about this
pirating what was the numbers again
nearly so 7.9 million for the first
episode 6.4 million for the second
episode and about 4.6 million for the
third episode how we were chatting
really though I though I think Game of
Thrones probably has similar if not
maybe that's why that's why I was pretty
skeptical of his report that was saying
that it's it while it's saying it could
be the most if those numbers stay the
same and I don't think it will I i think
the interest in the show is gonna die
out but also again I've never really
watched Top Gear I mean they're
hysterical they're fantastic
personalities I think I'm thinking this
might be like a weird
moon period where people like how its
top gear but it's not top gear maybe I
don't want it oh wait it's good i'll pay
for it later I god I said before we can
start of the show you know give me a
good excuse to pay for the content put
on the platform make it available a la
carte at a decent price yeah I will pay
for anything Amazon Prime has done a
pretty good job at that I said what Mike
said it's kind of a limited exposure
yeah as opposed to some of the other
ones but it's growing yeah I know they
were gonna get everywhere and all those
I remember when Netflix before Netflix
when international they were cutting
deals to put netflix programming on like
Australian television networks maybe
Amazon's doing a similar thing where
they don't have carriage quite yet so
it'll chill out at some point but where
every time I was waiting every time
there's like a highly anticipated you
know episode or TV show coming out like
that gets pirated like crazy every day I
but it's those spikes that like happened
like they did for a grand tour I don't
see this continuing for it mm-hmm also
and I have to watch I still have to
personally watch grand tour but like now
that we have those shows like westworld
and Game of Thrones for some reason I
personally question how rabid is it's
extremely rabbit but it's also like will
this be the show that like keeps getting
stuck until like DVDs and then passed
around and what maybe rent or yeah grant
went underground cuz like other shows
have been like that like we go to like a
china china there's a deep pirated DVD
market and you can like DVDs yeah or
laundromats and Bronx yeah sorry or
anywhere in here well fair enough I
lived in the Bronx and that was a ivory
that's how i restocked most of my
collection in a bar and like people will
like come in with like fake DVDs like
yeah sure yet laundromat that that's
popular spot to like it happened when I
got a haircut one time so would you get
I didn't get anything they just came in
it's like oh my god they're everywhere
it's my house nah I think that's
probably pretty good place to wrap it up
or everyone's just kind of hemming and
hawing in the chat at this point okay
thank you for hanging out yeah if you if
you come back tomorrow we're interested
to see if you are still again check out
the store and
we'll post it in the show notes to see
what the situation is regarding this
update and what it's going what is going
to happen and how if anybody's finding a
creative way around it we're interested
to see how you pull that off all right
