world's first smartphone with an ultra
tough sapphire crystal display hello
everybody I'm Lin la for Cena and today
we're gonna check out the Kyocera
brigadiere for Verizon first the basics
the 4G LTE device has a 4.5 inch HD
display that has a 1280 by 720 pixel
resolution it runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat
and has some nifty software features
from Kyocera including a barometer that
measures your current altitude a compass
and a widget that displays all this on
your screen for easy access the handset
is powered by a 1.4 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 400 processor and a
non-removable 3.1 ampere hour battery
that has a usage time of up to 26 hours
and wireless charging capabilities on
the sides here you'll have a shortcut
button for the camera and another button
here that you could program to launch
any app like the Chrome browser your
email or the flashlight the phone's also
equipped with an 8 megapixel camera that
can record 1080p HD video and a 2
megapixel front facing shooter users
will also get 16 gigs of internal memory
with an option to expand up to 32 gigs
via a microSD card and 2 gigs of RAM now
as you can obviously tell the brigadiere
is designed to be incredibly tough it
has a thicker encasing that is heavier
and bulkier than your standard handset
the device is also dust shock and
waterproof and it could survive in 6
feet of water for up to 30 minutes it's
not operational underwater and you'll
have to make sure the ports are sealed
and plugged beforehand
lastly the phone is a first to support a
sapphire shield display more durable
than common smartphone screens the
Brigadier can stand up to the scratches
scuffs and drops that accidentally
happen with your handset every day
currently the device is only available
on Verizon it will cost $50 with a
contract or $400 without again I'm Lyn
and you've been checking out the Kyocera
