show about do-it-yourself tech and how
to's I'm Donnell Bell and I'm Eric
Franklin and we've got some great
do-it-yourself projects ahead there are
a lot of fun and sometimes they're the
best way to make the most out of your
tech definitely if you're looking for an
original way to share your favorite
music this may be the way to go there
are a lot of portable boom boxes out
there but I guarantee you the best
sounding one is the one you make
yourself I'm going to show you how to
make your own self-contained boombox
that's unlike anything you can go out
and buy now let's go over the parts
you're gonna need for this first up
you're gonna need the X mini happy
speaker this is a critical item and it's
probably the most expensive item in this
whole thing around sixteen seventeen
bucks
has a built-in speaker and a built-in
mp3 player it's called the world's
smallest boombox we're gonna make it
bigger next you're gonna need is a basic
craft box this is gonna hold everything
together the speaker the mp3 player
everything's gonna go in here this is
gonna be your boombox
you're also gonna want a four ohm
speaker probably overkill bigger than we
need but why not it's a boom box now for
the rest of the stuff you're gonna want
a momentary switch some odds and ends
some bolts some solder some wire some
tools we're gonna cover that when we get
to it for now let's open the X Mini up
and see what's under the hood
alright here is the speaker itself we're
gonna actually take this speaker off
we're going to replace this speaker with
our big one this is the guts this is the
brains of the whole boombox
here we've got an mp3 player that reads
off of this SD card we've got a little
control here for play pause and power
and then we've got a recharging port on
the side here and the little battery
this is all we need to make our boombox
creation
all right so here's our in car
replacement speaker eight bucks steel
this thing can handle 50 watts I think
our mp3 player spits out about two watts
of sound we're going to put the speaker
facedown on our box safety first
we're all drilled out we have a few more
holes to drill ones going to be on the
side and that's going to be for our
power play pause button the other is
going to be on the back and that's going
to be for our charging cable
for our next step we're going to mount
the speaker in the hole and then we're
going to solder the connections from the
back of the speaker to the X mini you
should have read on positive black on
negative and you got it and then go red
wire red wire here on the X mini and
black wire is going to go where that
green wire is connected to the negative
all right
trying to flip it back over and wire up
our momentary switch to these two little
contact pads that will control
play/pause and power
I should do it let's hot glue the
circuit board into the box all right now
you can temporarily seal it up a little
dab of glue so there you go now you've
got your own self-contained rechargeable
mini boombox you can just load it up
with your favorite tunes and give it as
a gift or just save it for yourself all
in all the whole thing cost me just
about $60 there you go
rock out
excellent job on that dude I like making
a mess yeah make a mess of that one
though but you did a really good job
thank you all right it's time for a
quick break and when we come back we've
got some clever and easy ways to hide
those ugly power cords
welcome back understand you're not
really into ugly power cords no I mean
is anyone really into awkward dangling
from the knife to the power cord is like
audio cables hose HDMI cables yeah a ton
any form of cable dangling from my
appliances I hate them
yeah without reason fortunately we have
a clever way to hide those power cords
hiding your cables isn't always an
option but if you're willing to get a
little crafty there's an easy way you
can camouflage them with just a couple
of supplies you can turn any power cord
HDMI cable or ethernet cord into what
looks like a house plant for this
project you'll need stem tape or florist
tape which you can find at a local craft
store you'll need artificial vine in the
length of the cord that you want to
cover I'm going to cover this power cord
and it's about four feet long so I don't
expect this project to take any more
than about 15 minutes when you're
covering this cable only cover the parts
of the core that are actually exposed
because if one end is in a media console
or directly behind your TV it can create
a fire hazard it's best to work with the
tape in one foot long pieces so that
things don't get all tangled up only
part of this cord is exposed so I'm
starting down here and just make your
way down the cord wrapping it really
tightly as you go down use one hand to
wrap and the other hand to really make
sure that that's done tape is adhering
really well to the cord
so just keep going all the way down
pressing down with one hand and wrapping
with the other we're giving this cord a
nice green base that it blends nicely
with the artificial vine tada
we are done see that wasn't too hard and
that was the hardest part now comes the
fun part we get to turn this into what
looks like a vine I'll start it down
here I'm using the same tape adhere the
vine to the cord
and keep attaching the vine to the court
about every five or six inches to make
sure it really looks like it's a part of
the court looking good all right we're
done wrapping the cord and I do have a
little bit left over so luckily it's
made out of plastic I can just rip it
off use it for something else and now
check it out our cord looks a lot more
visually appealing than as it before so
plug it in and there you go the power
cord is now a vine plus if you want to
make it look a little fuller and cover
that cord even more just double up on
the vine that was really cool definitely
better than using like a random binder
clip or some other random tools and
rubberband this time twist is someone
who's run cables through my wall before
in order to disguise them I can tell you
that route is nothing but pain yeah I
feel you a lot of times yeah back to the
binder clip though there are actually
some clever uses for binder clip
specially for using like the tech
gadgets true I am a big fan of the
binder clip and it comes up in our next
DIY segment dan Graziano is going to
show us how to make his own smart phone
stands there are cases and stands out
there that can prop up your phones but
if you're on the go or just want to save
some money you can actually create your
own the best part about this is that we
will be using items you can find around
your house or the office for the first
one you will need a paper clip and a
pair of pliers start by straightening
out the paper clip and place your finger
in the center of the band and then bend
the band around your finger at the
bottom bend up to little feet
make sure to bend it forward a bit to
keep the phone balanced all you have to
do now is spread out the legs about 45
degrees and place your phone in pretty
simple but if you are nervous about
scratching your device you may want to
try the second stand this one is even
easier all you need are two binder clips
a larger one and a smaller one on the
small clip clap the two arms together
and then while holding them bend the
body upwards then insert the arms
halfway into the mouth of the larger
clip then just place your phone in and
begin watching your favorite
movie the reason I like this stand is
because you can use it with either your
phone and landscape or portrait for the
last stand all you need is a small paper
cup and a pair of scissors or a box
cutter I will be using this four inch
special CNET Edition Cup to start cut
two lines across from each other down
about an inch from the bottom of the cup
when connecting the two lines cut a
curved line this will help your phone
stay in place you can also cut a small
hole in the back and run a charger
through it these are only some of the
ways that you can make your own smart
phone stand but really with a little
creativity you can use just about
anything that's it for this week's show
we hope you enjoyed these projects and
maybe got inspired to make something of
your own I was inspired good yeah are
you gonna make I don't know I hope did
you just have the inspiration when you
find out email us at the fix at cnet.com
or you can tweet us i'm at donald and
i've at need opel we'll see you next
time right here on the fix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
