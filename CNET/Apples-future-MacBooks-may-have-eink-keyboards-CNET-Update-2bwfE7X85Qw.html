computers to show off and these may come
with some new features like a touch
screen and fingerprint reader all signs
point to Apple showing off new MacBooks
at a press event on Thursday October
27th so what could we see maybe a
MacBook with a touch screen strip that
replaces the function keys that may also
serve as a fingerprint reader to be used
for Apple pay or for unlocking the
laptop it could also have better
graphics processors for video games
that's all according to a report from
Bloomberg it would mark Apple's first
big laptop overhaul in four years
there's also some buzz that Apple may do
away with the normal charging port in
the MacBook Pro and replace it with a
USB C port just like I did with the
updated smaller 12-inch MacBook Apple
said it took courage to remove the
headphone jack on the iPhone 7 so we'll
have to wait and see if Apple has the
courage so to speak to replace all ports
with USB sees may be the highest
stocking stuffer this year's gonna be
dongle adapters but perhaps the biggest
change coming to Mac books won't even
happen until 2018 The Wall Street
Journal reports that Apple has teamed up
with an Australian startup company
called sander design to create e-ink
screen keyboards the keys can change
from the alphabet to special characters
or even emojis depending on what you
need sander already is taking pre-orders
for a standalone version of this
keyboard for $200 the technology is
similar to the screens used on ink
readers like the Kindle with each key
having its own screen now although that
won't be something we're gonna see this
year no matter what Apple has in store
I'm sure Microsoft isn't happy that
Apple is having an event the day after
its big windows news Microsoft is
expected to make some surface news on
Wednesday October 26 possibly showcasing
an all-in-one surface PC let's see which
company has the more impressive fall
lineup that's it for this tech news
