1080p resolution smart display and this
is the 199 dollar portal Facebook's more
affordable 720p digital screen unlike
other smart displays out there portals
are all about video calling exclusively
through facebook messenger that means if
you or the people you want to talk to
don't have facebook or use facebook
Messenger you can't use a portal while
portals are limited to Facebook users
these devices have some clear advantages
for anyone wanting to stay in touch with
friends and family they don't regularly
see portal to portal calling is much
more immersive than a typical video call
because the smart cameras in the portals
actually track you around a space so
that means instead of having to
constantly grab your phone or tablet and
reposition them to talk
the portals do the heavy lifting for you
they also have augmented reality effects
so you can select a fun face filter or
become part of a bedtime story during a
portal call both devices have built-in
Alexis speakers and Facebook's hello
portal voice service use Amazon's voice
assistant for all of your regular smart
speaker needs and save hello portal for
adjusting the speaker volume opening
portal apps like Spotify and video
calling hey portal call rich brown yes
hey rich how's it going hey Wow look at
you oh did you see that I did pretty
well for a second there I just yeah it
was pretty good here's what I got it's
not quite as impressive but oh stuck in
the beard I was impressed by how much I
truly felt like I was in the same room
with the person on the other side of the
screen and without any noticeable lag
time that's great since it's pretty much
the entire point of these smart displays
but even so I'm not convinced there's a
strong market for them the portal plus
in particular is huge and really
expensive I do like that you can rotate
it between portrait and landscape mode
and it's 1080p resolution but it's too
big to incorporate into your home decor
I also wish both speakers audio quality
was better they're fine but they didn't
blow me away and while you can video
call from a portal to a phone or a
tablet or from a phone or a tablet to a
portal it's much better with two portals
since everyone benefits from the auto
tracking cameras as far as privacy goes
a social networking giant runs its AI
tech locally on the portal and your
calls are encrypted but it does gather
usage information such as how long your
phone calls are to use in the ads it
shows you later on
that means these smart displays will
likely be a tough sell for anyone
feeling uncertain about Facebook privacy
but if you use facebook Messenger and
want to video chat without the hassle of
holding and constantly repositioning
your device the portal might actually be
worth it to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
