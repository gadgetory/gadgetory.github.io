my hand we have a first look at Sony's
PlayStation Vita now the first thing
you're gonna notice right off the bat
this gorgeous a 5-inch OLED display also
the power of the graphics in this
handheld unlike every anything we've
seen before they really touted that it
was on we're almost on the level of ps3
graphics I'm gonna tell you when I look
at this it's made me a believer now some
of the other features that this has it
has dual analog sticks something we've
been waiting for
also some innovative touch play so this
screen on the front is a touch screen it
also has a touch panel on the back side
that is incorporated in the gameplay for
a variety of titles now this device is
equipped with Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi and 3G AT&amp;amp;T
will be the carrier here in the US I
know some of you might not be so
thrilled about that but either way if
you want to get access to data at any
time you have that ability now the PS
Vita also has a front-facing camera and
up camera on the backside that you can
be used for you know augmented reality
apps but the models here available
there's two of them the Wi-Fi version
will be 249 they'll be available
sometime in the holiday season and the
Wi-Fi and 3G version will be $2.99 but
there you have it the first look at one
of the most anticipated handhelds that I
can remember and it feels really light
and I can't wait to get my hands on this
more there you have it Brian saw here at
e3 2011 with the PS Vita</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
