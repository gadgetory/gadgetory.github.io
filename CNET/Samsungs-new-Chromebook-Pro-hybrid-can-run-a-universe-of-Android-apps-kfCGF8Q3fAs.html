right that's what I used to think when
these budget laptops running Google's
Chrome OS first showed up they were
basically just web browsers in a box
good for surfing and that's about it
but a few years makes a big difference
in this new Samsung Chromebook Pro is
probably one of the first laptops I tell
you to look at if you were looking to
spend around 500 bucks on a new computer
sure there are plenty Windows laptops in
that price range or less but none that I
can think of offer this combination of a
decent design mostly metal construction
lag free performance long battery life a
better than HD touchscreen a hybrid
hinge that transforms the system into a
tablet and the built-in stylus on top of
that this is one of the first
Chromebooks to offer access to the
Google Play Store and with it millions
of Android apps
I got Instagram up and running right
away and the Amazon Alexa app both
usually only accessible on phones or
tablets a few didn't work like snapchat
or uber but Microsoft Office and
Photoshop Express were great you also
get access to a lot of Android games and
there's even an accelerometer that works
in some but again if you wanted to try
came up is not compatible still this is
my new budget go-to because it feels
faster and more responsive than budget
Windows laptops
I'd love a slightly nicer keyboard and
touchpad but using the built-in stylus
which sits in a little slot on the side
made it feel like a much more expensive
device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
