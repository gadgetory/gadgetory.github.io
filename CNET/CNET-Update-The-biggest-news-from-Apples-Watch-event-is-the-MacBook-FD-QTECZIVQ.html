seventeen thousand dollar Apple watch
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your seen
that update at an event in San Francisco
Apple revealed a few more details about
its SmartWatch but in a strange twist
the Apple watch wasn't the most
interesting thing at the event it was
what Apple did with its new MacBook more
on that in a moment first when it comes
to the SmartWatch we know it will come
in two sizes for three models sport is
the cheapest it starts at three hundred
and fifty dollars with colorful bands if
you want to in stainless steel the price
jumps to five hundred and fifty dollars
and it goes as high as 1050 dollars
depending on which size and van you pick
and the high-end the luxury apple watch
edition in gold starts an eye-popping
$10,000 the rose gold model is seventeen
thousand dollars it'll be able to tell
you the exact moment you went bankrupt
no actually doesn't do anything special
this price is just about the fashion
Apple wants to be a major player in the
world of fashion and if you have the
money you can make a statement about
your wealth with a watch that's a tiny
computer on your wrist you can check out
the watches for yourself in Apple stores
on April 10th when pre-orders begin and
the first ones are going to start
shipping on April 24th during the event
Apple said the battery life with normal
use should last 18 hours and it
demonstrated how apps can show you
different notifications on the watch but
Apple didn't show us an app that was
especially unique with something that
you couldn't already do on your phone
maybe that extra large iphone six-plus
is getting harder to take out of your
pocket so you'll want this to glance at
for quick replies it seems the main
reason to get one though is to track
your health during a workout so it can
be your little health coaching buddy now
about that macbook Apple made a major
update to the laptops design it's all
metal twenty-four percent thinner than
the macbook air and it weighs two pounds
it also has a 12 inch screen no vents no
fans a better touch pad they even
created new types of keys for the
keyboard but the most shocking change is
that there's only one connector port on
this thing just one it's USB see the
same port that you would use to recharge
it is the same port that you would plug
in any sort of connecting device with an
adapter of course because nothing you
one uses this new connection and if you
need to charge your laptop but you also
have to use a USB stick you may be out
of luck unless there's some sort of
splitter this new model comes in three
colors including gold and it ships April
10th starting at thirteen hundred
dollars Apple lower the price of its
streaming video box apple tv2 just under
seventy dollars and HBO announced its
new standalone internet subscription
service called HBO now it's going to
have an appt launching exclusively on
Apple TV and Apple devices it's fifteen
dollars a month gives you all HBO
programs past and present and when you
subscribe in April when it comes out
you'll get the first month free that's
your quick wrap-up of apples big
announcement but you can dive into more
