MacBook Air it's the redesign we've been
waiting years and years for and it's
right in this box so I think we should
we should take a look inside and see
what we've got inside pretty standard
looking Apple packaging this could be an
air it could be a MacBook Pro could be a
chrome inch MacBook all sort of looks
the same from the side a little taper
here wider in the back and now we're in
the front tells us this is this is
closer to the traditional air look they
don't say I'm MacBook Pro which is a
little more a little more squared off so
I'm gonna take the box turn it upside
down like this get my handy box cutter
and very very carefully cut the plastic
so we can open this up and see what's
inside the box
this is it the big moment and everyone
really copies this Apple packaging now
for their high-end premium products the
very sparse white box with a tight lid
that just sort of slides up but you've
got to kind of work it off a little bit
there we go and of course always some
plastic they keep your fingerprints off
it until you're absolutely ready to open
it up and it looks like this is the
space gray MacBook Air so a different
look than the normal silver you see
everywhere not the gold version that
would have been cool to check out but
maybe we'll come back to that later
looks and feels a lot more like a
MacBook Air than you would think from
the from the original photos and images
that even the previews we saw earlier
this week with Apple it's definitely got
a little bit of that rounded MacBook Air
feel inside the box is pretty minimal
we've got a USBC cable us PC on both
ends and we've got the familiar Apple
power brick and again this is the kind
that has USB see right there so you
can't use it for non USBC devices the
nice thing about USB see is that you can
use charges from other laptops or other
USB see devices to charge your macbook
it's one of the few things that is not
terribly proprietary
now I'm gonna take a fast peek here at
the system itself let's pop it open nice
Oh piece of paper right there now the
big difference here is obviously this
big screen where the image goes much
closer to the edge of the screen you
have that edge to edge glass so it looks
and feels a lot like a MacBook or a
MacBook Pro obviously big touch pad flat
butterfly filed keyboard and not one but
two USB C ports a headphone jack and
pretty much nothing else so if you want
to plug anything else in you're gonna
need a dongle or an adapter or you may
want to hang on to your your classic
MacBook Air
if you want to plug in all your
traditional USB and HDMI things but you
know what this MacBook would really like
me to set it up right now and I can't
wait so I'm gonna go do that thanks for
watching this unboxing and we will see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
