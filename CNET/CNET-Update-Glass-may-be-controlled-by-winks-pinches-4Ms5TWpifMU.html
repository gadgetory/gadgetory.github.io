Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update if you see someone testing out
the google glass headgear and they start
blinking their eyes rapidly and pinching
the air don't be alarmed this could be a
normal way to use the wearable computer
some interesting phrasing of code was
discovered in the myglass companion app
such as the phrase I gestures wink take
photo which means you might be able to
blink to take a photo and browser to
finger zoom which could mean moving a
thumb and index finger to zoom in and
out there's also code labeled head
gestures head wake so maybe shake your
head a certain way and it'll wake up the
device we'll find out soon enough as the
first units start to be shipped out to
testers and developers nokia wants you
to get excited about a new smartphone
with a physical keyboard that's right
kids phone makers still see a market for
phones with real keyboards and Nokia's
teasing that it will release one soon

of a bright yellow phone nokia will
release more info about it on wednesday

BlackBerry's new q10 with a keyboard

tweetdeck apps for Apple and Android
devices as well as the Adobe desktop

replacement Twitter management app like
HootSuite or use the browser version if
you use the Tumblr app to keep up with
your favorite blogs and animated gifts

Twitter's promoted tweets or Facebook

dollar sign icon here are some new apps
that might make your life easier take a
look at brightness it's free for Apple

good way to kick off a spring cleaning
weekend there's
also a new Yahoo app for Apple devices

who just wants to quickly scan headlines
from around the web if you turn on the
visual option the app will show
headlines on top of the main photo of
the story and the app uses new
technology that can summarize the text
of the story into a one paragraph
without any human interaction but you

story the app also has improved video
