should make retro products you guys see
the new Nokia 3310 it's got a lot of
people talking why probably nostalgia
and a really good reputation so we
wondered what other companies should
reissue older designs and ask you on
Twitter for your opinion let's get to it
at number 5 danger cooter polls only let
you put in four options but a couple of
people mention the danger sidekick the
device had a cool flip up screen that
revealed a full keyboard underneath
t-mobile owns the sidekick brand it was
even a model made by samsung called the
sidekick 4g that ran android so arguably
t-mobile could bring it back however
danger is no more which brings us to
number four microsoft microsoft bought
danger back in two thousand eight so if
a company were to reissue a version of
the sidekick Microsoft could be that
company what other retro products could
Microsoft bring back maybe a mini
version of the original Xbox it work
with Nintendo could a zoom work in 2017
now things get weird we had a tie for
our next to entry so we're gonna call
them both number two and our first
number two is sony sony has had awesome
designs in the path that you know people
will go crazy over how about a yellow
walkman or perhaps just laughing a
yellow walkman design on a phone JT on
Twitter asked for a minidisc revival
which might be crazy enough to work at
our second number two is Apple a couple
of people wanted to see that old cheese
grater Mac Pro make a comeback and I
can't blame them then there's also the
classic versions of the imac slapping
updated internals and I bet people would
buy that up oddly a number of people
told me they would buy an iPod Classic
if Apple loaded it up with one terabyte
of space and the number one company that
should go retro is motorola now owned by
Lenovo that Motorola brand has a lot of
classic designs just sitting around
there's the dynatac otherwise known as
the zack morris phone then there's a
star tech which was tiny and of course
people want the return of the razor flip
phone it was super thin with a really
big hinge and when you want it to end a
call snapping that things shut when the
conversation was over
thank you to everyone who voted you guys
are great if you want to find out when
we do polls follow me over on twitter
i'm at is and I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
