p20 pro and now honor Huawei sub-brand
is getting in on the vibrant action with
the honor 10 this boat has an all-glass
of back which looks vivid blue in
sunlight but give it a bit of a twirl
and your fingers and you'll start to see
some lovely purple tones come through
flip it around and you'll see a 5.8
4-inch screen
complete with a cutout notch at the top
which you can turn off in the settings
if you want to it's got a 20 to 80 by
1080 pixel resolution and is bright and
vibrant with a fingerprint scanner below
the screen hidden under the glass
there's no indentation to let you know
it's there so it is sometimes a little
tricky to get your finger placement
right in a hurry
still I do like this seamless look to it
and the scanner itself works well with a
24 megapixel monochrome sensor on the
back joined by a 16 megapixels color
sensor the cameras are the same
artificial intelligence that we've seen
before on hallways phones the idea being
that it recognizes the scene you're
trying to take a photo of and adjust
some of the settings accordingly the
problem is that in my use I found that
those settings are a little bit too much
with colors like blues and the skies or
greens and trees looking horribly
oversaturated luckily though you can
turn off that ai if you want to
ai aside I'm still not impressed with
the camera our door shots were very hit
and miss with some shots looking flat
with little contrast and mushy details
others were better with more vibrant
colors and more satisfying contrast but
I do find this inconsistency frustrating
selfies from the 24 megapixel front
camera was similarly disappointing with
poor contrast again producing drab
lifeless images in photography is your
main concern and you should probably
look elsewhere inside the phone runs the
same top-end kieran 970 processor the
quarry's got inside its flagship p20 pro
if so surprised then that these phones
give almost identical high performances
on our suite of benchmark tests in
everyday use this phone is very nippy
apps load quickly photo editing is
hassle free and even demanding games
like Riptide GP renegade play very
smoothly it charges with USB C and while
there's no waterproofing to keep it safe
from spills beer there is at least a
three point
five mil headphone jack on the bottom
overall then the honor tent looks great
and has plenty of power for it's very
reasonable asking price as long as you
know after the best camera performance
around it's definitely one to consider
but what do you think of the phone are
you interested at all or would you
rather spend a bit more money to get the
Huawei P 20 pro with this amazing
