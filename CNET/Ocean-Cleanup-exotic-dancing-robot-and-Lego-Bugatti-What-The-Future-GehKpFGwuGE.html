it's coming for the Pacific Garbage
Patch welcome to what the future today
we've got a massive project to clean the
oceans about to get underway a robot you
can live cam with and the Lego set every
kid always dreamed of all right let's
get right to it engineers are about to
launch ocean cleanup they gave us a look
at last-minute preparations the plan is
to send ocean cleanup on its maiden
voyage tomorrow from the San Francisco
Bay now this is a huge u-shaped floating
device 600 meters long it collects trash
using this 3 meter skirt that hangs
below the surface of the water once the
garbage is collected it's picked up in
boats for recycling the system operates
autonomously while an algorithm
determines its optimal locations now
engineers say fish and other wildlife
can swim safely underneath they designed
it specifically to clean up the Great
Pacific Garbage Patch now if you're not
familiar with that it's a huge
collection of floating junk sitting
between California and Hawaii a report
in March found the patches now three
times the size of France a few weeks ago
ocean cleanup tested a 120 meter section
of its system Engineers said they were
surprised at how well it performed in
rough waters previously referred to as
system zero zero one you can now call it
Wilson
now in a tweet the nonprofit's founder
asked Tom Hanks if you'd like to put his
handprint on Wilson so far no response
from Hanks say hello to the robot nobody
asked for this is cardiga porn site cam
soda calls it the world's first sex
robot people can live cam with for free
yes you can tell cardi bot what to do
from your own living room or bedroom or
wherever but it's not just twerking
shimmying and shaking as cam Soto says
cardi BOTS can converse with users
that's right
it can talk dirty cam soda says cardi
bot will be available once a week for
free public shows but if you want a more
intimate experience you can take it into
a private session and yes she accepts
tips
now if cardi bot looks familiar she's
the work of the same artist who designed
these robot strippers we saw at CES this
year alright remember when you told your
parents you were gonna build a car out
of Legos that really drives then you
gave up six minutes later to watch
cartoons
well this bugatti chiron is made up of
over 1 million legos and yes you can
drive it but the crazy part is they
built it the same way you remember
building LEGO sets no glue it's powered
by over 2,000 Lego motors like the ones
moving the rear spoiler here it did
require a few custom pieces and Lego
produced a special color to match a real
sheer on Legos team spent about 13,000
work hours building it still not as long
as I spent building the lego Imperial
Walker as a kid
now since I know you're all wondering
Lego estimates the car gets a whopping
5.3 horsepower and a top speed of about
18 miles per hour that's just a hair
under the 260 from a real Sheeran all
right it's question time Jason Fifield
wants to know what keeps other boats
from hitting Ocean Queen up now the
chances of that are pretty slim
since the Garbage Patch doesn't sit in
any heavily traffic shipping routes but
ocean cleanup says it's taken plenty of
precautions including anti-collision
beacons and radar reflectors plus the
Coast Guard will chart the area as what
it calls a special operation zone and
notify ships of the system's location
all right what makes you say WTF leave
your question in the comments below
that's going to do it for this show
I'm Andy Altman thanks for watching
