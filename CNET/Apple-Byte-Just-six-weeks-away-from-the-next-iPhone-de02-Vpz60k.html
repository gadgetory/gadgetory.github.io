look at the composition of that thing
and I'm hi Brian special delivery what's
up JJ today oh my gosh will check check
this out wait wait on we go look in this
section TV on the web apple pie baby oh
by the spot that's great no no it's so
great I'm gonna replace my Justin Bieber
out of that photo with this thing yeah
whatever we gotta go to the morning
meeting let's go come on meeting come on
again
what's happened i'm brian Tong and
welcome to the apple pie for everything
the good the bad all of it inside the
world of Apple right here now we finally
have a rumored date for apple's next
iphone to debut on sep tember the 12th
that's a wednesday with the release of
the phone to follow nine days later on
Friday September the 21st according to
I'm or no other tech outlets have also
confirmed September 12 as the date for
an apple announcement but there hasn't
been an official confirmation by the big
a just yet I'm or also reports that the
ipad mini yes that guy will be announced
at the same event along with the new
rumored ipod nano and ipod touch with
September historically being the time
for apples music player announcements
now I lounge chimes in with some details
about the iphone and the new dock
connector that some people are still
obsessed about they say it will not be a
19 or 16 pin connector but eight pins
that will potentially have the ability
to connect the docks and cables in
either orientation like a magsafe so
we'll see about that but we asked you
the Apple biters to tell us what you
thought now Anthony says iphone 5 yes
regardless of number of pins patty says
the new design alone is enough for me to
not get the iphone 5 putting the jack on
the bottom doesn't make sense now it's
about half and half of people who prefer
it on top I prefer it on the bottom the
headphone jack that is kevin says they
should wait for a better phone and
that's blackberry 10 no now I lounge
also reports there will be an iOS 6 and
bluetooth for link that they speculate
will allow an ipod nano to receive
messages or emails on its screen for
people who are still wearing it as a
watch that i promise to no longer make
fun of it would be taking the concept of
the kickstarter pebble watch or sony
smartwatch and bringing it to the apple
ecosystem also with the announcement
potentially getting closer new video
footage and still images from Japanese
repair shop I lab factory shows a fully
assembled device of what the front and
the back side of the new iPhone might
look like now we know Apple CEO Tim Cook
talked about doubling down on secrecy a
few months ago but these images are so
detailed and believable I'm starting to
believe this is it or could Apple really
have
sleek tout the iphone 5 get it I said fo
set a phone alright let's check out our
app of the week this one's a no-brainer
it's the amazon instant video app for
the ipad now amazon prime members who
pay seventy nine dollars a year really
get the benefit of having access to a
boatload of shows and movies but if
you're not a member you can still
purchase content to watch on the app now
a few things you guys should know there
is no search function in the app to find
anything you want you have to scroll
through the icons there is no search
also thanks to apple's awesome rules if
you want to purchase any content and
view it here you have to go to amazon's
website first to make the transaction
and then it will appear in your library
but you can't do it within the app in
you can thank Apple for that and at the
moment airplay only works for audio and
not full screen video yes it's still the
app of the week because how can you
complain about 120,000 videos and shows
now being available for free but it's
not perfect just like people so check
out the amazon instant video app alright
there's also an ongoing trial between
Apple and Samsung that's expect to the
last several weeks where Apple is trying
to convince a jury that one of its
biggest rivals Samsung copy their
designs and technology to get where they
are today now Samsung's arguing apple's
ipad and iphone would have been
impossible to develop without their
technology remember Samsung makes
components that are inside of Apple's
products making this the best pair of
frenemies we've seen since Paris Hilton
and Nicole Richie now the best part of
this fight is that we have now been
given access to the thinking and designs
inside of Apple with prototype
renderings and images that are being
made public for this case now look at
some of these is some pretty cool stuff
and some of the design cues have even
been implemented into the rumored
prototype that we've seen already now
Apple vs samsung is constantly evolving
it's a long ways to go so we'll keep you
in the loop with major things that
happen each week alright let's check out
some quick bites Apple TV fans will be
happy to get a new edition with hulu
plus I've never paid for Hulu Plus but I
know you cord-cutters do so you can
check that out and macbook pro retina
display owners get a little love since
the Thunderbolt a firewire adapter is
available at the apple store and also in
completely unrelated news did you hear
Snoop Dogg you know the rapper Snoop
Dogg is officially changing his name to
snoop lion after he said in an interview
i feel i have always been a Rastafari I
just didn't have my third eye open your
third eye well whatever we welcome snoop
lion to this world and it's also been
confirmed as the next name for OS 10
