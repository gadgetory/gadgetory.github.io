and the top and then add 16 grand to the
base does that add up to more or less
let's drive the 2011 Nissan Murano cross
Cabriolet and check the tech now the
number one feature of a cross cab is the
cab part more than the cross part let's
get into it
open this enormous dorm by the way these
doors are huge because they take out the
rear doors on a cross cab extend the
front door and apparently store like
Nazi gold inside this thing these things
weigh about a ton each if you let go of
one of these in a parking lot you're
going to kill the other car just FYI
now hit the button in the console and
here we go let's watch the show notice
how low this thing is by the way it's a
very low profile rag top with a lot of
frame work in it we'll check out the
trunk space in a minute because you see
the top is going to get completely
submerged in that rear space behind the
rear seat pretty fast in its actuation
and like most of the modern convertibles
today everything buttons up with a
hardtop and a bunch of nice panels ok
trunk space about a BB - on this car
it's a big vehicle with a decent amount
of space with the top down that's what's
hiding behind here there's my top now if
I were to put this cover down you can
see if that top weren't there I'd gain
some more altitude it's never a giant
trunk but it's definitely usable for a
weekend for to the folks in the second
row have to wear the same underwear the
whole trip Oh check this out when the
top is up you've got the rear backlight
glass heated then you've got a spar here
that's upholstered and then they try and
make some more window with this little
kind of olds Vista Cruiser thing up here
oh by the way the Murano cross cab just
got the new scenic car tech 2011 award
for vehicle with the most ways to
amputate your limbs these big ol heavy
doors is number one get a leg down there
in the sill and one of these doors
closes on it forget it you're a pirate
running around with a peg leg and a
parrot and if you've got your hand up
here on the header when you're closing
the top check this out oh what's the
point of that now we're all across cabs
only come one way a high end loaded up
edition you've got leather and you've
got pretty much all the tech hard drive
based GPS now not an interface that I
love but not one that I hate looks a
little dated but 7 inch LCD controller
as well as touch pretty much any way you
want to drive it or you can use voice as
well your audio options are also pretty
much all there satellite radio am/fm no
HD USB av aux Jack's here in the console
and you've got automatic dual
temperature control little silly when
the tops down let's talk about the
transmission one choice only here which
is interesting it's a CVT in a big
vehicle that's all-wheel drive with a
pretty big engine you don't always see
CVTs they're kind of rare at that level
this one is really simple PRN BL ones
the last time you saw that no shift gate
no s4 sport no paddles up here for
shifting about all you gots a switch
over here it's a defeat overdrive this
is refreshingly basic and kind of honest
whatever you're listening to comes out
of Bose speakers a7 plus a subwoofer
hard drives music and iPod scrolling are
all pretty fast and fluid that minimizes
the amount of time your eyes will be on
that and not on the road looking where
you're going
now across cab has a little more power
out of its three and a half litre v6 in
a standard Murano its 265 on the
horsepower 248 foot-pounds of torque
it's this forty four hundred pound carb
260 in the low eight second range the
downside is it delivers hoggish MPG of
17 city 22 highway kiss that 22 goodbye
you'll never see it this car weighs
about 230 pounds more than a standard
murano and of course it's a big thing to
push through the air so there's just no
winning that mpg battle there's
something cool about the cross cab being
open and up high it's a combination
you'll normally get most suvs aren't
convertible so that's the first thing
you notice in this car the next thing
you notice is how this cross cab has a
lot of power it comes on nicely for
everyday driving it's not the kind of
car you're going to take for you know
carving up a canyon road but it
definitely is good everyday accessible
power the only thing I like to do though
is kick it out of overdrive when I'm in
the city otherwise this thing tries to
go to overdrive in low-speed driving
when you need power you tip in and it
falls on its face that's the one thing I
do beyond that it's a good combination
of power and transmission programming
once you get out on the road that's
where things get weird maybe you can
even see it here in the camera it's
shaking the camera is mounted up on the
cowl the cowl doesn't seem to have any
relationship to the rest of the car we
experienced this in the Volkswagen Eos
recently when you make it convertible
and you cut out that rigid top unless
you do some very good engineering
underneath which isn't impossible you
end up with the the whole cowl of the
car kind of doing this and this car has
got a pretty bad case of that you can
always tell look in the rear view mirror
while you're going over a road that is
anything but glass smooth and the mirror
is going like this that means the car is
twisting like this it's not a nice
feeling the ride in this car is kind of
springy and bouncy it's kind of you know
comfortably fun on by the way the cross
camp Bose audio system has more than
enough guts to overcome all this road
noise
oh geez anyway let's price our Murano
cross cab 47 - they only come one way
all load it up like I showed you there
are only three options to talk about
they're all bizarre one is a seat belt
extender in case you're going to be
driving to your audition for The Biggest
Loser the other one is a set of airbag
anti-theft bolts where do they think the
buyers of this live and the last one is
really bizarre sports horns I don't make
this up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
