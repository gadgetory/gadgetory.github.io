buzz report this week scrabble wars kids
these days and a possible google killer
but first it's the gadget of the week
the gadget of the week is the iphone huh
okay no it's not really the iphone it's
the iphone as vehicle for this new
urbanspoon iphone app okay now
urbanspoon whatever competitor to chow
which we owned so don't go to the
website but the iphone app is
unbelievable ok first you use the
phone's GPS to figure out where you are
and then you put in some review criteria
like restaurant cuisine type and then
price and then you shake the phone and
this little slot machine type business
finds you a restaurant and then you can
lock down things like let's see I'm in
soma lock that South of Market I only
want two dollar signs because I'm cheap
and then I shake again and it finds
another one this right here is the only
reason I want an iphone well that in the
lightsaber game do you think I could get
those for blackberry come on and now for
the news the scribe euless scrabble
battle is gripping the nation first
Hasbro and Electronic Arts released the
official scrabble version for facebook
then they sued the makers of Scrabble
asst and then scribe euless promptly
disappeared from facebook obviously then
hours later the official scrabble game
went down was it a sudden rush of users
no apparently forces loyal to scribe
euless hacked the ruling regime and
briefly toppled it but the ragtag rebels
couldn't stamp out the scrabble elite
and the official rulers are now firmly
back in power hey you know what all you
scrub euless fans can do get back to
work a new study shows that girls mature
faster than boys when it comes to cell
phones the multimedia intelligence study
found that ninety-one percent of 17 year
old girls have a cell phone while just
seventy eight percent of 17 year old
boys have one dear 17 year old boys
would you like to get a date get a cell
phone and speaking of the youth of today
we've got a new segment here on the buzz
report
kids these days The Wall Street Journal
reports this week on a new breed of job
applicant kids who can't even spell
anymore apparently some recent college
grads are emailing thank you notes to
prospective employers that include text
message style abbreviations multiple
exclamation points misspellings and even
the horror emoticons let's take a look
at an actual correspondence from a real
college student hey thanks for the info
the other day great to meet you hope
you'll give me the job smiles think I'd
be pretty good at it and get lots of
raises real fast route LOL kthanksbye
hiring managers say letters like this
are usually deal killers because they're
you know stupid and unprofessional so if
you're a college kid and you're watching
this trust me don't do that I'm not just
saying that to be uncool and finally
let's have a look at what's clogging the
tubes the internet is going crazy for
the new google killer cool it's spelled
CU IL but it's pronounced cool clever
write this out of left field search
engine has a former search architect at
Google on board 30 million dollars in
funding and more than 120 million pages
indexed it could be stronger faster and
smarter than Google go try it out
cool is a joke the search results are
barely relevant to anything and the
pictures don't match the results look at
thinks I'm either this lady or natali
del conte or I've launched the urban
cartoon version of the buzz report and
that name is the stupidest thing I've
ever heard you can't pronounce it and
you can't spell it the internet hates
cool cool should never have even been
born and that's the Internet in a
nutshell sorry cool stick around though
we might forget all about you and then
fall in love all over again but I'm just
FYI I look like this I'm Hollywood and
this has been a buzz report thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
