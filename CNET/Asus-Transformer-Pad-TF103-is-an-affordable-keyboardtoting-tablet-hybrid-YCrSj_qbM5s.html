much as a laptop so those interested in
one that Peters into laptop territory
but still has the perks of a portable
slave will find this Asus tablet to be a
diamond in the rough
I'm Xiomara blocker prasena and this is
a first look at the transformer pad PF
1:03 the 10.1 inch tablet hybrid skips
the high-end look seen on the
transformer prime and opts for a more
simplified utilitarian one the plastic
build gives it a cheap feel however it's
thick girth helps make it feel sturdy
when using as a tablet the soft matte
finish on the back is smooth and
comfortable but it doesn't provide much
grip support I was impressed by how the
design of the transformer pad dock has
improved snapping the tablet into the
keyboard dock is easier than ever but
the keyboard itself is a little cramped
to type on that said it's still better
than using an on-screen keyboard the
transformer pad TF 1:03 houses a
quad-core Bay trial processor 1 gigabyte
of RAM 16 gigabytes of internal storage
and a micro SD card slot expandable up
to 64 gigabytes the 1280 by 800 pixel
resolution screen is sharp and colourful
however the lack of an ambient light
sensor means you have to manually adjust
the brightness settings when switching
environments there's a 0.3 megapixel
front-facing camera and a rear 5
megapixel shooter and though the native
camera app offers many different screen
modes settings and manual focus photo
quality is poor pictures typically come
out fuzzy and washed out you're probably
better off using your smart phone camera
it ships with aces new Zen user
interface which comes loaded with
features for customizing your tablet and
functional and fun ways the trendy flat
design is simple
easy-to-use without being restricting
asu's packs in its typical suite of apps
which include screen calibration
software in audio enhancing apps and
their robust battery saving features the
transformer pad also stuffs in a few
other free perks including music
downloads from a music magazines
courtesy of Zinio and 500 gigabytes of
free cloud storage for two years via a
ceases web storage service starting at
$2.99 as a standalone tablet the
transformer pad is forgettable but the
potential for productivity is unleashed
with the keyboard dock if you're looking
for an affordable tablet geared towards
productivity check out my full review on
Sina again I'm Xiomara blanco and this
has been a first look at the Asus
Transformer Pad T f103</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
