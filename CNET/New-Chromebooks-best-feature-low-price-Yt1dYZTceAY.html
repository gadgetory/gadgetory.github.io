but the new Chromebook from google and
samsung is powered by the same
lightweight processor that runs your
smartphone hi i'm seth rosenblatt
frisina and today we're taking a quick
tour of the latest chrome OS laptop from
google and samsung that's so low priced
it may be the first one that people
actually buy Google is making this
Chromebook the most accessible one yet
starting with an aggressively affordable
price at $249 that's 300 less than the
samsung series 5 Chromebook and eighty
dollars below the samsung series 3
chromebox the Chrome OS version of the
mac mini it ships with the arm-based
Exynos s dual chip a dual-core processor
running at 1.7 gigahertz it can decode
1080p video at 60 frames per second it
supports hdmi USB 2 and USB 3 it has a
webcam uses hardware accelerated
graphics and run software on its
graphics hardware with the opencl
interface it comes with an external rj45
dongle if you want to use ethernet an SD
card slot and a duel jack for headphone
and microphone it weighs just under 2.5
pounds making it the lightest chromebook
yet it feels much more comfortable to
carry around google says the battery
will last you around six and a half
hours although we found the 11.6 inch
screen to suffer from glitter pixel for
lack of a better term the trackpad is
fairly responsive and supports some
gestures like to finger tap to
right-click and two-finger swipe to
scroll some people might not like the
fact that the caps lock key is a
dedicated search button although you can
remap it but there's no delete key
either only backspace the Chromebooks
run chrome OS the browser based
operating system that updates every six
weeks on Google's rapid release schedule
new features in the version that ships
with this Chromebook include deep
connections to Google Play and 100
gigabytes of cloud storage in Google
Drive for two years on top of the 16
gigs of local storage there are some
limitations that restrict its usability
Wi-Fi only for one but the fact that
it's running Chrome OS locks you into
either Google services or websites
itunes won't work although there is
google play music the chrome OS gets
real sluggish with more than 20 or so
tabs although it does sink instantly
across your google power devices and
Chrome browsers it's a solid laptop for
at-home use and if you hate typing on a
tablet it could be a great device for
homework or mid-level productivity it's
not for everybody though with the first
look at Samsung and Google's latest
laptop running Chrome OS i'm seth
