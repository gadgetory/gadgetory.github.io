but they can still only show roughly one
third of the colors the human eye can
see Dolby is trying to change that with
Dolby vision it's new television
technology dobby vision brings to the
consumer the things that he's always
been looking for you know high
brightness display but one that retains
the contrast the colors that you could
see in the real world Dolby vision aims
to provide 40 times the brightness of
today's TVs notice how the colors of
these flowers appear more saturated
right objects like the Sun aren't just
washed out but can be shown with real
detail and watch how the highlights
spark on the plane's wings and really
bounce off the water adding to the depth
and lifelike nature of the scene far is
incredibly bright and its imprint
incredibly colorful and the two together
just cannot be displayed on today's
television receivers you can bring a lot
more emotion and feel to the content
that's because color plays a big role in
manipulating how an audience responds to
a scene with a few adjustments
colourists can change the time of day
refocus attention on one character or
even set the mood where do I want your
eye to go is that the stolen necklace is
that the murderers tie so I want you to
focus in on the middle of this scene how
am I going to get a person to look there
why don't I go in and just put a light
on there and i manipulated the color in
that triangle to create that light a lot
of directors will actually pull your
idol around throughout a movie some
Hollywood studios have committed to
making movies with dolby vision and
hopes that their artistic intent will be
more accurately represented in the
finished product today's cinema cameras
have the capability of capturing a much
wider dynamic range than anything that
we've been able to display up till now
so Dolby vision solves this problem by
creating the link between the quality
that we can achieve in the studio all
the way down to the television system in
your home sharp and TCL televisions that
feature Dolby vision will be available
to consumers later this year in San
Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
