this is orb next it's a color-changing
glass cube with built-in LEDs Wi-Fi and
its own dedicated channel on if the
online automation network that uses if
this then that based recipes so with orb
next you can program anything you can
think of to trigger the color of the
cube to change if you want the cube to
turn green when your stock prices up or
turn blue and you have a facebook
notification you can program all of that
using ifft now in addition to that if
channel you'll control orb next using
the blink and play app from advanced to
loom onyx the company that made this
thing and with that app you can change
the color directly you can set a color
cycle to go you can do a couple of
things but not as much as I would like
you can't create a customized color
cycle so you can't make it go red green
blue red green blue it only has one
option you also can't do a music sync
mode you can't schedule the light to
come on at a certain time now some of
that you can do with if you can use if
to say at six o'clock I want green light
but still that feels like a feature that
should have been in the app another
qualms with the app is this color
selector it's just not that great you
have to slide around on the thing and
then press a separate button to see the
color you can't just watch the cube
change color as you slide and you know
release your thumb when you like what
you see you have to keep on tapping the
color selector and tapping the button
until you get a color you like I don't
like that that's a lot clunkier than
you'll see with philips hue or lifx or
other smart color changing bulbs that
we've taken a look at of course the
functionality goes way up once you start
playing with if you can do whatever you
really want you can do some weird
recipes with it and if you want to get
creative there's plenty of room for it
so if you like that the orb next might
be something you'd enjoy still this
costs 129 dollars that's an awful lot
that the heck of a splurge that's more
than the life x bulb cost that's more
than individual philips hue bulbs cost
more than the taboo lumen bulb cost all
of those have color-changing smarts
philips hue has its own if channel
you've got a lot of options with those
that make a little more sense i think
than this but still if you like it if
you want it on your desk if you think it
looks cool and you'd have fun playing
with it it's not the worst words in the
world for CNN I'm right Chris
