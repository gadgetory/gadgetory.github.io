calling regard to do the talk you had
about the media coverage of the Boston
Marathon stuff and first obviously you
know feel sorry for those folks secondly
and I was born and raised in Sandy Hook
Connecticut so kind of was close to one
of these myself and I think part of the
problem now is just that we watch
articles get edited real-time it's a
fact right now ten minutes from now it's
not a fax the other piece after the fact
that I saw from the crowd source
standpoint is everybody has way too much
access to this information now and with
all the pieces on the table people can
put together any story they want I think
what he's trying to say and he brings up
really good points and like I said we
learned so much this last week about how
powerful and how dangerous the internet
is I think the big thing at least the
way I see it there's no delay anymore
right we have reached that singularity
where there's things happen and everyone
knows about it and in almost
instantaneous fashion so they nothing
can be verified well that's because
citizens no information now before media
rights do but nothing can be verified
right away because it's instant right
because everything is just Bam Bam Bam
Bam so quick there's no room for vetting
yeah whatsoever don't don't forget to
the competition like again these are
these are businesses trying to make
money yeah the competition is so
freaking hot and fierce that it's in the
best interest of a news entity from a
financial point of view where we've
disregarded integrity just to be the
first to a news story right yeah they
kind of go to they kind of forego that
vetting that used to be like Walter
Cronkite old-time journalism and now
they're just like all right we're going
to go with this and Gamble one of the
crazy things that I saw yesterday on
that fine Boston bombers subreddit was
that someone posted a photo a second
photo after the bomb blast had happened
that showed the younger
I in the picture like sort of in the
background it was only after the thread
had reached maybe 30 40 messages that
someone was like wait have you reported
this to the FBI yet right there's just
so much information it's too much for
our own good because they're the world
now has this consciousness online right
where everything that happens in the
real world is emulated in some in
varying degrees of accuracy online so
like there's this constant almost
parallel timeline that happens in the
real it's I feel it feel like I'm in the
goddamn matrix it's like the real world
which we all occupy and then the virtual
world which like doesn't operate on the
same octave just kind of like those on
gender it's fast it's just react it's
very strange they live in that kind of
you know dichotomy right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
