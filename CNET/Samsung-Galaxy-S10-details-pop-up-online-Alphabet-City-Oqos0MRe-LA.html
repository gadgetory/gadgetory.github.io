show that covers everything to do with
alphabet Inc that's the company that
owns Google and a bunch of other
companies I'm your guide Aya's Akhtar
and you are our fantastic audience you
read the title of the video so you know
we're gonna talk about first stop
Android Avenue either the Bell knows
things about Samsung's plans or it is
just making up all kinds of stuff that
sound very believable they say we were
getting three Galaxy S 10 models their
code names are beyond 0 beyond 1 and
beyond to 0 is the entry-level model one
is the normal one likely the s10 2 is
the big one likely the s10 plus 3 was
not included in the list so I don't know
why we're talking about it let's talk
about 0 no not that 0 the bell says the
0 would have a fingerprint sensor on one
of the sides of the phone kind of like a
moto device the 1 and 2 would have
fingerprint sensors built into the
display like that snazzy vivo phone the
Bell says this technology will cost
Samsung $15 per fingerprint module the
regular sensors cost about $2 according
to the same source and 3 I don't know
what you're doing here so just get going
the Bell also said the zero would have
one rear camera the one would have two
or three rear cameras there are
conflicting reports on this both from
Bell the two would have three rear
cameras and the three would not exist
stop with the three back to the beyond -
it could also have two cameras on the
front that's right the galaxy s 10 plus
could have a total of five cameras on it
Samsung is expected to show off its next
s phones early next year
next up X crossing
a report by Reuters says that Kenya will
be using Project loon to bring internet
to rural areas
Reuters spoke to Kenya's information
communication and a Technology Minister
Joe Musharraf who said the Loon team are
still working out contracts and
hopefully once that's done we can be
able to see almost every part of the
country covered if you're unfamiliar
with Project loon it's a project of the
X company X is owned by alphabet and
it's a research and development unit
Project loon aims to bring internet
coverage by using a network of balloons
now why balloons X says a cell towers
coverage area is limited by the height
of at antennas by lifting these antennas
up into the stratosphere we can deliver
connectivity over a much larger area
we contacted X and the company did
confirm to us that it spoke to regional
officials a project loon spokesperson
said quote we are always in discussions
with governments and telcos around the
world about Project loon but we have no
details to share at this time end quote
let's head on over to play Plaza
this is the part of the show where we
take a look at apps this time we're
talking about the YouTube app boob will
update in the YouTube app for Android
and it now includes an incognito mode to
access it click your avatar on the top
right of the app then you'll see an
option to turn on incognito the first
time you do this you'll see a little
dialog window saying you've gone
incognito to turn off incognito click
the little glasses and hat guy on the
top right then you can turn off
incognito how many times did I say
incognito not counting that last one no
it was 5 if you don't see the feature in
your app head on over to the Play Store
and update your YouTube app to get the
new mode there's also a Netflix update
for Android with the latest app Netflix
is introducing smart downloads that will
delete shows you've watched offline and
automatically download the next episode
for you the feature should be available
this week you know where we're heading
comment cove
this is the part of the show where we
shine a spotlight on the best audience
in the world you find folks last time we
talked about a report that says Google
is working on some kind of game
streaming system Daniel Castro had this
to say about it
Google should look into buying or
teaming up with Nvidia shield and stream
the Nvidia shield TV runs Android has
Google assistant built-in chromecast
and all the main streaming apps he went
on to say if the Nvidia shield TV could
somehow run steam games I throw my money
all over that that's a really
interesting idea Daniel our TV guru
David Katz Meyer is a big fan of the
shield as a streamer one of the
downsides has been the price if it was
also a steam box maybe that could make
the price easier to swallow on the news
that more Chromebooks are getting
support for Linux apps friend of the
show Luke Taylor said the future
integration of Linux and Chrome OS when
it finally hits the stable channel is
likely to be a game changer for a lot of
people in other news relating to Chrome
OS Adobe's project rush is meant to be a
fully cross-platform video editor that
they've even worked with Google to
ensure it works great on Chromebooks I
had not heard a project rush until your
comments Luke Chromebooks get mocked
sometimes for not being able to run
seriously heavy apps like a video editor
very curious to see how this ends up we
also talked about the new Google Maps
and it's for youth section that's where
Google offers you suggestions for places
to go
Arjen mangal said I got stripclub
suggestions on the map okay if you've
enjoyed your stay in Alphabet City
remember to Like and subscribe
we have new episodes on Tuesdays thanks
for your comments on Maya's after and
I'll see you online
you may have heard about Google giving
access to third-party apps that allow
your emails to be read don't freak out
too much head on over to account of
google.com slash permissions there you
will see which third-party apps have
access to your account and how much
access get rid of anything you don't
recognize worst case scenario you can
re-enable permissions later okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
