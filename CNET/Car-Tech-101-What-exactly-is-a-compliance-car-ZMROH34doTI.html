usually suggest someone is doing
something they didn't want to do because
someone else made them do it in this
case the someone who did the telling was
the state of California which in 2012
told all the large and intermediate
sized car makers in the state that a
certain percentage of their annual sales
had to be zero emissions vehicles that
means battery electric cars or the even
more rare hydrogen fuel cell vehicles
all of a sudden oddities like electric
Fiats and smart fortwo news and Honda
fits and rav4s cropped up car makers
that failed to sell the minimum
percentage of zero emissions vehicles
and this is figured out by a formula far
too complex to relate here would then be
subject to penalties that they can
satisfy by buying expensive zero
emissions credits from companies that do
sell more than their share of zero
emissions vehicles for example Tesla has
made millions of dollars the last couple
years selling credits because all they
makers do emissions vehicles and they
can sell them to car companies that make
gas engine cars and not enough that
don't spew not to say all zero emissions
cars are compliance concessions the
all-electric Nissan Leaf and Tesla Model
S are bonafide sellers but those two
cars make up some 70% of the US evey
market leading the rest of the list to
be painted with the compliance car brush
here's where it gets tricky plug-in
hybrids they use both emitting gas and
zero emissions electricity they can run
some all are virtually none of their
miles zero emissions depending on the
owner uses the car not depending on the
technology the automaker built in so
it's not in the car makers control now
recently those auto makers in California
gone to the state and said hey give us a
much bigger credit toward zero emissions
when we sell a plug-in hybrid because
they're using studies now that show
frequently when plug-in hybrids are used
in the real world they are in a zero
emissions state that is closer to that
of pure EVs and fuel cells
