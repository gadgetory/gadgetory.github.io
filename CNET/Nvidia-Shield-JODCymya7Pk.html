giving you a first look at the Nvidia
shield this is a 199 set-top streaming
box that they've used in May it can
handle everything you can throw about
you can think about any kind of
streaming boxing man how this one is
like that except on steroids has the
NVIDIA Tegra x1 processor built into it
it also has a hdmi output that can
handle up to 4k 60 frames per second
output we've got two USB ports here
we've got gigabit ethernet you got a
little power adapter here a USB and
micro SD expansion card slot has 16
gigabytes of storage baked into it but
you can expand that with that memory
card slot now it is nvidia so beyond
just doing streaming of media content
and uses the android TV operating system
to do that you also got lots of gaming
features built into this so you've got
Nvidia zone grid streaming game service
which is baked into this paying a
monthly fee you can get access to stream
a whole lot of video games bday android
games console game pc games a lot of
different content being brought that you
can stream for free with a monthly fee
then there's a grid download content
that you can do where you can get high
end pc games that you can stream at up
to 1080p 60 frames per second streaming
and you can use that you can use this
box for that as well then of course like
any of the other shield devices out
there you can also stream PC games
locally to the device that you can play
your PC towers in the back of your house
you can play it up in the front your
house on your main TV streaming it using
the Nvidia shield for the 199 price it
also comes with a game controller this
connects to the Nvidia shield using
Wi-Fi direct very low latency you can
connect up to four of these controllers
to one Nvidia shield you can also have
the option of buying a more television
style remote control that has a little
mic button here for activating google
voice control so that you can speak into
the remote there's a mic input on the
remote and that's a nice little slider
function here a little
capacitive slider there's no pricing on
this yet but it's available another cool
thing that I like about both the gaming
control that comes with it or the
optional more TV style remote control is
that they both have headphone jacks so
that you can plug in a pair of
headphones and listen to your content on
headphones without annoying the people
around you we also both have microphones
built into them so they'll both work
with google's voice control alright so
there you go that is the Nvidia shield
again due out in May for a base price of
one hundred ninety nine dollars an
exciting entry into the world of
streaming media boxes if you really want
a lot of power out of your streaming
media box this is going to deliver that
I'm also a great Android experience for
your TV cnet com I'm Donald Bell giving
you that first look at the Nvidia shield</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
