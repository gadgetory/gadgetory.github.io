doctor himself Peter Capaldi thank you
for joining us it's a pleasure to be
here
lego dimensions is the fabulous game
from WB and the Doctor Who pack for that
is just coming out yeah what was it like
to be kind of recreated in Lego it's
absolutely extraordinary
all of us know Lego everybody knows what
it's like paper that at some point of
their life to see yourself recreate
created is this tiny little figure with
I'm always shocked that my figure has
dog who has gray hair because for some
reason I don't think of myself as great
hair but I better get used to the idea
because it's official it's in Lego I
think it's an amazing game I think it's
I know that it was made by people who
love the show mm-hmm because I worked
with fun I recorded a lot of voice stuff
for them and their devotion to the show
and the detail that they have in the
game I mean you can actually go back
through all the doctors back through all
the TARDIS this is amazing thing when
you go back to like Patrick Troughton or
William Hartwell it goes into black and
white it's such a brilliant idea
fantastic um you've obviously got your
likeness on Lego now what's the
strangest piece of memorabilia you've
ever seen your face on a cushion good
for handmade cushion that someone made
out of felt and put a likeness let's say
a likeness of me on that cushion so the
idea that you'd be lolling around in
your house relaxing leaning back on
large cushions with pictures of yourself
woman
well it's a bit of an older idea but I
could do that if I wanted because I have
the cushions the doctor was obviously
joining you know Batman and Gandalf
these huge cultural figures in logo
dimensions
yeah how do you feel about Doctor Who
kind of taking that huge stage now
moving from kind of a niche sci-fi show
- yeah something much grander I think it
seems natural I think that's sort of why
he belongs now the thing about the
doctor Doctor Who is I think it still
retains its its cult core you know I
always think even though Mahut Djem ount
of fans
of the show I think they all have their
own very personal intimate relationship
with it which i think is really
important because there's something at
the heart of it the appeals to people
and it's not always the same thing you
know if you ask people why they like
Doctor Who we'll have lots of different
ideas about that and I think that's you
know what any successful show needs is a
very personal thing at its heart but
it's hard I think to protect that I when
the show is getting bigger and bigger
and bigger and that's sort of what our
job is is to make sure that we're
sincere and true to it as it expands
them to this you know I hate the word
brown but characters are thank you very
much for joining us Peter so the full
