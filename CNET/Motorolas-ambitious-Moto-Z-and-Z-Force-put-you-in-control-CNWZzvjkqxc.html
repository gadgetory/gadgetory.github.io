flagship phones the Moto Z and z-force
are unique in one big way their backs
have these magnetic pins on them which
lets you snap on and off modular
accessories aside from the new
functionality they add to your phone
they're also just really fun and easy to
attach these accessories or moto month
as they're called lets you customize and
transform your phone the way you want it
can be as simple as changing up the
handsets look or maybe you want a bigger
battery because you know you're going to
be out all day or maybe you want to
boost up your audio speaker for this
weekend's barbecue motorola even
developed an image and video projector
that you can attach in case you want to
start an impromptu movie night though
they'll definitely add extra heft to
your device their intuitive to use and
snap on securely plus you won't have to
power off the phone each time you want
to add a mod as for the funds themselves
they're on par with the flagships
available now they both have a 5.5 inch
display a snapdragon 820 processor a
fingerprint reader and expandable
storage oh and there's no headphone jack
but you can still listen to music
through the included USB C port adapter
the Moto Z force however does differ in
some aspects it has a tougher screen a
21 megapixel camera as opposed to the
Z's 13 megapixel shooter and a beefier
battery unfortunately the Z force is
only available in the US as a Verizon
exclusive and it'll be branded as the
Moto Z forcedroid the Moto Z however it
will be sold globally Verizon will be
selling its own version - known as the
Moto Z droid but you can still get the
handset unlock through Motorola and it
will work with GSM networks like AT&amp;amp;T
and t-mobile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
