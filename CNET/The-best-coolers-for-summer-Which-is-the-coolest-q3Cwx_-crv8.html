so we're taking a break from the gadgets
and gizmos to get a cold hard look at
coolers you've got a lot of options if
you're shopping for a new one this
summer ranging from dirt cheap to
hundreds of dollars so which ones are
the smartest buys let's start by taking
a look at the metric that probably
matters most performance I tested twelve
coolers ranging in price from four
dollars to $400 in our climate control
test lab by tracking the ambient
temperature inside all of them over 48
hours inside each one three pounds of
ice now that's not a lot that's not even
half of a small sized bag from the gas
station but I wanted to challenge the
coolers and get a good granular look at
how they perform in the end the test
delivered giving us a terrific look at
the differences from model to model now
that pink line at the bottom that
represents our top performer the popular
Yeti tundra 45 it's a thick rugged
cooler with a fancy roto molded design
and at three hundred dollars it doesn't
come cheap now roto molding that's short
for a rotational molding and it's just
what it sounds like the mold is
literally rotated as the plastic is
poured in and that helps it set more
evenly for better durability and
insulation and as the Yeti and other
coolers like it show roto molding can
make a huge difference in how well your
cooler keeps things cold
that leaves Yeti as my top pick for
people who just want the best
performance money can buy but be aware
that yetis coolers are smaller than the
name suggests
for instance the tundra 45 here isn't a
45 quart cooler it actually only holds
about 33 quarts not cool Yeti for
something bigger consider the Orca
classic cooler another roto molded model
that cost about three hundred dollars it
doesn't hold the cold quite as long as
the Yeti does but it hit the same
minimum temperatures in my tests and at
58 quarts there's about 35 percent more
space inside for your beer if you don't
want to spend hundreds don't worry I
found a couple of good picks that cost a
lot less to let's start with my top
overall value pick the igloo max cold
cooler at a price of just $45 it isn't
anything fancy to look at but it
performs like a champ better than any
other cheap cooler I tested and better
than two of the four roto-molded models
that I tested - another good value for
the price the lifetime high performance
cooler I picked mine up at Walmart for
97 bucks it performs just as well as the
igloo max kool
and the extra $50 or so gets you a much
better design with dual lid latches
roped handles and even a built in bottle
opener which seems like something every
cooler should include I also measured it
at sixty two point four quarts which is
bigger than advertised and about 35
percent bigger than igloo
that brings us to wheeled coolers I
tested a few out to try and find a good
pick for folks who want to bring their
cooler with them on their next hike the
cheap models I looked at felt flimsy and
underperformed in my tests but I was
blown away by the mobility and
durability of the rover roller 60 with
nine-inch inflatable rubber wheels and a
sturdy steel frame the thing has built
like a tank and the roto-molded design
offers strong cooling performance too
though not as strong as workers Yeti at
$400 it was the most expensive cooler
that I tested but until I find a good
rollin value pick I say it's a wheeled
cooler worth saving up for oh and one
last thing if you're just looking for
something dirt cheap don't even bother
with $20 coolers like this Rubbermaid or
igloo models this disposable styrofoam
cooler cost me just four bucks and it
held its minimum temperature longer than
either of them for more cooler insights
check out our full roundup post on
cnet.com now time to enjoy some of these
test sets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
