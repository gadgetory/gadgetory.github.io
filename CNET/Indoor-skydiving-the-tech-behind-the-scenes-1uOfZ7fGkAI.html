lifetime experiences that is unless you
go indoor skydiving
I'm Lexus Avedis foreseen it come with
me as I show you that behind the scenes
technology of all the fans and inverters
at work let's go at the I fly Center in
Sydney for 450 horsepower fans
sit at the top of the building pushing
wind down the sides and up through the
flight chamber directly above is a
primary diffuser that reduces the wind
velocity before it goes back around
flyers step into the 5 meter wide tunnel
with instructors having full control of
wind intensity we spoke to Matt about
what it takes to be an instructor the
course usually goes from two and a half
to three weeks
part of that course is driving these
machines for up to eight hours to be
signed off as an instructor eight hours
a lot of time usually pick it up by the
end of that this interface pretty much
controls everything related to when
people are flying in the tunnel from
your speeds by this dial to opening the
doors to the times also to the photos we
have a camera just here in our buttons
it just to everything within the tunnel
from when you step in to when you step
out is all controlled by the person
sitting in this chair wind speeds just
up here it can go from zero to three
hundred eighty kilometers an hour we
also have not just for the flying but
all behind scenes as well such as like
alarms everything to do with the motors
as well you've got a technologies use
the varying of the frequency and the
voltage to to the motors which control
the fans here in the eye flight
technology it means that we can vary the
speed of the fans and the speed of the
wind up and down we can increase or
decrease or you know to suit the height
and then the weight of the fly that's
flying products that that are here in I
fly our standard off-the-shelf products
so we used our
normal everyday factory automation
communication systems and products to
learn to achieve what we have here at I
fly so there is nothing special it's
just standard off-the-shelf equipment
with flights lasting a minute
you get more free full time than
skydiving from 14,000 feet and you don't
have to throw yourself out of a plane
