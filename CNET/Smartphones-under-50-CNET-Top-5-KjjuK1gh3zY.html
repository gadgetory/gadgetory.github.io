and you're not buying a smart phone good
luck not many basic phones left and the
only people buying them these days are
the elderly and anyone trying to
comfortably smuggle a phone into prison
lucky for you the price of a good smart
phone has never been cheaper i'm donald
bell and today we're counting down the
top five smart phones under $50 for june
of 2012 picked by CNET senior editor
Jessica dual court starting off at
number 5 the Nokia Lumia 710 this is a
relatively new Windows Phone on contract
from t-mobile we're actually seeing it
as a free option from a few retailers
which is surprising since you get a 5
megapixel camera 720p video recording
AMOLED screen and turn by turn GPS
Microsoft and Nokia really wants you to
try Windows 7 phone you had me at free
at number four the Samsung Focus 2 the
same basic premise here is the last one
only this one's on AT&amp;amp;T and it's just a
little bit cooler you get a larger Super
AMOLED screen works over 4G LTE get a
great camera GPS and even hotspot
support again you're rolling the dice
with the Windows Phone OS but we
wouldn't rate it so highly if we thought
it was a dud an Android phone finally
slides in at number three it's the
Pantech Burst which we're seeing from
AT&amp;amp;T right now for just one penny on
contract basically an Android version of
that Samsung Focus 2 you have that four
inch Super AMOLED screen 4G LTE 5
megapixel camera and it runs a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core processor and most
of all it runs Android so you can trust
it there's lots of app support out there
at number 2 the LG Nitro HD here's
another one from AT&amp;amp;T it's a four star
review from CNN it works a 4G LTE is
camera takes 1080p video and if you're
buying for screen size this is the one
to go for the giant 4.5 inch IPS screen
that packs a 1280 by 720 resolution when
LG says HD they mean it now before we
get to number one let's take a look back
at CNET's picks for the best cheap
phones of 2011 one common feature here
is that all these phones
physical keyboards we've come a long way
I think and now the number one
smartphone under $50 is the Nokia Lumia
900 this is hands-down the flagship
Windows Phone from Microsoft and Nokia
Carl Zeiss optics 4.3 inch screen and a
great design that stands apart from the
herd now this is $99 direct from 18t but
more than a few of the big online
retailers have discounted this thing
right down to $50 it's a 4 star review
from us and a great choice if you're
looking for something that's both simple
and very capable so those are the best
cheap smartphones on the market right
now as chosen by our CNET experts please
