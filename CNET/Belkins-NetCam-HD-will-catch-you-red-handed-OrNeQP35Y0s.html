here with the Belkin net cam HD plus
Wi-Fi camera so this IP camera is
particularly interesting because Belkin
took an existing product and revamped it
to include some additional features that
are really really interesting so the
existing camera specs were pretty good
but this adds two-way talk and
integration with Belkin Wemo home
automation products that means that I
can set up rules in the Wemo app that
can say if this camera detects motion
then I can use the Wemo switch to turn
on a light that is a really cool home
automation integration that really sets
this camera apart from its competition
another thing I really love that I think
you'll love too is the price it only
costs one hundred and thirty dollars now
compare that to Dropcam or the samsung
smart cam HD pro which are closer to 200
and this is a fantastic fantastic value
it also has a built in motion detector
and it will send you those alerts in
your email for free so that live
monitoring and the motion detection
email alerts are a fantastic start and
it's great if you're interested in more
entry-level basic IP camera offerings
but if you want something that saves
your videos for a longer period of time
you could spend an extra 10 dollars a
month or $100 a year to get the cloud
plus premium services that will save
those videos for 14 days on a rolling
basis with that extra fee you can also
get push notifications when motion is
detected and the best part is that it
works extremely well it was responsive
the video was pretty crisp it's 720p
which isn't great compared to Dropcam in
Samsung's 1080 but it's still pretty
good compared to the Dropcam pro the
video quality isn't quite as sharp but
it's still very good and it was better
than Samsung smart cam HD pros default
it also has a lot of the same features
as more expensive models to a talk which
I already mentioned night-vision motion
detection cloud storage the only thing
it doesn't really have that I like about
the Samsung is local storage there's no
SD card option or anything like that but
you do have the option of downloading
video clips from the web app
in mp4 files - safer later so overall I
think it's a fantastic performer it has
great features it's easy to use the app
is good and it's a nice discreet camera
all for one hundred and thirty dollars
making it a fantastic fantastic option
for an entry-level DIY home security
thanks for watching I'm Megan Fullerton
