my name is Siva Meacham producer of the
Apple byte extra crunchy podcast with
your host mr. Brian Tong what's up
everybody welcome to the show it is
episode 104 Apple byte extra crunchy
keeping it extra Munchie with you here
in studio in the flesh in the flash this
is an Apple bite show but there was a
Google event this week and we will talk
about some of that stuff that dropped
but we're here in the in the live
showing let's be honest the flow is just
better when we is when we're in the same
way better always better sounds so good
it sounds so good so anyways everybody
welcome thank you so much for listening
in as usual we are at episode 104 we
love how you guys and gals continue to
call in and be a part of this show the
number to call us at 1-866-376-8255 and
have fun doing it and so we just want to
offer a little perspective here yeah
thank you guys all for watching tuning
in every week it's it's awesome so thank
you and you know I think you guys and
gals all kind of also we like we're like
we're able to kind of escape some of
this stuff through tech so let's get
into the show and really to kick things
off we did want to bring kind of a this
day in history for the Apple world
today as of at least this Thursday the
show as most of you will hear this after
Thursday is the sixth anniversary of the
death of Steve Jobs believe it or not
six years six years on October the fifth
Tim Cook also today just posted a little
tweet saying remembering Steve today
still with us still inspiring us using a
quote from SJ make something wonderful
and put it out there oh yeah this is
that was words from Tim Cook the
successor to Steve Jobs and just kind of
a note just something to think about in
obviously around this time is right
we're talking about the 10th anniversary
of the iPhone but what happened this
week was that Google had their own
keynote and they dropped a lot of stuff
and really aimed directly at Apple I
don't know if you could feel that during
the keynote Beach oh there are plenty of
jobs at Apple during the chemo little
bob-and-weave jab jab here up and under
so what we want to do is kind of talk
about a few of the things that they put
out there and how it does compare with
some of the things that Apple has out
there at Google announced their new
pixel two phones they announced their
new home pas home Google home max Google
home Mini they put out a pixel book they
put out their own wireless earbuds just
what we like to call a cornucopia of
products so I thought it was actually
really impressive keynote and it had a
different vibe you know apples apples
keynotes are starting to feel a little
stale like it's the same style and
delivery and stuff yeah and Google is
like they had like I'm not saying you
need a live DJ to make the keynote
exciting but it did add some flavor to
it don't you think
oh yeah the live DJ's were cool and
they're like working on tablets yeah it
was cool it was cool so let's forget
about the presentation let's talk about
the actual products the first one that
stuck out to me the most had to be
Google's home max this is their home
smart speaker it's a large size speaker
larger than the home pod but why did it
stick out for me look it has two offers
it's larger in size it has the Google
assistant so if we're talking about
Google System
versus Syria we know come on Google
assistant is a better product right now
although Syria has gone better at Google
assistant is just a better product yeah
all right
in addition to that you can stand it you
can lay it down sideways you can stand
it up vertically if you wanted to you
can pair them to have two speakers side
by side much like they're encouraging
people to do with a home pod the price
point is a little more it's 399 but I
loved how it looked like to me fabric is
the new black like everything we're
seeing is fabric covered yeah speakers
home audio assistance Amazon dropped a
bunch of stuff last week they had a
bunch of fabric covered stuff Google has
their own fabric covered speaker it
looks great it is a little more but when
I saw what it could do and just this you
could the size of it it's it's honestly
going to be a better product stand alone
versus versus apples I got to admit when
I saw Diplo had two of them for his DJ
set up I was kind of jealous I'm like I
got that set up right that looks good
look cool like come on you're not gonna
put two big fabric marshmallows on the
side of your DJ table no no you know
what I mean yeah exactly
it doesn't look and there is a certain
design aesthetic that Apple is going for
but I don't even let's even just forget
about how they look although look is
very important the tech inside is better
on the Google home Mac so I thought that
was something that surprised me and the
presentation of it was like really nice
it does also have the ability to detect
the room that you're in and
automatically adjust that was kind of a
big feature that Apple is pulling for
and the other thing that I think that we
have to pay attention to is Apple still
looks like it's going to be specific to
the Apple music service which is great
if you use it but typically in Android
fashion they've been able to be
compatible with lots of services right
out of the gate and I'm not saying like
yeah you can always pair your phone to
these Bluetooth speakers and control
them from their individual apps but it's
different when you can talk to the
speaker directly and say you Spotify to
play this playlist yeah yeah you know
this code that code does that stuff too
yep which is cool you can play Spotify
Pandora
all kinds so Google was kind of
launching with a lot of those same
partners too they had tune in Pandora
and I don't know if they had Pandora
Spotify and stuff like that so it's cool
and then just YouTube in general music
on YouTube there's like every song
almost in the world is on YouTube
somehow you know yeah
so so it's really interesting that they
threw they threw their hat into the
table and it really does look like a
better product out of the gates okay
let's keep on moving down the line I
think you have to talk about the pixel
to phone specifically what what is it
gonna be matched up against the pixel to
excel is going to be matched up with the
iPhone X or iPhone 10 iPhone 10 say I
Phone 10 visually I think the phone
looks fine it there's no way it competes
in design with the actual iPhone 10
there there's just no way it can do that
based on the design I'm not even I'm not
even a big you know oh it's gotta be
bezel it's got to be bezel it's it's a
nice design but it doesn't it the iPhone
10 looks better do you agree I agree it
looks like when I first saw it I was
like it looks kind of like a like a
cookie or something you know it has like
I got Christmas cookie er you know just
I do like the like little colored
buttons on the side you know the
brightly colored but that's just like a
little flashy thing but yeah I mean the
iPhone definitely looks a lot more slick
yeah it's future it's gonna look like
it's especially with that with that
notch that I love so much that's right
but from a standpoint of just just tech
inside look the iPhone is going to be
faster the iPhone screen is going to be
better so when you talk about like in
general the hardware the iPhone has the
edge but this is one this is what Google
has done now two years in a row where
does it Excel it excels with its voice
in three things actually its voice
assistant it excels with its camera and
it excels with kind of just new unique
software features like when Google
started their keynote they talked about
how now these days phones are all about
the same when it comes to hardware I'm
gonna be like okay yeah sure to a
certain degree but it's coming down to
now software features that you bring to
the table that work with the hardware
and it's really funny to hear Google say
that because this is
really where Apple's bread and butter
was years ago mixing hardware and
software together to deliver cool unique
solutions I think that from the software
side it doesn't Apple hasn't felt like
it's really changed and changed too much
rascally are giving us many new like
things that were like oh whoa but when
we saw the keynote for the Google pixel
- phone line you know it's we've seen in
other companies but squeezing to prompt
the assistant having the screen
always-on in actually having the phone
be always listening and being able to
show you songs that it hears directly on
the screen without you having to unlock
it at all like I like I always on Shazam
on your screen I thought that was
actually really cool I thought that was
really cool - yeah like really no cool
they had like a real big focus on
artists you know musical artists which
was awesome so you're gonna be able to
find music easier like circling a guy's
picture and then it shows you his album
and all his social networks and stuff
that's pretty cool yeah so they're just
little bells and whistles look none of
this is gonna stop people that are
listening here from completely jumping
over like I saw that phone and I said to
myself man I wish I could leave the
ecosystem to give this a true shot maybe
I just have to go a full week with a
pixel - and just talk about it I think
that would be good you know we're we are
we since we work here you know we use
Google Docs so we're kind of in that
whole Google ecosystem and that's one
thing they need to improve big time
because like Google Drive and Google
sheets and stuff like that they don't
work very good on the iOS app or
anything all right like on an iPhone app
in general so that's something they need
to improve and they have me because I
use Google Docs a lot ya know so you
have me there but like just not other
places it's weird it's and I think it's
the I actually think it's in a weird way
I think it's kind of deliberate yeah
because they want it to be like they
want you to you know what it's not that
there are drastically different but it
is easy I only use honestly I really
only use Google Docs for me on either a
tablet or a computer I don't use it on
my phone yeah I mean I use it on my
phone but I can only just read stuff you
know I can't like edit a spreadsheet on
my phone or
you know I can't it just takes a lot of
it's hard yes yeah it's just not as
small so we have that but the main thing
here right the quick the camera quality
is what sticks out why I'm only bringing
up this not to like brag about the
Google pixel - because let's be honest
at the end of the day I'm going to get
an iPhone 10 I will probably get a pixel
two for my work phone but DxO mark had
come out with the latest results of the
camera performance that are kind of like
become this de-facto reference site for
camera performance in a smartphone so
when the iPhone 8 came out it was rated
the best performing camera that DxO mark
has ever seen the note 8 came out and it
was rated overall because they they rate
photo and video separately overall the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 was rated equal to
the iPhone 8 plus at a rink ranking
score of 94 that factors in photo
performance and video performance and if
I recall right I believe the note 8
might have had an edge in photo but its
video performance was so low that it
fell out at a 94 well the the DxO mark
score for the google pixel 2 which is a
single lens camera this is not a dual
lens camera came in at 98 yeah that's
crazy so they said they couldn't use any
more superlatives to describe how good
the video and photo functionality of
this phone was and so you got to think
okay well the iPhone 10 is coming out
where does the iPhone 10 fit in all this
it has a dual lens it has a it has more
technology packed into the actual
there's actual processing power and
custom silicon in the iPhone 10 to 8 in
this camera capabilities
I really am curious where will the
iPhone 10 fall will it hit a 99 will it
ty or will it be below because we talked
about the best camera right now at this
day
Google's pixel 2 has the best camera on
the market and it's a single lens camera
it's still this portrait mode because it
has a dual pixel sensor that allows it
to detect foreground from background
it's not a dual lens but it has a dual
pixel sensor so I'm just really curious
when the iPhone 10 comes out where it's
gonna fall yeah yeah
we're no Apple guys are you know
scheming right now - how do we get our
score up guys
I've heard people yeah right I've heard
people here say I want the phone with
the here's the thing I've heard people
here I won't name names say I want the
phone with the best camera that's the
phone that I'm gonna get but then when
it comes down to it I've never seen them
have the phone with the best camera yeah
right there extremely they might say it
in this room but they don't I always say
you know back it up put your money down
your own bread and butter not like a
loaner from the company's put down your
own money and that'll tell me if you
really follow through with that
statement right and so it is it shows
the power of the ecosystem Google may
have the best camera in the market but
do you think that half of users that say
I will buy the best the phone with the
best camera are gonna jump over the
pixel - not yet I don't think so I don't
know yeah not everyone not a lot of
people don't even care and you know
we're like we're not all professional
photographers out setting our apertures
and stuff you know so I don't think a
lot of people care they just want a
phone that's gonna be fast easy to use
and you know reliable basically yep so
it's just ultimately it's a great
offering from the phone it has unique
software and it has the best camera in
the market that was very cool we also
saw Google kind of try and take on Apple
with the wireless earbuds segment and I
thought I thought it was probably the
most exciting when we talked about look
I think now these days we aren't really
aren't allowed by hardware as much as we
are with software features yeah we
aren't we just aren't right so they
showed off their Google pixel buds $159
same price as air pods but what do they
have sure they have a wire that connects
the two but it has instant live
on-the-spot translation they showed this
crazy demo of these two people talking
to each other one with the pixel buds in
speaking English and I think what was
the other person doing were they
speaking their stains in sure yeah is it
Germany in German term it might have
been German yeah but so they were they
were speaking German worse making up
stuff and it was a real-time translation
between two people we had our own
editors on site Sean
list her was speaking Japanese to Lexi
civvy days who was speaking English and
it was translating in real time one
person had the ear the pixel buds on the
other one had the phone I just thought
that was awesome and it's fast whoo yeah
shocked at how fast it was it seemed
like such a second or two you know
nothing - it was such a natural
conversation that we're having so it's
like that is incredible you know yeah it
was it was pretty amazing so again those
are cool things that as tech lovers
whether you're Apple or Google or
Samsung wherever you are you've got to
be like dang that was that was
impressive so everyone the chat room
sing Swedish so we both were wrong
Swedish oh it was Swedish it wasn't
churned German ich no wasn't you're not
German Innes or Danish wait sweat ich
sweet yes shoutout to the sounds in
sweden what's up sweet so I think a lot
of people were i don't care where you're
from that was just impressive they have
more touch controls and they have a
prompt to the Google assistant they may
not be as actually I don't know I think
they technically look a little better
but they do have a cord connecting them
so I do wear air pods
I do have the q-tips coming out of my
ears I still think they look ridiculous
I will never stop saying that but the
cable is a safety measure though - it
holds them on you know if you're they
come out of your ears it's gonna stay on
your head yeah it's true it's true so
they also put that out I'm not gonna dig
too much into the pixel book I thought
the pixel book was really cool but it
wasn't a standout for me only because
it's a two-in-one convertible laptop
with a touchscreen with a pen Apple
obviously is stuck to their guns of
saying we just want to give you a touch
bar which everyone that I talk to now
after using it over time has said it's
lame like every single person when I
first saw it my gut instinct was I'm not
gonna use that you're only forced to use
it to change the volume which you have
like go into the setting and then you
have to do two taps just to get to the
volume change like it has no haptic
feedback there's just too much stuff go
I don't know I don't I don't think it
chained has changed anything in my
workflow and most people will agree
I feel like 99% of people say yeah the
touch bar was amiss yeah yeah definitely
I haven't I haven't heard anyone say I
love it it's great I'm sure
get some calls or emails now but it's
fine if you love it I want to know but a
lot of people said they loved in the
first week and then afterwards after
they got over the hype they're like I
don't even really use this thing and you
have to like give a lot of these
products a little time and breathing
room look at what happens after Apple
has a keynote and people are in the
review room right off the keynote
they are like sucking apples you know
what and it's like come on it's just
right there you don't know all the devil
in the details yet you haven't used it
for like a week and you're just like oh
like there's great products the Apple
watch series three LTE if you use it to
its max when I say that you know in that
ideal situation for an hour where you're
working out and you want to get your
phone in your text it is an amazing
product but not everyone does that and
if you don't it's probably not for you
but for me I think it it's it's pretty
amazing to me well because of how I you
know how it's always comes down to now
these days how you use the product so
the pixel book $9.99 the MacBook Mac
Apple is only offering that's around
that price is $9.99 for the MacBook Air
but this is where it comes down to it
Chrome OS on the pixel book is like a
web browser
doot-doot right it's like it's not dude
it's like a very lightweight operating
system where it's like hey you do email
and you do web browsing and yeah some
basic photo editing that's about it that
was like the big drawback was what
people were yeah there's good for school
like this pixel book is the design and
the functionality is nice but if you
can't run any high-end apps whatsoever
on it it does nothing for me so it's
funny someone threw out the comment like
you might complain about how Apple over
prices things but they would never
charge $9.99 for a laptop that's just a
web browser and that was funny you know
that's a go because because a MacBook
you're at $9.99 now you can literally
you can still do it may not be the most
powerful machine but you could still do
pretty much everything that that a
laptop actually does so you know we'll
see how it all shakes out but that was
just kind of some of the breakdown I
thought that overall Google as they've
kind of taken over and used a little
identity of what Apple has done
controlling hardware and software you
can see how it is positively
changing the direction of the company
from a product standpoint like they're
starting to get mature and coming out
some really cool stuff an apple should
be aware Apple's gonna sell more Apple
will most likely sell more home pods
versus Google's home max but I think the
Google home acts is a better product
like that happens a lot in the industry
the whole thing yesterday just felt
cohesive like even down to the colors of
all their products they're all the same
colors from the from the headset to the
Google home pot you know the Google home
speakers you know just all felt very
cohesive like here's our line of stuff
for this year it was cool it's very good
so um kudos to them and best of luck
we'll see that if there are people at I
had no idea people had issues actually
getting the original pixel XL really I
had no idea how hard it was I got it
like the first week and I was like this
is dope yeah I'm clueless on that for my
work phone that is okay let's kind of
move and groove along this is a little
update to let you all know what's
happening kind of outside of the Apple
world there was a recent vulnerability
in Mac OS 10 High Sierra that we talked
about how someone could put like
nefarious code and be able to access
your passwords and whatnot there's
actually another vulnerability that was
just updated recently as of I believe
today Apple released a supplemental
update to Mac OS tight Sierra actually
ten point one point three Mac OS hi
Sierra a ten point 10.13 it's the first
update to the operating system that was
released to the public
now this update comes about a week after
the initial release of Mac OS hi Sierra
this will basically support and cover a
software vulnerability that could expose
the passwords of encrypted Apple file
system volumes in just pure plaintext
through the disk utility app so they
threw out this supplemental patch that
is out there I suggest if you have high
sierra you definitely go and get this
this does not address the last
vulnerability we talked about but that
was that's more you have to know the
code to actually activate it in the ex
NSA hacker who was able to figure this
out has made Apple aware of it and
they're gonna work on a fix there's not
like he's gonna publish that code and
say hey this is how you can use
everyone's get
everyone's computer but at least this
new recent keychain vulnerability has
been patched with this new update so
just just the little things like to know
like okay maybe you should maybe you
should get on that um in addition that
iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 plus we talked
about this kind of crackling noise that
happened to some users when they're on
phone calls that has been updated with
11 point 0.25
I just don't know my battery's still
getting destroyed by iOS 11
I remember in past iOS is that yeah
after about a week they said it was like
optimizing the system and whatnot but I
I my battery still is is crap in iOS 11
and they haven't addressed a specific
update to that and that's really what
they need to do are their apps like
following your location or something cuz
sometimes like after you do these big
updates to defaults all your some of
your apps back on to following your
location around
I mean I've checked most of them I think
the the most disconcerting thing is I I
was on a plane ride that was only 45
minutes I had my phone in airplane mode
I was only playing music and I had the
screen offense and I was literally
flying probably 40 45 minutes tops I was
coming over here right yeah my flight my
phone used 20% of my battery doing that
just listening to music yes with
airplane mode on for a 40 minute of
roughly 40 minutes that's never happened
before
yeah that has never happened before in
the entire time I've ever used my phone
and so I was like dang I find myself in
normal use looking down to my phone
around 3 or 4 o'clock and it's already
down to like 30 40 % that never happened
before either
that's a button I mean usually can use
listen the music app for hours and hours
and it like take 2% off that's what I'm
saying it's it's great if ik n't I know
people are still experiencing this some
people are not but a lot of people are
so I just weeds need a call out Apple
and be like are you gonna give us the
software update or not like yet get on
that already or we're waiting for you
guys to just address it and
people on a 6 &amp;amp; a 6s they're just like
hating life right now still I haven't
updated because I've been hearing your
problem I've been still I think it's
super smart I think you are the smartest
person in this room Thanks there have
been more reports also with the iPhone 8
and 8 plus this is not a widespread
issue but it is happening to a small
group of them and they are increasing
right now I think there's only been
maybe five or six documented cases that
we know about that people have come
forward with but what is happening
potentially Apple is aware of this and
looking into it during something is
going on with a select few or maybe a
specific batch of lithium ion batteries
and where is it it is causing whether
it's it's not it doesn't look like it's
necessarily heat but it might but it
might be relate to that or when the
battery is actually charging it has been
shown in different cases where the
actual iPhone 8 pluses the the metal is
bursting open because of this yeah that
that sounds like the note the last note
problem sounds similar at least they are
they're not sitting on fire yeah they're
not exploding and setting on fire but
there are multiple pictures of iPhone 8
pluses sometimes people have opened them
up from the package and they've arrived
like this burst open
one gentleman plugged it in overnight
and then it burst open but there is
something with a specific batch of
batteries that is causing them to swell
and burst open this iPhone 8 plus phone
so just want to let you all know one
just want to let you all be aware of it
this is not a battery gate or anything
unlike iOS 11 that's battery gate right
there I'm more than comfortable calling
that battery gate that's funny that's
just poopoo my 3GS did that what had a
back in the day but I'd already had it
like two or three years it's slightly
old yeah it swelled up like I had it
turned off for a while cause it was just
giving me a lot of problems it wouldn't
charge this and that and then I plugged
it in one day and it just like it just
expanded in front of me and exploded I'm
you know it didn't like explode but I
don't blame but it opened but it opened
up oh damn same way like this did that
was a 3GS but I'd already owned it for
like two or three years been using it a
lot so you know I didn't really think
about anything of it I just threw it
away
or I recycled in a river but never
underestimate the power of batteries
yeah they're kind of they're kind of
crazy they power a mini-computer in your
pocket that's just all that's all they
do right yeah Apple has released watch
OS 4.0.1 I'm loving this one this is the
fix to the issue where when you're
connected to your phone and then you're
looking for LTE outside of your phone
the ability for it to switch or not get
hung up on wife public Wi-Fi networks
where it would cause the Apple watch to
basically not connect to anything
temporarily or for a good stretch of
time which is what I experienced in my
review a lot because I was hanging out
with my girlfriend and sometimes she'd
have full signal and I would have none
and I would be like what is going on
here and it's it's because of that issue
according to them they have fixed this
with 4.0 point one it's an update you
guys can do it guys and gals can do it
right now
it's obviously through your phone
through the Apple watch app but uh yeah
I'm I'm more than happy about the
battery life on this Apple watch series
three it's bomb that's nice just in
normal use it is a it is great whether I
have my phone with me or whether I don't
and then also the Nike watch version of
the Apple watch 3 is in stores now so in
case some of you are waiting for that
you like that
Nike integration with their app and also
like basically you get like exclusive
watch faces with it from that are part
of Nike and then it comes with the Nike
watch band it's very similar to what
happened with the series - those are out
there in stores now so you guys you know
can check it out see if you're down with
that I thought it was gonna be like the
green like the black and green color
that was last year that was last year's
Stephen definitely I'm sorry you can buy
that you can buy that band though for 50
bucks if you want I don't want that
green okay I'm gonna tell you guys and
gals I'm gonna tell you all why don't
keep on saying guys and gals today I'm
gonna tell you guys and late the ladies
and gentlemen's a protip look there are
if you go on eBay
like seriously I tried this out to see
maybe this is really jank you're not
they have like replacement Apple watch
bands and Apple charges 50 bucks for
theirs you can literally get
and I held them side-by-side I closed my
eyes I like felt the material the
thickness the actual bolts on them
they're like 10 bucks on eBay oh yeah
I'm looking at 125 right here I mean
those are metal ones but there's like
the rubber if you type in like Apple
watch rubber like 42 millimeter you
there was I'm just not gonna go to the
Apple store and buy a $50 rubberband
anymore I'm going to go on eBay and get
them there's there's manufacturers
clearly they're being shipped in from
China they're like replacement bands
there so I yeah it's not that top one
that top one right there oh yeah you
know it soft you know you know these
things literally cost like pennies on
the dollar to me that's exactly the bolt
is literally exactly like what a pice I
held up an expensive one side by side so
I'm just saying that's cool man it's
totally worth it so I'm gonna get all
color I'm gonna get all colored up now
yeah you baste they do all kinds of
holiday deals too man look out for your
holiday deals let's who wants to talk
about everyone wants to talk about
iPhone 10 oh yeah don't you want to talk
about iPhone 10 I can't wait to just see
one I know and like why use it and ya be
annoyed that it takes longer to unlock
my phone than it does today the iPhone
10 Apple has received FCC approval ahead
of its October 27th pre-order date so
what this really means is it's gone
through a variety of requisite tests
that it needs to follow up needs to pass
to allow it to be cleared for sale the
good news is that it cleared that FCC's
like thumbs up the iPhone 10 we know
we've heard the stories about the
production levels of how they are
expected to be lower
oh it's gonna be hard to get I'd really
think this is gonna be a super hard
phone to get this year yeah yeah like
that it's just there's just no way
there's not another really fun report we
know we have our friend Ming Chu Kuo who
was with KGI securities he put up this
report about specifically the true depth
camera right this is that whole array on
the top that's people are now I think a
lot of Apple fans are trying to really
sell themselves on this and say it's
what makes the eye
phone unique from others mm-hmm and I'm
like bro
yeah it does just just get over yourself
it doesn't look good but fine let's
forget that I'm not gonna get in a
debate about that I would like to him
over the phone with someone because
you're just crazy but the true depth
camera we know it has all these sensors
like a flood illuminator a proximity
sensor an infrared camera ambient light
sensor the technology in it and the way
it actually scans your face is unlike
anything that is on the market today it
is outright more advanced than what
Samsung has so Ming chic whoa after
looking at the functionality and the
user experience came out with a report
that claims it would take probably about
two and a half years one to two and a
half years for competitors to catch up
with what Apple has Wow interesting
again this is if they want to replicate
this true depth sensor which I kind of
laugh at because they have a fingerprint
sensor and it it works just fine like
it's still faster into a fingerprint
sensor the other thing though right this
true depth sensor is front-facing I
think the detail that people aren't
really thinking about is that it will
also take roughly year to two and a half
years for Android to use and emojis true
this is one of the top three features
that Apple pitched to us about the new
iPhone 10 exclusively on the iPhone 10
yeah so I'm sorry I think when Android
comes out with it they're gonna call
them and remote jeez I made that up it
that's right good no it's not funny
patented patented right here and from oh
jeez right now yeah Shh ago it was it we
have prior you know you could you can
prior work or prior art prior so yeah so
if someone has a lawsuit we can say no
what's the date today who came out with
who wait hold up which which show which
collective started the whole iPhone X
Revolution dude I'm gonna I'm gonna be
texting you like we have a lawsuit Brian
they just called it Andrew Android mo
geez and Romo geez
dude I'm serious first it's iPhone X now
it's and remote jeez they need a higher
s already yeah what's up we're just just
hire us for coming up with two names
yeah or at least you copyright
infringement come on we have a message
come on another thing going on with the
Apple world Apple employees are testing
Apple pay cash internally an iOS 11.1 so
the 11.1 beta is out right now so what
they're doing is internally they're
giving employees basically kind of like
how you have access to the beta with
like a special certificate for your
phone they're getting employees this
special certificate that gives them
access to the pay to pay it's found in
the messages app where we can send money
to another Apple user it has not been
rolled out to anyone publicly in any
form of public beta but they have
according to a user and MacRumors it has
been confirmed that this is being tested
by Apple yeah it's apples venmo I can't
wait for this man I think a lot of
people are gonna it's gonna make a lot
of things a lot of a lot easier I think
if you I don't know exactly but if all
you you know what instead of actually
having to use an Apple pay app on the
bottom bar and messages I think that if
you have someone's name and you just
type in a dollar amount and it instantly
will prompt you like if you want to send
it put your fingerprint on or scan your
face for Apple pay to send it like I
don't want to take an extra step to go
to the Apple pay to pay app on the
bottom underneath my messages I just
want to type in an amount and then send
it now that would be that would make me
use it more than venmo because it's just
quicker totally you know how there's
like all these little anomia I don't
know how you guys think about that I've
totally agree you know how there's like
little buttons here like there's a
little camera button yeah and stuff like
that if there's just needs to be like a
dollar sign button hit that type in who
you want it to go to type in the amount
boom that's what I'm talking about
that's what I'm talking about another
story here Samsung according to the Wall
Street Journal a report by them in
partnership with counterpoint technology
Samsung is expected to earn four billion
more making iPhone 10 parts compared to
Galaxy s8 parts Wow so this is because
Apple is such a huge customer right when
you put in those terms it's really crazy
so this analysis was put together by
counterpoint technology on behalf of the
Wall Street Journal they used the
prediction based on projected sales in
the first 20 months after new phones go
on sale that would be November 3rd for
the iPhone 10 that's because this is
like kind of the ideal window when
people tend to buy a new phone that was
first 20 months now they said
counterpoint expects Apple will sell 130
million iPhone 10 units earnings samsung
about a hundred and ten dollars on each
unit through the summer of 2019
okay again Apple is expected to sell 130
million units the Galaxy s8 is expected
to sell around 50 million units now they
are earning more from the s8 because of
the prices of the components but just
from that pure sheer number the iPhone
10 is expected to bring them 4 billion
more dollars I thought another cool
point that was mentioned in here is that
Samsung executives as when they talk
about this their if let's say they're in
a business meeting and you pull out a
phone and it's not a Samsung phone it's
an iPhone they're totally okay with it
because they consider iPhones are
besting their best client in the report
it says Samsung employees offer often
refer to Apple with code names one of
the most popular is low short for a
lovely opponent like they get a hundred
and ten dollars for every iPhone they
sell that's that's you know it's like
there's an it I doesn't Samsung helped
Apple sell iPhone said yeah put them on
their website something on behalf of our
low yeah low low low low low low oh man
we got like apple bottom jeans notes
with the curves you know like they I
don't know they should just do some
marketing thing you know they I'm sure
they see long lines at the Apple Store
they're like ooh we're gonna cash in
this time that's a song right there man
we've got a song right there that's easy
I love it though low lovely opponents
that's good I'm gonna I'm gonna use that
next time on the court I'm like what up
low guys gonna be like what are you
talking about you know lovely opponent
like what he's gonna be like I'm gonna
kick you ass all right this is a fun
story unfortunately it literally expired
overnight apples known to do this but
just a couple of days ago if you asked
Siri what is the national anthem of
Bulgaria the song that came up as a
recommendation and a direct link to that
song was des posse though this path Seto
you know the song Siri says the national
anthem Bulgaria is des Posse toe-in when
in fact it is Mila roadie no it was we
have the evidence the visual evidence
this was I guess originally found on
reddit it started to spread like
wildfire scene I put in a barnacle we
tested it yesterday and then as of this
morning it was changed fixed correctly
Apple has been known to do this that's
funny man because you know how everyone
was calling the iPhone 10 iPhone X I
mean people are still calling it the
iPhone X the general population is
calling it the iPhone X we asked I
specifically asked Siri just for fun I'm
like hey how do i preorder the iPhone 10
when you ask it the proper way
Siri used the Roman numeral X and she
would respond this is how you order the
iPhone X and I was ready we set up our
cameras do this skit about it right and
just being like I told you was a cold
you and that because they worked the day
before that morning they had literally
fixed it oh wow that's funny cuz you
know that's just like man Siri tells you
it's access like I knew it I don't knew
it that makes me feel sorry for this
Siri engineers cuz you know they're
getting a phone call
I like midnight they're like ready to go
depression
they're teeth like hunk fixed some
bulgaria national anthem ah man okay
I'll do it
so people are applet and let's be on it
a political as paying attention what's
going on here with Siri they are they
totally are that means that they're
little they're a little concerned it
sounds it seems like you know Oh totally
I really didn't want the iPhone X iPhone
10 part I'm I wanted that mini skit so
bad that's that's a but I wanted that
time you know that's gold that's just a
cold that's a mini gold joke well
through the magic of editing we could
probably stick you probably could but it
would be very Pitt then people would try
to be like dude it doesn't work what are
you talking about then you begin a bad
apple you would I would I would get a
bad that I would get a bad apple all
right so we got a guys everybody called
in we loved it so much again if you want
to be a part of the show 1-866-376-8255
or space great to me the space Grey's
are going to have a higher people are
gonna want those more just because it
just looks better yeah with the black
it's also kind of like the classic al
Apple iPhone color totally so let's
let's just throw it out here silver 64
is most definitely going to be the least
popular then quite honestly
I'm gonna lean it depends on how many
Apple make scene are you saying which
one sells out first or which one sells
the most because they're probably going
to produce more 64 gig models then they
can keep up to produce 256 gig models
there's like a shortage of flash memory
going around so I think that will make
it harder as well I'm gonna say this
silver 64 black 64 silver 256 black 256
if you want in order from which sells
out first hmm but in order if you said
which is the most popular I go silver
silver black black see I interpreted
this question completely different I
thought he was saying like each I phone
he said iPhone yeah he said iPhone 10 so
and everything like I see eight eight
plus 10 so that would be easy it would
be se 8 8 plus 10 C was like a real
popular Buster's I guess I'm saying
which ones I would want in the order
yeah but without a doubt black 256 will
be the hardest one to get in my opinion
it's totally that's that's where I'm at
yeah the big one I am disappointed there
was no signature color I think it's just
because they couldn't get it done in
time and I think that we'll see a third
color sometime in like the next six
months yeah they tend to do that with
like it's like 5 seer wears it was rose
gold.rose go was rosy I want the Rose eh
I would not be opposed to a rose gold
phone neither would i but the black just
looks it just looks so much better
yeah it looks complete I'm gonna slap a
dope case on it oh sorry next call I'm
like looking at the website I'm sure I
know I know you has that power you're
like good cool website this is real good
right now okay here we go next question
hi guys this is Jennifer from Oklahoma
calling back um I had called last week
you were right my other question is
about that Apple watch LTE or the
regular three would it be if I'm not
planning on using it for a cell phone
right now but is it possible
use it and not put it on a plan and then
maybe later put it on a plan when I find
I want to use it for voice calls so
anyway that's those are my questions
thanks so much take care bye
what up Jennifer the answer to that is
yes you can when you set up your Apple
watch to your phone for the first time
it asks you specifically there's a panel
that asks you if you want to set it up
for cellular or not you can skip that
step the only thing that I'm not sure
about is when you if you want to kind of
reactivate that cellular step I don't
know if it's actually in the settings of
the app or you might have to potentially
I don't think so kind of Reese refresh
your Apple watch from start and go
through that process I just don't know
if there's this the quick shortcut to be
like okay now I want to turn on cellular
the other thing that I do want to bring
up is and I mentioned this in my review
if you are someone who was on a
grandfather data plan almost all of
those and I'm talking about a plan
that's easily five years old or more
mine was like eight nine ten I've had
the same data plan forever because I
wasn't trying to pay more they're gonna
ask you to upgrade to some sort of a
modern plan these are the words that
they use with me for a modern device to
work with it they said their system had
no way of attaching a new Apple watch
LTE to an old data plan which means
you're gonna have to pay more for your
data plan in addition to ten more
dollars for that for the Apple watch to
work on it so there's finances here that
Apple just made to say okay ten more
dollars to go on your plan and like they
told me 20 more dollars so what I did is
I went a customer service I went to this
area on AT&amp;amp;T called like customer
loyalty I looked at all the plans I
found out how much data I typically use
right now period and I found a plan that
technically is it it is a semi unlimited
it was called a I think mobile share
Advantage is the name of the plan but I
was able to get 20 gigs and then once I
hit 20 gigs that throttles down the
speed which I'm like fine but I only had
to pay five more dollars for this new
plan instead of the initial $20 they
were telling me to then you add on the
ten so really I'm paying $15 more than I
used to but at least I'm not paying $30
more
hmm and that and okay so that's just if
you want to watch right that you had to
get a whole new plan for yes own - yeah
I had to get a whole new data plan oh
man
again right there the modern a modern
plan for a modern device it's called BS
we just want more money
yeah they logically lost me right there
man I will not upgrade because I'm
grandfathered any time and I'm telling
you most of you here's the thing you've
got to really be able to commit and are
the type of person that will use your
watch when you're working out without a
phone if you don't do that I really
don't think there's any reason to buy
those series three watch LTE version I
think if you just go from an original
Apple watch in your fan and you want to
get the third gen it's gonna be a great
upgrade because the speed and
performance in the Serie but don't get
the LTE version if you're someone that
doesn't work out it serves no purpose
other than okay fine
I'm gonna go to the grocery store and
I'm gonna be gone away from my phone but
you're typically gonna have your phone
with you when you go to the grocery
store yeah it's a really specific use
case and you've got to figure out if
it's worth it before you do that it was
worth it for me and I'm very happy
because that's what I wanted my watch to
do and 20 gigs I blow through 20 gigs
like do you know what you're do you know
what your monthly is about like 20 like
30 maybe really like that oh damn I'm
streaming constantly oh yeah I'm around
I'm actually around 16 per month they
told me oh really see well I get to 16
like halfway through the month and then
they start sending in the text that
they're gonna start throttling or
something yeah and then I do notice like
the slowness I'm like you're throttling
me you better use that work Wi-Fi more
beach I do I do
yeah oh yeah get on that work Wi-Fi more
yeah if it works yep sometimes I turn
off the work wife I'm like this is crap
I know it's terrible blocking me from
Ticketmaster again forget y'all yeah
alright next call hey guys Fred from
Jersey quick question you see all the
technology they put in with facial
recognition do you really think that the
under the screen fingerprint ID was ever
in the works and second question do you
think that we'll see it in the next
generation of
honks thanks guys love the show I think
that if they can get it right it will be
in the next iPhone that's what I feel
like this is like an iPhone 9.5 there
are multiple reports and evidence that
they absolutely were trying to put it in
this phone
they have multiple patents over the
years that have shown that they've been
they already had the patents for
fingerprint sensing through a screen
without a physical button so I there's
no way they weren't working on it but
again we know we have to look at the
industry as a whole Samsung had a
problem with it I believe it's Qualcomm
the company that says they will have a
under the fingerprint screen sensor
ready to go by the end I think mid to
end of 2018 you've got to imagine that
Apple is working on their own so combine
all that I hope that they get it done by
next year because I think it could be a
really powerful combination depending on
what you use facial scanning for versus
what use your fingerprint for and how
they can complement each other I think
you can do some really cool things if
both of those things are there you know
that's I think that was the I think that
was the goal quite honestly and for
whatever reason I think Apple although
they tried and tested it just from a
pure aesthetics reason they wouldn't
that they were not willing to put a
fingerprint sensor on the rear of the
phone mmm and I wish they did I it has
never bothered me it has never bothered
me people like put it on the Apple logo
well it's not that easy have the Apple
logo later that lights up and then takes
you off into space yeah that's not gonna
happen but that's what they did with the
pixel that I had some it's on the back
right yeah it's on it's on the perfect
spot it's fine I really feel like LG was
the first company that did this if I
recall right I feel like it was LG that
was the very first one that put that
fingerprint sensor in the back and when
you pick up the phone it's totally there
it's it's not that bad instrument I feel
like the way that your hand naturally
grabs a phone in general your
fingerprint is there same amount of time
your fingerprint moves down to push on
the bottom of the front screen so yeah I
do I do expect it next year I just hope
that they can get it done all right next
call
a beach and tongs is Alex all the way
from the East Coast here do I hear that
guy keep playing him a beach and tongs
Alex all the way from the East Coast
here in Miami I just wanted to give a
quick comment on something that Beach
said on the last episode about the
Lightning port not being connected
really well to the iPhone and being
really loose same thing happened to my
iPhone 6 and what I found out was lint
stuck inside that little port inside the
phone so went in there real carefully
with a little toothpick you'd be
surprised how much lint I got out of
there and then once I tried the
Lightning port back in there BAM it was
stuck on really good wouldn't get any of
those connections and the whole not
charging issue and whatnot so anyway
just wanted to give that old but still
good tip to you guys maybe it works
hopefully it does
alright guys love the show take care
yeah baby I got a lot of people tweet me
that about that on your behalf
yeah me too you do did you try the
ignite I haven't had time but I'm gonna
try it and now maybe I'll take some
pictures of my lint if I pull this this
is lit this place is lit this is so lit
yeah oh yeah I mean that makes sense yes
it's in my pocket all the time so I'm
sure there's lint from my pants or your
hoodies your little a little soft little
sweaters no this thing for like two and
a half years our sweater vests yeah well
linty sweater vests yeah that's what I'm
saying your sweater vest I still wear
any sweater vests your parents your pata
go near Patagonia d-bag that's Rhode
show my Roadshow jacket here I'm sorry
I'm not trying to offend our listeners
but the Patagonia vest
on top of a baby blue collared poplin
shirt is the biggest d-bag thing I've
ever it's just horrible just stop it
guys just stop it already
although someone would say this would
insult my hair just as he just as easily
so yeah but I'm just saying stop that
already I hate that it's the worst yeah
okay let's move on next call last call
for alcohol here we go hey guys this is
Ricky from Dallas Texas I just
mention about the low power for the iOS
11 what I've been doing is I just been
putting my phone in low-power mode and
it's been working just fine so I don't
have to really worry about that so that
helps me buddy there you go
low-power mode yeah man but like when
you're low-power mode you can't do like
you nearly half the stuff these like a
lot of stuff like notification okay here
let me let me read this all
I mean insane you my man you are totally
right okay you can even do things like
try and like bijna said turn off certain
locations I think location services on
certain apps I think the biggest one is
if you want to reduce the fetch on your
email oh instead of it doing real-time
just make it do like every half hour
unless you really got to get that
actually you should be careful because
all these stupid not stupid all these
Instagram museums are like so hot right
now like the color museum the ice cream
museum 29 rooms look them all up okay
yeah like their tickets are so hard to
get that they'll send you an email when
the tickets are available really I don't
even know but if you're not one ice
cream one but are they what do they have
to do with Instagram it's like the their
visual least visually just like dope
rooms weather like the color fat color
factory or color museum I do see people
instagramming those places over that's
what I'm saying so their rooms basically
made for the Instagram generation is for
the IG it's like oh you're so cool you
went to another Instagram museum great
congratulate isn't it full of balls yes
in the pit guess what I'm the
thirty-fifth person with a yellow pit
ball picture congratulations
boomerang I'm blue badges alright yeah
exactly
boomerang IG Facebook Twitter all right
low power but here let me just break
down everything you'll lose if you don't
allow low power mode I've only gone a
low power mode when it was like 10% I
mean he was gonna be out for a long time
like I just hope this gets me through
but it doesn't low power mode
temperature temporarily reduces power
consumption until you can fully charge
your iPhone when this is on mail fetch
hey Siri background APRI all due to just
set off my
Siri
blank Siri background app refresh
automatic downloads and some visual
effects are reduced or turned off okay
so no notifications still work that well
background app refresh icon is really
kind of tied to I automatic downloads ya
know just I mean mail fetch is yeah it's
like living with a cast on kind of you
know like he's like I'm just gonna wear
a cast it'll be fine or you could get an
Apple watch LTE for $400 and then pay 10
more a month and update your plan and
just get gouged up that you know what
there's solutions out there guys yeah
there's always a tough tough solutions a
bunch of first world solutions a bunch
of first world solutions all right man
that's it that's it yep okay everybody
thank you so much for being a part of
the show again if you want to call us
and get interactive with us it's uh I
don't know what is what's the what's the
