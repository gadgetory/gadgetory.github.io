it's episode 351 of the 359 podcast now
we're off to a fantastic start G and I
screwed it all up but here's been and
Joan to make it better
hello wait we're here to make it better
are you sure we'll see I don't know
anyway today we've got we've got a good
one for you folks we're gonna be talking
all about the Apple home pod our review
is out on scenic on today so check it
out we'll be delving into quite a few
elements of the home pod from the review
so send in your questions and comments
about that we'll also round it out with
the way movi or uber trial which kicked
off yesterday
so sending your questions and comments
BVG we'll get to as many as you can at
the end of the show let's get to the
podcast here we go for the recording in
three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Raven I'm
Joni salzman CNET's a review of Apple's
new home pod smart speaker is out today
bottom line it's a good speaker but
pricey and locked into Apple's ecosystem
Joan what are your expectations for the
sales of this thing do you think that
it's going to do well against Alexa and
Google assistant well it's basically
going after a different market than
right so you're going after the a either
hardcore sound geek who really really
likes to have the best quality
possible-- sound or you're going after
like the Apple ingrained I have the
iPhone I have Apple TV I have everything
that I could want all Apple that this
would connect to right yeah absolutely
and at 349 dollars they're absolutely
going after Apple lovers with with that
price point people willing to pay yeah
but I don't know I I think that the
problem for me especially with the
speaker is how deeply ingrained into the
Apple ecosystem it is there are just a
couple things that Meghan wall Orton
mentioned in her review that I want to
mention so it's very tied to Apple music
for audio you actually need to send
Spotify from your phone which I find
really annoying considering how much
you're paying for this right yeah so the
idea is that you would have to be an
apple music subscriber you'd have to pay
$10 a month in order to listen to a
subscription streaming service on it
which is different than it's not
necessarily different than other
applications like for example echo you
need to be a premium Spotify subscriber
in order to use it but echo allows you
to have Dora or Amazon music and if you
are a prime subscriber you you at least
get prime music which is which is good
not great you got like yeah you get
something so you don't have to spend
additional money on top of that so an
echo echo changed in the last I think
year-and-a-half where you can set
Spotify as the default if you don't like
Amazon music as that if I didn't know
that yeah you can set Spotify or Pandora
as the default thing so when you set you
don't have to go through this extra step
of saying Alexa play Spotify or Alexa
play Pandora you can just say what I do
in my house Alexa plays Esposito and spa
exactly right hopefully I just triggered
somebody to play that's you know another
point also just to point out how the
home pod has its limitations for now we
don't know if this is going to change at
any point the home pod and apples home
app do not work on Android phones or
tablets now that is a big difference
between how Google and Amazon have been
treating their smart speakers where they
do try to make them much broader
obviously there's an Alexa app for both
iOS and Android do you do you think that
that could change do you think that that
might limit a little bit how much people
are actually going to want to use the
home pod well if Apple for your second
question if Apple is really just going
after the people that are already baked
into the Apple universe with this first
iteration of their smart speaker then it
probably won't hurt that market because
that market doesn't care but if they do
want to have sort of like like an iPhone
like a broadly impactful device then
they're gonna have to open it up to
other stuff but what we seem like with
Apple TV is that it takes a long time
for them to allow people within their
walled garden they've only just recently
Apple TV only just recently allowed
Amazon to have their video streaming
thing well either way we also wanted to
get to one other story
the first day of the highly-anticipated
way more way movi uber trial kicked off
yesterday way mo which is owned by
Google's parent alphabet claims ubers
former star engineer stole 14,000 highly
confidential files to develop its own
technology
uber uber caused the claims baseless if
uber is found to have stolen the files
it may be forced to halt its autonomous
vehicle program and hand over nearly two
billion dollars to way moe either way
come back to see net for more stories on
that if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on CNN I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm Jerry Saltzman thanks
for listening
alright so I'm gonna go ahead and start
delving through the chat cheesy thing
and find anything good commentary well I
have the conversation going I'm not sure
I have to practice saying ooh BRR and
lame-o moron way movil uber lame-o it's
kind of the unfortunate side effect of
these like hip catchy yeah names very
hard they roll off the tongue it's
pretty apparently it's like squishy I
heard like the the actual like the the
the speakers around it are kind of like
soft and foamy and apparently cats will
love it look it looks like an apple
product if you're very much into
minimalist stuff that's cool I also like
the yeah it's like the Siri the
listening the glow on top of it also
kind of yeah it gives it it gives it
this like extra little like sheen of
luxury I'd say that you're not getting
from definitely now like not from like
that little echo dot thing but the same
time you're talking to it sometimes from
across the room so how much are you
actually gonna be looking at it ya know
but III think that the echo is obviously
not been a design forward product for a
long time
I think the newer ones the
second-generation echos are obviously
much nicer looking good Apple is sorry
Amazon has been much more utilitarian
inner design they're like here's the
thing start to Alexa
I'd say we're not gonna make it look
pretty sound it'll play things but the
other like I I think the fact that this
is only Apple music I think is a real
problem that you need your phone
- like stream other things to it because
for the most part even though Alexa does
a lot of stuff Google assistant does a
lot of stuff from a lot of the
third-party research that I've seen a
lot of the smart speakers are very much
speakers right we'll use them to play
music that's what they're for that is
that is generally and to like ask the
weather so fact that it's really limited
in that music thing I think you're
totally right with what you said about
during the podcast that Apple people or
people that have Apple music aren't
really gonna care or notice but if you
are gonna try to expand that universe
you might be a little bit more difficult
yeah and I think that it's also telling
that you know Apple has been very
successful in getting people to sign up
for Apple music simply by virtue of its
I've the fact that iPhones are so
popular in the US that I think is the
main reason why Apple music has grown as
fast as it not the main reason but one
of the main reasons why Apple music
specifically has grown well when it's
really been except for Apple music
there's like no one else really in the
race like it's spotted I'm gonna quiz
you for a second do you know like the
how many subscribers off the top of your
head yeah like so globally Apple music
has 36 million subscribers and Spotify
has 70 million
so basically oh you doubled but there is
there are indications we don't know it's
hard to tell because they don't break
out there are indications that in places
where the iPhone is the dominant like in
the US where iPhone is the dominant
device compared to places overseas where
Amazon are sorry where Android reigns
that Apple music is stronger in those
markets where compared to Spotify I hope
music a stronger compared to Spotify in
markets where Android is stronger the
Apple music is stronger compared to
Spotify in places like the US where
iPhone that makes sense yeah yeah the
more iPhones there are like in the
system the more likely there are people
that are gonna get Apple but for that to
apply to home pod you have to
a sort of iPhone like hit and the
question is can you have a hit when the
space is already this crowded with
people you know it's already crowded
with a lot of other competitors and it's
such a high as compared the differential
price is so much higher yeah absolutely
and if you're really into music and
you're really into the whole speaker
quality so notice one is a hundred and
ninety-nine dollars and Sonos is really
well known for its speaker quality and
check out the sea net review on the head
you know what you know what else is
interesting is that the highest of the
like mainstream stream subscription
streaming services Apple doesn't have
the best sound bitrate like not very
basically but like you you have to like
title hi-fi is a subscription where you
get the best like the file that you're
listening to is the highest quality from
that versus definitely versus Apple
music so you have this really really
high five speaker but you don't have
access to the highest fidelity
subscription service file stream you
could if you're like our super in if
you're super into sound I think that
that would matter to you yeah absolutely
but at the same time if you're like that
into sound I don't know that I'm dying
right $350 speakers right you're buying
like $1000 speakers yeah maybe yeah I
don't know shall we take some questions
yeah chap all right first up from
chipper I hear you need an iPhone to
even use the Siri speaker so you can't
even have a guest hook up to it is that
true I think that may be true yeah that
might be a blessing in disguise not
defending it but coming from somebody
who hangs out with a lot of you know
fairly savvy friends
you got a open xposed echo sitting out
in the living room and they catch you
into that and next thing you know it's a
karaoke competition yeah I mean if you
like their music I guess it's okay but
that's but I don't I think I don't why
are they your friends why did you invite
them into your home I don't know they
just showed up I think specifically for
set up you generally need your phone to
do set up to connected to wireless to
connect any smart speaker at a wireless
that's at least Moton my experience has
been with echo and Google home I haven't
set up the home pod I haven't tried it
out personally myself
like we don't have it in the office so
do not take that 100% as far as that you
absolutely needed an iPhone for it but I
think to do a lot of stuff with it
especially for something like we
mentioned with streaming other services
you will need it an iPhone for it - all
right so Jeffers on fire today here we
go buckle up
Ione - Sonos play five Jen two speakers
and I've had yet to find anything that
can even match the sound quality of them
and you can stereo pair of left and
right he's true leave these so no
speakers or solids and the stereo
pairing is not yet available on home pod
is gonna be coming it is coming but
Sonos is already head of the game is
kind of the theme of today's
conversation also you can hook up an old
iPod or old iPhone on Wi-Fi plug it in
say hey Siri and it'll run through
speakers or you could get more advanced
and easy alexa dot everybody which was
has more deaf support and third-party
support we also made an alarm so if
somebody breaks in to our high quality
speakers start triggering off apple's
still far behind that as far as well
doesn't cool additional support and this
is all just emphasizing that Sonos is
way ahead of the game and jeffer
bookends this by saying hardware should
always take a backseat to the software
who cares if you have an amazing product
if it doesn't have the guts to support
it
syria is a 2007 thing just an opinion
what's your thoughts oh that's a sick
bird yeah apply cold water
I think Siri I think sorry came out in
2011 if I remember correctly but I
definitely get the point and it was
behind then it continues to be behind
now and that that seems to be the
problem and that's one of the reasons
that Apple has really been emphasizing
the speaker quality for this
specifically but for somebody like Jeff
er there's no reason to buy a home pod
and sounds like Topher is very happy
with what they already have and it's
that's probably a situation for a lot of
people that either have echos all over
their house or Google homes all over
their house and that's that is going to
be the hurdle that Apple is gonna have
to go through the thing that and so I
think looking at this from the other
perspective the thing that people need
to remember is is that Apple is still
very much Apple and they they can play
long game on this they don't have to
sell a ton of them in the first year or
the second year whatever they can they
can stick it out and hopefully they will
end up getting a beachhead and keep
growing and this is really not even day
one they haven't even sold the started
bringing the product to market that's
not going to come for another week or so
so the expectation from any smart
speaker I would say is that you know
wait and see and it will probably
continue to get better so of course that
is that is something that can say yeah
but like I just don't want to give
people the impression that this thing is
dead on arrival because I don't think it
oh it's not dead on arrival but there's
plenty of valid arguments about how is
just so severely behind I totally agree
I totally agree I want to offer both
sides to it totally like that's why
that's why everybody's favorite that's
well okay thank you yeah I mean like I'm
here defending the repeal of net
neutrality some days so yes I do try to
take I do try to take the opposite
opinions up but I think that he brought
up an interesting point
the I think the statement was something
along the lines that the software is
what matters more soar than that most
more so than the hardware is that yeah
that's an interesting idea I mean like
the iPhone was only I hate to use the
word revolutionary but there was only as
significant and impactful as it was
because of the App Store it was because
of what they had going on on that
hardware brightly made it different well
they made the phone customizable which
is ironic as hell considering it's Apple
right right well and they open it up to
like every developer that ever wanted to
be a developer like they've abandoned
that ecosystem to a certain extent they
man did that fault that particular
philosophy that made the iPhone as
powerful as it as it was and if they
bring even a little bit of that
philosophy to the home pod they're gonna
be developers falling all over
themselves to develop apps for the home
pod because all the research that I see
is that iPhone users tend to spend more
money on their phones that Android users
I don't see why that would change at all
if you're willing to spend three hundred
and fifty dollars on the smart speaker
yeah there's a strong possibility you're
gonna want to do more voice chopping on
a home pod than you would on an echo
device or you know spend money on apps
that
kind of thing so that's that's another
reason to really say wait and see and
see what happens with this they might
end up taking more of the like the
higher end market I would say but the
middle market it'll be a fistfight
between Google home and Alexa I agree
one thing I want to say is I I mean
Megan wrote a fantastic review of the
home pod but since they're touting so
much as far as audio fidelity goes I
would really love to get our audio files
steve guttenberg tie Pendlebury David
Carr know to put their heads together
and really analyze the hell out of that
speaker performance yeah yeah I heard
two other Bluetooth speakers both smart
and on smart and I think karna smart has
just has a story if I recall karna has a
story out on seeing it already about
listening to the home pod oh really this
is I can't read everything you guys
write so much I'm just trying to let
people know so if you want to delve a
little bit more into the home pod sound
quality I think coronoid does have a
story for you I figured I'd pick their
brains personally sooner or later but I
think that might be a fun video to
produce you see we'll see what that say
yes yeah absolutely but um you're
probably not gonna buy a home pod like
you're probably just curious but I think
the thing is is that just as a moderate
audiophile myself I'm interested for a
mini version of the competing products
from Google and Amazon 50 bucks you know
if you wait until the holidays is thirty
dollars it's like you don't really have
to think that much about it
$350 I'm not getting that for a gift for
anybody know just as anyone who is touts
themselves as an audiophile you're not
gonna lean on this stand alone you're
gonna buy your own system and integrate
into it
whose have been said time and time again
from the Sonos speakers I myself I'm a
big fan of Bose and Yamaha to a certain
extent so I mean I've got my echo in
home and that's working into my systems
so yeah which is what Amazon's argument
is as to why they're not creating a
high-end speaker yeah they they're still
very much an online retailer and they
want to sell you a cheaper audio product
that you can then plug in to more
expensive stuff and not compete against
those guys like posing Yamaha so let's
keep the burns rolling imagine soggy
says Apple should have worked harder on
their products than their headquarters
I really wonder where they'll be in 10
years the iMac pro isn't even in stores
anymore
ouch yeah and there yeah to keep the
burns going this is also a delayed
product it's important to remember that
it was supposed to come out during the
holiday season and that could hurt them
to a certain extent because everybody's
got their wallets out during the
holidays so maybe it is gonna depress
sales at least in the short term yeah
sigmund a judge can you speak to it and
have it play a specific film or TV show
all on your Apple TV is that all
integrated together in the home yes I
don't know
I imagine that my gut is that right now
you can't but I really don't know so I
shouldn't say it's got to be one of
those things that's at least coming
because didn't amazon only reese fairly
recently so couple months ago it's start
working that in yeah yeah and an Apple
TV you know obviously has the voice
remote where you can do that right I
don't know seems like it'd be an easier
step for Apple to take than the others
yeah kind of that's what I mean one of
the few benefits of a walled garden is
that you have so much control over how
your devices but I don't recall hearing
something about that happening now yeah
I don't know either it's a good question
and I'm sorry we don't have the answer
for you immediately on that one
let's talk to sir enjoy sir enjoy says
if Samsung pushes big speed with
improvements do you see it catching up
to Siri in the near future surely it's
the weakest amongst the top three very
good point as always from string joy
Samsung has definitely been pushing very
heavily to develop Bigsby but Bixby is
still very very early days if they keep
investing I would say that there's
there's a good chance that Bixby and
Siri at least reach a an equal level but
I think Samsung still has a lot of work
to do if they expect to reach closer to
the top to imagine Sagi says it's crazy
for this home pod to be delayed and have
so many limited capabilities what about
families that have Android and Apple
phones are they're gonna have to borrow
the iPhones just to use Spotify I think
that families like that should consider
you know just breaking a
part like if you have an Android divorce
or like give give the kids away to a
different family that is an Android
something that Megan mentioned in her
review is that there's no way to mute
the home pod just by touching a button
so if you want the home pod to not be
listening for its wake word for Siri for
you talking to Siri you have to how nice
to have a phone gross
yeah what yeah imagine if the echo
required you to have a fire phone Wow
nobody would buy it of 10th level of how
would we be living in yeah yeah yeah
you're right I'm looking at Megan's a
story right here the home pod doesn't
have a button on the speaker it's for
muting to mute Siri which is which is
definitely like a step back from what a
lot of people have yeah expected you
know like for instance the Google
assistant smart displays these days also
have like a specific like like a shudder
that you can shut the camera yeah that's
facing you so I think that people are
really have this expectation that there
is an increase of privacy but I don't
know it's also very Apple that's like we
don't want to too many but brahim nobody
beautiful mmm fabric mesh squishy
seamless technology Hey harsh on Apple
Apple it's very Apple to be like I don't
want like what was it like I don't need
that what did Steve Jobs say like I
don't need a stylist like God gave me
ten styli or whatever What did he say he
doesn't like styluses he doesn't know
why he doesn't like like the Steve Jobs
like philosophy is that simplicity
design at all cost at least of like what
you see on the surface it has to be
simple yeah very Apple to not have a
button it's funny they'd be simpler
these things get the less interesting
they are to look at and talk about
because they just do you don't actually
have to interact with them anymore
they're getting so smart to the extent
where it's like how do we demonstrate
this yeah well I I think of the future
of voice assistance is that you don't
even have to talk to them anymore I mean
like that's that's like all the sci-fi
movies show that like you just walk
in your house the lights turn on the you
know the oven starts your dinner all
that stuff and the possibility that
Google assistant and Alexa could
eventually do that for you I think is
very real you know they're already
integrating with all your stuff so the
idea that voices isn't just turns into
an assistant I think is possible and and
the fact that Siri is where it is right
now means they're like I don't know your
dinners just gonna be horrible
I think it's funny we're talking about
these voice assistants and the the top
three clearly being Google echo and Siri
and then and like is there a fourth
three forgetting somebody and and I've
lost who what lost legacy jumping goes
this Cortana
dead oh yeah definitely worth mentioning
Cortana is like in the mix to a certain
extent but really it's only existed in
the PC world and you know maybe there's
gonna be more expected hello
hang on sorry microphone failure oh I
feel like I'm in like a like a death
metal concert all of a sudden and we're
about to like really ramp it up fixed X
what are we talking about why Cortana
yeah so Microsoft probably should have
expanded the Cortana universe because
they were early to voice assistance ooh
and they didn't and now they're kind of
just playing catch-up and they teamed up
with Alexa which may help them or it may
just end up getting shadowed by Alexa so
but yeah it's good to at least mention
Cortana existing we are running low on
time so if there's any last-minute
questions go ahead and submit now before
we do go we should probably give a
little more time to the way Moe uber
yeah so basically way Moe's legal
defense as they presented on like
opening whatever was basically like
y'all know ubers like the worst right
throws everybody knows that they're the
worst company on the planet like come on
guys like guys
Oh actually first of all I could have
done that okay me 400 lawyers on both
sides and that's the best thing yeah but
it's a very it's a very effective
argument like it's in a way look
reputation obviously matters I think as
I mentioned in the podcast this could
have very significant implications
because uber has been really pushing it
into autonomous driving and if this
hampers their autonomous driving program
completely like they have to like shelve
it and start over because all of the
technology was stolen allegedly that
could that could really pull one of the
major players out of the game and that
could mean that autonomous driving at
least from Hooper's perspective is gonna
be you know much slower coming to the
market or maybe not at all uber is the
Patriots of who what's going on
somebody's mad Oberg Oh other guy I like
where this is going and I'm glad you
mentioned the Super Bowl by the way are
you aware of that there's anybody aware
that the reason Ben Fox Rubin was not on
the 3:15 ID podcast yesterday's cuz it
was laying in bed hungover from partying
after this football this is completely
accurate and apologized for nothing it's
not completely accurate you weren't in
bed because you were partying after
zeros cuz you were like drinking by
yourself oh my god you guys have
weaponized the pre podcast conversation
against me and it is all true all true
fly eagles fly and by the way the guy
that ate horse poop on the street of
Philadelphia I'd like to interview you
so please find me oh god what is wrong
with us as a society on that it's it's
look it's more organic than Tide Pods
okay somebody's gonna put something
disgusting in their mouth I'd rather you
know us poop I'm gonna give you that one
thank you wrapping up so on that note on
horse poop it's time to wrap it up for
the day thanks everybody for joining us
who wants to say the goodbye today
oh it's Ben's turn ok take I'll be right
