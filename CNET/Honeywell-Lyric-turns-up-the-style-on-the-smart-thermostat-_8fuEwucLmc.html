start thinking about smart thermostats
I'm glad you carry would seen it with
your first look and Honeywell
smart thermostat it's called the lyric
now this is a small circular one that
you put on the wall and it has a reel to
simply change your temperature but we
don't want to get more into your
temperature settings it's all about the
smartphone app the lyric is able to
sense when your phone has left the house
it's a geofencing sensor so when the
phone has gone a certain distance away
from your home well an energy-saving
feature will kick in and your AC won't
be ready at full blast so that's pretty
handy for saving energy without having
to worry about setting a schedule on
when you're coming and going there are
different lifestyle modes in this
example there's one for working out when
you might want to be cooler in the house
the lyric takes into account the
feels-like temperature so it calculates
for humidity and wind chill
getting down to the device itself it has
a few touch controls you don't have to
use your smart phone for everything the
wheel has some haptic feedback so you
can hear clicks when you're moving it
for instant adjustment of the
temperature but also if you're just
stepping away for a moment you can touch
the home clock button and let it know
that you'll be away for seven hours the
cloud icon is a handy way to see if you
need an umbrella to go it will show you
what the weather is like outside in six
hour increments on top you can also
change from cool to heat you're a little
intimidated on installing something like
this because it can be complicated
the app even comes with DIY instructions
so you get a step-by-step walkthrough on
what you need to do to install it this
is a growing evolving category the nest
thermostat made the sleek home smart
thermostats popular and the Honeywell
lyric is going to be a big competitor to
the net you'll be able to pick up this
at Lowe's and Home Depot for two hundred
and eighty dollars the CNET I'm Bridget
Carey with your first look at the
Honeywell lyric</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
