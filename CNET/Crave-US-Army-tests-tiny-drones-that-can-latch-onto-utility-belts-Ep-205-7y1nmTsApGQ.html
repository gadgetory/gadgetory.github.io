you're just happening this week on CNET
scrape block the genie scale is a small
portable stylish scale that can weigh
just about anything the scale connects
via bluetooth with a smartphone app and
does a lot more than just weigh things
the app can be used for weight and
health management to make sure you're
not overeating it can be used to alert
you when your dinner is done or if your
child got out of bed you can use
multiple Genie scales to weigh larger
objects like boats luggage yourself and
just about anything that you put on the
scale the scale is small enough to fit
in your purse so no need to bring that
large awkward bathroom scale around with
you anymore
and the scale seems to be almost
indestructible according to what I saw
in the video and it is water-resistant
and washable just in case you make a
mess wing weird things
the Genie scale is currently raising
funds on Kickstarter with a goal of a
hundred and ten thousand dollars to
start production but it can be yours for
an early-bird pledge of $69 this pothole
in Panama City might have more Twitter
followers than you
it definitely has more than me Panama's
daily news show telemetry o reporte
installed a number of sensors inside pot
holes throughout Panama City which went
run over by a car would send an
automatic tweet to the Ministry of
Public Works alerting them of the
pothole location and the damage caused
for example one tweet read I feel
terrible
I just caused tire damage to an old
lady's car the Twitter account is called
elf wacko twit Cairo which means the
tweeting pothole and has become very
popular because victims of the potholes
feel like it's a good place to voice
their complaints and share photos of
existing potholes while the tweets did
in fact work in the city began repairing
potholes that were made public by the
tweeting pothole campaign this is such a
good example of how technology can help
solve a common problem and definitely
way better than Whang see the street
artist who paints penises over potholes
in Manchester to get the city to fix
them actually he's pretty cool too
people will risk their lives impossible
decapitation to ride a speeder bike like
the ones we saw in Return of the Jedi
and that is exactly what a group of
Hungarian flight enthusiasts are doing
with this flying tricycle that looks
extremely dangerous to me the flight or
flying bike is a coaxial Y 6 layout
tricopter and has six spinning blades
just a few feet away from your head it
is equipped with a full authority flight
management computer that manages flight
stability and altitude making the flight
as easy as riding a bicycle according to
the project website now we've seen other
hover bike prototypes like the air
effects which hovers on two large
shielded fans so the technology is
progressing and who knows maybe by the
year 2020 we will all be cruising around
on hover bikes crashing into each other
and blowing leaves and garbage all over
the place and getting decapitated the
United States Army is testing out
palm-sized PD 100 black Hornet drones
that easily launch from a utility belt
the drone weighs 18 grams it is equipped
with both regular HD and thermal cameras
for spotting the enemy up ahead the BB
100 black Hornet drones are a product of
procs dynamics out of Norway which has
already deployed a number of the drones
to British forces in Afghanistan the
drone has a flight time of about 25
minutes and can be piloted with one hand
using a small controller or it can be
programmed to fly to a specific
coordinate on a map if you think these
are cool little consumer drones then
think again the PD 100 black Hornet
drone sells for $40,000 apiece but it
does come with this fancy launching pad
