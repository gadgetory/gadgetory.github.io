and more on this week's edition of
Android Alex a weekly for January 11
2012 I'm Justin Eckhouse alongside
antuan goodwin hey guys how's it going
we're in Vegas we are in Vegas and we
have a guest with us Ryan Biden the
Director of Product Marketing from
samsung mobile how's it going thanks for
joining us no problem thank God so I'm
going to jump right into it you guys had
some big announcements from the show and
some of them were actually Android
related we're not going to talk about
the washing machine probably for the
most part but you know you can maybe
sneak it in here okay so let's start
with the galaxy note which there was a
lot of rumors about and we've heard
Antony was confirmed the moment we
checked into our hotel across the way
and saw all the big banners say when you
saw the giant bus is driving down we saw
the giant buses we saw the banner which
actually for a while said the Samsung
Galaxy no I guess the wind was brutal on
day one here okay so walk us through
this what is this this is a phone is
that a tablet is it a okay so be a
player so it is pretty clearly a 5.3
inch smartphone it's basically if you
just look at it it feels a lot like one
of our android galaxy s2 devices yeah so
it looks like 12 just bigger just bigger
so as I said it's 5.3 inch screen Super
AMOLED HD and it's 1280 x 800 resolution
so very high res great image quality you
get all the vibrant colors and richness
that you expect an ax and a super amoled
display so kind of as our great displays
are going this is kind of the evolution
of that and another beautiful bright
phone I mean from a kind of pure
hardware perspective it's got a
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz processor 8
megapixel autofocus camera on the back
with LED flash it's got an another
camera on
for video conferencing that kind of
stuff if you may have seen the
international version of this I know
it's been out overseas for a couple of
months now a little bit of a design
difference on the front of this one
we've got kind of the four capacitive
touch keys as the rest of our Android
devices in North America instead of the
one single large touch button and who do
you think that who's the ideal user for
this well and that's the thing about
this device I mean if you just take
those specs in and of themselves it just
feels like another high-end smartphone
right so the really unique feature about
the galaxy note is the S Pen right so
what this does and please don't call it
a stylus is it allows you to interact
with device and do a bunch of stuff that
you couldn't do with either your finger
or just a normal capacitive stylus so
what we've actually done is integrate
the stylus with I just called it sighs
we're going to get in trouble or two
probably already email coming you use
the S Pen with the digitizer integrated
into the touch screen allows you to do a
lot more stuff so you get really fine
grain details so down 2.7 of a
millimeter with this thing and also 256
levels of pressure sensitivity so you
can start to create really fine drawings
notes create things essentially where it
so is this for artists is it like a
doctor well I mean you can start to
imagine the obvious uses when you're
talking about note-taking right so
you've got this single handheld device
you got the stylist allows you a lot of
cool stuff like draw take picture or
draw pictures edit photos that kind of
stuff but we've also gone a step further
on the productivity side of things and
integrated it into Polaris Office so
what you can actually do is open up a
powerpoint annotate it with the pen send
it back to somebody and they can kind of
see those edits in Microsoft Office as
another as objects on the device and go
ahead and continue to use it with that
or continue to make those changes remove
your edits and continued use of files so
it's got some productivity pieces as
well like our safe so Samsung approved
for enterprise features so additional
VPN support additional exchange in act 2
synchro
while stuff so just a lot of under the
hood stuff as well that make it great
for business so when you asked me who
the ideal customer for this is it
somebody who wants a really high-end
smartphone wants the portability
associated with that but needs to do a
little bit more and doesn't want to
carry an additional top of the wall as
well all right so let's jump to another
product which you announce which
actually it's kind of been around for a
while right but you sort of have an
enhanced it with a slightly new name and
that's sort of the all-share yeah
product line or woody call service yeah
so let's do let's think of all sure as a
service I mean traditionally it's been a
bunch of very desperate or disparate
kind of pieces right so we had kind of
all share remote which was the remote
control functionality and then we had
all share which allowed you to share
content then very similar to DLNA across
devices that are on the same Wi-Fi
network so push content from your phone
to your TV watch content that may be on
a remote server those types of services
what AllShare Play does as we added the
cloud so now they don't need to be on
the same Wi-Fi network to be able to
share that content and do that you just
need to register the devices and then
they'll start to see each other
seamlessly ok and the suite of devices
we're talking about that support this so
your phones TVs phones tabs TVs washing
machines what can I really but yeah ok
fridge what do I do with the fridge so
basically think about it the fridge in
very much the same way you'd think of
having perhaps a smartphone in the
kitchen except for the making calls
piece so download apps right watch TV on
it push pictures so say you're out at
the park kids are running around shoot
some shots of the kids and actually push
them right to Grandma's fridge right and
this is the kind of thing to use your
competitors terminology is this can I do
airplay type of stuff where I'm watching
a video on my phone and I pause it and
then I'm like oh I need to watch the
rest of this recipe on my you know
refrigerator yeah so it starts to enable
all of those types of things so I'm
watching TV on my watching TV in the
living room I can actually then
seamlessly start watching the TV on my
phone
tab go into the other room with it push
it to the fridge if I wanted to do that
but very much those kinds of let's take
content with us like to use it
seamlessly wherever we're going on
whatever device right okay great so
what's next ok so we've already got the
washing machine control with an android
app when's the car that's what aunt was
really interested in right yeah I'm
really into coarseness and Samsung car
you'd be into that yeah we do lolz
roadster drive your car with your phone
so Samsung is a very big company as you
know washer dryers TVs super tankers
rank giant building some insurance
fashion you name it we probably do it
and so what we're thinking about and
kind of the approach that we're taking
going forward is about how can we add
more Valley to you by being in the
Andrew herb being in the Samsung
ecosystem right so this idea of okay so
today I've got a galaxy phone tomorrow
maybe I add a smart TV maybe down the
road I upgrade my fridge or my washing
machine and every time you incremental e
do that we want to incrementally more
valued Thank You rating okay well great
thanks for joining us today those great
overview of both those products which
are pretty interesting and I'm sure
we'll be hearing more about them yeah
more about extent thanks we're going to
take a quick break but then we're going
to run down all the news from CES so
stay with us
and we are back how about pretty a good
interview thing yeah it was good i like
the all-share stuff i like that now in
the Android world we have you know a
choice for the whole whoops Apple
ecosystem I think its own yeah we
ignored that and have a one iphone atlas
for that but let's talk about cameras
okay yeah anyway hehe the there's a
camera so I don't know how to describe
this but for a long time we've seen you
know phones get better and better
cameras and now what we're seeing is I
don't know if this is first but it
certainly it says right here on the
headline Polaroid first with Android
camera so it's a first yeah so it's the
opposite of what you just said and a set
of phones they're coming more like
cameras camera in this case the Polaroid
SC 1630 it's more like a phone it's not
exactly a phone that yeah this is
interesting for a couple reasons so I
know that Molly is discussing to earlier
abuzz out loud how we've been looking
for Wi-Fi based cameras for a long time
and Samsung actually introduced one but
it's not android-based as far as we know
so we're not going to talk about that
but yeah this one is a 16 megapixel
camera that has a touch screen on the
back which you know for all intents and
purposes looks like and well is android
right i mean you'd be it's kind of like
you know the performers they used to
have back in the day word one half is
like a man when half was a woman and
they do like to do it with themselves
prices like that one side of this is
basically a portable media player an
android portable media player and the
other side I mean looks just like a
camera a really big lens placed front
and center and in really simple controls
for and whatnot place place
friend center where you can get to them
yeah I mean I think this is really cool
i'm most excited i have to say about the
connectivity less so about the android I
mean
it's great on the phone but you know the
fact that it can connect over Wi-Fi can
connect over 3g and a bunch of other
sort of cellular networks at an extra
cost just makes your pictures so much
easier to get off their camera which has
always been the problem for me with
cameras you know if-- i tried to solve
this problem in sort of an aftermarket
way but it just never really came
together for most people I think to be
fair there knew I ficar do do work with
Android and iOS devices that you compare
that directly with the phones with the
app but I mean I've understand when I
played with it when it first came out it
was a little weird yeah i think it was
but i think an integrated solution in
this case is going to be better so let's
talk about some real phones for a second
here and this is one that we've been
talking about it reversed for a long
time this is the droid 4 so both you and
I have the original droid right right
motorola droid one right a
groundbreaking phone in the Android
world I think really propelled Android
into the map and now we finally have
what I think is a good successor to the
original droid which is the droid 4 and
our own Brian Bennett says is the best
android keyboard slider yet so I'm
assuming that you know the the
interesting thing here is the keyboard
because the phone itself looks pretty
much like the droid razr with the added
bulk of a keyboard right but it's the
first you know droid slider keyboard
with 4g okay it has you know processors
not that much faster than the droid 3 I
guess and it's still only running
android 2.3 i was saying before the show
i'm a little disappointed at the lack of
ice cream sandwich phones that have been
introduced I mean to be fair it just
came out you know ice cream famous was
just sort of like just hit the market on
in the first phone weeks ago yeah and a
lot of the vices that we're seeing here
at the show I mean they're new to us but
I mean to the developers or not they've
been working with these devices for
month at this point so I'm really not
surprised making excuses I'm not giving
them any slack I'm not making excuses
and just saying
surprise right okay I guess that's
that's true I'm a little surprised but I
have high expectations for our Android
ecosystem let's talk about another phone
the droid 4 is a great one are you going
to switch damn it you're good alright so
the Galaxy Nexus my phone of choice been
out on verizon for what like four weeks
now and sprint has announced that sort
of as part of their LTE rollout which
will start soon and then hit I think ten
different cities by 2012 one of the
first phones on that is going to be the
Galaxy Nexus which is going to be almost
identical to the verizon one except it's
unadulterated meaning people yeah that
means that the Google Wallet
implementation that was cherry picked
out of the verizon version it's actually
going to be in this one presumably
because if it doesn't have the sort of
contractual conflicts that verizon has
we're not developing their own payment
system right the ISIS payment system
yeah I wonder if this is going to put
any pressure on verizon to should have
yet the Google Wallet on there or at
least their own wallet solution I think
the biggest problem with the verizon
solution is there is no solution let me
there's a very simple solution it's
called root your phone and put it on
there I mean that came out you know
literally lift same day that the the
Galaxy Nexus hit the market was people
had already put the Google Wallet
implementation back on in the
aftermarket but if you're really into
that sort of thing and I mean there is a
solution i mean there's the good thing
about integrated is usually no problem
that's not really solvable with you're
willing to void your warranty it's true
but most people are unfortunately but i
mean it's good to see I you know I love
the concept of using an a/c to pay and
I'm very disappointed I haven't rooted
my phone yet I don't something about
rooting your phone and downloading
google wallet from some server that
holds all your credit card information
then make unsteadily the Google wall
that you download comes from the android
open source project
it's not you're getting it from Google
server you're just basically rebuilding
it back in there all right a little less
delicious logic but it's still
unsettling that you have to install that
yourself man up Justin ah alright what's
next what's next is another motorola
phone quick hit on this one it's the the
droid razr maxx it's another droid razr
variant it seems like ma xxxx yeah 2 x's
because it's double extreme it's
basically again the droid razr a little
bit thicker but what's interesting here
is that that little bit of added
thickness point zero seven inches
thicker it is I adds up to about double
the battery life right Motorola's
boasting a 12 and a half hours was the
old one yeah now they're both in 21
hours of continuous talk time so it's
not a bad trade-off 4.07 inches thicker
but my question is does an extended
battery merit a new name for your phone
oh yeah sure yeah because I just ordered
an extended battery for my phone but it
didn't change the name well that's kind
of like you know you buy a mini cooper
yeah you had a turbo to it it's not
still a cooper and stuff cooper s you
got to put it's a new model it's a
different model you've always uses all
right fine far as EPA concern first EP
well it'll regulate phones thankfully so
the droid maxx so let's talk about we
are hosting the best of CES awards we
announced finals this morning and the
words are tomorrow there were some
interesting android devices to come out
of there we're going to talk about a
couple of tablets the first of which is
from toshiba and it's the excite x10 and
this is this is pretty interesting
tablet because it is the according to
our own eric franklin the lightest and
thinnest tablet yet yeah it's crazy
expensive yeah so again this is a point
seven seven point seven millimeters thin
by about a half a millimeter point six
millimeters thinner than the transformer
prime that's about a blade of grass
we're talking about thickness but I mean
you know accolades or accolades but yeah
it seems like a looking at air support
that it is a pretty impressive device
but I mean it's kind of expensive too
and compared to other Android tablets
but compared to the ipad not excessively
expensive right not excessively but I
mean you know you're paying for things
like Magnum agni-v mal Lloyd chassis and
you know just really I guess the the
build quality that you need to make it a
bicep man and not feel like a creaky
mess when you're touching it is one of
the things that when I talked to Eric he
said that it felt pretty sturdy for it
to be that thin one thing that I'm a
little bit you know they're going to a
magnesium alloy back side this is metal
and I'm I haven't seen any pictures of
the back but I wonder how they're gonna
you know avoid the pitfalls of the
transformer prime remember that metal
back on that device actually caused
issues with it it's Wi-Fi connectivity
that's why it costs money they you know
made it stronger to put in some crazy
glue I don't know I for one can't wait
to steal this off of Eric's death okay
let's so let's jump to the other end of
the tablet spectrum also best of CES
finest finalist the asus memo 370 t so
the previous one was a solid fast tablet
but really expensive right and this one
is a quad core and vidya ice cream
sandwich tablet for two hundred and
fifty dollars wait what yeah like
subsidized by somebody I don't know that
by asus like yeah soos it's a 7-inch
tablet so the period the other tablet
was 10 inch but still two hundred fifty
dollars for what ballot and yet at all
you know quite a core tablet I mean
you're talking about Oh potentially
viable laptop replacement just and think
about that compared to the kindle fire
which is 199 right and ideas subsidized
so the fact that they've been able to
make this sort of unsubsidized tablet
for 250 that pretty much can do
everything the Kindle Fire can do plus a
whole lot more I think it's pretty
interesting product that could really
sort of change the tablet space in least
on the Andrew
type of thing no I'm looking at the post
right here and it says second quarter
2012 base price of 399 ringing 250 from
accessor right there at the top I think
it comes in different configuration okay
then three glasses yeah so it's debuting
at 250 but yeah I'm sure you can add
more memory and you can always make
things more expensive and of course you
can have the requisite the keyboard dock
to make it into a little clothes elab
hoppy thing right yeah everyone's kind
of go in the way of the prime there all
right let's talk about lenovo and their
ideapad ideatab s2o you know what I open
the wrong oh you did okay i confuse me
oh that's the one that's 399 look right
so this one is a getting there it is a
competitor to the prime right right so
this is Lenovo's ice cream sandwich
tablet that you know can be a full
laptop full android based laptop which
as I was just saying this sort of the
way of things are going right now it's
pretty well powered 1280 x 800
resolution qualcomm you know dual-core
1.5 gigahertz chip and all the sort of
standard bells and whistles that ball
standard now well standard I think for
high-end Android tablets yeah Dan dirt
yeah and apparently for low-end 7-inch
tablets made by a sous standard as well
yeah well yeah for that in what I'm
seeing here the the 399 pricing a little
bit more more reasonable does that price
include the actual doc is why I very
seriously doubt it yeah I'm pretty sure
that's $150 doc that's why that can they
like they like to charge triple digits
for those things as you can get first
people think these convergence devices
are going to take off I mean where we
going to see the Prime and you know this
what I always forgot the name the lenovo
sort of tablet docking station take off
motorola try to do year ago didn't
really work out very well yeah they
dreaded a year ago but that was that was
a phone getting slapped on to basically
a screen in a keyboard
when they came out with the docking
station for the atrix so it was there's
a bit of redundancy there to basically
you have a perfectly good screen that
you're hiding behind another screen in
this case it's like you've got a tablet
I mean the the the tablet market is
already kind of proven that people
really love to buy cases that have
keyboards in them so why not make it a
little bit you know more elegant of a
solution not just strapping it into
basically a trapper keeper with a
keyboard built into it love to talk
about the Trapper Keeper part of my
childhood alright well we'll see what
happens here there's some other
interesting stuff running Android the
first is some google TV announcements i
think we talked actually a lot about
google TV last year at CES and we have
some news sprinkled in throughout the
year but Google is again getting serious
about Google TV and has signed some new
partnerships they have to the Sony
partnership and they have a logitech
devices that came out which haven't done
that well but now they have new deals
with vizio LG and Samsung to offer you
know Google TV in their various devices
from the TV's to set top boxes and also
deals with Marvel and media tech to
produce chipsets that can be used in
other devices going forward so question
is will this actually change the game
for Google TV is the sort of
manufacturer support what is lacking
there or is the user demand lacking well
i think you know tvs are becoming
connected they're getting aptly the TV
manufacturers are definitely wanting to
make these things more than just a dumb
display and I mean Google TV is is there
I mean it right it's an option too all
right well here's how what's the easiest
way to do that well it's just basically
take something that's already built and
slap it in there instead of you know
calling Sam phones around basically
developing your own sort of interface
for your TV and then making your own
partnerships and and basically having to
get in contact with with Netflix and
form your own partnership there like you
already have sort of a built-in
ecosystem there and you know when these
manufacturers who are mean maybe not
late but maybe not early getting into
this
connected TV game start thinking about
doing it I mean of course it's just
easier just to go like oh well let's do
this and it I don't know if it's going
to be from one of the things that puts
google TV on top of the game or you know
but it definitely adds a little bit more
relevance it makes them more of a viable
contender as far as like you know
competing for Google's resources and
attention right I mean I interests say
that I'm still skeptical I think that
what people want on their TVs is kind of
a curated experience something that's
very easy to control from their living
room from their couch and Google TV has
gone the route of like let's put the
internet on your TV and I don't know
that that's what people want you know
they've introduced apps which i think is
going to simplify everything but we
haven't seen tons of apps come out so I
don't know I think you'd be amazed by
you know people wanting internet on
their TV I would be amazed by that
you're right the other question is what
we've seen in the past is google has
signed deals for Google TV on you know
with various manufacturers but normally
those deals are like we're going to put
that on two of our 20 different models
and they're going to be on the models
that no advice anyway so when we start
seeing devices from Samsung and LG and
Vizio you know I think if it's that kind
of deal then it's not going to work out
but if it's going to be these are on our
big best-selling devices then they're
going to start to sway the industry I
would hope that LG and video would want
to fill all of their TVs and they
weren't just making TVs to be shelf
warmers well know why it's going to make
it let's just put it out anyway I would
really hope that that's not and I'm
pretty sure that's not their their their
way of looking at it sort of thing but
again those are often the low cost
models and you don't want to spend dump
a bunch of R&amp;amp;D money into something that
you're not going to make a ton of you
know
it doesn't have like a ton of overhead
you know so it would make sense on a low
cost budget TV to go ahead and add
something that's already built and not
to invest that money into building it
yourself it's true but all these
companies already have their connected
TV platform but it is also true that
Android is free for them for the most
part right I mean why not why not hit
Joe Smith yeah so lenovo has taken a
different approach to getting android on
their TVs so they actually have an ounce
of TV that actually is going to only be
released and china to start with and
this TV is actually running android not
android via google TV but Android itself
which is a very different take that we
have not seen before what do you make of
this does that make any sense it seems
rather roundabout yeah but I don't know
it's definitely interesting i like to
see weird things like this happen so
basically when you turn on this TV
you'll go to the android or an android
home screen presumably something that
skin ty Lee's good i would guess right
but it wouldn't be like and maybe
there'd be like a tuner window in there
or something like that but my worry is
that this would be like every annoying
TV nets and hotels now where you turn it
on and instead of just doing what the
channel yet did welcome antoine it
starts trying to sell me things and you
have to push for buttons just to get to
the tuner before you can go to your
channel i worry about that but i know it
definitely seems interesting and it's a
little confusing though considering we
just finished talking about google go
baby sounds like it would be better
better suited well it could be that they
are taking the approach that i'm talking
about where people want the curated
experience they don't want the internet
they don't want a web browser on their
TV and so maybe just sticking android on
there is like it's a free OS that we can
just stick on there and you know we just
want to build a TV that is smart to
compete with you know samsung was built
their own OS and we want to jump start
on that but we don't actually want
Google TV so I think it could work and
they're also going to use this to
connect to their other devices their
android tablets and there
basically second screen devices I think
ultimately how interesting or how
successful this is is going to depend on
what they do with Android they can't
just like slap you know that standard
android home screen with the app drawer
on the device they're going to have to
heavily skin it do something like you
know parrot has actually built a series
of Android powered car stereos and it
doesn't look anything like Android but
they just needed an operating system
that they could skin Android just
happens to be it if this is something
similar that where they just want to
build their own experience and the
easiest way to do that is to start with
Android and then create something
completely different maybe they just
don't want Google TV they don't want to
put the Google TV logo on it maybe they
don't even want the the android
marketplace they just want the the
underlying you know thing that's
powering it the software that's powering
it then then maybe we could be something
interesting from them yeah I mean I
think we're gonna have to watch this one
it'll be a little hard since it's only
in China but hopefully it'll come to the
u.s. eventually and we'll be able to
scale it early long telescope and you
can watch it from here I we're just
gonna have to get a scene that trip to
China or I mean there was also the
internet the internet I've heard of that
on my TV I'm on it Beach awesome let's
do one quick app of the week here and
that I think we're done TiVo who has had
apps app for other operating systems
that shall not be named for quite a
while has released an android app and
it's pretty much parity with the apps on
the other platforms you can say Apple I
can yeah I don't get in trouble if I
don't like zapped you won't get kicked
off the show we'll see tune in next week
to find out so it lets you sort of see a
guide of what's on your TV elect it
actually will show you a remote control
picture of so the classic TV remote so
you can do all the functions you can do
with your moat but you can also click in
the guy then sort of jump to any given
show or scheduled programming is coming
up in the future or even search for
programming so I think this works on
both Android tablets and on
smart phones as well I'm a big tivo user
so I'm pretty excited about this
disconnect like through the internet to
your device or is I mean it says the
good yeah even RF or Bluetooth because
every phone doesn't have that so is it
just sort of pinging a server and then
bouncing back based on my usage of the
ipad version it does connect sort of
over your land over the internet you
have to sort of pair the two devices
which has kind of been a pain to do
every time I've done it and that sort of
loses parents so hopefully the Android
one works better but it's actually a
really great way and one of the best to
navigate TiVo and one of the best second
screen apps that I've actually seen out
this gives me a very good idea for our
next weeks after the week but I want to
save that okay and if you want to tune
