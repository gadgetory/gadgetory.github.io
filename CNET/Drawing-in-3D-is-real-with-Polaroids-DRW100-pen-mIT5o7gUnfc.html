out of the page well now you can with
Polaroids drw 103d pen just be warned
that your skills on a sketch pad may not
always transfer into a three-dimensional
masterpiece or so I learned using this
pen is basically like having a 3d
printer that you can control with your
hand except the 3d computer rendering is
all up to you
unless you use one of their stencils
which I didn't because I was overly
confident in my artistic abilities this
is what I achieved and this is what you
could achieve with a few hundred hours
more of practice and an art degree the
mechanics of the pen are similar to that
of a glue gun it heats up the plastic
filaments and then pushes them out and
although it's more sophisticated than
that for starters it will never burn
your fingers and will cool off after a
few minutes on standby you can also
control the temperature depending on
your preferred consistency once out of
the pen the plastic dries in seconds
which is particularly helpful when
drawing up aside from these fun
sculptures you could use it for mock-ups
or to make repairs on existing 3d models
there are over 60 colors of filaments to
choose from with kits that range
anywhere from thirty to sixty dollars
depending on the length of the string
the pen itself will cost one hundred and
thirty dollars for the wired version you
have to plug into the wall and a hundred
and fifty dollars for the wireless
version which lasts about an hour and a
half per charge and comes with its own
charging station</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
