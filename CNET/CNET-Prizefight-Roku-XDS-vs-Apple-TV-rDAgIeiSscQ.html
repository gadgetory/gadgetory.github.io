and we've got a battle for streaming box
supremacy it's a prizefight throw down
showdown between the roku XDS and the
Apple TV our judges for this fight our
senior editor John bad to the bone
Falcone senior editor David Garneau and
yours truly all night long we'll take
all three judges blind scores and
average them out to the nearest tenth
each round the final prize fight store
will be an average of all rounds using
the same decimal system let's get this
party started round 1 in design both of
these boxes are small and black and you
really won't notice them next year TV
set the roku XDS is simple and clean but
it's fabric tag belongs on a t-shirt
more than it does on a set-top box Apple
stays true to tradition and can even
make a streaming box sexy it's the
smallest component you'll have it's
about fifty percent smaller than the XDS
and its remote is just as sleep Apple TV
starts a fight with a perfect five and
Roku get two for next round is interface
and navigation the roku XDS has a simple
interface that's very utilitarian it
won't wow you visually but it gets the
job done it's also easy to customize by
adding channels for your favorite
content and the remote doesn't get in
the way the Apple TV interface is clean
and elegant just like you'd expect
animations are smooth and its interface
feels polished you won't get any real
customization here but its remote is
simple and easy to use the big a gets
another perfect five and the Roku gets a
3.7 dr. averaging two rounds Apple leads
by over a full point but it's still too
early to get excited round three is
secret
with the media box you want options and
the roku XDS connects to any TV with
HDMI up to 1080p component video and
composites there's also USB port for
potentially streaming content off a
connected thumb stick or hard drive in
the future plus you're getting dual band
802 11 N and an ethernet port for
connectivity now the apple TV is pretty
limited here it brings HDMI at only 720p
and that's it it won't connect to any
non HD television sets networking
options include Wi-Fi and ethernet but
is pretty slim pickings roastin strikes
back with a perfect five of its own and
Apple gets a 3 next round is content
with media streaming boxes content is
king Netflix is the flagship service on
both boxes but you know s we're hungry
for more now the Roku shines with over
100 channels of content like amazon
video on demand Hulu Plus Pandora for
music discovery and streaming music from
the cloud with mp3 tunes plus there's
on-demand sports from Major League
Baseball and the National Hockey League
and none of these services are currently
available on Apple TV now beyond Netflix
apples box has access to content from
itunes but key shows like house fringe
or modern family aren't even available
at the moment it can stream itunes from
pcs on your local network and you can
watch youtube you can use airplay to
view content from iOS devices on the big
screen but not all media content can be
viewed like videos plane in Safari or
movies you recorded on your iPhone it's
a killer innovation but it's still not
fully baked The Rose who gets another 5
with its myriad content solutions and
the Apple TV gets a 3 after averaging
four rounds Roku has taken the lead by
four tenths of a point this one is so
close and the final round that decides
it all is value
for ninety-nine dollars the roku XDS
brings the best video and audio
streaming services on the web with every
connectivity option you can think of the
apple TV is also 99 bucks and if you
live in an apple dominated ecosystem
you'll feel right at home with itunes
integration but you'll be missing out on
a whole lot of content in the final
round roku gets another perfect five and
Apple gets a four so let's average out
all five rounds and in a battle where
the big a dominated from the start the
roku XDS came back with three perfect
rounds taking this faceoff 4.5 24 and is
your prize fight winner both of these
streaming boxes will continue to mature
with new features and content but the
decision really comes down to your
desire to stay in the Apple world or
experience all the services that Roku
has to offer I'm Brian Tom thanks for
watching we'll catch you guys next time
for another prize fight
