am thrilled for you all to now meet our
truly personal digital assistant for
Windows Phone and yes her name is
cortana I want you to notice right there
on the Start screen front and center
right here I have a live tile for
Cortana
so of course Cortana has a live tile and
you can see she's animating right there
and there's a number of interests that
I've already taught her about and the
live tile is showing me this news and
information so that's one way I might
get to Cortana but Cortana also fully
replaces the search function on Windows
Phone so whenever you push the search
button Cortana is there to help you do
searches find information or get things
done so I'm gonna go down here and touch
the search button and there's Cortana
and you can see she greets me she looks
a little excited to see me here on stage
and probably to see all of you she says
what's on your mind and below that you
see she's giving a bunch of suggestions
for things that I might ask and these
suggestions are actually personalized if
you watch them sometimes she suggests
things actually related to people that
she knows about me people that she knows
that I know and one of the nice things
you could do here is I'll just touch
this see more so you get an overview of
all the kinds of things Cortana can do
like a real personal assistant she's
good at handling your communications in
your calendar she can make phone calls
or send texts or schedule appointments
or take a note give you a reminder she's
also good at learning helping you learn
things she can do searches tell you what
music is playing
she knows the places you frequent and so
on and so on so all of that is built
right in now imagine you're in the
dentist appointment at the desk and they
want you to set up appointment well you
can do this really easily put dentist
appointment on my calendar for August
first at 10:00 a.m. all right I'll add
dentist appointment to your calendar for
Friday August 1st at 10:00 a.m.
sound good yep
all right I've added it just so you know
you have pick up Christina from airports
at the same time uh-huh oh that's what
you would expect from a personal
assistant if there's a conflict you want
them to tell you in fact I could say to
Cortana please move an appointment and
so on and and she can handle all those
sorts of tasks so that gives you a sense
of how she can help you be organized and
get things done well as I said she's
powered by Bing and knows the entire
internet so she's pretty good at sort of
searches and questions and those kinds
of things so here I am in San Francisco
I'm hoping to be to meet up with my
family a little bit later and I'm gonna
get a big group of people let's say and
go out down in Palo Alto so this is the
perfect kind of thing that Cortana can
help me with show me the best Mexican
restaurants in Palo Alto here are 10
Mexican restaurants in Palo Alto that
are 4 stars now here's what's going on
of course
Cortana powered by Bing knows a lot
about the Internet but remember Bing has
relationships with lots of other great
data feeds so in this case Yelp data
helps Cortana
identify four-star restaurants and
that's what she's showing me here now
because that data is present and because
Cortana is sufficiently smart I can
narrow my query in a really natural kind
of way I'm gonna have a big group of
people so I want to make reservations
which ones take reservations here are
the ones that are 4 stars and take
reservations now one of the other things
that we've added in to Cortana that is
something we heard these personal
assistants talk about a lot is the
degree to which they help their clients
with relationships with other people you
know the the personal assistants knew
that you had a meeting was so-and-so and
they knew that the person had you know
got promoted or was bummed out about
something and so Appert real world
personal assistant helps you with those
relationships we thought well that's a
perfect thing for Cortana to do as well
in fact it's something that other
digital assistants don't do so I want to
show you a kind of reminder that only
Cortana can do and these are people
reminders so I'm going to keep myself
out of trouble with my sister
by remembering to talk to her about her
new addition to her family
next time I speak with my sister remind
me to ask her about her new puppy
alright next time you talk to Nancy
exactly I can remind you to ask her
about her new puppy sound good
yep great now of course since this is a
phone I might talk to my sister on the
phone or I might have a chat string with
her I might have an email conversation
and in all those cases Cortana will now
remind me when I'm in the context of
talking to my sister to talk to her
about her new puppy and of course that
will make my sister feel much better
about me as her brother okay
I showed you a little earlier that as
we're building up Cortana we are making
her smarter and smarter on the service
back-end but we're also inviting you all
to participate with that as well and
when people start talking to their phone
in natural language we want to be able
to use the natural language capabilities
in the cloud to make your apps work
better so if a user addresses an app by
name and then says some text we're gonna
parse that and get it to you so that
good things happen let me show you some
examples
Skype get David Treadwell startings hi
this is a new version of Skype that were
updating for Windows Phone 8.1 and you
can see here Skype has recognized David
Treadwell and he's coming on the line
here in the contact that I have said I'm
not gonna actually make the call here on
stage you get the general idea there are
lots of other things that we're working
on right now and we invite you all to
participate as well let's say I'm at a
party or I'm out and someone says have
you seen the new show in this case
deadbeats a new show on Hulu Oh a Joe
you should watch that I don't want to
have to navigate around and find stuff I
want to really get to my apps quickly so
I can now do that via talking to Cortana
Hulu ad deadbeat to my cue opening Hulu
Plus and so the app runs the service
recognizes the data
adding deadbeat to queue there it is
deadbeat has been added to my queue
using natural language and making that
really convenient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
