could either be attached to it or not
it's your choice ciao
all right so what's the plan the movie
skyscraper is an action-packed romp and
in the movie Qin Han plays Joe the man
who is responsible for the Pearl that is
the building one of the most important
characters in skyscraper in Jinan is
here with us right now
I thought you're very nice of you thanks
for coming by our studio and telling us
a little bit about your role in
skyscraper this must be really exciting
it is I play Joe who is the the designer
of the Pearl and also the owner of the
building he is this maverick techno
premiere billionaire in in Hong Kong and
he has decided to build this 8th wonder
of the world basically as the sentian
building which is self-sustaining so it
has this wind turbine engines using
solar panels it's got all this stuff
it's got 30 story garden in it Opera
House so you know I mean it is a thing
unto itself and and and pretty
monumental it's the the biggest smart
home yeah I like it so you mentioned a
kind of maverick tech entrepreneur that
sounds so unfamiliar in Silicon Valley
we don't have a lot of those now we have
so many of those what kind of research
did you do for the role well I watched
Iron Man a million times
you know channeling your inner Tony I
know I'm no I only being ha facetious
because I mean that is the same person
that we did research on because I heard
Downey jr. had done research for the
role you know based on Elon Musk and so
I mean Elon Musk being the most current
and I think such a colorful character is
very colorful yes uh I got to reading
his biography first and then you know
for for history you know I went for the
back you know when the Tesla and went to
Edison and you know to get a sense of
what what drove these people even Steve
Jobs as well obviously sure but what
drove these people and what were the
you know what were their motivations for
all the innovations that they have
created
that's really cool I would imagine it
was an interesting sort of journey to
kind of piece together a lot of like
what all of what makes those men and
women tick which is pretty cool to bring
that to jail yeah so in the way of
disaster movies because obviously
unfortunately the Pearl I it's not all
fun and rainbows at the Pearl like bad
things start happening and I know that
you are a little bit of a fan of
disaster movies and so what when you're
able to do this movie one how did you
feel when you got the role to do it and
then to what are some of your favorite
disaster movies that you've been
influenced by well it's so great though
because rawson marshall thurber you know
i think we've kind of not to age
ourselves but we grew up in the same era
right out of the 70s 80s and so the
movies that he loved I mean not only the
disaster ones but things like Raiders of
the Lost Ark and die Han and fugitive
and cliffhanger are the same movies that
I loved so reading it I mean it felt
like a an ode you know a Valentine to
movies from from that era it was an easy
you know it was an easy decision to say
yes and a very emphatic yes to it -
rawson in this movie now the the movies
that I love from that time I mean
obviously Atari inferno you know being
such a seminal piece of work the
Poseidon Adventure you know is great you
know Shelley Winters and then there were
some lesser-known ones that are banal
and ones like the swarm or earthquake or
meteor you know with Sean Connery I love
all of that stuff I mean that was just
terrific
that's really cool and I mean now you
are part of that history which is really
neat that's really neat so in the movie
we talked about how the Pearl is sort of
the sentient building obviously
skyscraper do you in the way of your
role do you did you see any parallels
between sort of how tech companies today
build their products and how in the
movie we kind of have this this tech
product
really it's it's its own tech product
how that building was built well you
know I think everything starts with the
best of intentions right I mean making
this a better world
I think the poll to Jo is basically you
know his own little microcosm of the of
the world at large so you know it's this
idea of what utopia would look like and
obviously that becomes the fortress the
faut Fort Knox in the sky which he calls
it becomes its prison
and I think that you know that's you
know in Silicon Valley in with with
technology as well we start with the
best of intentions like you know with
social media they're meant to bring
people together you know I mean they're
they're you know allowing people miles
apart to to stay connected but it has
become this other thing you know I mean
that no one has foreseen and I think
that you know that kind of development
you know it it it pays to be mindful of
what things can become sure and and then
you know and then we'll see what the
next step of this evolution of this
technology is gonna be yeah it seems
like there's a lot of parallels between
the idealism of Zhao and this building
and the pearl and and tech companies
today tech CEOs feeling very idealistic
about how their products are going to be
used without thinking of the potential
consequences or how it could be turned
against them so I think that's that's
really cool it's like very timely I know
one of the things that is really
important to skyscraper the cast and
crew skyscrapers diversity and accuracy
in diversity and I'd love to hear a
little bit about your thoughts on that
process and being on a set where that
was an important thing well I mean it is
important you know I think that it is
obviously very current and you know is
something that people are talking about
a lot representation and diversity but
there's some there's one other element
that is actually very important as to
why the you know we the accuracy and the
cultural of all the cultural norms and
you once's of the place that is set in
which is Hong Kong are there you know
because when you have
of such a big story you know so epic in
scope and and and you know this giant
building and then you have the the
world's biggest movie star doing the one
thing you want to do with something so
large is is to ground it in reality you
know I mean so that the audiences can
then take this as a jumping off point
and and be invested in these characters
because you know I mean that that's that
that will enhance the movie-going
experience that much more so I think on
the practical level you know in terms of
filmmaking and storytelling I mean it
was an important decision I mean to have
it be grounded in reality
you mentioned Hong Kong as the setting
of the movie and how do you feel the
features and the design of the Pearl
kind of played a role or the setting
played a role in the design of the
building very much so you know I mean I
think that you know Hong Kong is such an
interesting and uniquely landscaped
place you know it's kind of dense a
small is hilly you know and and this
water all rounded and so in the design
of the Pearl basically they're building
a city upwards vertically instead of
horizontally because they don't have the
space so they're building the city
vertically but not only that I mean
rawson had done his research and
together with the production designer
Jim Bissell they used a Chinese a fable
about the dragon and a pearl and so it's
about a boy and a fishing village
jumping into the water finding a pole
transforming go dragon and then
protecting this village base oh wow so
it looks like a dragon you know you know
with a mouth and a prohm at the top of
it and I and and so all this you know
played into the and the you know the
design of the film basically that's
really interesting I didn't know that
that's so cool that is really cool um
okay so if you if the Pearl World real
place where would you spend the most
time uh I would spend the most time at
the spa I mean same same tone
hot stones massage yeah I get that nice
clay room take a nap I get it but you
know I mean as in the movie you will see
that you know that that sphere is it's a
magical place you know it's got these
holographic panels and projections and
stuff it's like a literally like a
funhouse you know and I think that I
would love to be in that space you know
and and observe the landscape from 225
stories up yeah yeah definitely
okay so very last question I think it's
always really important for people out
there especially in Western countries to
learn about new actors who do you feel
is maybe an up-and-coming or the sort of
rock of Asian cinema well I I don't know
about up-and-coming but you know I mean
we have traveled on the with the pressed
tour through Beijing and Hong Kong and
New York and I've seen the way people
respond to them you know they love him
there is something that he connects with
that Dwain connects with with the
audiences with all over the world cross
culturally and this will not the person
that I known and I've met who has that
effect you know and it's Jackie Chan
right yeah you know I mean there's this
there's something about these two
characters that are so accessible and
yet the things they do is so incredible
yeah you know you know Duane with his
physical promised way from you know the
time of his wrestling days and Jackie
Chan really I mean even if you went back
to his older movies like police story or
you know drunken master phenomenal stuff
and so I seen a lot of parallels and I
think those those two actors are you
know there are the legends of our time
really I think they're worth work ethic
touches something in everybody you know
you see that how hard they work all the
time and you're just like if I work that
hard maybe I could do those incredible
things but then there's also something
like you said that intangible magic
where you see them on screen
it's just like wow maybe not maybe if I
work really hard I'll never be able to
do that because that's incredible a
night but it's it's it is some kind of
magic which is really cool it is and
then I will you know full disclosure I
think I don't think that you know any
amount of time in the gym will will get
me to Dwayne's size I think I can agree
with you there and I think that's a
great place and to end our interview
