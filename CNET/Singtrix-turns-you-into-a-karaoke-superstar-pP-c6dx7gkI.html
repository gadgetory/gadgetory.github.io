taking a look at sink trick switch to
turn your voice into the smooth tones of
Barry White or Tinkerbell
or you can harmonize in different
directions you could pitch too and you
can sound fantastic and definitely not
like your regular cell sink tris costs
$2.99 but you're getting two microphones
with that microphone stand being a
speaker in your nice little magic box
that comes with about 300 or more
presets and there's an app that has 3500
songs that are supported in it so you
can change your voice or play around
with different presets to your heart's
content and you can plug in any other
music player and have it work with sync
tricks to sound like a superstar with
whatever song you choose and there's
also a hit button on the microphone that
you can use to trigger effects while
you're singing for an extra bit of oomph
this box has a number of other presets
as well and an effects tuner signors was
created by some of the original creators
of Guitar Hero so there's a little bit
of that game vibe going on too
with this type of karaoke experience
that we're seeing here it's available
now and it's going to start shipping
soon so it's $2.99 if you want to create
your little karaoke superstar set up
sing tricks looks like a pretty good
solution for it I'm Scott Steinberg net
this is the rest of the song that I
don't know very well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
