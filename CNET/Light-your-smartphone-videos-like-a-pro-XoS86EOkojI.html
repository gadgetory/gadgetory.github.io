filmmaker in this episode we're looking
at the lighting tips for the pocket
cameras now it's not going to be rocket
science when we talk about small cameras
to understand that we're working with
really small lenses and small lenses
mean we have very small sensors that are
capturing the light coming in through
that lens now a well-lit shot will give
us great color and great clarity in our
video picture and of course natural
daylight is the absolute best type of
light for us to film with however it's
not always available to us we might
occasionally find ourselves filming
inside or a nice or under a shady tree
outside and each of those instances is
going to give us a different color
temperature to our picture now a quick
way around this when you're filming on a
pocket camera if you don't have a manual
override control is to actually show
your camera something white in the
environment you're standing in so
whether it be outside inside if you have
a back of a t-shirt or a notepad show
that to your camera and it'll
automatically adjust the white balance
to suit the color temperature to white
reflecting off the page now without a
shadow of a doubt one of the biggest
enemies of pocket lighting is backlight
and backlight is very evident where we
film someone say against a bright window
or a doorway and they just appear like a
silhouette in front of great shape the
reason is your pocket camera is simply
exposing for the brightest light source
of the picture but there's ways we can
get around that simply moving your
camera or your subject away from that
heavily back light source will give you
a much better picture or sometimes on a
camera you'll find that is backlight
compensation features which you can
activate as well on some of the newer
smartphones we even find we have a
manual exposure over I such as his Sony
Xperia TX I can actually press this
setting here and go up or down in my
exposure settings which goes a long way
towards compensated for backlight now
another great tip when filling outside
is to avoid mixed lighting and when I
say big sliding
I mean filming your subject in all shade
or all Sun as soon as you start crossing
over the two you get this dappled light
in which your camera will find very
difficult to automatically expose for if
you're filming outdoors a great tip for
getting fantastic even lighting is you
use bounce light to fill in the light in
the shadow side of your picture now to
get nice bounce lighting doesn't have to
cost a fortune in fact you can use a
simple white sheet of cardboard or a
simple twenty dollar reflector that I
found on eBay or I'm a must-have
accessory for pocket lighting is their
LED light pack you'll find these online
on eBay you can buy them really easily
and really cheaply they come in all
different shapes and sizes from square
packs right through to these nifty
little radar lights now rhodolite simply
presses on the front here with a soft
touch button that's powered by two
double-a batteries and it gives it that
beautiful round even soft lighting on
your face which is great for filming
people and portraiture or interviews
before I go check out this great little
pocket film this week it's called cell
phone crashing - now it's gonna put a
smile on your dial it's a little bit
wrong but you're certainly gonna have a
life from your seat
check it out alright when I see you next
time we're going to be looking at
unlikely pocket cameras this is gonna be
a really interesting one you're gonna
want to shoot in four see you there
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
