love it when companies coin new names
for emerging technologies like when
Verizon was unveiled I tell everyone it
meant on the verge of a new horizon now
sprint has zoom it's the new brand name
for their WiMAX mobile internet wimax is
4g wireless broadband really superfast
the service similar to Wi-Fi but it's
more reliable since it uses a licensed
part of the spectrum sprint working with
major electronics makers to build zoom
capabilities into devices like cell
phones laptops and even digital cameras
look for service starting in 2008 first
there was spam and now legit companies
are making bacon the latest silly net
name comes from a brainstorm of tech
geeks at a podcast camp in Pittsburgh

Revolution and ketchup now making a new
name for itself as defining the side
order we're seeing in our inbox every
day bacon is middle class email you know
the Facebook alerts twitter follow

kicks you'd be hard-pressed to find on
anyone else's feet now with nikeid you
can throw away those plans to set up
your own sweat shop no cutting fabric or
stitching here just an easy-to-use

bucks in four weeks later anyone who
really cares about this stuff will be
jealous finally the beta Swahili is
apparently all the rage these days when
it comes to naming new sites must be the
only unread
surnames left so ebay has kijiji and now
Microsoft has two fede what does it mean
do research the site helps people use
the web for research projects that
require more than one sitting there are
ways to search the web news RSS feeds
