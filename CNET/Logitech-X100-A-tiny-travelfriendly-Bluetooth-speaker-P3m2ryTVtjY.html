sized bluetooth speaker that retails for
$49.99 and comes in five color options
I'm not sure why Logitech sent me the
aqua colored one I mean I'm not really
an aqua guy but hey I'm not complaining
hi I'm David Carr noise and welcome to
another CNET video review of a portable
bluetooth speaker as you can see this is
a micro wireless speaker and it competes
with such models as the JBL micro
Wireless and Devon boombox travel
they're all similarly shaped cost around
50 bucks and produce bigger sound than
their tiny size would indicate I like
the hard rubberized finish on the
speaker and it seems fairly durable
though it isn't water-resistant it's got
a little loop on top that allows you to
hang the speaker from a backpack or
doorknob or wherever you can also just
lay it flat and have the single driver
fire upward battery life is rated at 5
hours which seems about average for this
type of speaker and it has speakerphone
capabilities and an auxilary input for
non bluetooth devices it charges via
micro USB I can't tell you that this
model sounds any better than its
competitors the davu travel actually
plays louder but it does sound decent
for what it is and as I said I like the
design some colors the black version for
instance can be had for closer to $40
which seems more like what you want to
pay for the speaker for bigger sound you
can opt for the Logitech X 300 which
retails for $70 it isn't as portable as
this one but it's still quite compact
and has multiple drivers I'm David
Connolly and that's the Logitech X 100
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
