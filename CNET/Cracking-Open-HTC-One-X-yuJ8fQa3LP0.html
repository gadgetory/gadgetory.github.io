windows phone handset HTC is back with
its highly anticipated Android phone the
One X and I can't wait to see what's
inside this Ice Cream Sandwich
powerhouse I'm Bill Detweiler and this
is cracking open given that the 1x and
Titan to look alike and are both from
HTC it seems logical that they would
have a similar internal design and be
cracked open in roughly the same manner
but no unlike the Titan tube which has a
three-piece back cover held on with
screws the One X has a single piece
cover which snaps onto the devices frame
so using a thin metal tool
I started near the bottom of the display
and worked my way along the edges
popping loose the cover as I went after
lifting the display and frame assembly
out of the cover we got our first look
at the phone's hardware and it's
immediately apparent that the One X's
internal design is significantly
different than the Titan twos the main
circuit board is mounted above the
battery and partially protect it find
internal cover the board extends along
the phone's left edge and eventually
meets up with a smaller board that's
used for the docking connector and it
was when removing this board that the
One X reminded me why HTC devices can be
a real pain to crack open and reassemble
instead of conveniently placing the
battery and display assembly connectors
on the side of the motherboard that
faces the phone's outer cover the One
X's designers put connectors on both
sides of the board now this makes it
very difficult to reattach the
connectors when you're putting the phone
back together and it means that you'll
need to remove the motherboard to
replace the battery why HTC did this on
the One X when they didn't do it on the
Titan 2 is just beyond me but enough of
my griping let's look at the rest of the
hardware the One X has a 4.7 inch
display with a resolution of 1280 by 720
an 1800 milliamp hour battery an 8
megapixel rear camera 1.3 megapixel
front camera and a Beats Audio speaker
looking at the chips our US version has
a 1.5 gigahertz dual
or Qualcomm s4 processor one gig of ram
and 16 gigs of storage now this for me
is a bit disappointing when the phones
european variant has a quad-core NVIDIA
Tegra 3 processor but the loss of RAW
processing power may have an upside the
One X's Qualcomm chip contains both the
application processor and a 3G LTE modem
now this eliminates the Tegra 3 s need
for a separate modem given that both
variants have a battery with the same
capacity u.s. buyers may get a little
bit better battery life and as CNET's
Brian Bennett notes the 1x
flies through Ice Cream Sandwich and
HTC's since overlay with oomph and
agility
rounding out the 1 X's other major chips
are an infant Sense 3-axis gyroscope
synaptic touch screen controller and
audience ear Smart voice processor
despite its lack of a quad-core
processor or microSD card slot and my
complaints about its internal design the
One X gives Android fans in the u.s. a
lot to be happy about as of this taping
it's available for $1.99 with a two-year
ATT contract or 629 without to see more
