stage here at cnet 2012 we have an
amazing guess here we know the ladies
love them the fellas got nothing but
love for him LL Cool J in the house make
some noise everybody what's up what's up
there you go all right there's your
microphone everything so we'll be good
to go good good what up everybody how's
it going everything good good good all
right so I'll we had a chance to walk
around this whole CEA CES all the booths
and all sages what you think about that
I thought it was a lot of cool
technology out there a lot of people
that are you know really smart really
creative some of the glasses-free 3d
stuff was cool some of these new glasses
with it you know you can you know cry
and watch a movie all alone that was
pretty cool you know a lot of cool cool
technology what was it that you said
when you saw that asteroid belt at the
LG booth oh I said I said you know in a
couple of hundred years it would be like
Oh what 3d we're going there yeah you
don't I'm saying so but that's later you
don't know that everybody in this crowd
knows that we're gonna do it like
they're gonna have big casinos on Saturn
it's gonna be crazy because we kiss but
we were bored too early that's all that
is now you're involved in tech here we
came here first of all talk about boom
dizzle yeah your audio product yeah well
what here's his the premise and what
boom dizzle is it's a virtual studio and
my thinking you know a lot of times when
I would be in LA or I would be in New
York and my engineer would be in LA or
New York I would get frustrated it's
like hey dag man I want to record
tonight but you know I can't go in the
studio I'd have to go in the studio we
have to email songs back and forth
tracks back and forth etc so what we did
is we created collaborative technology
where let's for example a kid in New
York and a kid in Paris or kid in Orange
County and a kid in Miami can go online
and create music at the same time
collaboratively so they don't have
there's no delay no latency we've solved
all of those problems and they can
actually create in real time and this is
amazing because it won't just be for
professional artists it'll be you know
Becky and Idaho and her friend Buffy off
in college
llnl Amy and every Cisco it'll be like
every uploading dance tracks and
recording music so you know I think it's
the world is getting flatter and flatter
as we know and this won't eliminate
recording studios but it'll definitely
change the way music is recorded forever
now start off kind of as a social music
website that was the launch of it yeah
well a lot of it what we wanted to do in
terms of the social part is just
aggregate a lot of upcoming artists a
lot of demos get a lot of these artists
online bring a lot of these artists to
our site because these are the people
that will want to use the technology
moving forward so we have you know
thousands upon thousands upon thousands
of people signed up already and it's
really exciting because this absolutely
is the future of technology you know
it's it's it you know everyone doesn't
have money for a plane ticket everyone
doesn't have money to do these things so
i just want to show people how this
technology works and show them that it's
real and you know no your honor you want
to show to hang onto i'd love to show
you how it works so this is my man glenn
he's obviously out of town hello Glenn
hey kid can you hit Glenn you guys see
you guys in here Glenn right you can
hear right all right Glenn um you know
i'ma in Paris right now and you're in
Glen Cove Long Island since your name is
Glenn let's uh let's create let's create
a song right now so for example give me
give me a little guitar put a little
guitar on in the session add a little
guitar to the session give me some
guitar now as Glenn is adding this rim
remember as Glenn is adding this he
could actually be playing this music
live so it you know in my case a lot of
the music we make sometimes can be you
know it's not always like sometimes we
use synthesizers etc but you can do this
with live guitars live basis if you're a
grapefruit dead fan or Zeppelin fan you
can still do all of those cool things it
doesn't have to be only hip-hop or only
rap news or anything like that it's for
all kinds of music all of genres you
might be a Leonard Cohen fan and like
his lyrics or something this is good for
you all right okay clan I like that
up you know what this time I want you to
go back to the top go back to the top
and this time I bring bringing some
drums for me when you uh when you play
the guitar so start the guitar and then
give me a little drums with a little
basic cetera can we turn that up a
little bit remember you know I'm a
little kid I'm on punishment my mother
doesn't know I'm on my laptop I'm
upstairs with Johnny I'm creating an
album we're amazing we're going to be
icons in 20 years and mommy thinks we're
upstairs on punishment this is the
future this is the future okay all right
Glenn go to the top now before go back
one more time before you do that let me
let me add a little rap to it and show
them that you can actually record some
vocals on it I don't know these words by
heart so you got to forgive me you know
so if I start hemming and hawing just
you know we'll just rewind it like I do
in my real recording sessions like mama
said knock you out which took 14 times
or get it right but we won't talk about
that right now okay because it sounds
perfect once it's out all right let's go
Glenn give me a little something this is
a song called no more and we it's about
relationships and being on the fence in
a relationship and stuff like that but
uh feel free to write something more
uplifting if you if you feel the need I
need to hear um get me give it to me in
my headphones Glenn let me everything
yeah make sure I can hear it in my
headphones and that you know the vibe is
there make it nice and loud in my
headphones and make it sexy and turn it
up and it turn it up in here so we can
make it great let's go a lot of fun you
know Brian my tech guru it's a gorilla I
can do hooks to trust me you can I do
your thing on you know right down so I
have a little uh a little Brian Brown
over here a little I'm Rio all right
you're right Ryder pry oh right Russia

stuff so whatever if I had a wonderful
unbelievable voice and I you know could

but I can't do that so I'm gonna have
sound again I might have to do with the
cool j way but just imagine i have these
wonderful voice I and here we go you
ready all rights uploading so what
happens is in order for us to configure
it deal with all of the latency issues
everything uploads and then syncs up
perfectly just so you know how things
are working so you know all right now
we're not going to keep it I just you
know it was horrifying I just wanted to
people that you know I just want them to
you know know that it really works but
we're gonna I'm a record this one and
then after our court this one blend will
play this back for the people and show
them that the technology works all right

you know I have to I have to get you in
the basement before we put in front of
Simon you were worried out there you go
see this is amazing and then on top of
it we have Dobie technology Dobby has
actually allowed us to utilize some of
their technology so that the mix and the
sound quality is amazing as well so not
only will you be able to you know record
and actually it's functional but Dobby
has given us their stator to our
technology in term for audio so that it
will sound great so after you record it
you know you can mix it and make it
sound the way you want it to sound the
way was meant to sound and don't be
partnered up with us for that so it's
it's fantastic that was good stuff you
got your thing hey did you did our think
of that thing i did it with the LL Cool
J we hear it for the future technologies
beautiful you can't make this up you
can't make this well I did want to have
a few follow-up questions ok you were
here before you know the internet ever
existed is this something that just
below is your mind the fact that we can
do these things with technology today I
mean this is something could happen all
years ago you know what and I think a
lot of people in this crowd can respect
what I'm about to say it's kind of like
the world is catching up with our
imaginations you know with my
imagination and that intersection
between art and technology between art
and science there's a sweet spot there
and that sweet spot is where creative
people want to live and exist and create
and breathe and make great things happen
and I think we're doing that with boom
tizzle so I thank you guys I think you
for seeing what we're doing you can do
it all around the world and um you know
it's the future and I hope you enjoy and
there are a lot of other great things
that I have in the pipeline so you see
more i'm telling you i'm going to shock
you now there's one last thing okay last
thing rumor on the street has it that
you're an amazing hugger and an amazing
hunger the best hug ever okay I I'd like

brotherly love in the copy you use the
weather cafe left oh yeah you'll see
that goes on out there

technology and dumb and enjoy it it's
really good at all film izle i'll be at
