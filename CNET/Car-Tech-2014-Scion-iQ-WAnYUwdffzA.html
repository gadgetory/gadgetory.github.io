different than my boot it costs about
the same as a good pair too let's drive
the 2014 Scion iQ and check the tech now
the headline on the Scion iQ is very
simple small specifically short it's
about 120 inches long nose to tail 56
inches shorter than a Civic Coupe that's
tiny not quite short enough to park it
you know perpendicular the way a smart
car can however because this guy
ostensibly has seating for four we'll
look into that later now I'll admit when
I get in this thing I feel a little bit
like my name should be bozo and my fuzzy
wig should be touching the roof it's a
little bit of a small cabin in here
not super Cranham is no smart fortwo but
definitely small and very tall and they
emphasize that with the design of the
console a lot of the cues in here say up
right now we have the optional what they
call the bespoke audio system let's run
through some of the features of that
that does give you navigation it's a
basic system but it works well and what
I always look for is does it have quick
response on the touchscreen at least
when you touch the button properly and
it does it's fairly advanced with a
number of different view modes I still
like to DS straight down to be honest
but getting in and out of things is
quick and easy which is great for low
distraction so kudos for inexpensive car
nav rig of course the system also
includes Bluetooth hands-free as well as
bluetooth streaming audio pretty good
display of media as well in fact there
are a lot of expensive cars that don't
do it this well which is kind of a shame
on them you pretty much have all the
greatest hits of modern media here AM
and FM with HD radio available I
mentioned the bluetooth streaming with a
pretty good handling of meta tags and
album art your iPod goes in through a
USB connector as any modern car does
today and in spite of this being a car
for the youngest buyers it's got one of
the oldest media in there it stills a CD
player which we're seeing drop away from
a lot of vehicles but this one still has
it you've also got aha
right here which is going to bring you
streaming internet stations predictive
internet radio stations you know like
Pandora and such you're also going to
bring in the ability to play podcasts
and it's also your social media portal
for Facebook and
now beyond the central screen you don't
have a whole lot going on in the
instrument panel area a simple little
orange Nissan like info display on the
left its LCD speedometer a weirdly
shaped tach and that's it only
transmission on this car is a CVT a
continuously variable gearbox no paddles
or anything like that this is a very
simple basic car and simple and basic is
the word that comes to mind with these
seats as well I've rarely seen
upholstery that looks more like covers
you buy it O'Reilly Auto Parts there's
no stitching
there's no detailing looks like
something you slid over it like a
pillowcase now back here is where a
Scion iQ is quite a bit different than a
smart fortwo back here you've got a
pretty decent cargo bay and seating area
here's the seat area folded down pull
them up and these very very basic little
seats do give you kind of a church pew
or a form school bench this is some
prostate pinching stuff back here you're
never going to find me in these seats
but if you've got some very small
friends or children it'll do in a pinch
you've also got a little smugglers box
back here that passes for a very tiny
little hiding storage area now
underneath what has to be the world's
stubby stud we find one of the world's
smallest engines not that small but it's
down there 1.3 liter inline-4 sitting
sidesaddle driving the front wheels of
course and hooked up to that CVT as I
mentioned the numbers are diminutive as
well 94 horsepower 89 foot-pounds of
torque we don't see double digits around
here in those categories very often
however the weight number goes down with
them just about 2100 pounds I sat next
to a guy on a flight last week away more
than that
therefore the mpg comes out pretty good
thirty-six City 37 Highway 37 average
but notice as small as this car and its
engine are we still don't crack 40 mpg
that's at least psychologically
disappointing now the first little
frustration of driving this car as I put
it in reverse and nothing shows up on
the dash there is no rear view camera
standard or optional in the IQ now
driving this car is I put it this way I
don't mean it to be a backhanded
compliment but I guess it is and that is
is not the worst car I've ever driven
and considering that it's got a very
small engine in a CVT and a low price
tag that's actually a victory for scion
I have driven more expensive cars with
more power and more cylinders that
actually have worse response so good on
them on the other hand something
exhilarating about driving an IQ it
doesn't make any very pleasant noises
though they aren't awful the ride
quality is good these big ugly looking
seats are actually quite comfortable
I've got to give them that as well
looking back over your shoulder you
realize how small a car you're driving
it's not quite as pronounced as a smart
fortwo but you really go whoa when you
turn around where's the rest of it you
have to get used to that and start to
take it as an advantage in parking and
you really can't put this thing on some
small spots you've got a sport mode here
on the gear selector and you know it
doesn't do a whole lot for the vehicle
it holds rpms a little higher and seems
to increase throttle response but again
in a gearless gearbox it doesn't give it
any more bite
now pricing our little snub nose friend
is pretty easy about 16 for bass
delivered the only option to take it
more seen that style is 1198 for that
so-called bespoke head unit that brings
in far more audio options navigation
that AHA support and things of that
nature it's certainly worth the money I
wish there was a backup camera available
at almost any cost but there's not and
that frustrates me you'll logically
cross shop this car against a Fiat 500
or even a smart fortwo
but don't cross shop it against a chevy
sonic for example it's got better mpg
and it's a full serving of car in about
the same price range you have to value
super small urban dimensions for this
car to make sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
