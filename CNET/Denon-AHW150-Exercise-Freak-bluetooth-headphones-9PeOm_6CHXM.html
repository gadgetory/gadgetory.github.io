cnet.com and I'm here with the den on
exercise freak in-ear bluetooth
headphones yes these are wireless
headphones intended for athletic use I
tried them at the gym I wore them on the
treadmill for a few days
they are sweat proof and they are
comfortable once you get them set up
correctly they do look a little bit like
giant hearing aids when you wear them
but they certainly aren't as discreet
they do come in 3 different colors black
blue and yellow they also come with a
nice carrying case and you should
definitely use that carrying case
because these are fairly pricey
headphones at a hundred and fifty
dollars they do sound very good for
bluetooth headphones if you can get a
tight seal these have these articulating
arms with the but at the end of them you
get a few different sized ear tips of
course and hopefully one of them will
fit your ear if you can jam that ear tip
in you can get a lot more bass and the
clarity is pretty decent for Bluetooth
this also has a built-in microphone so
you can use it for cell phone calls
there's a call answer end button right
on the ear and you can reach the volume
controls they're a little bit small I
did like that there's a bit of
cushioning on the inside that makes the
fit a little bit more comfortable it
does give a little bit of breathing room
between your head and the actual device
one other small thing worth mentioning
on the back there is a small silver
piece that does have a bit of reflecting
material on it so if you're running at
night there will be a little bit of a
reflection on these they that back does
flop around a little bit on your neck I
noticed that while I was running but all
in all these were comfortable headphones
I had no problem wearing around for long
periods of time I do think however these
are the type of headphones that people
are either going to love or not like as
much they're not going to fit everyone
equally as well a lot of people don't
necessarily like having that ear tip
really jammed in your ear and that is
essential if you want really good sound
so they did work well for me they do
charge via USB and they give you about
seven hours of battery life that's not
fantastic but certainly good enough to
get you through several days of use I'm
David Carr noise and those are the Denon
