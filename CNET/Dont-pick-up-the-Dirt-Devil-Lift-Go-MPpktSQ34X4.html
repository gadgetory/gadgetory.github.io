today to review the Dirt Devil lift and
go convertible vacuum Dirt Devil is
known for its budget vacuums but this
one for a hundred and thirty dollars
packs in enough features that it almost
makes me think this is a high-end vacuum
unfortunately nope no this is this is
not a high-end vacuum so those features
I was talking about it has a removable
canister vacuum it comes with a couple
of attachments that secure right to the
vacuum itself it even has a wand and
hose that snap right off for easily
reaching the corners and the ceiling but
the most interesting feature is this vac
plus dust tool to clean hardwood floors
this is a Swiffer like pad to dust which
attaches to this which vacuums so you
can dust and vacuum your hardwood floor
at the same time and all of this
attaches right to the wand of your
vacuum so the lift and go tries to do a
lot with all of its stuff but all of
that is undermined by a few glaring
design issues for starters the cord and
the hose try to occupy the same space
you can easily get to one or the other
but not both secondly if you want to
clean the brush roll you can't detach it
meaning you have to flip the vacuum over
if anything gets tangled and pull the
air out yourself well it's still
attached to the vacuum head you also
can't adjust the height of the brush
roll or turn it off meaning this fun
optional attachment isn't optional
anymore and becomes much less fun
because in order to clean hardwood
floors without flinging everything
everywhere you need to bring this with
you and this is the one attachment that
won't store on your vacuum all of this
including the minor gripes I have about
it might be forgivable if it performed
well as a vacuum well unfortunately it
does not we test our vacuums on sand for
small particles Cheerios for large
particles and pet hair on sand it did
worse than just about every other
full-sized upright vacuum
Cheerios it either pushed them aside
occasionally it would fling them and pet
hair it would leave matted clumps all
over the place this works very very well
as a coat rack as a paperweight even
perhaps as a baseball bat as a vacuum
you're going to want to look elsewhere
if you're looking for a budget vacuum
try the Bissell power glide the shark
rotator pro or the Hoover Wintel if you
do end up going with this one just know
that you might need to use other tools
to supplement your cleaning for example
a different vacuum foreseen it I'm a
jerk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
