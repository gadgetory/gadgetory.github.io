today ah there is we've installed a lot
of high-tech gadgets here at the scene
at smart home and one of them is running
up this Bigfoot sized electric bill
that's why we're going to install a
smart energy monitor and get to the
bottom of this
smart home energy monitors let you see
exactly how much electricity your home
is using in real time they can also
pinpoint exactly how much electricity a
particular appliances drawing and maybe
predict how much it'll cost you in the
long run lots of companies are getting
into the smart home energy monitoring
game we chose nerio because we recently
reviewed the device we know how it works
were familiar with its operation but I
have to say it is not easy to install to
matter of fact it can be a little
hazardous but you know what i think our
technical editor Steve Conway can do
this in his sleep I probably could do
this installation and muscly but I sure
wouldn't want to installing the neuro
has you dealing with very high current
levels coming into your house and even
when we shut the main breaker panels off
which we're going to do you're still
going to have to work in areas of the
box where there is active current the
first step is going to be to identify
the two different phases in your box so
you can see that we actually wired into
each one of those phases on our double
pole breaker and ran that back to the
main Yorio device after that the nerio
device also has a white neutral wire run
your white wire from the neuro device to
the breaker bar install it there now you
can see that in our breaker box behind
the main power lines we have a lot of
wires there's not a lot of room to work
in there so what we did is we actually
jumped up to our common box in the
middle where the two main sets of lines
come in to power each of our breaker
boxes and that's where we installed our
sensors finally to install the antenna
for the nerio we use one of the
breakouts on the side of our breaker box
punch it out install the antenna with
the included grommets and then connect
it to our near you and now Brian can see
live energy usage on his phone with
uriel now installed we can see main
sections of the house where power is now
being used we're talking ovens ranges
microwave ovens dishwashers even
powerful coffee makers okay now we're
going to find out exactly which one of
our gadgets is running
the bill wait a minute that doesn't make
any sense do we check the bathroom
what are you doing in here what is all
this stuff you're using this take
selfies you know i'm just going to cost
us for electricity one second</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
