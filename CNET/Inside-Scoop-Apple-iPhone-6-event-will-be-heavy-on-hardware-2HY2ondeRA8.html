need us joining me is tim stevens
editor-at-large for cnet Tim you have a
invitation a coveted invitation to
attend the apple event we are now at t
minus one day it's happening tomorrow
and there have been a flurry of leaks in
the i would say last you know 72 hours
let's talk about what we know for sure
and then let's let's get to these leaks
you know we're gonna see iphones right
16 yeah we're expecting two new iphones
one in a 4.7 inch size which will
probably be the new iphone 6 not bigger
than what we've got now my point 7 inch
to increase over before so quite a bit
larger than before and it should be
thinner as well because once you make
phones larger in that dimension you can
then make a mold of thinner but still
offer the same battery life so it should
be a nice upgrade in that regard thinner
probably even lighter than the car phone
despite being bigger I'm hoping it's
stronger because I've been cracking my
screen I know we're not gonna see
sapphire glass right that's pretty much
off the table but when I hear thinner
and larger I think Snapple yeah that's
definitely a big challenge I mean
obviously a thicker device gives you a
lot more torsional rigidity so it
resists that sort of twisting a thinner
device can Apple deliver the same sort
of strength so hopefully we'll sweet
we've seen some chassis leaks and things
look pretty solid but you know you never
know until you get in your pocket and
sit on it they are known for having a
pretty solid product okay so beyond the
iphone the other thing that people are
hoping for expecting is the iWatch right
we even know that it's gonna be called
in i watch no we actually haven't seen a
solid leak on the name yet i think
everyone's just assuming it's gonna be i
watch which is a pretty catchy name but
we're actually expecting multiple
wearable devices possibly two different
models so maybe they'll be two different
names or maybe we'll be on watch now I
watched light on we really haven't seen
any indication but we're definitely
expecting to see apples entry into the
wearable market tomorrow finally after
so many years of waiting okay any leaked
images that seem more credible than the
other stuff we did see some chassis
leaks or sort of supported chassis leaks
just this morning some supposed CAD
schematics that show what the case looks
like it's a rectangular a rounded
rectangular device there's actually a
lot of debate online about their
legitimacy they may actually just be a
test case to hold the actual i watch
within it which would mean we still know
what that I watched shaped like so not
exactly very legit just yet we still
don't know
exactly what it's going to look like it
what how exactly is gonna work questions
leading to question there's still some
intrigue for tomorrow which is good yeah
and a lot of intrigue surrounding this
white structure that's been built right
next to the flint center right what is
what's your best guess well I think
we're gonna see a lot of people here
tomorrow so probably gonna give us a
little bit more room but I think we'll
see a lot more with health getting home
kit home get in particular going to give
you more connectivity for appliances and
things like that in the home and maybe
you will even see some new stuff with
car place so maybe they'll be maybe a
Ferrari f12 parked on the show floor
tomorrow morning that we can get get a
demonstration of car play one can hope
if there are two new phones and the
smaller of the newer phones is 4.7
inches in terms of screen size do we
know the dimensions of the larger phone
we're thinking 5.5 which would give it a
size right on the size of the new note 3
something like that so yeah definitely a
large phone we're definitely a phablet
territory we are and what's that going
to enable you to do it gives you more
resolution and we're expecting it to
have kind of like an iPad style
interface at least if you hold the phone
sideways so for example if you're in the
calendar app you'd get your agenda on
the left and then you'd actually have
the traditional calendar view on the
right so more work more visible space
and more of a professional feel I think
all right so we know you're gonna be
there you're going to be live-blogging
we'll be live-blogging it's gonna be
pretty exciting we're gonna be typing
away myself and char are gonna be giving
you the blow-by-blow there will be a
live video stream so you can watch that
too but you always want some commentary
to go with your sports right ok we'll be
there with a commentary excellent Tim
Stevens thank you so much thank you for
