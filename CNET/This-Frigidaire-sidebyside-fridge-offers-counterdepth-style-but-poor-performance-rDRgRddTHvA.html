here with the Frigidaire Gallery FG HC 2
3 3 1 PF and this is a counter-depth
side-by-side refrigerator and counter
depth means that it isn't quite as deep
it's not going to stick out beyond your
cabinets that gives it a more
streamlined and flush appearance that a
lot of homeowners like but you also have
a little less interior space the grand
total is 20 2.2 cubic feet 14.2 of which
are allocated to the fridge that's not
great by a standard side by side metrics
but compared to other counter depth
models it's pretty par for the course
now isn't par for the course is the
price tag at $1600 this fridge is about
as inexpensive as counter depth models
get so if you're looking for that flush
appearance in your kitchen this might be
where you start your hunt however I
don't think this fridge is a very good
performer you take a look at this heat
map you see all those orange regions 8
out of the 11 total regions we tested in
the fridge came in above 40 degrees
Fahrenheit that's the temperature where
you start to see Listeria and meat and
other bacteria you don't want even
cranking the fridge down to 33 degrees
it's a minimum setting you still have an
orange hot spot there in the main body
of the fridge up at the top that's just
not a good result not an acceptable
result frankly the features of this
fridge leave a lot to be desired as well
you see that kind of a bare-bones
interior you do get this chilled drawer
here that has a vent in the back of cold
air piping directly into it you can
adjust it with that slider and crank it
a few degrees up or a few degrees down
but it's not precise doesn't give you a
number and again the fridge is so
inaccurate to begin with that this
doesn't make a whole lot of difference
there's also this shelf here in the
middle that slides out to give you
easier access to items in the back of
the fridge I like that feature but
there's just too much friction here it's
kind of hard to use it sticks as you use
it especially if anything heavy is
sitting on top all-in-all the price is
pretty enticing here if you want a
counter depth model this is one of only
a handful you can get for less than
2,000 but like I said the performance is
just not up to snuff so I'd probably
pass and spend my money on something
else for more check out my full review
at cnet.com and filled your fridge
questions my way on twitter we're seeing
that appliances I'm right Chris
