has landed let's take a look
Oh
Oh we're back we're back in the scene
that cave live was seeing that live here
with the posse across me the lovely Lexi
savita's Steven Beach I'm running the
show because he's mr. octopus eight arms
you don't you only see two of them you
only see two of them but he runs this
show by himself and our lovely producer
executive Research Forum here in the
corner she doesn't want to be shown body
Ganon's in the house all right
welcome everybody to seen that alive we
are here to talk about Google i/o we do
want to start off and give you a nice
juicy picture from the Shoreline
Amphitheatre in Mountain View where the
keynote will be held at 10:00 a.m. we've
got a cool hipster bounty in his head on
the large screens but I think he's like
doing something with like a tablet or a
keyboard or a phone right there he's
playing some music he's doing digital
he's doing digital music right there
apparently it's absolutely insanely loud
that's what I was over the report it was
like lost you were there last year I was
there and it was deafening I was like
what is this what's the deal wasn't
there like a bird poopy incident oh
also that's what birds flying around so
it's Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain
View it's an open space that have a lot
of live concerts there and there was an
incident of several birds leaving their
droppings like seagulls are keep
whooping on people right but yeah you
avoided that I did avoid it it was good
luck so I mean supposed to be good luck
right sorry
so yes everybody welcome to the show
this morning we are here to talk about
everything Google that we are expecting
to see here obviously the Google
assistant in my mind's gotta be really
the flagship thing that we see here
amongst everything else for developer
stuff but we want you all to be a part
of the show how do you do that all right
so there's many ways to interact and be
a part of this shindig we call here CNET
live first of all call us we want you to
be a part of this the number one eight
eight eight nine hundred cien ET or two
six three eight or CNET CNET so one
eight eight nine hundred cien ET call us
we have our lovely Danielle who will
take your calls put us on hold and may
put you on hold and we need friends okay
I thought this calls for saying my
friends
everybody needs a friend so we want to
hear you know what you're expecting to
see what you want to see if you have
questions for us about Google i/o um we
can do that but let's kind of jump in
here and talk about the Google assistant
I think it's really the leading thing we
they showed it off last year we have it
on the pixel it is at the moment in my
mind and probably you're still the best
virtual assistant out there right now we
have Google's hooks um what are some of
the things that you're hoping to see or
just Google assistant in general what
are your thoughts miss Lexi so last year
at i/o the assistant was revealed as
Brian said and we saw an amazing
demonstration of how you could have a
seamless conversation with the
assistants so I think there was a family
going about their everyday life you know
just chilling in the kitchen and they
decided they want to go and see a movie
and so they had this conversation with
the home and the assistant where they
could actually talk and say hey I want
to go see this movie what are some movie
times and it would respond and it'll say
who's starring in that you know movie
I'd actually want to book some tickets
if you try and do that with the
assistant today well good you can't you
can't you can't so I'm hoping that one
year on Google is going to show us
something exciting about the assistant
involving a more conversational approach
rather than having to go okay google
tell me what movies are on near me and
then okay Google and then Google
assistant will go
yeah don't have any answers boy I don't
understand your request because that's
what happens all the time when I use my
Google fire.the the demo and beaches on
the dock I think it's actually the first
video link sundar pichai like showed off
how super conversational was in a
premade video where he first asked like
who's the director of the revenant it
showed the dry I can't remember the
director's name off the top of my head
he showed the director then he said um
one of them you know what other movies
has he directed
what about family movies but it was a
super organic way of talking you can
kind of get maybe one level in with
Google assistant and it does a lot of
other amazing things but it wasn't
nearly as conversational as natural and
organic as they showed in the demo and
that's what we're hoping to see I think
also with the Google assistant even
though it is number one at the moment
obviously the AI space virtual assistant
space there's tons of competition we
have echo we have Cortana series on the
fringe but they're going to work on it
but it's still on the fringe and
I think Google whatever they do to show
us the new hooks and the things that
they have they want to take another leap
ahead they don't want to start they
don't want to be part of that pack there
they need it show us another jump
because they have the lead definitely
miss Bixby on that oh yeah sorry you're
right you're right yeah Bixby yeah I
mean even though on the s8 obviously
we're not getting that entire full
functionality that we were promised it's
still something that's coming and
Samsung's invested heavily in viv that
other virtual assistant is very
conversational and very Intel supposedly
intelligent in that way
so Google really needs to step up their
game and also I have to say this IO has
been the fewest rumors yeah the forehand
so in terms of us kind of having a
concrete idea of what's coming from
Google there have been hardly any leaks
on the bandwagon so that's one of two
things either Google's got really good
in locking down all of their leaks or
there's not going to be anything
interesting no hope it's I hope as a
forum I really yeah absolutely so we
have Google i/o and then Beach can you
leave the number on the bottom we have
someone call but then they just dropped
off so if you guys and gals that are
watching want to join us in conversation
you can the other thing about the Google
assistant is how it relates to the home
last year we saw the home actually debut
at Google i/o I really don't think they
necessarily have to release a new piece
of hardware we've seen how the echo
itself is the same at least the original
echo the tall larger one the 179 one is
still the same form factor they actually
haven't update anything they came out
the echo dot and now the echo look and
the Astro show so they have a whole
family of stuff that quite honestly
serves different purposes I don't think
we really need to see a new Google home
we just need to see advancements to the
assistant they've already improved the
assistant on the Google home to be able
to support up to six users recognize you
know for the most part we haven't we I
don't I don't think anyone's really
thoroughly test enough to be how well
does it really make a distinction
between six different people on a day to
day basis that would be something that
maybe a tech website that makes videos
could possibly do I want to experiment
and see who could do who could will
could do that I want to try and fool it
with different exit oh yeah exactly I
want to see if it can understand me
doing an American accent or you doing an
Australian accent
exactly faster whatever I think it would
be fun III could do Bill Detweiler Zack
cent if he's watching he's uh from our
Kentucky team so but I won't
but yeah haha he'll be he will not he
will not like that no well he would you
like it so Google home again this is
going to be all about the assistant but
another thing is that and now the phone
lines are completely filled so we will
get to those is awesome we're going to
get Danielle to jump on those but
another thing about just the Google
assistant is sundar pichai has made it
clear that they want this assistant to
be everywhere it's you know really
interesting alliances obviously the
phone the pixel is kind of its debut and
it it was a successful debut but it can
get better like we talked about
appliances they just made a deal with GE
that's gonna be like packed in their
into their appliances but beyond that
and you know we can talk TVs cars I mean
this is the future everyone's talking
about is a I so are there any other
devices that you know that you'd like to
see it in or one well funnily enough
because of the whole the one of the
agreements that we do have is that maybe
the assistant is coming to iOS now this
this would be a big deal if we've said I
mean Google has traditionally been
really good in pushing out things to iOS
first such as the G board the Google
keyboard a lo got a bunch of or sorry
not a low there was some other chat apps
from Google like duo they can put us
everything is pretty much cross-platform
on Google so they're not too worried
about keeping everything locked into the
Android world unlike Apple who tries to
keep everything in the iOS world so I
think it's a possibility that we might
see the assistant on iOS devices I don't
know exactly how it would work and I
don't know if this is going to be the
unveiling of it but I know Google is
very much open to the idea and as you're
saying before Sundaya has talked about
having the assistant across multiple
devices
maybe iOS is one of them I would love to
hear from you guys if you think that the
assistant is something that's likely to
come to iOS Apple devices let us know
give us a call
jump on the hashtag see net live Daisy
no lie and also we have to talk about
the most important thing that is going
to be possibly revealed today which is
the name of Android Oh Android Oh
oh don't loop that in any type of gif
and send it to me on Twitter all right
Oh loop it and send it to him all right
so you know what let's get to some calls
because we've got we've got a bunch on
the line let's say let's see what we've
got here I'm just gonna take this live
welcome to Cena live this is Brian and
Lexi and Stephen who are we talking to
hi my name is Justin
whatup Justin were you calling from I'm
come from Arizona you don't know like
big fans like oh my gosh this is so
surreal Justin just round of applause my
man this is this is surreal this is so
real to me but surreal to you you know
what I'm saying so what's up let's talk
what's going on what's in your brain
okay what's in my brain so my question
is you would think they will show with
Google pick food too and what features
would you want there okay so I hate to
break it to you they could surprise us
again Lexie alluded the fact that they
haven't really there really have been
very few leaks here about the convention
sorry the announcement here so that's
exciting and it really is a developer
conference or software but if you fall
along to kind of what they did last year
they show it off you know the latest
flavor Android they showed off the
assistant but they all the pixel in like
October September October I think it was
October and so our hunch is really that
they're probably going to do the same
thing people that have watched my stuff
I was a huge fan of the pixel I mean
it's it's my work phone the other thing
about it is it was Google's first entry
into the phone world and they came out
strong with the best camera in the
industry and the best virtual assistant
so by having those two you know those
two leading edge techs in their phone
I've got a hope that they still keep
those edges intact work on the form
factor even more but again I don't
expect us to see anything here in at
Google i/o I think it's unlikely that
we'll see hardware in terms of the pixel
- I mean there there have been
speculation about what it might possibly
have obviously a faster processor I
would like to see Google start to
integrate some of their tango technology
into their own phones rather than having
other manufacturers like Lenovo and Asus
trying to put it in other phones like um
we have the fab 2 Pro and as the other
as Suzanne thrown on the
market the only to tango enabled phones
and I know Google's trying to be pushing
tango quite a lot but Justin I want to
know like if there was a pixel to being
announced today what sort of features
would you want to see did he hang up
oh we lose you Justin oh say night sorry
I think I think something's going on
with our phone lines but I mean I'm
gonna take the next call and see what we
got out there the fact that Google right
now has a low
he has hangouts and also has Google
Voice to send text messages or or use
your phone to take you dropped out you
it's okay it's okay up top let's go here
let's go here hold on one thing we have
someone holding welcome to CNET live
this is Brian Lexi and Stephen what's
going on oh hey hi what's question you
have for us welcome to the show what's
your name where you from I know I'm
coming from England right now whoo we
like that what's your question I want to
know if they're gonna bring em enjoy
decision to iPhone well that's the rumor
yeah you know we know that Google the
Google app is on the iPhone there's
plenty of people including our own
Stephen Beecham who use the Google app
for your search right constantly all the
time on your iPhone yeah I used to use
old now all the time also it was very
helpful so to us it's an just seen how
historically Google has built apps and
developed for the Apple platform and
knowing that come on you can't ignore
the fact that there's this huge iOS
community hundreds of millions of users
it's going to get there we just we have
heard the rumor it might show up here it
would be smart fortwo so most likely yes
but we'll see yes it would be really
cool if there's a way to get it to be
used outside the app that they're able
to negotiate some contract with Apple
that would that would be a dream come
true if Apple would be like hey Google
why don't you just take over Siri
instead like right you can have your you
can choose your default search engine on
you choose your default voice assistant
but unfortunately the way that Apple
works
that will never happen because Apple is
all about their platform that they had
built Siri for a reason if you recall
Siri was really the first first virtual
assistant on any phone that was a thing
that they made like we're proud of this
it never developed that much more it's
getting hooks in the third-party apps
finally how many years later from the
forests own also we'll see how that all
shakes out but thanks talking much for
calling all right all right appreciate
it
okay bye we'll see ya all right we're
gonna take is Scott on the line right
now
he is Scott is on the line but he needs
to turn on this video okay so I wanted
there you turn on your video Scott hey
hey Scott can you hear us what happened
you saying it it goes on I don't see you
oh there you are I got you now
alright ladies and gentlemen boys and
girls Scott Stein in that fixie fixing
his hair from Mountain View hair yeah
just just make sure the quoc hey I make
sure the coop is tight you make sure the
coop is tight alright
ah there's Andrew Gebhart hey so from
our smart home team Andrew Gebhardt over
there there's Richard you new here and
is that Jess and it's Jessica and we've
done indicating Scott's here who is who
I'm here and Google IO is here we've got
a big amphitheatre full of stuff and
behind me is the collaborative bubble
making app experience there's always
something like you can blog in it you
could add bubbles is what she's doing
right now she's doing the bubbles on her
phone huh
we're seeing it was out alive Anna oh my
gosh
this is this is this is like Billy's
people doing bubbles yeah these are like
fans from the Warriors game yesterday
they were so bored at that 36 point
blowout they were just on their phone I
saw that I was there that's you about
time we're gonna do the wave soon I'm
sure we like the new wave there's a lawn
back back there people can sit all the
way back on the lawn if you want to do
and the bubble I don't know last year
was like paper airplanes
those are trance music there's like live
kind of trancey music that's really loud
nice what about what about the birds
Scott have there been any incidences
last year at i/o there were a lot of
birds flying around and a lot of
unexpected droppings happening is that
happening this year so above me right
now is a large canopy that that canopy
nice for you looks fun dropped their
poop that was a poop sent home last year
and it's right above us right now and
it's bird free so that's that's that's
really good news that's the best news um
we don't know if the birds are put off
by the trance or whether they're going
to return when it gets a little armored
during the keynote and surprise us with
pellets well nice work it's all part of
the I imagine is France prize Hey hey
Scott I'm so far real quick your phone
is kind of breaking up but so we want to
kind of get your thoughts in just
because it's a little harder to hear
anything that you feel we've talked
about in here but kind of the thing that
will stand out the most at Google i/o in
your opinion sure so I think obviously
we're gonna hear a lot about answering
but I think beyond that how Google is
attacking AI that is a continually
interesting and globally of interest
thing that Google is involved the
machine learning AI how what they're
going to do with it how will it affect
their apps how will affect things like
everything from YouTube to cameras to
smart homes stuff so that's interesting
and I'm curious about VR and AR I know
it's died down a bit this year but it
was a lot of investments in virtual
reality even beyond daydream also AR
they have that tango camera and they
also are maybe going to blend those into
things kind of like hololens so what's
going on with that we're going to hear a
little bit today and there's a whole
keynote tomorrow just about the RNA are
and then you know again like what's
what's going on with the Android what's
going on with them after Android like
Google assistant you know School
assistant going to end up in the post
app world going to replace what we do
within Android or is Google going to
continue spreading on to other devices
that are not just an Android you know
iPhones and you know Brad
and all the other things that they do so
that's the most interesting stuff to me
maybe we'll see some other crazy things
like robots I don't know you never know
there's always that interesting area
though in IO that has all the
experimental the developers that are
working on crazy stuff you probably
haven't got to see it yet but I'm really
looking forward to seeing what
everyone's been doing the experimental
crazy stuff over at Google IO so I'm
looking forward to seeing you hopefully
can do Facebook live or something take
us through there a bit later on
yeah well connected after this at all
dumps to do crazy like festival area
mamasan boxes and like Lexi was saying
it's like it could be anything
so sometimes it's art projects sometimes
it's like demoing apps and we don't know
so that's going to be like later today
and the days to come so it'll be really
fun we'll definitely tune in with all
the weird and tonight with some of the
weird stuff in the party including
whatever musical performances light
shows and and experimental things they
might have though wasn't it like a rave
last year or something like that is
something like that is like EDM it was
like drunk medium yeah we were a hula
hooping there was like a pirate ship
Skip's truck with a klezmer band type
thing there was a tango acquits shooting
game where was like a virtual arcade
there was a trance Seas type meditation
room with VR where you could create art
I tried to create art and then and I was
not supposed to be on stage
I got massive please get off z9j I do
not go there yes I didn't know somebody
I think Jessica told me to do that so it
was her fault alright well hey hey Scott
thanks so much for thanks so much for
calling in and a buckle in will be
you'll be starting about ten more
minutes so we'll be good to go and
thanks for all yeah thanks for all your
work and dedication thank you thank you
for all your work and dedication and
we'll be tweeting you live and covering
it so stay tuned we're just gonna eat
hug this out okay you want out you want
to eat here give us an e hug give us an
e hug Scott oh very oh yeah that that is
actually where my head Nestle's it
Nestle's in your neck when we hug is
that okay it's totally okay awkward it's
2017 that is totally okay nothing wrong
whatsoever it seems yeah it's comfy it's
it's comfy that's good all right Scott
he's here bro okay thanks bye all right
there you go Scott Stein in the house
we're gonna jump in we're having a few
issues with the phone line so if you
called and you were dropped come back in
we're working it out so we have a bunch
of calls in here um we're sorry to
Justin who got cut off a little earlier
but um bro we got nothing but love for
you okay so let's get jumping in here
let's take this next call mr. Channing
welcome to the show you're on scene that
live hi prime what's up well you're here
with Lexie and Steven um if you turn the
volume of your computer down a little
bit then you'll be able to hear us and
then we can just jump right into it are
you good to go yeah do you think Rafi is
Chromebook features Oh that'll be and
you know what it remains to see how much
of Chrome OS they'll even show us
there's there has been quite honestly
not much buzz around it at all leading
into Google i/o I know that we're
hearing a lot about AI um we'll see
because also the Chromebook space great
for education it hasn't necessarily
taken off in the consumer space and this
is a developer place damn I got imagine
they have all these um kind of separate
developer workshops that they most like
you might even show more there than they
will at Google i/o but this is a good
reason to tune in because we don't know
if they'll actually show off anything
related to Chrome OS or how much they'll
show and Microsoft recently announced a
bunch of Education laptops like the the
surface laptop that is basically going
to take try and take over some of that
Chromebook market it was in education so
I think Google obviously has this on the
radar I don't know as Brian said if
we're going to see it today but stay
tuned because you never know what
they're going to surprise us with during
the keynote
all right Channing yeah I can I talked
to Brian the Bridger carry you could if
she was here she's in New York so we'll
send her she's probably watching and you
want to if you have a personal message
for her this is your time like you will
never get another chance so what would
you like to say to her but she's awesome
Channing you're awesome yes you're
you're awesome
oh you're awesome all right - anything's
Apple but on Thursday Oh always bro I'll
be there for you I'm gonna give you a
shout out all right to my boy Channing
we'll catch you later man okay thank you
awesome all right let's go over here
we've got Ritchie and Belize is that
correct Ritchie are you playing with us
no I'm beneath Wow Wow I guess it is
that makes sense this is this thing
called the Internet the world wide web
spread far and wide
wait Fran this is this is Brian you
can't can you tell oh my gosh man I mean
it's been my dream talk to you
personally man Richie let's get lit
before before this gets awkward between
us um
what right right yeah I know you know we
got to keep it cool right Google i/o
what do you want to talk about well they
just want to know exactly what's gonna
happen you know software-wise will
probably see something new you know the
new updates but person that you know any
any new changes like anything new
anything is real or any rumors are gonna
just pop up out of nowhere you know I'm
just skeptical and whether I should go
to Google or not oh so are you and are
you telling me that you're an iOS user
and you're you want to jump over but
you're just not sure what they're going
to show you that is convincing enough
for you is that where you're at yes yeah
that's where I am I'm using the iPhone
service and I thought Eagle pixel but
you know it looks okay but I'm not
convinced so if I know if maybe what
you're going to do today kind of
convinced me to switch to Google Wallet
Lexi lead with this and then see if I'll
pick up the scraps well let's let's see
obviously I mentioned a little before
that Google is starting to bring a lot
of features across to iOS so maybe you
don't even need to transition if you
want just features like possibly
assistant you have access to all of the
google chat apps hangouts gol oh the
Google keyboard the Google Search app
the Google app itself everything you
could probably want in terms of a
software side
on Google you can pretty much get on iOS
now it comes down to the hardware and we
saw the pixel totally smash the iPhone 7
when it comes to the camera quality the
hardware itself in terms of the physical
form factor I wasn't a huge fan of the
pixel when it first when I first handled
it but it's definitely growing on me
so it Brian's pointing to it he's in
love with it he's in love with it I
think it's a great it's it's a really
nice feeling pony definitely grew on me
and that blue color I love and it was
their first phone for the record
Google's first actual you know designed
like their second one is gonna be sick
I think I think they're gonna surprise
but continuing I'm sorry I don't know
that was that was pretty much my thought
I want to hear what you think in terms
of transitioning is is Google gonna
reveal something that's gonna make Apple
users go yeah I'm going I'm going
Android I'm going Android know every you
know what it is is this is really more
of a Developers Conference anyway so
this is all about software
I like developer conferences because it
tends to show us the stuff that we'll
actually be able to do hardware is
always hardware it really comes down to
the platform you align with and like
Lexi said you could basically Google out
your phone your iPhone if you wanted to
your mail like every right you can live
in the Google ecosystem while being in
the Apple ecosystem that's one of that's
one of those rare instances where it
actually works I think if you might be
some people let's be honest get bored of
iOS and I've got to tell you like the do
Android once they went to material
design it is flatter but it just feels
really clean it's it's just a really
clean OS that I enjoy and so I think
they can show us more things like that
they've already rolled out you know the
Developer Preview Android Oh we'll see
more of that today I think all the
secrets are really there I don't know if
they're gonna give us much more I think
they'll probably be actual
demonstrations of some of the features
they announced for example Android oh
one of the big things as picture-picture
and I we didn't see that on the
Developer Preview I loaded that onto a
Nexus phone and I was like oh it can't
wait to play with picture-in-picture no
it doesn't work so hopefully we're going
to see some actual demonstration of the
demonstrations of that and a few little
nuggets of extra surprises I'm looking
forward to seeing how they kind of get
us excited about Android
is really the big thing is it's going to
improve your battery life and that's not
sexy I mean it is important it's
important but it's not like wow I can
have this amazing demonstration look
everybody my battery lasted the whole
day like it's like if you're gonna
impress me with battery life it needs to
be two day battery life and not one day
double-double that baby so um Richie I
don't know if we answered your question
but I feel like look the I the next
iPhone is coming out on the fall the
pixel two is coming down on the fall so
you got decisions to make bro yeah I
mean at this point I'm very like reliant
on the rumors that are going around I
mean the iPhone late it sounds like a
dream phone but I also want to see what
Google has up their sleeve what what are
they friends over there goes to meet and
to win more customers for their
ecosystem yep good man you know keep
your mind open with tech I I think it's
funny when people accuse me of being
paid off by both Samsung and Apple
I'm staying off by everybody I'm still
trying to figure that out because of my
wallet my wallet ain't getting bigger
from either of those two companies let
me tell you right now all right thanks
for calling Richie we appreciate it take
care of buddies all right all right no
problem thank you
okay so right now time time check the
keynote is expected start in a couple
minutes we have literally four calls on
the line we've gone the call situation
figured out I'm gonna jump over to
Travis right now he's been waiting the
longest sorry no no no I didn't I don't
know I pressed the wrong thing Travis
and Marilyn what's up my man good good
thanks for calling me
Lexie Steven in the house what do you
want to talk about hopefully we get you
in before the keynote starts okay great
great
um just two quick things um do you think
that Google will ever come up with a new
tablet this year
[Laughter]
talk about one and also do you think
that we will get a snippet of how uh
Anjali Oh we'll handle fragmentation I
you know do first of all two great
questions
in regards to the tablet we know they
have the pixel see my hunch just based
on how the tablet industry is there they
don't I don't know if there's
necessarily compelling reason for them
to just also and here's our newest
tablet I think
pixal see is more than capable it has
that great you know kind of the keyboard
case setup that you can use I just don't
because the tablet market isn't hasn't
grown anymore it just continues to
decline I don't know if it makes sense
for companies if they have a good enough
tablet to release a new one
I don't know it yeah I agree and on the
fragmentation front that's a really
interesting question androids had a lot
of problems obviously they've
acknowledged this over the years
recommendation across devices if you
just have a look at like how many people
are currently running nougats it's like
three percent something really really
low under ten it's definitely definitely
under ten so it's and like google has a
lot of work to do I don't know if
necessarily Android o is going to be
able to address it in terms of kind of
one whiz-bang feature that's going to do
that because I think it's really going
to be something about that Google has to
kind of band all the manufacturers
together in order to get from
fragmentation to not be as big of an
issue it's a really good luck yeah good
luck it's just the nature of how Android
was and it's why Android is the largest
you know platform on phones because they
were able to get into so many developers
I just think it's kind of the the Curt
the blessing and the curse of the
direction that you choose that no matter
what like she said nougat is less like
with less than ten percent right that's
pretty low for a phone platform to be up
to date and I don't think that's going
to change anytime soon even with Android
oh all these manufacture you the new
stuff you need new hardware to run this
new stuff and it only androids on phones
that are still being used from five six
years ago that will never run nougat so
I just think the nature of what they've
accomplished to get it out there it's
gonna be always be fragmented even the
carrier relationships oh yeah to get it
on the latest phone at the same time
that Google releases it makes it hard
and I think because Google got into the
phone game with a pixel they're trying
to get people to really get a pixel
phone oh and so that's I think if you if
you jump on that side of the hardware
and you're like yeah you know what
Samsung I love the look but I want
something that I can update all the time
and be on top of it I think they're
really trying to push the hardcore
Android users to get a pixel phone for
this coming year so that's that's
alright all right Travis thanks so much
for calling my man we really appreciate
that thank you all right take care you
too alright um how are we doing with the
keynote is it start
you know they're still okay so then no
one's on stage talking at the moment
okay so again you'll stick with us we
will show the live stream of Google i/o
after the show we will be back people
are still standing up so it looks like
nothing has started yet um we're gonna
take another call here and if we have to
jump into it we will jump into it
we've been waiting patiently waiting
jari what's up Jerry
this is Jerry yes oh joy here I'm sorry
I'm sorry Jer welcome to the show
get us your question because we want to
make sure we get in before the keynote
starts no problem so the only question I
have is about the the dual application
versus hangout versus a low yeah do you
think do you think that Google will do a
better move on trying to centralize this
application into one that would do best
the word you use exactly is centralize
it they need to do that I think their
hangouts product that was turned out
more until kind of like their version of
slack so I don't I think they're gonna
keep that separate we'll see if Google's
doing a low combine but we'll see that
we might find out about that today so
we're gonna jump into the keynote looks
like they're starting it Gyre thanks for
calling and we will be back after this
to wrap things up with CNET live lexi in
the house Stephen Beecham and see you
call back then alright no problem
drinking Fung all right take care
good morning welcome to Google i/o I
love you guys too
can't believe it's one year already it's
a beautiful day we've been joined by
over 7000 people and we are
live-streaming this as always - over 400
events in 85 countries last year was a
tenth year since Google i/o started and
so we moved it closer to home at
Shoreline back where it all began
seems to have gone well I checked the
Wikipedia entry from last year there
were some mentions of sunburn so we have
plenty of sunscreen all around it's on
us use it liberally it's been a very
busy year since last year no different
from my 13 years at Google that's
because we've been focused evermore on
our core mission of organizing the
world's information and we are doing it
for everyone and we approach it by
applying deep computer science and
technical insights to solve problems at
scale that approach is served us very
very well this is what has allowed us to
scale up seven of our most important
products and platforms to over a billion
monthly active users each and it's not
the not just the scale at which these
products are working users engage with
them very heavily YouTube's not just s
over a billion users but every single
day uses watch over 1 billion hours of
videos on YouTube Google Maps every
single day users navigate over 1 billion
kilometers with Google Maps so the scale
is inspiring to see and there are other
products approaching the scale we
launched Google Drive five years ago and
today it is over 800 million monthly
active users and every single week there
are over 3 billion objects uploaded to
Google
drive two years ago at Google i/o we
launched photos as a way to organize
users photos using machine learning and
today we are over 500 million active
users and every single day users upload
1.2 billion photos to Google so the
scale of these products are amazing but
they're all still working up their way
towards Android which I'm excited as of
this week we crossed over 2 billion
active devices of Android as you can see
that the robot is pretty happy - behind
me so it's a privilege to serve users of
this scale and this is all because of
the growth of mobile and smartphones but
computing is evolving again we spoke
last year about this important shift in
computing from a mobile first to a AI
first approach mobile made us reimagine
every product we were working on we had
to take into account that the user
interaction model it fundamentally
changed with multi-touch location
identity payments and so on similarly in
AI first world we are rethinking all our
products and applying machine learning
and AI to solve user problems and we are
doing this across every one of our
products so today if you use Google
search we rank differently using machine
learning or if you're using Google Maps
Street View automatically recognizes
restaurant signs street signs using
machine learning duo with video calling
uses machine learning for low bandwidth
situations and smart reply in a low last
year had great reception and so today we
are excited that we are rolling out
smart reply 2 or 1 billion users of
Gmail it works really well here's a
sample email if you get an email like
this the machine learning systems learn
to be conversational and it can reply
and find with Saturday or what
so it's really nice to see just like
with every platform shift how users
interact with computing changes mobile
brought multi-touch we evolved beyond
keyboard and mouse
similarly we now have ways and vision as
new to new important modalities for
computing humans are interacting with
computing in more natural and immersive
ways let's start with voice we've been
using voice as an input across many of
our products that's because computers
are getting much better at understanding
speech we have had significant
breakthroughs but the pace and even
since last year has been pretty amazing
to see our word error rate continues to
improve even in very noisy environments
this is why if you speak to Google on
your phone or Google home we can pick up
your voice accurately even in noisy
environments when we were shipping
Google home we had originally planned to
include 8 microphones so that we could
accurately locate the source of weather
where the user was speaking from but
thanks to deep learning use a technique
called neural beamforming we were able
to ship it with just two microphones and
achieve the same quality deep learning
is what allowed us about two weeks ago
to announce support for multiple users
in Google home so that we can recognize
up to 6 people in your house and
personalize the experience for each and
every one so voice is becoming an
important modality in our products the
same thing is happening with vision
similar to speech we are seeing great
improvements in computer vision so when
we look at a picture like this we are
able to understand the attributes behind
the picture we realize it's your boy in
a birthday party there was cake and
family in wall and your boy was happy so
we can understand all that better now
and our computer vision systems now for
the task of image recognition are even
better than humans so it's us
Starlin progress and we using it across
our products so if you use the Google
pixel it has the best-in-class camera
and we do do a lot of work with computer
vision you can take a low-light picture
like this which is noisy and we
automatically make it much clearer for
you or coming or coming very soon if you
take a picture of your daughter at a
baseball game and there is something
obstructing it we can do the hard work
remove the obstruction and have the
picture of what matters to you in front
of you we are clearly at an inflection
point with vision and so today we are
announcing a new initiative called
Google lense Google lens is a set of
vision based computing capabilities that
can understand what you're looking at
and help you take action based on that
information we will ship it first in
Google assistant and photos and I will
come to other products so how does it
work so for example if you run into
something and you want to know what it
is say a flower you can invoke google
lens from your assistant point your
phone at it and we can tell you what
florida's it's great for someone like me
with allergies or if you've ever been at
a friend's place and you've crawled
under a desk just to get the username
and password from a Wi-Fi router you can
point your phone at
and we can automatically do the hard
work for you or if you're walking in a
street downtown and you see a set of
restaurants across you you can point
your phone because we know where you are
and we have our knowledge graph and we
know what you're looking at we can give
you the right information in a
meaningful way as you can see we are
beginning to understand images and
videos all of Google was built because
we started understanding text and
webpages so the fact that computers can
understand images and videos has
profound implications for our core
mission when we started working on
search we wanted to do it at scale this
is why we rethought our computational
architecture we designed our data
centers from the ground up and we put a
lot of effort in them now that we are
evolving for this machine learning and
AI will we are rethinking our
computational architecture again we are
building what we think of as AI first
data centers this is why last year we
launched the tensor processing units
they are custom hardware for machine
learning they were about 15 to 30 times
faster on 30 to 80 times more power
efficient than CPUs and GPUs at that
time we use DP use across all our
products every time you do a search
every time you speak to Google in fact
DP user what powered alphago in its
historic match against lace at all as
you know machine learning has two
components training that is how we build
a neural Atlee we you know training is
very computationally intensive and
inference is what we do at real time so
that when you showed a picture we
recognize whether it's a dog or a cat
and so on last year's TPU software
optimized for inference training is
computationally very intensive to give
you a sense each one of our machine
translator
in models takes a training of over three
billion words for a week on about
hundred GPUs so we've been working hard
and I'm really excited to announce our
next generation of TP use cloud TP use
which are optimized for both training
and inference what you see behind me is
one cloud TPU board it has four chips in
it and each board is capable of 180
trillion floating-point operations per
second and you know we've designed it
for our data center so you can easily
start them you can put 64 of these into
one big supercomputer we call these TPU
parts and each part is capable of 11.5
peda flops it is an important advance in
technical infrastructure for the AI era
the reason we enable the named it cloud
TPU is because we are bringing it
through the Google cloud platform
so cloud TP users are coming to Google
compute engine as of today
we want Google cloud to be the best
cloud for machine learning and so we
want to provide our customers with a
wide range of hardware beats CPUs GPUs
including the great GPUs Nvidia
announced last week and now clout GPUs
so this lays the foundation for
significant progress so we have focused
on driving the shift and applying AI to
solving problems at Google we are
bringing our AI efforts together under
Google da di it's a collection of
efforts and teams across the company
focused on bringing the benefits of AI
to everyone Google dot a I will focus on
three areas state-of-the-art research
tools an infrastructure like tensorflow
and cloud TB use and apply day I so let
me talk a little bit about these areas
talking about research we are excited
about designing better machine learning
models but today it is really time
consuming it's a painstaking effort of a
few engineers and scientists mainly
machine learning PhDs
we want it to be possible for hundreds
of thousands of developers to use
machine learning so what better way to
do this then getting neural nets to
design better neural nets we call this
approach Auto mo it's learning to learn
so the way it works is we take a set of
candidate neural nets think of these as
little baby neural nets and we actually
use a neural net to iterate through them
till we arrive at the best neural net we
use a reinforcement learning approach
and it's the results are promising to do
this is computationally hard but cloud
tipi use put it in the realm of
possibility we are already approaching
state-of-the-art in standard tasks like
C for image recognition so whenever I
spend time with the team and think about
neural nets building their own neural
nets it reminds me of one of my favorite
movies Inception and I tell them we must
go deeper
so we are taking all these AI advances
and applying them to newer harder
problems across a wide range of
disciplines one such area is healthcare
last year I spoke about our work on
diabetic retinopathy it's a preventable
cause of blindness this year we
published a paper in the Journal of
American Medical Association and verily
is working on bringing products to the
medical community another such areas
pathology pathology is a very complex
area if you take an area like breast
cancer diagnosis even amongst highly
trained pathologist agreement on some
forms of breast cancer can be as low as
48 percent that's because they're each
pathologist is reviewing the equivalent
of thousand 10 megapixel images for
every case this is a large data problem
but one which machine learning is
uniquely equipped to solve so we built
neural nets to detect cancer spreading
to adjacent lymph nodes it's early days
but our neural nets show a much higher
degree of accuracy 89 percent compared
to previous methods of 73 percent there
are important caveats we do have higher
false positives but already giving this
in the hands of pathologists they can
improve diagnosis in general I think
this is a great approach for machine
learning providing tools for people to
do what they do better and we are
applying it across even basic sciences
take biology we are training neural nets
to improve the accuracy of DNA
sequencing deep variant is a new tool
from Google da di that identifies
genetic variants more accurately than
state-of-the-art methods reducing errors
is important applications we can more
accurately identify whether or not a
patient as genetic disease and can help
it better diagnosis in Freedman we are
applying it to chemistry we are using
machine learning to predict the
properties of molecules today it takes
an
incredible amount of computing resources
to hunt for new molecules and we think
we can accelerate timelines by orders of
magnitude this opens up possibilities in
drug discovery or material sciences I'm
entirely confident one day I will invent
new molecules with that behave in
predefined ways not everything we are
doing is so profound you know we are
doing even simple and fun things like a
simple tool which can help people draw
we call this order draw just like today
when you type in Google we give you
suggestions we can do the same when
you're trying to draw even I can draw it
this time so it may look like fun and
games but pushing computers to do things
like this this is what helps them be
creative and actually gain knowledge so
we're very excited about progress even
in these areas as well so we're making
impressive progress in applying machine
learning and we applying it across all
our products but the most important
product we are using this is for Google
search in Google assistant we are
evolving Google search to being more
assistive for our users this is why last
year at Google i/o we spoke about the
assistant and since then we've launched
on Google pixel and Google home and
today it's available on over 100 million
videos Scott and team are going to talk
more about it but before that let's take
a look at the many amazing ways people
have been using the Google assistant ok
Google Hey
play some dance music sure this is fresh
air my guests will be Kimmy Schmidt on
Netflix
okay Google count to 100
sure one two three play vacuum harmonica
on my TV 71 72 73 play the Wonder Woman
trailer
hey Google talk to dominate dr. Lonely
Planet talk to Korra show me my folders
from last weekend your car is parked at
22b today in the news turn the living
room lights on okay turning on the
lights back baby hey Google drop a beat
flip a coin call Jill set a timer talk
to heads base and then just for a moment
I'd like you to let go of any focus at
all just let your mind do whatever it
wants to do hey everyone last year at
i/o we introduced the Google assistant a
way for you to have a conversation with
Google to get things done in your world
today as sundar mentioned we're well on
our way with the assistant available on
over a hundred million devices now just
as Google search simplified the web and
made it more useful for everyone your
Google assistant simplifies all the
technology in your life you should be
able to just express what you want
throughout your day and the right thing
should happen that's what the Google
assistant is all about it's your own
individual Google that video we saw
really captures the momentum of this
project we've made such big strides and
there's so much more to talk about today
the assistant is becoming even more
conversational always available wherever
you need it and ready to help get even
more things done first we fundamentally
believe that the Google assistant should
be hands down the easiest way to
accomplish tasks and that's through
conversation it comes so naturally to
humans and now Google is getting really
good at conversation to almost 70
percent of requests to the assistant are
expressed in natural language not the
typical keywords that people type in a
search box and many requests are
follow-ups that continue the
conversation we're really starting to
crack the hard computer science
challenge of conversation allottee by
combining our strengths in speech
recognition
natural language understanding and
contextual meaning now recently we made
the assistant even more conversational
so each member of the family gets
relevant responses just for them by
asking with their own voice and we're
continuing to make interacting with your
assistant more natural for example it
doesn't always feel comfortable to speak
out loud to your assistant so today
we're adding the ability to type to your
assistant on the phone now this is great
when you're in a public place and you
don't want to be overheard the
assistants also learning conversation
beyond just words with another person
it's really natural to talk about what
you're looking at sundar spoke earlier
about how AI and deep learning have led
to tremendous strides in computer vision
soon
with the smarts of Google lens your
assistant will be able to have a
conversation about what you see this is
really cool and Ibrahim is here to help
me show you a couple examples of what
we'll launch in the coming months so
last time I traveled to a Saka I came
across a line of people waiting to try
something that smelled amazing now I
don't speak Japanese so I couldn't read
the sign out front but Google Translate
knows over a hundred languages and my
assistant will help with visual
translation I just tap the google lens
icon point the camera and my assistant
can instantly translate them into
English and now I continue the
conversation what does it look like
these pictures should match all right it
looks pretty yummy now notice I never
had to type the name of the dish my
assistant used visual context and
answered my question conversationally
let's look at another example some of
the most tedious things I do on my phone
stem from what I see a business card I
want to save details from a receipt I
need to track and so on with google lens
my assistant will be able to help with
those kinds of tasks too I love live
music and sometimes I see info for shows
around town that look like fun now I can
just tap the google lens icon and point
the camera at the
markie my assistant instantly red-eyes
is what I'm looking at now if I wanted
to I could tap to hear some of this band
songs and my assistant offers other
helpful suggestions right in the
viewfinder there's one to buy tickets
from tech aster and another to add the
show to my calendar with just a tap my
assistant adds the concert details to my
schedule saving event save stone foxes
for May 17th at 9 p.m. awesome
my assistant helped me keep track of the
event so I won't miss the show and I
didn't have to open a bunch of apps or
type anything thanks you for him so
that's how the assistant is getting
better at conversation by understanding
language and voices with new input
choices and with the power of google
lens second the assistant is becoming a
more connected experience that's
available everywhere you need help from
your living room to your morning jog
from your commute to errands around town
your assistant should know how to use
all of your connected devices for your
benefit now we're making good progress
and bringing the assistant to those 2
billion phones and other devices powered
by Android like TVs wearables and car
systems and today I'm excited to
announce that the Google assistant is
now available on the iPhone so no matter
what smartphone you use you can now get
help from the same smart assistant
throughout the day at home and on the go
the assistant brings together all your
favorite google features on the iPhone
just ask to get package delivery details
from Gmail watch videos from your
favorite YouTube creators get answers
from Google search and much more you can
even turn on the lights and heat up the
house before you get home now Android
devices and iPhones are just part of the
story we think the assistance should be
available on all kinds of devices where
people might want to ask for help the
new Google assistant SDK allows any
device manufacturer to easily build the
Google assistant into whatever they're
building speakers toys drink mixing
robots whatever crazy device all of you
think up now can incorporate the Google
assistant now we're working with many of
the world's
consumer brands and their suppliers so
keep an eye out for the badge that says
Google assistant built-in when you do
your holiday shopping this year
now obviously another aspect of being
useful to people everywhere is support
for many languages I'm excited to
announce that starting this summer the
Google assistant will begin rolling out
in French German Brazilian Portuguese
and Japanese on both Android phones and
iPhones by the end of the year will also
support Italian Spanish and Korean so
that's how the assistant is becoming
more conversational and how it will be
available in even more context
finally the assistant needs to be able
to get all kinds of useful things done
for people you know people sometimes ask
if the assistant is just a new way to
search now of course you can ask your
assistant to get all sorts of answers
from Google search but beyond finding
information users are also asking the
assistant to do all sorts of things for
them now as you've already seen the
assistant can tap into capabilities
across many google apps and services but
Google's features are just part of the
story we also opened the assistant to
third-party developers who are building
some really useful integrations I'll
turn it over to Valerie to share more
about how the developer platform is
getting stronger
hi okay so the actions on Google
platform it's been awesome to see how
developers like you have been gauging
with the Google assistant like honestly
you have built some really cool
integrations like I can ask food network
about the recipe that's on TV right now
I can work out with fitstar ask CNBC
about the news or my husband and I could
play name that tune with song pop which
he is surprisingly good at until now
these experiences have been available
through the assistant on Google home but
today we're also bringing them to
Android phones and iPhones it's over 100
million devices on android alone so now
people can get to Google features and
third-party services from anywhere and
they can even pick up are they left off
across devices so not only our
third-party integrations available in
more places they'll be able to do more
starting today actions on Google will be
supporting transactions it's a complete
end-to-end solution for developers
including payments identity
notifications receipts even account
creation the platform handles all the
complexity let me show you how one will
work hi how can I help
I'd like delivery from Panera hi
this is vedera I'll need your delivery
address which one can I get from Google
will go at 1600 Amphitheatre what can I
get you started with of a strawberry
poppy seed salad with steak instead of
chicken got it
how about one of these cold drinks here
I can just swipe through my options see
what looks good I got eliminated great
are you ready to checkout
yep okay the total is eighteen dollars
and forty cents
are you ready to place the order yes
I'll just scan my fingerprint to pay
with Google and that's it thanks
yeah super easy like I was talking to
someone at the store so here I was a new
Panera customer I didn't have to install
anything or create an account you'll
also probably noticed I didn't have to
enter my address or my credit card
I just saved those earlier with Google
and Panera used built-in platform calls
to request the information now I was in
control over what I shared every step of
the way so the developer platform is
also getting much stronger for home
automation integrations actions on
Google can now support any smart home
developer that wants to add
conversational control today over 70
smart home companies work with the
Google assistant so now on my google
home or from my phone I can lock my
front door with August locks control a
range of LG appliances or check in on my
son's room by putting the nest cam on TV
alright now that we're talking about
making your home smarter we also have a
lot of news to share today about Google
home our own smart speaker with the
Google assistant built-in here to tell
you more is Rishi Chandra
thanks Valerie you know it's really hard
to believe we launched Google home a
little over six months ago and we've
been really busy ever since since launch
we've added 50 new features including
some of my favorites like the support
for Google Shopping where I can use my
voice to order items from Costco right
to my front door or I can get
step-by-step cookie instructions from
over five million recipes or I can even
play my favorite song just by using the
lyrics now in April we launched in the
UK to some great reviews and starting
this summer we're going to be launching
in Canada Australia France Germany and
Japan and with support for multiple
users we can unlock the full potential
of Google home to offer a truly personal
experience so now you can schedule a
meeting set a reminder or get your own
daily briefing it's my day by using your
own voice and get your commute your
calendar appointments and your news
sources now today like a short share for
new features we'll be rolling out over
the coming months so first we're
announcing support for proactive
assistance coming to Google home home is
great at providing personally relevant
information for you when you ask for it
but we think it'd be even more helpful
it can automatically notify you those
timely and important messages and we do
this by understand the context of your
daily life and proactive looking for
that really helpful information and
providing it for you in a hands-free way
so for example let's say I'm relaxing
and playing game with the kids well I
can see that the Google home lights just
turned on hey Google what's up hi
Ritchie traffic's heavy right now so
you'll need to leave in 14 minutes to
get to shoreline athletic fields by 3:30
p.m. that's pretty nice
the assistant saw the game coming up on
my calendar and got my attention because
I had to leave earlier than normal so
now my daughter can make it to that
soccer game right on time
now we're going to start simple with
really important messages like reminders
traffic delays and flight status changes
and with multiple user support you'll
have the ability to control the type of
proactive notifications you want over
time all right second
another really common activity we do in
the home today is communicate with
others and a phonecall is still the
easiest way to reach someone so today
I'm excited to announce hands-free
calling coming to Google home it's
really simple to use just ask the Google
assistant to make a call and we'll
connect you you can call any landline or
mobile number in the US or Canada
completely free and it's all done in a
hands-free way for example let's say I
forgot to call my mom on Mother's Day
well now I can call her while I'm
scrambling to get the kids ready for
school in the morning I just need to say
hey Google call mom
sure calling mom oh yeah finally calling
but this day was three days ago
yeah sorry about that they may even
rehearse for i/o on Mother's Day
speaking of which you're on stage right
now say hi to everyone so hopefully this
makes up for not calling right no it
doesn't you don't need to visit and
bring flowers okay I'm on it
bye bye it's that simple
we're just making a standard phone call
through Google home so mom didn't need
to learn anything new she just need to
answer her phone there's no additional
setup apps or even phone required and
since the assistant recognized my voice
we called my mom if my wife had asked we
would have called her mom we can
personalize calling just like everything
else and now anyone in the home can call
friends family even businesses maybe on
a local florist to get some flowers for
your mom now by default we're going to
call it with a private number but you
also have the option to link your mobile
number to the Google assistant and we'll
use that number whenever we recognize
your voice
so whoever you call what's notes coming
from you now we're rolling out
hands-free calling the us to all
existing Google home devices over the
next few months
it's the ultimate hands-free
speakerphone no setup required call
anyone including personal contacts or
businesses and even dial out with their
personal number when we detect you
voice we can't wait for you to try it
out okay third let's talk a little bit
about entertainment
we designed Google home to be a great
speaker one that you can put in any room
in the house or wirelessly connect to
other chromecast built-in speaker
systems well today we're announcing that
Spotify in addition to their
subscription service will be adding
their free music service to Google home
so it's even easier to play your Spotify
playlist we'll also be adding support
for SoundCloud and deezer to the largest
global music services today and these
music services will join many the others
already available through the assistance
and finally we'll be adding bluetooth
support to all existing Google home
devices so you can play any audio from
your iOS or Android device but Google
home can do much more than just audio
last year we launched the ability to use
your voice to play YouTube Netflix and
Google photos right on your TV and today
we're announcing additional partners
including HBO now so just say what you
want to watch and we'll play it for you
all on a hands-free way with Google home
we want to make it really easy to play
your favorite entertainment ok finally I
want to talk a little bit how we see the
assistant evolving to help you in a more
visual way voice responses are great but
sometimes that pictures worth a thousand
words so today we're announcing support
for visual responses with Google home
now to do that we need to scream well
fortunately many of us already have a
ton of screens in our home today our
phones our tablets even our TVs the
Google assistant should smartly take
advantage of all these different devices
to provide you the best response on the
right device for example with Google
home I can easily get location
information ok Google
where's my next event your Pokemon go
hike is at Rancho San Antonio reserved
for my kids my kids relax but if I want
to view the directions the best place to
do it is on my phone well soon you could
just say ok Google let's go
all right I'm sending the
best route to your phone it will
automatically your phone notify your
phone whether it's Android or iOS and
take you straight to Google Maps so you
can glance at directions interact with
the map or just start navigation it's
really simple
now TVs are another natural place to get
help from the Google assistant and we
have a great place to start with over 50
million chromecast and chromecast
built-in devices so today we're
announcing that we'll be updating
chromecast to show visual responses on
your TV when you ask for help for google
home for example I can now say ok Google
show my calendar for Saturday showing it
on your TV it'll show up right on the TV
screen immediately get results from the
assistant and since the assistant
detected my voice we're showing my
calendar others will see their calendar
by using their their voice we can
personalize the experience even on the
TV they can continue to follow up the
conversation looks like I have a biking
trip to Santa Cruz what's the weather in
Santa Cruz this weekend this weekend in
Santa Cruz it will be clear and sunny
most of the time so it's really easy
it's all hands-free your assistant could
provide a visual response to a TV to a
lot of different types of questions you
know we talked how easy it is to play
what you want to watch on the TV screen
but what about those times you don't
know what to watch well soon you could
just ask hey Google what's on YouTube
here you go
and show me my personalized results
right on a TV screen if I don't like any
options I can continue the conversation
with my voice show my watch later list
alright play send my love playing send
my love from YouTube
it's really simple
again no remotes or phone required in a
short conversation I found something
really interesting to watch using Google
home I can even do with other things
okay Google what's on my DVR here you go
here we're showing how it works as
YouTube TV a new live TV streaming
service that gives you live sports and
shows from popular TV networks and
YouTube TV includes a cloud DVR so I can
easily play my saved episodes play
Modern Family okay playing modern family
from YouTube TV you guys have a too easy
nowadays you can just lay around even
sack saying okay googled in the kitchen
lights sure thing dad ok Google show me
a video of a kangaroo playing Bevan with
a pirate short playing on YouTube what I
had a similar reaction the first time I
saw it everything can be done in a
hands-free way all from the comfort of
my couch and over time we're gonna bring
all those developer actions that Valerie
already talked about right to the TV
screen
so we do even more over time with Google
home and when you're done just say ok
Google turn off the TV sure and that's
our update for Google home proactive
assistance to bring important
information to you at the right time
simple and easy hands-free calling more
entertainment options and evolving the
assistant provide visual responses in
the home next up is Anil who's going to
talk about Google photos
two years ago we launched Google photos
with Anna daesh's goal to be the home
for all your photos automatically
organized and brought to life so that
you could easily share and save what
matters in doing so we took a
fundamentally different approach we
built a product from the ground up with
AI at its core and that's enabled us to
do things in ways that only Google can
like when you're looking for that one
photo you can't find Google photos
organizes your library by people places
and things simply type a nail pineapple
Hawaii and instantly find this gem or
when you come home from vacation
overwhelmed by the hundreds of photos
you took Google photos will give you an
album curated with only the best shots
removing duplicates and blurring images
this is the secret ingredient behind
Google photos and the momentum we've
seen in these two short years is
remarkable as sundar mentioned we now
have more than half a billion monthly
active users uploading more than 1.2
billion photos and videos per day and
today I'm excited to show you three new
features we're launching to make it even
easier to send and receive the
meaningful moments in your life now at
first glance it might seem like photo
sharing is a solved problem after all
there's no shortage of apps out there
that are great at keeping you and your
friends and family connected but we
think there's still a big and different
problem that needs to be addressed let
me show you what I mean if there's one
thing you know it's that you're a great
photographer if there's a second thing
you know it's that you're kind of a
terrible person what yeah you heard me
the only photo of the birthday girl in
focus never sent it the best picture of
the entire wedding kept it to yourself
this masterpiece of your best friend we
are gonna send it but then you were like
oh remember that sandwich I love that
sandwich if only something could say hey
Eric looks great in these
you want to send them to him and you
could be like great idea well it can
wait it can yep
with Google photos
so today to make us all a little less
terrible people we're announcing
suggested sharing because we've all been
there right like when you're taking that
group photo and you insist that it be
taken with your camera because you know
if it's not on your camera you are never
seeing that photo ever again
now thanks to the machine learning in
Google photos will not only remind you
so you don't forget to share will even
suggest the photos and people you should
share with in one tap you're done let's
have a look at suggested sharing in
action I'm once again joined on stage by
my friend and Google Photos product lead
David Lieb all right so here a bunch of
photos Dave took while bowling with the
team last weekend he was too busy
enjoying the moment so he never got
around to sharing them but this time
Google photo sentiment reminder via
notification and also by badging the new
sharing tab the sharing tab is where
you're gonna be able to find all of your
Google photo sharing activity and at the
top your personal suggestions based on
your sharing habits and what's most
important to you here is the sharing
suggestion that Dave got from his day
bowling Google Photos recognized this
was a meaningful moment it's selected
right shots and it figured out who he
should send it to based on who was in
the photos in this case it's John V
Jason and a few others who are also at
the event Dave can now review the photos
elected as well as update the recipients
or if he's happy with it he can just tap
send and that's it Google photos will
even send an SMS or an email to anyone
who doesn't have the app and that way
everyone can view and save the full
resolution photos even if they don't
have Google Photos accounts and because
Google photo sharing works on any device
including iOS let's have a look at what
john VIII sees on her iPhone she
receives a notification and ting on it
lets her quickly jump right into the
album and look at all the rows that Dave
is shared with her but notice here at
the bottom she's asked to contribute the
photo she took from the event
Google photos automatically identifying
and suggesting the right ones
John we can review the suggestions and
then simply tap add now all of the
photos are finally pooled together in
one place and Dave get some photos he's
actually in which is great because a
home for all your photos really should
include photos of you
now even though suggested sharing takes
the work out of sharing sometimes
there's a special person in your life
who you share just about everything with
your what partner your best friend your
sibling would it be great if Google
photos automatically shared photos with
that person for example I would love it
if every photo I ever took of my kids
was automatically shared with my wife
and that's why today we're also
announcing shared libraries
let me show you how it works so here
we're now looking at my google photos
account from the menu I now the option
to go ahead and share my library which
I'm going to go ahead and do with my
wife Jess importantly I have complete
control over which photos I
automatically are I can share them all
or I can share a subset like only photos
of the kids or only photos from a
certain date forward like when we first
met in this case I'm gonna go ahead and
share all we did not meet today
and that's all there is to it I've now
gone ahead and shared my library with my
wife Jess so let's switch to her phone
to see what the experience looks like
from her end she receives a notification
and after accepting she can now go to
see all the photos that I've shared with
her we can access Leeza Lee from the
menu if she sees something she likes she
can go ahead and select those photos and
stuff save them to her library will even
notify her periodically as I take new
photos now this is great but what if
just doesn't want to have to keep coming
back to this view and checking if I
shared new photos for her with her she
just wants every photo I take of her or
the kids to automatically be safe to her
library just as if she took the photos
herself with shared library she'd do
just that
choosing to audit a photos specific
people now anytime I take photos of her
or the kids without either of us having
to do anything they'll automatically
appear in the main view of a wrap let me
show you now I couldn't justify pulling
the kids out of school today just to
have their photo taken but I do have the
next best thing
all right
maitre de su to Ava and Lily all righty
here so I'm gonna go ahead take a photo
with the girls smile kids fantastic and
since this is too good of an opportunity
I'm gonna have to take one with all of
you here too all right there we go
Oh brilliant all right okay so thank you
girls
much appreciated back to school we go
all right so using nothing more than the
standard camera app on my phone I've
gone ahead and taken one photo with my
kids in one photo with all of you here
in the audience Google photos is going
to back these two photos up it's going
to share them with Jess and then it's
going to recognize the photo that has
kids in them and automatically save just
that one to her Liebig like you can see
right here
now finally Jess and I can stop worrying
about whose phone were using to take the
photos all the photos of family are in
my Google Photos app and they
automatically appear in hers too and
best of all these family photos are part
of both of our search results and
they're included in the great collages
movies and other fun creations that
Google photos makes for us but notice
how only the photos with the kids showed
up in Jess's main view but because I
shared my entire library with her I can
Slee go to the menu and Jess can now see
all the photos including the one with
all of you and that's how easy sharing
can be in Google Photos spend less time
worrying about sharing your memories and
more time actually enjoying them
suggested sharing and shared libraries
will be rolling out on Android iOS and
web in the coming weeks finally we know
sharing doesn't always happen through
apps and screens there's still something
pretty special about looking at and even
gathering around an actual printed photo
but printing photos and albums today is
hard you have to hunt across devices and
accounts to find the right photos select
the best among the duplicates and
blurring images upload them to a
printing service and then arrange them
across dozens of pages it can take hours
of sitting in front of a computer just
to do one thing
thankfully our machine learning and
Google photos already does most of this
work for you and today we're bringing it
all together with the launch of photo
books
they're beautiful high quality with a
clean and modern design but the best
part is that they're incredibly easy to
make even on your phone what used to
take hours now only takes minutes I
recently made a book for Jess on
Mother's Day and let me show you just
how easy and fast that was first thanks
to unlimited storage all my life's
moments are all up here in google photos
no need to upload them to another
website or app now my favorite way start
a book is to use people search since
this is a Mother's Day gift I'm gonna
simply find photos of Jess Ava and Lily
there they are
alright I thought I took more photos
alright so why don't we just go and pick
another set of photos Dave if that one's
not coming up just it'll be a fun
Mother's Day gift for her she'll get a
different surprise so I'll select a
bunch of fussier and the good news is I
don't have to figure out which are the
right photos and which are the good ones
because this is where Google photos
really shines I'm just going to go ahead
and hit plus select photo book I'm going
to pick a hardcover book we offer both a
soft cover and a hard cover and notice
what happens Google photos is going to
make the best photos for me
automatically automatically suggesting
photo for in this case how awesome is
that
and it's even going to go ahead and lay
them all out for me all that's left for
me to do is make a couple of tweaks
check out and in a few days I'll end up
with one of these beautiful printed
photo books
and soon we'll make it even easier to
get started applying machine learning to
create personalized photo books you'll
love so when you go to photo books from
the menu you'll see pre-made books
tailored just for you your trip to the
Grand Canyon time with your family
during the holidays or your pet or even
your kids artwork all easily
customizable we'll even notify you when
there are new photo book suggestions
photo books are available today in the
US on photos google comm and they'll be
rolling out on Android and iOS next week
and we'll be expanding to more countries
soon I am really excited about this
launch and I want all of you to be the
first to try it out and that's why
everyone here at i/o will be receiving a
free hardcover photo book
it's a great example of machine learning
at work so those are the three big
updates related to sharing in Google
photos suggested sharing shared
libraries and photo books three new
features built from the ground up with
AI at their core I can't wait for all of
you to try them out real soon now before
I go I want to touch on what sundar
mentioned earlier which is the way we're
taking photos is changing instead of the
occasional photo with friends and family
we now take 30 identical photos of a
sunset we're also taking different types
of photos not just photos to capture a
personal memory but as a way to get
things done whiteboards we want to
remember receipts we need to file books
we'd like to read and that's where
Google lends and its vision based
computing capabilities comes in it can
understand what's in an image and help
you get things done Scott showed how
Google lens in the assistant can
identify what you're looking at and help
you on the fly but what about after
you've taken the photo there are lots of
photos you want to keep and then look
back on later to learn more and take
action and for that we're bringing
google lens right into Google photos let
me show you so let's say you took a trip
to Chicago there's some beautiful
architecture there and during your boat
tore down the Chicago River you took
lots of photos but it's hard to remember
which building is which later on now by
activating lens you can identify some of
the cool buildings in your photos like
the second tallest skyscraper in les
Willis Tower you can even pull up
directions and get the hours for the V
deck and later welcoming the Art
Institute you might take photos of a few
paintings you really love in one tap you
can learn more about the painting and
the artist and the screen shot that your
friend sent you of that bike rental
place just adding lens you can tap the
phone number and make the call right
from the photo
lenz we'll be rolling out in google
photos later this year and we'll be
continually improving the experience so
it recognizes even more objects and lets
you do even more with them and those are
the updates for google photos
now let's see what's next from YouTube
look at that oh my god
Wow check this out
open the hatch
we are one species sharing one
profoundly interconnected world
don't let them convince you that you're
small because a lot of small things
coming together can do big things love
is love is love is love is love cannot
be killed or shut the sight now fill the
world with music love and pride
all right good morning everyone I am
thrilled to be here at my first ever IO
on behalf of YouTube so that opening
video that we all just saw that's a
perfect glimpse into what makes YouTube
so special the incredible diversity of
content a billion people around the
globe come to YouTube every month to
watch videos from new and unique voices
and we're hard at work to make sure that
we can reach the next billion viewers
which you'll hear about in a later i/o
session today we want to give everyone
the opportunity to watch the content on
YouTube so YouTube is different from
traditional media in a number of ways
first of all YouTube is open anyone in
the world can upload a video that
everyone can watch you can be a vlogger
broadcasting from your bedroom a gamer
live-streaming from your console or
citizen journalist documenting events
live from your phone on the front lines
and what we've seen is that openness
leads to important conversations that
help shape society from advancing LGBTQ
rights to highlighting the plight of
refugees to encouraging body positivity
and we've seen in our numbers that you
just really want to engage with this
type of diverse content we are proud
that last year we passed a billion hours
a day being watched on YouTube and our
viewership is not slowing down the
second way that YouTube is different
from traditional media is that it's not
a one-way broadcast it's a two-way
conversation viewers interact directly
with their favorite creators via
comments mobile live-streaming
fan polls animated gifs and VR and
these features enable viewers to come
together and to build communities around
their favorite content so one of my
favorite stories of a YouTube community
is the enable network a few years ago an
engineering professor named Jon Schull
saw a YouTube video about a carpenter
who had lost two of his fingers
the carpenter worked with a colleague
for over a year to build an affordable
3d printed prosthesis that would enable
him to go back to work
they then applied this technology for a
young boy who was born without any
fingers so inspired by this video
the professor posted a single comment on
the video asking for volunteers with 3d
printers to help print affordable
prosthesis the network has since grown
into a community of over 6,000 people
who have designed printed and
distributed these prosthetics to
children in over 50 countries
so today thousands of children have
regained the ability to walk touch play
and all because of the one video one
comment and that incredible YouTube
community that formed to help and that's
just one example of the many passionate
communities that are coming together on
YouTube around video so the third
feature of this new medium is that video
works on demand on any screen over 60%
of our watch time now comes from mobile
devices but actually our fastest growing
screen isn't the one in your pocket it's
the one in your living room our watch
time in our living room is growing at
over six ninety percent a year
so let's now welcome Sarah Ali head of
living room products to the stage to
talk about the latest features in the
living room
Thank You Susan so earlier today you
heard from Rishi about how people are
watching YouTube on the TV via the
assistant but another way people are
enjoying video is through the YouTube
app which is available on over half a
billion Smart TVs game consoles and
streaming devices and that number
continues to grow around the world so
when I think about why YouTube is so
compelling in the living room it isn't
just about the size of the screen it's
about giving you an experience that TV
just can't match first YouTube offers
you the largest library of on-demand
content second our recommendations build
channels and lineups based on your
personal interests and what you enjoy
watching and third it's a two-way
interactive experience with features
like voice control and today I'm super
excited to announce that we are taking
the interactive experience a step
further by introducing 360 video in the
YouTube app on the big screen and you
know that you can already watch 360
videos on your phone or in your daydream
headset but soon you'll be able to feel
like you're in the middle of the action
right from your couch and on the biggest
screen you own now one of my personal
interests outside of work is to travel
and one place I'd love to visit is
Alaska to check out the Northern Lights
so let's do a voice search aurora
borealis 360 great let's choose that
first video and now using my TV remote
I'm able to pan around this video
checking out this awesome view from
every single angle
traveling is great especially when I
don't have to get on a flight but 360 is
now a brand new way to attend concerts I
didn't make it to Coachella but here I
can experience it like I was on stage
and to enhanced the experience even
further we are also introducing live 360
in the living room soon you'll be able
to witness moments and events as they
unfold in a new truly immersive way so
whether you have a Sony Android TV or an
Xbox one console soon you'll be able to
explore 360 videos right from the
comfort of your couch and along with
your friends and family and now to help
show you another way we're enabling
interactivity please join me in
welcoming Barbara McDonald who's the
lead of something we call super chat
good morning
io and to everybody on the livestream
as Susan mentioned what makes YouTube
special is the relationships that
creators are able to foster with their
fans and one of the best ways to connect
with your fans is to bring them live
behind the scenes of your videos
offering up can't-miss content in the
past year the number of creators live
streaming on YouTube has grown by 4x
this growth is awesome and we want to do
even more to deepen the connection
between creators and their fans during
live streams that's why earlier this
year we rolled out a new feature called
super chat when a creator is
live-streaming fans can purchase super
chats which are highlighted fun chat
messages not only des fans love the
recognition but creators earn extra
money from it in the past three months
since launch we've been amazed by the
different ways creators are using super
chat even April our favorite pregnant
raff who unfortunately could not be here
with us today has raised tens of
thousands of dollars for her home the
animal adventure park ok ok we can glad
for that
but enough talking for me we are going
to do a livestream right here right now
to show all of you how super chat works
and to help me very excited to introduce
top YouTube creators with 9 million
subscribers and over 1 billion lifetime
channel views on the grass back there
the slow mo guys Wow hey how could you
be it's good it's great to have you so
let's pull up their livestream and just
look chat is flying now I love the slow
mo guys and I want to make sure that
they see my message so I'm going to
super chat them pulled up the team and
right from within live chat I'm able to
enter my message select my amount make
the purchase and send boom see how much
that message stands out and it gets
pinned to the top cool right yeah thanks
Barbara it's actually lovely the minute
although I feel like there's a high
chance of showers very local showers
like specifically to this stage yeah I
wonder I wonder well because we know
developers are incredibly creative we
wanted to see what you can do to make
super chat even more interactive so
we've launched an API for it
and today we're taking it to the next
level with a new developer integration
that triggers actions in the real world
this means that when a fan sends a super
chat to a creator things can happen in
real life such as turning the lights on
or off in the Creator studio flying a
drone around or pushing buttons on their
toys and gadgets the slow mo guys are
going to create their next slow motion
video using super chats API we have now
reached things out
so that when I send my next Super chat
it will automatically trigger the lights
and a Big Horn in this amphitheater okay
and that is going to signal our friends
back there on the lawn to unleash a
truckload of water balloons at the slow
mo guys I'm scared yeah that's right but
every dollar we're gonna take another
balloon so more money means more
balloons although I did hear a guy over
here go we're gonna totally nail these
guys alright that's got to be at least
four dollars right there
so yeah each dollar donate goes to the
course that Susan mentioned earlier the
enable Network okay so how much do you
think we can send I can start at $1 and
go anywhere upwards from there so it's
for charity how do we think 100 how's
that sound
okay higher higher 200 200 how about
$500 for 500 balloons $500 I can do that
I can do that okay it's like it's in my
super chat and hit send 500 woo
that was amazing thank you everybody for
your help so this obviously just
scratches the surface of what is
possible using super Jets
open api's and we are super excited to
see what all of you will do with it next
so Susan how about you come back out
here and let's check out the video we've
all made
[Laughter]
Wow
thank you so much thank you Barbara I'm
really happy to announce that YouTube is
going to match the slo-mo guy super chat
earnings from today
a hundred ex to make sure that we're
supplying prosthetics to children in
need around the world
so that 360 living room demo and the
super chat demo those are just two
examples of how we are working to
connect people around the globe together
with video now I hope that what you've
seen today is that the future of media
is a future of openness and diversity a
future filled with conversations and
community and a future that works across
all screens together with creators
viewers and partners we are building the
platform of that future
Thank You IO and please
please welcome me enjoy and in Dave
Burke joining us to talk about Android
then I ever
hi everybody it's great to be here at
Google i/o 2017 as you can see we found
some new ways to Hardware accelerate
Android this time with jetpacks
but seriously two billion active devices
is incredible and that's just
smartphones and tablets
we're also seeing new momentum in areas
such as TVs and cars and watches and
laptops and beyond so let me take a
moment and give you a quick update and
how Android is doing in those areas
Android wear 2.0 launched earlier this
year with a new update for Android and
iPhone users and when you hardeners like
Emporio Armani Lovato and New Balance we
now enable 24 of the world's top watch
brands Android auto being a 10x user
growth since last year it's supported by
more than 300 car models and the out
auto mobile app and just this week howdy
in Volvo and as that their
next-generation math systems will be
powered by Android for a more seamless
connected car experience Android TV
we've partnered with over a hundred
cable operators and hardware
manufacturers around the world and now
we're now seeing 1 million device
activations every two months and they're
more than three thousand Android TV apps
in the Play Store
this year we're releasing a brand new
launcher interface and bringing the
Google assistant to Android TV Android
thing's previewed late last year and
already there are thousands of
developers in over 60 countries using it
to build connected devices with easy
access to the Google assistant
tensorflow
and more the full launch is coming later
this year Chromebooks comprise almost
60% of K to 12 laptops sold in the US
and the momentum is growing globally and
now with the added ability to run
Android apps you get to target laptops
too now of course platforms are only as
good as the apps they run the Google
Play ecosystem is more vibrant than ever
Android users installed a staggering 82
billion apps and games in the
last year that's 11 apps for every
person on the planet all right so let's
come back to smartphones and the real
reason I'm here is to talk about Android
Oh two months ago we launched our very
first Developer Preview so you could
kick the tires and some of the new api's
and of course it's very much a work in
progress but you can expect the release
later this summer today we want to walk
you through two themes you know that
we're excited about the first is
something we call fluid experiences it's
pretty incredible what you can do in a
mobile phone today and how much we rely
on them as computers in our pockets but
there are still certain things are tough
to do in a small screen so we're doing a
couple of features you know that we
think will help with this which I'll
cover in just a moment the second theme
is something we call vitals and the
concept here is to keep vital system
behavior in a healthy state so we can
maximize the users battery performance
and reliability so let's jump straight
in and walk through four new fluid
experiences whit live demos done
wirelessly what could possibly go wrong
alright and these days we do a lot of
once on our phones whether it's paying
for groceries while reading a text
message you just received or looking up
guitar chords while listening to a new
song but conventional multi-window
techniques don't translate well to
mobile they're just too fiddly to set up
when you're on the go we think picture
and picture is the answer for many cases
so let's take a look my kids recently
asked me to build a lemonade stand so I
opened up YouTube and I started
researching DIY videos and I found this
one now at the same time I want to be
able to jot down the materials I need to
build for this lemonade stand
so to multitask all I do press the home
button and boom I get picture-in-picture
you can think of it as a kind of
automatic multi window I give it out of
the way I can launch keep I can add some
more materials so I know I need to get
some what
glue-like so then when I'm done I just
simply swipe it away like that
it's brilliant picture-in-picture lets
you do more with your phone it works
great when video calling with duo for
example maybe I need to check my
calendar while planning a barbecue with
friends and there are lots of other
great news cases for example picture and
picture for max navigation or watching
Netflix in the background and a lot more
and we're also excited to see what you
come up with for this feature we're also
making notification interactions more
fluid for users from the beginning
Android has really blazed a trail when
it comes to its advance notification
system you know we're extending the
reach of notifications with something we
call notification dots it's a new way
for app developers to indicate that
there's activity in their app and to
drive engagement so let's take a look
you'll notice that the Instagram app
icon has a dotted net and this is
indicating that there's a notification
associated with the app so if I pull
down the shade sure enough you can see
there's a notification in this case
someone's printed on a photo and tagged
in what's really cool is I can long
press the app icon and we now show the
notification in place one of the things
I really like about the notification
mechanism is that it works with zero
effort from the app developer we even
extract the color of the dot from your
icon oh and you get to raise the icon by
simply swiping the notification like
that so you're always in control
another great feature you know that
helps make your experience more fluid is
auto fill now if you use Chrome you're
probably already familiar with auto fill
for quickly filling out a username and
password or credit card information with
a single tap widow we've extended
autofill to apps let's say I'm setting
up a new phone for the first time and I
open Twitter and I want to log in now
because I use Twitter comm all the time
on Chrome this system will automatically
suggest my username I can simply tap it
I get my password and then boom logged
in it's pretty awesome autofill takes
the pain out of setting up a new phone
or tablet once the user opts in autofill
will work for most applications we also
provide api's for developers to
customize autofill for their experience
I want to show you one more demo of how
we're making Android more fluid by
improving copy and paste the feature is
called smart text selection so let's
take a look in Android you typically
long press or double tap a word to
select it for example I can open gmail I
can start composing if I double tap the
word bite it gets selected like so now
we know from user studies that phone
numbers are the most copy and pasted
items the second most common are named
entities like businesses and people and
places you know we're applying a device
machine-learning in this case a fee for
neural network to recognize these more
complicated entities so watch this I can
double tap anywhere on the phrase old
coffee house and all of it is select for
me no more filling around with hex
selection handles it even works out for
addresses so if I double tap on the
address all of it is selected and what's
more there's more what's worse the
machine learn model classifies this as
an address and automatic suggests Maps
so I can get directions to it with a
single click and of course it works as
you expect for phone numbers you get the
phone dialer suggested and for email
addresses you get Gmail suggested all of
this neural networking processing
happens on device in real time and
without any data leaving the device it's
pretty awesome now on device machine
learning helps make your phone Spyder
and we want to help you build
experiences like what you just saw so
we're doing two things to help first I'm
excited to announce that we're creating
a specialized version of tensorflow
Google's open source machine learning
library which we call tensorflow
lite
it's a library for apps designed to be
fast and small yet still enabling state
of art techniques like commnets and LSTs
second we're introducing a new framework
at Android 2 Hardware accelerate neural
computation tests refer light will
leverage a new neural network API to tap
into silicon specific accelerators and
over time we expect to see DSPs
specifically designed for neural network
inference and training we think these
new capabilities will help our next
generation of on device speech
processing visual search augmented
reality and more tests of low light will
soon be part of the open source
tensorflow project and the neural
network API will be made available later
in an update to oh this year ok so
that's a quick tour of some of the fluid
experiences in oh let's switch gears and
talk about vitals so to tell you more I
want to head over to Steph who's been
instrumental in driving this project
thank you
hi everyone okay so all the features
they've talked about are cool but we
think your phone's foundations are even
more important battery life security
startup time and stability after all if
your battery dies at 4 p.m.
none of the other features that Dave
talked about really matter so a no we're
investing in what we call vitals keeping
your phone secure and in a healthy state
to maximize power and performance we've
invested in three foundational building
blocks security enhancements OS
optimizations and tools to help
developers build great apps first
security Android was built with security
in mind from day one with application
sandboxing as Android has matured we've
developed vast mobile security services
now we use machine learning to
continuously comb apps uploaded to play
flagging potentially harmful apps then
we scan over 50 billion apps every day
scanning every installed app on every
connected device and when we find a
potentially harmful app we disable it or
remove it and we found most Android
users don't know these services come
built-in with Android devices with play
so for greater peace of mind
we're making them more visible and
accessible and doubling down on our
commitment to security with the
introduction of Google Play protect
so here you can see play protect has
recently scanned all your apps no
problems found that's Google Play
protect it's available out of the box on
every Android device with Google Play
second OS optimizations the single
biggest visible change in o is boot time
on pixel for example you'll find in most
cases your boot time is now twice as
fast and we've made all apps faster by
default we do this through extensive
changes to our run time now this is
really cool stuff like concurrent
compacting garbage collection and code
locality but all you really need to know
is that your apps will run faster and
smoother take Google sheets aggregate
performance over a bunch of common
actions is now over two times as fast
and that's all from the OS there are no
changes to the app but we found apps
could still have a huge impact on
performance some apps were running in
the background and they were consuming
tons of system resources especially
draining battery so an o we're adding
wise limits to background location and
background execution these boundaries
put sensible limits on usage they're
protecting battery life and freeing up
memory now our third theme is helping
developers build great apps and here I
want to speak directly to all the
developers in the audience wouldn't it
be cool if Android engineering team
could show you what causes performance
issues today we've launched play console
dashboards that analyze every app and
pinpoint six top issues that cause
battery drain crashes and slow UI for
each issue the app has we show how many
users are affected and provide guidance
on the best way to fix now imagine if
developers could also have a powerful
profiler to visualize what's happening
inside the app in Android studio we've
also launched new unified profiling
tools for networked memory and CPU so
developers can now see everything on a
unified timeline and then dive into each
profiler for an example on CPU you can
see every thread you can look at the
call stack and the time every call is
taking you can visualize where the CPU
is going and you can jump to the exact
line of code okay so that's android
vitals
how we're investing in your phones
foundational security and performance
later today you'll see androids
developer story from end to end our hard
work to help developers build great apps
at every stage writing code tuning
launching and growing but there is one
more thing one thing we think would be
an incredible compliment to the story
and it is one thing our team has never
done for developers we have never added
a new programming language to android
and today we're making Kotlin an
officially supported language in andhra
so Colin Colin is when our developer
community has already asked for it makes
developers so much more productive it is
fully Android runtime compatible it is
totally interoperable with your existing
code it has fabulous IDE support and
it's mature and production ready from
day one we are also announcing our plans
to partner with JetBrains creating a
foundation for Colin I am so happy
jetbrains CEO Mac Safarov is here today
this new language is wonderful but we
also thought we should increase our
investment in our existing languages so
we're doing that too please join us at
the developer keynote later today to
hear our story from end to end
ok so let's wrap up there are tons more
features in Android o which we don't
have time to go into today everything
from redesigned settings to project
treble which is one of the biggest
changes to the foundations of Android to
date - downloadable fonts with new emoji
and much more if you want to try some of
these features for yourself and you do
I'm happy to announce we're making the
first beta release of o available today
head over to Android comm slash beta
but there's more you probably thought
we're done talking about Android oh but
I'd like you to hear some more about
Android and from that please welcome
Sameer
thank you thanks Steph hi everyone from
the beginning androids mission has been
to bring the power of computing to
everyone and we've seen tremendous
growth over the last few years from the
high end to entry level devices in
countries like Indonesia Brazil and
India in fact there are now more users
of Android in India than there are in
the US and every minute seven Brazilians
come online for the first time all this
progress is amazing for those of us who
have a smartphone we intuitively
understand the profound impact that
computing is having on our daily lives
and that's why our team gets so excited
about how we can help bring this
technology to everyone so we took a step
back to think about what it would take
to get smartphones to more people there
are a few things that are clear devices
would need to be more affordable with
entry-level prices dropping
significantly this means hardware that
uses less power pack processors and far
less memory than on premium devices but
the hardware is only half the equation
the software also has to be tuned for
users needs around limited data
connectivity and multilingual use we
learned a lot from our past efforts here
with projects felt and KitKat and the
original Android one program but we felt
like the time was right to take our
investment to the next level so today
I'm excited to give you a sneak peek
into a new experience we're building for
entry-level Android devices internally
we call it Android Go Android Go focuses
on three things
first optimizing the latest release of
Android to run smoothly on entry-level
devices starting with Android o second a
rebuilt set of Google App
that use less memory storage space and
mobile data and third a version of the
Play Store that contains the whole app
catalog but highlights the apps designed
by all of you for the next billion users
and all three of these things will ship
together as a single experience starting
on Android o devices with one gigabyte
or less of memory let's take a look at
some of the things we're working on for
Android go first let's talk about the
operating system for manufacturers to
make more affordable entry-level devices
the prices of their components have to
come down let's take one example memory
is an expensive component so we're
making a number of optimizations to the
system UI and the kernel to allow an
android o device built with the go
configuration to run smoothly with as
little as 512 megabytes to one gigabyte
of memory now on device performance is
critical but data costs and intermittent
connectivity are also big challenges for
users one person put it best to me when
she said mobile data feels like currency
and she wanted more control over the way
she spent it so when these devices were
putting data management front and center
in quick settings and we've created an
API that carriers can great with so you
can see exactly how much prepaid data
you have left and even top up right
there on the device but beyond the OS
the google apps are also getting smarter
about data for example on these devices
the chrome data saver feature will be
turned on by default data saver
transcodes content on the server and
simplifies pages when you're on a slow
connection and when now we're making the
savings more visible here in the UI in
aggregate this feature is saving users
over 750 terabytes of data every day I'm
really excited that the YouTube team has
designed a new app called YouTube go for
their users with limited data
connectivity feedback front on the new
YouTube app has been phenomenal and
we're taking many of the lessons we've
learned here and applying them to
several of our
Google Apps let me show you some of the
things I love about YouTube go first
there's a new preview experience so you
can get a sneak peek inside a video
before you decide to spend your data to
watch it and when you're sure this is
the video for you you can select the
streaming quality you want and see
exactly how much mobile data that's
going to cost you but my favorite
feature of youtube go is the ability to
save videos while you're connected so
you can watch them later when you might
not have access to data and if you want
to share any of those videos with a
friend you can use the built-in
peer-to-peer sharing feature to connect
two of your devices together directly
and share the files across without using
any of your mobile data at all but
beyond data management the Google Apps
will also make it easier to seamlessly
go between multiple languages which is a
really common use case for people coming
online today for example G Board now
supports over a hundred and ninety-one
languages including the recent addition
of 22 Indian languages and there's even
a transliteration feature which allows
you to spell words phonetically on a
QWERTY keyboard to type in your native
language script and G board is super
cool so I want to show it to you I grew
up in the US so for any of my family
that's watching don't get too excited by
the demo I haven't learned Hindi yet and
I'm sorry mom okay
so let's say I want to send a quick note
to my aunt in India I can open up a low
and using G board I can type how it
sounds phonetically boom guess awho
which means how are you in Hindi and
transliteration automatically gives me
Hindi script that's pretty cool now see
I want to ask her how my IO speech is
going but I don't know how to say that
Hindi at all I can use the built-in
Google Translate feature to say how is
this going and seamlessly I get Hindi
script all built right into the keyboard
why my family is apparently a tough
audience
all right well the cou collapse are
getting go F ID what is always propelled
Android forward is the apps from all of
you and no surprise many of our
developer partners have optimized their
apps already so to better connect users
with these experiences we'll be
highlighting them in the Play Store
one example is right here on plays home
page to be eligible for these new
sections we've published a set of best
practices called building for billions
which includes recommendations leave
seen make a big difference in the
consumer experience things such as
designing a useful offline state
reducing your apk size to less than 10
megabytes and using GCM or job scheduler
for better battery and memory
performance and also in building for
billions you'll find best practices for
optimizing your web experience we've
seen developers build amazing things
with new technology such as progressive
web apps we hope you can come to our
developer keynote later today to learn a
whole lot more ok that was a quick
walkthrough of some of the things coming
in Android go starting with Android o
all devices with one gigabyte of RAM or
less will get the go configuration and
going forward every Android release will
have a go configuration we'll be
unveiling much more later this year with
the first devices shipping in 2018 we
look forward to seeing what you'll build
and how we can bring computing to the
next several billion users next up next
up you'll be hearing from clay on one of
Google's newest platforms that were
really excited about VR and AR thank you
Thank You Samir so send are talked about
how technologies like machine learning
and conversational interfaces make
computing more intuitive by enabling our
computers to work more like we do and we
see VR and AR in the same light they
enable us to experience computing just
as we experience the real world virtual
reality can be transporting you can
experience not just what it's like to
see someplace but what it's like to
really be there an augmented reality
uses your surroundings as context and
puts computing into the real world a lot
has happened since Google i/o last year
and I'm excited to share a bit of what
we've been up to so let's start with VR
last year we announced daydream our
platform from mobile virtual reality and
then in October to kick-start the
daydream ecosystem we released daydream
view a VR headset made by Google
that's super comfortable it's really
easy to use and there's tons to do with
it
you can play inside alternate worlds and
games like virtual virtual reality you
can see any part of our world with apps
like Street View and you can visit other
worlds with apps like Hello Mars there's
already a great selection of daydream
phones out there and we're working with
partners to get daydream on even more
first I'm pleased that LG's next
flagship phone which launches later this
year will support daydream and there's
another I'm excited to announce that the
Samsung Galaxy s8 and s8 plus will add
daydream support this summer with a
software update
the Samsung of course they make many of
the most popular phones in the world and
we're delighted to have them supporting
daydream so great momentum in daydreams
first six months let's talk about what's
next
so the daydream we showed that you can
create high-quality mobile VR
experiences with just a smart phone and
a simple headset and there are a lot of
nice things about smart phone VR it's
easy there aren't a bunch of cables and
things to fuss with you can choose from
a bunch of great compatible phones and
of course it's portable you can throw
your headset in a bag we asked how can
we take the best parts of smartphone VR
and create a kind of device with an even
better experience I'm excited to
announce that an entirely new kind of VR
device is coming to daydream what we
call standalone VR headsets and we're
working with partners to make them so
what's a standalone headset the idea is
you have everything you need for VR
built right into the headset itself
there's no cables no phone and certainly
no big PC and the whole device is
designed just for VR and that's cool for
a couple of reasons first it's easy to
use getting into VR is as easy as
picking the thing up and it's one step
in two seconds and second presence and
by that I mean really feeling like
you're there by building every part of
the device specifically for VR we've
been able to optimize everything that
displays the optics the sensors all to
deliver a stronger sense of being
transported and nothing heightens the
feeling of presence like precise
tracking how the headset tracks your
movement and we've dramatically improved
tracking with a technology that we call
world sense so world sense enables
what's known as positional tracking with
it your view in the virtual world
exactly matches your movement in the
real world and it works by using a
handful of sensors on the device that
look out into your surroundings and that
means it works anywhere there's no setup
there's no cameras to install and with
it you really feel like you're there now
just as we did with daydream ready
smartphones we're taking a platform
approach with standalone headsets
working with partners to build some
great devices to start we worked with
Qualcomm to create a daydream standalone
headset reference design a sort of
device blueprint
partners can build from and working
closely with two amazing consumer
electronics companies to build the first
headsets first HTC the company that
created the vibe we're excited about it
too they're a leader in VR and we're
delighted to be working with them on a
standalone VR headset for daydream and
second Lenovo we've been partners for
years working together on tango and now
we're excited to work with them on VR
these devices will start to come to
market later this year so that's the
update on VR great momentum with apps
more daydream ready phones on the way
and a new category of devices that we
think people are going to love so let's
turn to augmented reality a lot of us
were introduced to the idea of AR last
year with Pokemon go the app gave us a
glimpse of AR and it showed us just how
cool it can be to have digital objects
show up in our world well we've been
working in this space since 2013 with
tango a sensing technology that enables
devices to understand space more like we
do two years ago in 2015 we released a
Developer Kit then last year we shipped
the first consumer ready tango phone and
I'm excited to announce that the
second-generation tango phone the Asus
zenfone AR will go on sale this summer
now looking at the slides you may notice
it notice a trend the devices are
getting smaller and you can imagine far
more devices having this capability in
the future it's been awesome to see what
developers have done with the technology
and one thing we've seen clearly is that
AR is most powerful when it's tightly
coupled to the real world and the more
precisely the better that's why we've
been working with the Google Maps team
on a service that can give devices
access to very precise location
information indoors it's kind of like
GPS but instead of talking to satellites
to figure out where it is your phone
looks for distinct visual features in
the environment and it triangulates with
those so you have GPS we call this VPS
Google's visual positioning service and
we think it's going to be incredibly
useful in a whole bunch of places for
example imagine you're at Lowe's
a home-improvement store that has
basically everything and if you've been
there you know it's really big and we've
all had that moment when you're
struggling to find that one weird random
screwdriver thing imagine in the future
your phone could just take you to that
exact screwdriver and point it out to
you on the shelf turns out we can do
this with VPS let me show you how and
this is working today
so here we are walking down an aisle at
Lowe's and the phone will find these key
visual feature points as you can see
they're in yellow by comparing the
feature points against previously
observed ones those colorful dots in the
back the phone can figure out exactly
where it is in space down to within a
few centimeters so GPS can get you to
the door and then VPS can get you to the
exact item that you're looking for
further out
further out imagine what this technology
could mean to people with impaired
vision for example VPS in an audio-based
interface could transform how they make
their way through the world and it
combines so many things that Google is
good at mapping computer vision
distributed computing and we think
precise location will be critical for
camera based interfaces so VPS will be
one of the core capabilities of google
lens really excited about the
possibilities here so last thing i
wanted to share is something that we've
been working on that brings many of
these capabilities together in a really
important area and that's education two
years ago we launched expeditions which
is a tool for teachers to take their
classes on virtual reality field trips
and two million students have used it
today we're excited to announce that
we're adding a new capability to
expeditions AR mode which enables kind
of the ultimate show-and-tell right in
the classroom if we could roll the video
please all right want to see a volcano
three two one look at that lobby like
this coming out of that attend you're an
airplane and fly over the tornado what
do you see we're learning about DNA and
genes things that we can't see and so
the most exciting thing for me with the
AR technology was that I could see kids
get an aha moment that I couldn't get by
just telling them about it the minute I
saw it pop up on the screen I mean when
get up and walk to it you actually get
to turn around and look at things from
all angles so it gave us a nice
perspective see if you can figure out
what that might be based on what you
know about the respiratory system I got
to see where the alveoli branched off
and I can look inside them
see how everything worked which I never
saw before it was really really cool
we're just delighted with the response
we're seeing so far and we'll be rolling
this out later in the year so VR and a
are two different flavors of what you
might call immersive computing computing
that works more like we do we think
that's a big idea and in time we see VR
and AR changing how we work and play
live and learn and all that I talked
about here these are just the first
steps but we can see where all this goes
and we're incredibly excited about
what's ahead thanks so much
back to sundar we wanted to make machine
learning an open-source project so that
everyone outside of Google could use the
same system reusing inside
it's incredible when you open source
platform when you see what people can do
on top of it
are we really excited about the momentum
behind tensorflow it's already the most
popular ml repository on github and
we're going to push it further
we are also announcing the tensorflow
research cloud we are giving away
thousand people use which is 180 better
flops of computing took academics and
researchers for free so that they can do
more stuff with it I'm always amazed by
the stories I hear from developers when
I meet them I want to highlight one
young developer today Abu Carter from
Chicago he is used tensorflow
to help improve health for everyone
let's take a look my name is Abu I am a
high school student 17 years old my
freshman year I remember googling
machine learning had no clue what it
meant that's a really cool thing about
the Internet is that someone's already
doing it so you can just YouTube it and
it's right there it was a minute I
really saw what machine learning can do
I kind of like hid something within me
this like need to build things to help
people my parents are immigrants from
Ivy understand it's not easy coming in
the only reason we made it through some
of the times that we did was because
people showed acts of kindness seeing
that at an early age was enough for me
to understand that helping people always
comes back to you and then it kind of
hit me
a way where I could actually genuinely
help people mammograms are the cheapest
imaging format there is it's the most
accessible to people all around the
world but one of the biggest problems
that we see in breast cancer is
misdiagnosis so I decided I was going to
build a system for early detection of
breast cancer tumors that's accessible
to everyone and that's more accurate how
was I gonna do it
machine learning the biggest most
extensive resource that I've used
for call tensorflow I've spent so many
hours going really deep into these open
source libraries and just figuring out
how it works
eventually I wrote a whole system that
can help really I'll just make their
decisions yeah I'm by no means a wizard
at machine learning I'm completely
self-taught I'm in high school
i YouTubed and just found my way through
it you don't know about that kid in
Brazil that might have a groundbreaking
idea or that kid in Somalia you don't
know that they have these ideas but if
you can open-source your tools you can
give them a little bit of hope that they
can actually conquer what they're
thinking of I will started this as a
school project and it's continued to
build it on its own
we are very very fortunate to have a boy
and his family here with us today
thank you for joining us enjoy IO we've
been talking about machine learning in
terms of how it will power new
experiences in research but it's also
important we think about how this
technology can have an immediate impact
on people's lives by creating
opportunities for economic empowerment
46% of US employers say they face talent
shortages and have issues filling open
job positions while job seekers may be
looking for openings right next door
there is a big disconnect here just like
we focused our contributions to teachers
and students through Google for
education we want to better connect
employers and jobseekers through a new
initiative Google for jobs Google for
jobs is a commitment to use our products
to help people find work it's a complex
multifaceted problem but we've been
investing a lot over the past year and
we've made significant profits last
November we announced a cloud jobs API
think of it as a first fully end to end
pre-trained vertical machine learning
model through google cloud which we give
to employers FedEx Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson
HealthSouth Keri builder and we are
expanding to many more employers so in
Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson's carrier site they
found that applicants were 18 percent
more likely to apply to a job suggesting
the matching is working more efficiently
and so far or over four and a half
million people have interacted with this
API but as we started working on this we
realized the first step for many people
when they start looking for a job is
searching on Google so it's like other
search challenges we have work in the
past
so we built a new feature in search with
the goal that no matter who you are or
what kind of job you are looking for you
can find the job postings that are right
for you and as part of this effort we
work hard to include jobs across
experience and wage levels including
jobs that have traditionally been much
harder to search and classify think
retail jobs Hospitality jobs etc to do
this well we have worked with many
partners LinkedIn monster Facebook carry
builder Glassdoor and many more so let's
take a look at how it works let's say
you're come to Google and you start
searching for retail jobs and you're
from Pittsburgh
we understand that you can scroll down
and click into this immersive experience
and we immediately start showing the
most relevant jobs for you and you can
filter you can choose full time and as
you can see you can drill down easily I
want to look at jobs which are posted in
the past three days so you can do that
now you're looking at retail jobs in
Pittsburgh
posted within the last three days you
can also filter by job titles it turns
out employees and employers use many
different terminologies for example
retail could mean a store clerk a sales
representative store manager we use
machine learning to cluster
automatically and so that we can bring
all the relevant jobs for you as you
scroll through it you will notice that
we even shook commute times it turns out
to be an important criteria for many
people and we will soon add a filter for
that as well and if you find something
that's of interest to you
so maybe the retail position in drawers
and you can click on it and you end up
going to it right away and you're one
click away you can scroll to find more
information if you want and you're one
click away from clicking and applying
there it's a powerful tool we are
addressing jobs of every skill level and
experience level and we are committed to
making these tools work for everyone
it's part of building it we literally
talked to hundreds of people so whether
you're in a community college looking
for a barista job a teacher who's
relocating across the country and you
want teaching jobs or someone who is
looking for work in construction the
products should do a great job of
bringing that information to you we are
rolling this out in the u.s. in the
coming weeks and then we're going to
expand it to more countries in the
future
I'm personally enthusiastic for this
initiative because it addresses an
important need and taps our core
capabilities as a company from searching
and organizing information to AI and
machine learning it's been a busy
morning you know we've talked about this
important shift from a mobile first to
AI first world and we are driving it
forward across all our products and
platforms so that all of you can build
powerful experiences for new users
everywhere it'll take all of us working
together to bring the benefits of
technology to everyone I believe we're
on the verge of solving some of the most
important problems we face that's our
hope let's do it together
thanks for your time today and enjoy
Google IO
all right everybody
there you go Google i/o 2017 at least
the first keynote for the day there will
be plenty of other workshops that are
going on today and tomorrow that they're
doing another keynote tomorrow I believe
but we won't be we won't be you know
here for that but you guys you can also
actually watch directly on Google's own
IO page all the keynotes are they're
broadcasting them as well so you guys
can check that out the next couple days
we saw a lot of stuff here we know that
you all saw a lot of stuff here as well
we're gonna stick around maybe for the
next 15-20 minutes and talk about this
but we also want you all to call in the
show and let us know what you thought
maybe things you liked we will first
talk about our thoughts on all these
things but the number down below one
eight eight eight nine hundred cien et
that's two six three eight give us a
call and we'll jump on Lexia first
impressions how about let's start off
with the highest things that you liked
the things that I liked okay so they did
lead with the most interesting stuff oh
yeah which was home assistant coming to
iOS big boom that was interesting and
Google lens so this seems like a
culmination of all of the things that
Google's been working on for a long time
like think Google Goggles and image
recognition machine learning everything
coming together so the demo they showed
was that one actually blew my mind I
think blew your mind too bro is that
Wi-Fi connection one you hold your phone
up with lens on it in front of your
Wi-Fi access code password and so on and
then it will automatically connect like
on that label on that barcode label
that's on your router that yeah that was
sick and you know in addition that just
the fact that this whole Google lens is
integrated directly into the assistant
just amps up the power and the level of
detail and information including using
the GPS location right they showed a
street front look like somewhere like
New York and because it knew where you
were and could identify the signage it
knew what restaurants you were looking
at and was giving you like reviews and
data on each of those as you pan I mean
this is like next-level stuff when we're
talking about that I'll let you continue
but yeah I thought that was that was
wild I agree it's just like
Shazaam for objects seriously when they
when you can put up the camera to a
flower and it's like oh this is this
particular variety of flower just going
okay that's something that I probably
don't need but I think it will come
incredibly handy for a lot of other
things this is of course going to be
integrated into all of the other Google
products like Google photos which there
was a very long section about Google
photo line let me just let me just say
that photo books are not interesting I
don't know if I'm the only one out there
that thinks that way I've got a handrail
right yeah I just had to jump in because
okay I do like let there Shutterfly
there all these services out there too
for them to say that it's hard to do it
it's not but part of building a photo
book is actually putting care into it
breaking down like why you put picture a
B and C what I saw that that was a photo
book for lazy people that are too busy
that don't give a crap and I I even
tweet them like oh they forgot what
makes a photo book important this thing
called love from where is the love the
heart the heart so it was like could you
imagine you as a lady and your man is
like your man's like or whatever you as
a guy whatever whatever side the coin
you're on oh I made this photo book for
you and it yeah it's a sequential event
of photos you didn't pick any of them
you let the machine do it it laid it out
and you just handed that is so
impersonal and on top of that Google did
all the photo editing for you correcting
everything and all of that I get it if
you if you're like if if you want it you
think you're gonna press someone that
doesn't know what Google photo boats is
about you might actually get away with
it I might give you props
but damn like a photo book is supposed
there supposed to be some Karen thought
put into that's all I'm just old school
like that I'm sorry I agree I mean also
the other stuff that I was intrigued
about that I don't think they really
kind of each out as much as I wanted was
a whole conversational aspect coming to
home and the assistant I really just
want to see that working because we've
talked about this for quite some time
and I know it's being worked on in the
behind the scenes but it's been a year
since like last year's Google i/o when
we first saw that we saw a couple of
different examples
having more natural conversation and
also being able to type to the assistant
rather than use your voice and calling
coming to Google home was another big
one it was a big like huh take that
Amazon yeah I think I think that uh
again the Google assistant is going next
level I think that you saw things that
when you talk about other companies and
how they're trying to integrate their
Google assistant we already knew the
Google assistant was smarter than any AI
the whole Google Lenz integration they
took it to the next level and then in
addition with a Google home leveraging
the assistant they're starting to put
all these pieces together in really
interesting ways in dare I say the e
word ecosystem like the smart could this
be the beginning of the smartest
ecosystem we have ever seen by a company
like that that's what it feels like and
looks like they're getting there so
that's exciting I mean it you know
whatever they talk about you know being
able to I would I don't really care per
se as much of like I'm watching TV and
you could see things on the screen but
the way that can talk and interact call
recognize your voices know your calendar
this is this is all stuff that's going
to be rolling out this year and I went
out when we hear rumors about Apple
making a smart speaker um that got a lot
to live up I don't I don't I'm this
ballet I got a lot to work if you gotta
come out with the Apple bravado you
better be careful about that right now
if you're gonna say it's got Siri and it
can use your TV it's not going to be
it's just there's no way it's gonna be
as smart I don't this is one of those
few keynotes by a tech company where you
heard the N word neural but yeah
machine learning the M word like you
hear it in so many places but the proof
is in the pudding you can actually see
how it exists it's in the DNA now and
they're kind of really capturing that we
are the smarted although yes we do give
up our information and there will always
be this security cloud hanging over just
how much does Google know how much are
we willing to give and that's up to you
personally you know how much you're
really willing to give to these tech
companies period but man it the smartest
company out there right now especially
with what we saw with AI the Anschluss
the AI stuff was really exciting to see
and also it was a big a big
take big attack on Amazon really there
was a whole bunch of stuff I mean Amazon
just released the echo show the device
with the screen in it and then Google
comes out and goes well we can kind of
do that as well but we don't need to
release an entirely new device hey we're
just going to use our ecosystem like you
said Brad we're going to use our
chromecast so if you want to see results
or something on the screen well there
you go if we want to use it on your
phone you can see something on your
phone too so really they're doing
something very clever they don't need to
kind of diversify their product range
through hardware they're trying to do
that through software and that's what
Google's real strength is Amazon
strength is definitely in the hardware
yeah and obviously their voice assistant
Alexa working across all those devices
but Google's just basically going why
would you buy a different device at
every room in your house you're just
going to need one Google home and you
can TV is going to be existing in the
living room just add a chromecast to and
your phone which you already have anyway
kind of goes with you from room to room
so there's no real point in buying a new
device for every single room of your
house yeah I think it's really we'll
talk more about other things we saw the
keynote things that we liked and maybe
didn't like we do have a phone call from
our friend John in Michigan I'm gonna go
to you in a second and just remember
guys and gals call us on the line we're
just going to hang around for a few more
minutes just to talk about the and wrap
up the stuff from Google i/o John can
you hear me my man after earlier hey
thanks for calling
CNET live in Google i/o Lexi and Stephen
are in the house welcome to the show
what you want to talk about the one
thing I wanna talk about is the
assistant and how it's going to change a
lot of things in the next like five to
ten years you really think about it
through different age groups you know
easy it's going to be for elders to just
kind of actually get the technology like
though it's like one two three these
kids are already like you know getting
smarter as I go like infants and whatnot
let's imagine learning you know Spanish
at like four or five years old which is
crazy in a sense that you can like put
it up put the photo ends up and then you
can teach your kids it's going to be
totally interactive in the next 5-10
years it's going to be amazing I think
it's amazing in two different reasons
and it's just
education level that's gonna that's
gonna bring a higher like pedestal to it
but not only these little podunk towns
like you know in rural states Michigan
Missouri also that's going to create a
lot of opportunities for a lot of people
as well as long as they don't take you
know there's always kind of this whole
thing like technology taking over jobs
versus you know but I think what you're
you're more talking about is raising the
education level and improving basically
some knowledge and skills for for those
higher level jobs is that what you're
alluding to yeah absolutely yeah yeah I
mean it's just insane to think that this
technology has came and 5-10 years and
it's just going to get a little bit
better and better and better each
generation and it I'm actually really
happy for like a you know minorities and
who don't have the capabilities of
getting a great education like that this
stuff is really good I think you make a
great point just of the accessibility
let's even just talk about purely you
you know although they I we both felt
that they didn't really need to spend
time on YouTube in this keynote it was
almost like they didn't have any big
announcements so that's another point
but to get to your whole point about
just technology the democratization of
media and being able to have multiple
voices from all different backgrounds
being able to be represented on a
platform like YouTube that is thanks to
technology right and those are the types
of things that you're talking about
being able to open that up for everyone
and that's kind of one of the beauties
right of technology in general even when
you talk about developing countries all
of a sudden getting something like you
know fiber plugged in there and being
able to have a faster internet bandwidth
and we do over here I'm just you know
being able to there's there's also the
gap the rights some of the technologies
so far ahead that you're leaving people
to dust but I think overall in general
technology has helped lift it up people
in in different ways so I think there's
always no matter what we're always going
to have some level of marginalization
unfortunately right but access has
improved and no matter what that's going
to help so I thanks so much for your
call with John we really appreciate that
thanks John oh absolutely
all right cool take care hey real quick
he talked about you know elders being
able to use this a lot easier
and someone in the chat room immediately
said we got Google home for my grandma
and she refuses to use it my dad is the
same way about our echo dot like he's he
doesn't want it he doesn't want to talk
around it you know so there is like this
there's a disconnection there with the
older people and using this technology
so I'm curious to see how that's gonna
be implemented later you know I think to
Lexi's point the more conversational it
is the better I you know you know what
if you can find this actually a beach
and while we're talking us SNL did an
Amazon echo yet yes that just because
we're time out voice and a I pull it up
we'll talk a little bit more about other
things it looks like we have someone
online too so I'm just going to take
them right now and oh if you're on the
phone and you can hear me and you have
your computer turned down and welcome to
seeing that live you're here with Brian
Lexi and Stephen what's up hello hey
what's going on what's it wow they
really punch me through that's cool
hey I was a tripping out about how
Google assistant is now in the iPhone
yeah and I just feel like at any it
seems like Google can see that Apple is
struggling and they're like well you
know what since our cellphone sales were
down with the pixel let's just uh move
in on Apple and yeah take over Apple
well I don't know if it's all if it's
going to be let's take over Apple I
think Google's very smart with trying to
kind of be platform agnostic but at the
same time be very Google and and centric
as well to make sure that you're in the
Google ecosystem even if you're across
platforms because you know iOS users and
Apple users a very dedicated user base
and Apple is a massive company and so it
doesn't really make sense to ignore that
user base even though statistically
there are less iPhones in use than
Android phones in the world so Google's
very clever in making sure that all of
us all of its ways is trying to talk to
people and through all the apps that it
has that it's trying to reach as many
platforms as possible because if you
think about it most people on
it's probably going to be using Google
as their primary search engine anyway
and most people probably have a gmail
account so it makes sense to have a lot
of the functionality available so you
can go cross device not necessarily that
iOS users are going to end up migrating
to Android that's pretty product
probably pretty unlikely unless you're
constantly looking for kind of the best
hardware all the time but I think it's
it's a really great idea that Google's
decided to make sure that it's got the
ability to reach users everywhere that
they are not just on Android
specifically yeah while I love the Apple
hardware but the ecosystem drives me
nuts but if they came out with like a
Google Play edition iPhone on point that
is the Holy Grail Chris that is the holy
grail like right there right like come
on but you know yeah we know that we do
super Sneaky and they're you know
they're not going to say oh we're taking
over Apple because it would just be this
huge thing so what they're doing is
they're like oh yeah here look try our
Google stuff through apple it's not like
apples sharing Siri with Android but
sure enough Android sharing everything
with Apple and let's be real I don't
think Android wants Siri you know you
know saying it's like come on now like
oh hey guys here's our Siri app Android
users not going to like that way yeah
Google assistant all the way it's
definitely insane and it's a fun ride to
watch and I'm also interested in seeing
a and a phone that has the like tango
like I Google what is it the sorry the
VR daydream your camera B not covered
because the Google daydream VR it has a
cover over the camera but it'd be nice
to build us a little window to see
what's going on outside of your phone so
you can walk around and not bump into
stuff are you telling me you wanna wear
a VR headset in public while walking
because that sounds like let's just say
you know Starbucks that'd be nice I
don't know order my coffee and not worry
about knocking over my muffin I'm
watching a video and looking like a tool
anyway you won't look like a tool with
the VR headset on right just knocking
over a copy of the problem right kidding
yeah it's a cool I'm noticing that it'd
be nice to be able to because they're
doing this whole a our VR merger thing
and so I'm surprised that they haven't
come out with the phone that has you
know the dual camera feature where you
can see overlay cuz I'm gonna draw their
own you know what's going around their
cell phone their face all the time
anyways you might as well just wear it
on your head yes it's coming it is it is
correct so Christopher thanks so much
for calling man we really appreciate it
yeah oh thank you very much this is
great awesome
all right have a great day bye so I got
that uh that's an elven okay I just
wanted because we're time out yeah we'll
show the video we'll talk about a couple
things and we'll wrap this up but yeah
this is a an SNL echo video like so for
help blasted thing but the latest
technology isn't always easy to use for
people of a certain age kids um bought
me a busted machine again that's why
Amazon partnered with AARP to present
the new Amazon echo silver the only
smart speaker device designed
specifically to be used by the greatest
generation it's super loud and responds
to any name even remotely close to Alexa
so they can find out the weather Allegra
what is the weather outside it is 74
degrees and sunny
huh it is 74 degrees and sunny we're
outside what about the temperature
outside is 74 degrees and sunny I don't
know about that alright anyways it's
it's fine were there any other let's see
highlight we talked about the system we
talked about the home we talked about
the machine learning low low lights were
spending the YouTube part it was like I
don't know it just it didn't help move
anything for they they were pushing
their super chat feature which is like
yeah super chats there but you know it's
a monetized way of getting attention I
know they said okay find the money going
here we'll be going a great cause but
that's not always the case it's not like
every person who's doing a livestream
yet is gonna be like oh yeah this is all
going to charity the idea is that
creators are earning money from the chat
and you're getting donations from your
viewers in order to promote your chats
higher and higher up so you can see I
don't know if we do super chat on the
livestream okay I was always asking
chatters and they're like no no way no
one wants to spend five bucks they're
like hey let me treat read my comment
yeah five bucks please please do that
I'm in terms of other things that were
highlights from the keynote I was really
surprised that they've kind of buried
Android oh yeah all the way at the end
and we didn't find out what I was gonna
be called either they didn't even
announce a naming but even joke about it
and there was so many like double
entendre sinuan yeah we've been naming
yeah we had um we had a lot of stuff we
had Android Oh face
we had fluid experience experiences I
all those things were in there yeah I
thought I thought they were gonna call
the new VR stand-alone headset
the wet dream instead of the daydream
based on their track record from today
was I'm trying to white balance
something I'm not but why you getting
out the Kleenexes and why is he pulling
out the Kleenex and paper towels right
that's white balancing the camera okay
anyways that's how you know we're pretty
much wrapped up so anyways there you go
there you have it Google i/o lot a lot
of great things that were really
interesting the top first half was
probably like is all the sweet stuff but
get ready also they talked about kind of
the Android go which is the scaled-down
version that will match future versions
of Android for kind of entry-level
phones that's an initiative right for
developing countries or you know
entry-level phones to get Android on
there but we will let you know
everything else that's going on we have
people on site they're breaking down
what they saw there's demos um will have
all the coverage here at cnet.com and so
until next time I think our next keynote
will be June 5th WWE which will be WWDC
with Apple uh oh
well the region will be they drop will
they be dropping good apples or bad
apples we're gonna find out so Lexie
thanks so much for hanging with that
friend thanks everyone
mr. Beecham thank you guys all for
watching it's been fun it's been real
all right we will see you guys on June
the fifth stick here cnet.com for all
the stuff coming forward and we'll catch
you guys in a couple more weeks all
right please take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
