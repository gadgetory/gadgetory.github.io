a Mercedes c-class the big idea here is
to simplify and surface what your phone
does your iPhone any of the five class
phones 5 5 s 5c will work on this
through their Thunderbolt cable not
through bluetooth at this point let's
take a look at what it'll do first of
all obviously the big one telephony and
communications and because this is the
Mercedes
don't touch the screen Germans don't
like that everything is naturally
controlled through Siri voice command
with whom would you like to speak call
John Appleseed calling Johnny Appleseed
and notice how that calling as well as
messaging both SMS and iMessage are done
in an eyes free mode Syrian Siri out no
text composition on the screen maps and
turn-by-turn navigation are via Apple
maps of course and again Siri driven and
now in terms of media it's not just I
stuff there's also some podcasts you can
bring in Spotify that's a third-party
vendor there's like heart radio from
Clear Channel and of course there could
be others but I think the real power
play here is the integration of I radio
because the car is a radio environment
and finally this is a bi-level set up
here's car play with the Apple world go
to command which is Mercedes interface
and it's still there as well I should
also note you've got two voice command
systems here Siri which runs the Apple
layer Mercedes voice command runs the
Mercedes layer so you've got sort of a
forked approach of technology now
Volvo's also a launch partner for apple
carplay doing this a little differently
than Mercedes in a couple levels first
of all they use touchscreens in Volvo
cars so that adds a third layer of
interacting with car play not just by
voice or control knob secondly Volvo has
more evenly integrated car play it's
sort of at the same level as their built
in technology where Mercedes kinds of
squirrels it away into its own little
happy little ghetto shall we say it's an
interesting point because car maker by
car makers would have to make that
decision how much do you have to dig to
get into car play and when you are in it
does it relate to the other connected
systems in the vehicle or is it more off
in its own silo for its part Mercedes is
like every other
carmaker not at all interested in giving
up their prized center screen but at
least willing to sublet it we simply see
people bringing their smartphone to the
car they rely on their smartphone on the
daily life they have anything on it in
the end we will have both customers
customers for the embedded world and
customers for them as we call it broad
in world when you bring in your device a
couple of good even Ferraris in on the
act of launching with car play from
Apple and you may say okay well I'm not
gonna buy a Ferrari but it's an
important indication of how companies
that really don't specialize in cabin
tech can leapfrog into the realm of
those who do by partnering with Apple
and of course it doesn't hurt either
brand to be mingled together they both
love that about the deal
where's Google you ask well coming but
in a different form under the guise of
the open automotive alliance basically
Android in the car out egm Honda and
Hyundai are on board along with Google
and NVIDIA so far nothing tangible to
show but expect a similar path as
carplay but with Google having stronger
services and with glass which Hyundai
and Mercedes have already shown working
with their cars in concept form most
recently Microsoft joined this race
showing a very early concept of its
technology through their metro tile
interface those live tiles they do on
phones and tablets could either be a
great single glance in car status screen
or just way too much going on this is a
wild card player that you haven't heard
as much about its mirrorlink a former
Nokia technology now more of an open
standard using existing technology
standards like IP Wi-Fi Bluetooth and
USB to be able to bring up and translate
pretty much any phone into any head
units it's by no means the brand name
that Android or iOS and Apple are
however it's got a certain universality
that might appeal to car makers
mirrorlink would seem to offer the most
flexibility and the least adult
supervision if you will over what the
phone displays on the car screen and how
its currently being pursued by VW Honda
and Toyota this is the first era when
we've seen car makers and well branded
dominant mobile platforms come together
in a way where you can actually tell
what
Oh platform it is in the past mobile
services and phones were translated into
things that were kind of Frankenstein's
on the dash to be honest and the timing
seems right on another front the US
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration is about to issue its
first-ever rules on portable device
distraction in cars giving these new
integrations perhaps a whiff of
government approval if they do it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
