with a sleek glass and metal body and
top-notch specs it's non removable
battery and lack of an expandable
storage option will anger a lot of
longtime fans but if you can get past
that you're gonna find a fluid large
screen device that's a lot of fun to use
and that does more than other phones out
there this is a big phone that doesn't
feel too big despite its spacious 5.7
inch display curved glass edges on the
back feel good in the hand it's just too
bad that this smudgy fingerprints tends
to pile up down at the bottom of the
phone the S Pen Stylus clicks into place
use it to navigate around draw crop
write and preview items I really like
the redesign shortcuts menu that lives
on the screen it never got in my way and
adding your favorite apps is a real
bonus and you know what else comes in
handy being able to draw a quick note
even when the screen is off there are no
major updates to the custom interface
that runs on top of Android but
everything seems just a little smoother
than before like a cleaner stylus menu
and a native camera app that gives more
visual guides
speaking of which the note 5 comes with
a 16 megapixel camera on the back and a
5 megapixel lens on the front there are
lots of filters and auto HDR and the pro
mode gets you extra settings photographs
are clean and detailed especially when
taken outside but some night and
low-light shots weren't quite as good
for fans of selfies there are a lot of
beautification settings I don't know
about you but they freak me out so
personally I turn them off inside the
phone you've got an octa-core processor
and a fairly high capacity battery
remember you can't take it out storage
is either 32 gigabytes or 64 gigabytes
and there are 4 gigs of RAM which is a
good thing I really like the note 5 it's
attractive and has a solid camera and I
like writing and navigating with the
stylus if you're looking for a high-end
super size phone it's a phone you should
definitely consider even though there
are other cheaper phones out there
I'm Jessica's all-court for CNN and you
should learn more about the note 5's
