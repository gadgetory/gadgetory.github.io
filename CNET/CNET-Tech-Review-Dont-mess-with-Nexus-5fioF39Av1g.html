all Android all the time almost we got a
taste of Ice Cream Sandwich running on
the Samsung Galaxy Nexus two new tablets
from amazon and barnes and noble and how
to make google music work for you plus
brian coolies favorite cars of the year
so far it's all coming up right now hi
everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the Cena tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of text plus we offer our own
unique tech wisdom in the form of the
bottom line let's start things off with
the good smartphone and android fans
have been waiting a long time for the
arrival of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
although the phone itself isn't as
exciting as the OS running it kent
german has our first look at this hotly
anticipated handset hi I'm Kent chairman
section editor here at cnet com today we
take a first look at the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus now if you're an Android fan and
even if you're not you probably know
about this phone this is an unlocked gsm
version we're using it on tmobile this
is the first phone to offer ice cream
sandwich which is Google's newest
operating system or the newest update of
its operating system now Ice Cream
Sandwich has a whole lot of stuff in it
I'm going to concentrate on the phone
for this video though when you take away
Ice Cream Sandwich you're left with
actually a pretty standard Android
device it does look like the Nexus S and
a lot of the galaxy s phones before it
so you'll notice it has that same really
thin profile the dark color it has that
contour design which is designed to
mimic the shape of your head is pretty
big as a 4.6 five Super AMOLED display
the funny thing though it's because you
have this bar down here at the bottom
that has icons you can rotate in and out
not all of the screen is usable it's
plenty big for a smartphone not so big
for ice cream sandwich was Jessica will
talk about but this display is bright
its colorful its vivid you get five home
screens you can populate them as you
like you can cycle do a couple pages
here between widgets and apps you go
over here you'll see a big tray of
widgets and then you can drag these to
the home screens down at the bottom you
have three controls there's back
there's one that will take you home and
there's a button that will open the
screen so you've seen recently on the
back you have a little bit of a textured
material it is a nice change over the
slick exterior here I have to say it
like a lot of Samsung Galaxy devices and
like the Nexus S it does feel very light
in the hand it almost feels a little too
fragile but it just feels just a little
wispy and I really would be afraid of
dropping it even once on a hard surface
just feel that would break and gosh
sometimes they even get the feeling like
it could snap in half so that something
Samsung has always done just their
devices don't seem that rugged or sturdy
internal features that don't have to do
with ice cream sandwich you'll find
everything there that you're used to
you'll get messaging you'll get
organizer apps you'll get access to the
android market all the google apps
there's a 5-megapixel camera it does
have a camcorder everything you like
about Google will be on this phone of
course since it is a Nexus device it is
a pure Google experience so there's no
sort of manufacturer overlay or any kind
of carrier overlay so you have to do
with HTC sense or motoblur or anything
like that I do like the design of this
phone I like the features but of course
just remember when you take out ice
cream sandwich you don't have a whole
lot their ice cream sandwich is really
what this phone is about i'm kent german
and this is the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
gosh Kent please do be careful with that
phone it's the only one we've gotten
around here I guess he was able to keep
from breaking it long enough for Jessica
dole court to get her hands on it as
Kent promised here's her first look at
the latest version of Android Ice Cream
Sandwich it is finally here at the next
version of android which is better known
as ice cream sandwich and guess what it
is enormous I'm Jessica doll court for
cnet and i'm going to show you around ok
well i can't show you everything because
we don't have half an hour but i will
hit the high points first of all there's
the interface google has pretty much
reworked almost every single element
making it look really fresh but also
familiar since one of the goals was
creating one single operating system for
tablets and smartphones there are a lot
of elements from the tablet focused
honeycomb OS in here like the new
on-screen navigational controls Ice
Cream Sandwich loses the search and menu
navigation buttons but it gains a button
to see mo
recent programs just like in honeycomb
search is definitely more prominent as
well and Google has tried to do away
with needing a menu you can launch voice
controls from the microphone button in
the search bar menu buttons by the way
now look like a three dot colon folders
are another new feature as in iOS you
just drag and drop icons on top of one
another to create a new folder there are
five icons on the bottom of the home
screens and you can customize these two
just by dragging and dropping them off
and on the notifications tray looks
really beautiful now and you can swipe
away notifications that you no longer
want to see that's sort of a new hidden
feature the app tray looks pretty
similar as before but now it also holds
widgets that you can drag and drop to
the home screens and even resize I
personally think that the widgets
portion looks a little bit cluttered and
the grid indicators are really confusing
if you don't know what they're there for
I do like the android market button that
you can access from any screen within
the app tray google has also completely
reworked how it handles contacts the
entire look and feel of the app is new
but so is how you use it the key is to
tap your buddies contact image to call
text or email when you dial the phone
goes into full screen mode which looks
cool but it doesn't really fit into the
aesthetic of the home screens and when
you get an incoming call you can drag
the ring over one of three icons to
either answer hang up or send a text
gmail get some really neat enhancements
as well there are new graphics of course
but also some neat touches in a really
clean and logical interface for example
when you start typing a name Google will
auto suggest the address and include
your friends photos as well the menu bar
makes it really easy to add attachments
and get to settings and there are some
really great spell check features too
plus you can simply drag and drop
selected text now not just press buttons
to cut and paste the camera app also got
a makeover and the biggest change is
that panorama mode is now front and
center I'm not really sure that this is
necessary but it is a nice feature to
have regardless it worked smoothly in my
tests to it but even better in my
opinion is the gallery which gets new
icons for easily sharing photos and it
gets a full suite of editing
and those can reduce red I sharpen
straighten crop correct color and also
add effects the video tool lets you do
time-lapse now which is very cool and it
also adds some silly effects which are
fun but also frankly very creepy there
are also some wacky and sort of
Impractical backgrounds that you can
superimpose into your videos for an
extra life the one thing i don't like
about the gallery is how cluttered and
visually busy the tiles are when you're
looking at your pictures or screenshots
and i wish there was more space between
them because my eyes are frankly just
going a little bit nuts trying to find
the photo i want amidst all of this now
i know that what you really want to know
about is unlocking the phone with your
face google admits that face unlock
isn't the most secure especially because
a doppelganger of yours or a photo of
you will also unlock the phone but it is
cool to see facial recognition
implemented in android but seriously
it's more of a conversational piece than
anything else i'm sure that you also
want to know about Android Beam which
uses a radiofrequency standard called
NFC to pass information from one
compatible phone to another since all i
have is the one phone right here i have
not been able to test this feature at
the moment so overall ice cream sandwich
is a really huge update that touches
almost all of the attributes of android
it's powerful and yes it succeeds in
many many areas however there is a
little bit of discord when it comes to
some of the graphical themes that I
think can be a little confusing and
honestly it shouldn't be there as part
of a polished and mature operating
system I also think that ice cream
sandwich will look even better on a
tablet than it does on a phone so Google
has a little bit of work to do but this
really is a serious stuff up into
Android adulthood I'm jessica's all
court you can read the full review of
ice cream sandwich and the Galaxy Nexus
smartphone on cnet and clock calm
Ice Cream Sandwich seems to be following
the general Android trend pretty amazing
but not all the way baked still pretty
good start in other Android news the
last couple of weeks have seen the
arrival of two new full-fledged tablets
from two major ebook retailers first up
Scott Stein is here to show off the
latest from barnes &amp;amp; noble the simply
named nuke tablet hi I'm Scott Stein
senior editor at cnet com and last year
the nook color changed the tablet
landscape for a lot of people by
introducing an affordable two hundred
fifty dollar 7-inch color tablet that
actually was rootable and was an Android
device and could compete with the ipad
at a price that nobody had really
thought about before well this holiday
it's up the ante because the amazon has
the kindle fire which is a 7-inch
android tablet to compete with the nook
color Barnes and Noble has fired back by
introducing the Nook Tablet now this is
sort of the iphone 4s iphone 4 of nook
products because from the outside this
looks a lot like the new color now there
are some definite design changes in
terms of the finish and the feel almost
like a teflon type soft touch on the
sides here but it really does look like
a new color but the innards are changed
it's a dual-core processor there's one
gig of ram and this has an improved
screen there's an IPS display made by LG
now these storage options are also
improved their 16 gigabytes of on-board
storage with a microSD card slot that's
upgradeable to an extra thirty two
gigabytes of storage that's a big deal
because the Kindle Fire has only 8
gigabytes of on-board storage of which
only about 6 gigabytes are accessible so
there's a big leap in terms of what you
can store on barnes and noble's nook
tablet but what the new clacks is a
cloud ecosystem that's comparable to
what amazon gives you amazon has a cloud
music player they have video on demand
that's really great and a great
alternative to itunes and of course they
have their book assortment and there are
a wide variety of color magazines that
also allows subscriptions if you already
have the print versions there's also a
large app library but it's not the same
this is an Android Gingerbread tablet
but it doesn't taste like gingerbread
because it's developed using its own
clothes
system that has a curated selection of
apps you will get some of the big hits
like Pandora Netflix Hulu Plus angry
birds but you're not gonna be able to
get that large variety unless you start
playing rooty tooty fresh and fruity and
root your tablet then you could play
around with some other features for
everybody else you're going to get a
closed environment still it's going to
provide most of those big basic features
and a nice web browsing experience but
maybe not quite as refined as what we
saw on the kindle fire now what it
really boils down to is how much of a
side loader are you and when I mean side
load I mean loading in media from your
computer as opposed to streaming it on
your device if you're that type of
person and that ranges from mp3 files to
with video probably stuff that's not drm
then the Nook Tablet is going to be that
type of device for you in fact they're
counting on you to make it that type of
device with that type of storage doesn't
mean you can't use cloud video of a sort
in fact Netflix and Hulu Plus look
fantastic on this screen in fact it
looked a little bit better than it did
on the kindle fire and the IPS display
has really nice viewing angles nice
sharp colors and a good definition so it
seems like a video experience that
really holds up in streaming to what you
would get on an iPad it feels not that
dense but but definitely holdable in one
hand and something maybe you could take
out on the town with you take on a trip
a little bit easier than an iPad but the
limitations of that display especially
with web browsing don't quite feel the
same as what you get on a large 10 inch
screen like an iPad but they're
different devices there's a two hundred
fifty dollar device that is half the
price of what you pay for an iPad and
gives a lot of people a really nice
feature set of what they look for and
what they think of as a tablet now if
you're shopping for the holidays and
looking at the nook tablet versus the
kindle fire which a lot of people are
that extra fifty dollars is getting you
twice a storage an expandable card slot
arguably some nicer looking screen and
performance details may be a little bit
zippier but you're giving up those cloud
services and if you're using a kindle
already well there are a lot of books
and hey if you're a obviously or if a
prime subscriber and you're paying
seventy nine dollars a year there's a
lot of free content that Amazon is
angling
to you as an incentive to go with the
kindle fire now while the new color is
still out there it's 50 bucks less and
and has a few improvements over last
year's model if you're buying a new
product this year spend the extra fifty
dollars go with the nook tablet and be
glad for its improved specs and storage
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Nook Tablet biggest
selling point there the extra storage
especially if you're a big downloader
and we'll have more on the second big
tablet of the week the amazon kindle
fire later in the show so you can
compare now even though google music
isn't totally android centric it's
really android users who could
potentially benefit most from the new
service google music officially came out
of beta this week and Donald Bell has a
first look hey I'm Donal Bell and this
is a first look at google music this is
Google's music store and cloud locker
and a real competitor to itunes and
amazon on the web you can access the
Google Music Store by heading to market
android com / music and here you're
going to find a curated selection of
songs and albums along with top songs
and a free song of the day when you dive
into an album page you'll see album info
and pricing along with track listings
that offer 90 second song previews
you'll also notice a section here for
similar artists down here on the left
for discovering more music after
purchasing a song or an album the music
is instantly transferred over to your
online google music library and a
high-quality 320kbps mp3 format you also
have a share button here that will show
your music purchase to your friends on
Google's social network and allow them
to listen to the full track once for
free now unlike most music stores your
purchase music doesn't automatically
download to your computer if you really
want the file you'll need to find it on
Google's music library and select the
save to computer option this option is
only here for music you purchase from
google you can upload up to 20,000
additional songs from your own computer
and stream them at no charge but you
can't download them back down like you
can with purchase tracks the real payoff
here is for android phone users the
music store is also accessible through
the mobile version of
market and your purchased and uploaded
music tracks can be streamed back down
to you using Google's music app now it's
worth noting that the Google Music app
is a different app than what probably
came installed on your phone it's a free
download but if it doesn't have this
black headphone icon you've got the
wrong app iphone ipad and ipod touch
users can also access and stream their
music collection by heading to music
google com on their Safari web browser
so there you go that's Google Music in a
nutshell it's a clean-looking
well-priced music store with some smart
cloud integration and convenient
features for android smartphone users
prasina com I'm tompa i gotta say i was
hoping for a little bit more like
slightly better integration with the
existing Android music app just sayin
but Android ease will be happy I'm sure
and with that let's take a break we'll
be back with more Android atlas I mean
cnet tech review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good Brian Cooley
was in Los Angeles this week for the
2011 LA Auto Show adding to the amazing
tally of cars that he sees and drives
every year now they can't all be winners
in his eyes but in this week's top five
Brian's counting down the cars that he
might just consider spending his own
money on
I check out a lot of new cars every year
about a hundred that we shoot here it's
seen that almost that many of the
world's big auto shows but if you think
I look at everyone and want it you're
very wrong I'm Brian Cooley with the top
50 really the only five cars that I shot
in 2011 that I ever looked into buying
for myself number five the ford transit
connect yeah i see you there looking at
me like i have two heads but i love the
idea of a stand-up height van that isn't
some huge ponderous pain in the ass to
drive and keep fueled it's based on the
Ford Focus so things begin economical
and stay that way it has basically no
tech which is fine by me in something
like this I've got a smartphone a window
mount and an aux cable we're good let's
go haul some stuff number four was
another ford the mustang GT i would have
ranked it higher if it was the model
with the v6 which i think is the sweet
spot of the mustang line since that's a
powertrain you can actually drive it
seven-tenths in the real world unlike
this affordable v8 monster which has a
superb new five liter engine one of the
best interiors in the US car business
great lines I think and Ford SYNC though
the interface on that needs a refresh
number three the Kia Optima this is
actually my go-to car right now all this
year really when anyone asks me what car
they should buy it has handsome lines
courtesy of X Audi designer Peter
Schreyer an interior no car in this
price class has a right to offer
plentiful and usable center stack
technology and real responsive
drivability which is often overlooked in
favour of performance stuff like
horsepower and zero to sixty stuff that
you don't really care about number two
the fiat 500c now I'm a Fiat partisan
from way back as you may know but that
notwithstanding I love how the Fiat
leads that brands return to the US with
stylish looks a great modern version of
the old retro ragtop adequate tech and
fun if underpowered drivability and all
that under
grand for a convertible step up to the
more powerful a Barth version will be
testing soon and this cars story comes
full circle before I get you to the
number one car that I thought about for
me this year here are the three cars
that i recall hating without having to
even look back at my notes the MINI
Countryman it costs too much the stick
is tired and the one they sent us died
and had to be hauled away the smart
fortwo I had such high hopes for this
little piece of crap but Mercedes is
going to relaunch it in 2012 and I think
it has about one more chance to come up
a winner and the Volkswagen Eos first
car we ever rebadged enough said okay
the number one car I configured and
penciled out for myself in a long lovely
what if was the 911 carrera GTS believe
me I'm as allergic to the whole 911
cliche as I bet you are and they even
sent us a yellow one yeah but on the
road the GTS reminds you why this car is
a classic it's maybe the only car this
year maybe in the history of seen that
car tech that I can say feels like an
extension of the driver and keep a
straight face it's light it's responsive
it's built like an ingot of Steel but
it's got serious power right now power
but it's totally livable day to day lots
of tech yes but they still trail BMW and
Audi in that respect but that isn't the
point no car I drove all of 2011
succeeded so well at delivering what
it's set out to do okay you can find all
my car videos including those of cars
you love and I don't at cnet TV com just
pull down car tech under the tech shows
tab and find more top 5s like this at
top 5 cnet com I'm Brian Cooley thanks
for watching
of course don't count on Cooley to
actually add any of those cars to his
fleet anytime soon as regular car tech
fans know he's still pretty partial to
that ford country squire me though I
definitely would not mind seeing that
Porsche in my driveway with a big red
bow on it this Christmas I love those
big red bows but I can't say the same
thing about the TV that's coming up next
in the back it may feel like we're
picking on TV manufacturers in this
section lately but let's face it if you
can't put out a TV with decent picture
quality what else is it good for in the
example we're about to see it seems as
if Vizio has forgotten the main reason
that people buy a TV in the first place
David Katz Meyer here I'm sitting next
to the vizio e3 d0v x-series this is the
42 inch member of the series there's
also a 32 and a 47 inch here this is the
least expensive 3d TV on the market
Vizio actually includes two pairs of 3d
glasses here which makes the TV a better
overall value than the cheaper 3d
plasmas that are available get to that
and a little bit but first let's take a
look at the other features on this TV
and it's styling styling is not really a
great point it has this sort of dimple
here in the middle underneath the screen
it kind of interrupts the speaker grill
all together a pretty chunky look the
stand it doesn't swivel on the flip side
design wise we really did like this
flipper remote Vizio does include a full
qwerty keyboard on the back side of its
remote which is really cool for
navigating apps and typing and passwords
doing searches stuff like that so it's a
real help we wish more manufacturers
would include it because obviously
Stevie's pretty darn inexpensive in to
throw in that remote didn't add all that
much of the price the downside compared
to the flip are found on some Samsung
TVs is that this TV doesn't have
bluetooth so you have to actually keep
the remote aimed at the TV while you're
typing so unless you have something
interrupting line-of-sight that
shouldn't be too difficult TV also
includes built-in Wi-Fi to access all
those internet features so we really
like that you have to run a wire to this
TV and the Wi-Fi worked very well in our
testing course speaking of internet it
does include the videos via applications
platform which includes Netflix Amazon
video and demand food
and all the major services there's also
Pandora there isn't YouTube however but
that's not really a big deal in our
opinion we did like the rhapsody app
which course only works for rhapsody
subscribers leg to stream unlimited
music there's also a few other apps the
interface however wasn't all that great
it includes this sort of strip along the
bottom here you can only see four at
once so you got to scroll a lot if you
have a lot of apps also application
discovery is I'm not quite as advanced
as a lot of the other TVs on the market
the connectivity on the Vizio is pretty
darn good around back to find two HDMI
there's also a third on the side we also
like that the inputs are labeled good
better best for people who are not too
familiar with input quality so basically
just plug in HDMI you'll be fine so as
you can see the video is very well
featured but I'm downside it's picture
quality is not all that great and 2d
biggest flaw is relatively light black
levels which wash out the darker parts
of the picture and make the entire image
look a little bit flatter and with less
pop that some of the competing
entry-level TVs video processing was
also a weak point the Vizio doesn't
handle 1080p 24 source as well as some
of the other TVs we've tested on the
flipside its color accuracy was very
good and we did appreciate the matte
screen which rejected ambient light well
finally it does have better uniformly
than many of the other LED TVs we've
seen 3d picture quality on the Vizio is
a mixed bag it does have passive 3d
which is brighter and has less crosstalk
then active 3d in general and that's
very good on the downside there is some
visible line structure and text and some
flat fields we also saw the image was a
little bit softer than some of the other
TVs on the market but again 3d was
pretty darn sharp all told that's a
quick look at the Vizio e3 d0v x-series
and i'm david katz meijer
I know 3ds the hot new trend in TVs but
if 99% of the stuff we're watching is
still 2d kind of gotta nail that come on
guys all right let's keep it moving
right on down to the bottom line the
much-awaited kindle fire made its debut
this week facing stiff competition from
the nook tablet and of course the iPad
so does it deliver let's find out hey
i'm donald l and this is a first look at
the kindle fire Amazon's a hundred
ninety nine dollar 7-inch tablet what a
hundred ninety-nine bucks buys you here
is a dead simple way to access digital
entertainment at the top here you'll see
categories for newsstand books music
videos Doc's apps and the web browser
with the exception of docs in the
browser each of those categories are
going to toggle between the collection
and Amazon's digital store for that
content another interesting feature is
that when you're looking at your
collection you get another toggle here
between what's stored on the device and
the stuff you bought in the past that's
backed up to the cloud this is really
dramatic in the music view since Amazon
allows you to upload your entire music
library to their cloud where you can
stream your music or select songs or
albums download all the navigation is
done on the screen and when you're in a
nap or a menu you'll see controls on the
bottom settings are accessible at the
top of the screen and on the main menu
beneath the categories you get a nice
big view of your recently used apps and
files along with a shelf of your
favorite stuff these can be your
favorite apps books albums or websites
and you add them by just holding down
the icon up here beyond entertainment
you also get an email client in a web
browser email is fairly straightforward
and get some help from Amazon's on
custom keyboard which I personally liked
the web browser is typical for a 7-inch
android tablet page load time is Swift
I'm glad to see that there's a setting
here that will force the browser into
loading standard web pages instead of
those smaller mobile versions made for
cell phones still in general I'm not a
big fan of browsing the web on a 7-inch
screen it's better than a smartphone but
it still
leaves you doing more zooming and
scrolling than you would on a larger
tablet like the ipad as for what's
missing well there's no GPS no Maps no
bluetooth no cameras no microphone no
video output no calendar no card slot
for extra memory and I'm probably
forgetting a few things but let's go
back to my original point it's a hundred
and ninety-nine dollars at that price I
think it's a slam dunk you're getting
more entertainment options than on
barnes &amp;amp; noble's nook tablet more screen
than Apple's 199 dollar ipod touch and
an ease of use you're really not going
to find at any price would I rather have
an iPad absolutely but for three hundred
dollars less the kindle fire is a good
enough option for those who are mostly
looking for entertainment or a workable
way to email and browse the web from the
couch so that's the kindle fire it's all
the fun stuff on a simple tablet for the
great price cnet com I'm tambo the
bottom line this week 199 dollars sold
that price is just about irresistible
for all that little tablet can do
especially if you're already a fan of
everything amazon it is a horse race
between the fire and the nook but i
think that 50 bucks could be all the
difference you need of course if you
don't need all those tablet features and
you just want a solid ereader the newest
version of the Kindle Touch is out now
24 just ninety nine dollars so many
choices and that's going to do it for
this week's show but come back next time
for an all-new cnet tech review until
then there are tons of great videos
available every day as seen on TV com
see you next time and thank you for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
