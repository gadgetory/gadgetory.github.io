for cnet.com and I'm here with the sound
freak sound kick a wireless Bluetooth
speaker that retails for affordable
hundred dollars it has some nice
features and good sound quality for its
price point as you can see it's got an
attractive clean design and I liked how
the back portion retracts into the unit
when not in use making the overall
footprint smaller to turn the unit on
you do have to extend the back
compartment which is rubberized feet and
not only forms a stand but is also
supposed to enhance bass performance
it's a cool design element and while the
speaker stands up fine it ends up being
a little unstable and if you bump into
it at all it'll rock a little and may
fall over aside from that small growth
there is a lot to like here it's easy
enough to pair a Bluetooth enabled
smartphone or tablet and you get an
auxilary input on the back for
connecting audio vices that don't offer
Bluetooth support on top of that there's
also a USB port that allows you to
charge your phone or iPod but it only
works when the included AC adapter is
plugged in or the volume as it's set at
70 percent or lower that AC adapter is
used to recharge the units built-in
battery which is rated at an ample seven
hours of playing time in terms of other
design touches it's worth noting that
the buttons on top of the unit are touch
sensitive some people like these types
of buttons and some don't I thought they
were fine and liked how there was a
separate pair button that puts the
speaker into pairing mode while sound
freak doesn't include a remote with the
unit it does offer a free remote app for
iOS and Android devices it doesn't
really do anything but put a skin on
your music player but it's free so
there's nothing to complain about
as for sound I thought the sound kick
was quite decent for a compact speaker
that's priced at $100 it can play louder
than smaller speakers like the Jawbone
Jambox and can handle more volume
without distorting so long as you engage
the uq3
sound specializing mode which
essentially optimizes the performance of
the speaker you want to keep it on all
the time which makes you wonder why
sound freak didn't just bake it into the
speaker and do away with the button
overall the speaker sounds pretty
detailed and while it offers some bass
it does sound a bit thin and doesn't
deliver anywhere near the base of Bose
Soundlink wireless bluetooth speaker
which starts at $300 it produces much
better sound however that's not really a
fair comparison when you're dealing with
a compact hundred dollar Bluetooth
speaker you just can't expect the world
in other words as long as you keep your
expectations in check
you should be fairly impressed after you
add everything up the speaker does offer
good value for the money it has an
attractive design some nice extras like
the USB charging feature and performs
well for its size I'm David Connelly and
that's the sound freak sound kick
