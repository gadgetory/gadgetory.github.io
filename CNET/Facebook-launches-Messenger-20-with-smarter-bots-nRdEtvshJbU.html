messenger that will surface the best
BOTS and businesses interactions you can
have in your region and we're going to
work with you in the next coming weeks
to ensure that we populate this tab in
this new surface with the right things
also new to platform 2.0 our chat
extensions I'm really pumped to welcome
Spotify on the platform you can open
open the drawer from our redesigned
composer tap on Spotify search any song
or artist you want and then when you're
ready to share it back in the tread you
can just tap it and share it just as
easily as this no more complex apps
switching and sharing flows and the best
part of all of this the music now plays
live and this is now open to our hundred
thousand developers starting today so
you can build your own chat extensions
later today I think we can all agree
that automation is going to be a
critical part of our joint success and
we want to bring to the people who need
it the most which are small business
owners because they don't have time to
figure out technology and respond to
messages 24/7 they have a business to
run so we're launching smart replies
powered by AI and we're starting very
small which restaurants in the US by
enabling them to automate responses to
messages they get on messenger and the
way it works is that the smart replies
engine basically grabs the information
that's available from your page
automatically detects the types of
questions that are being asked and
responds on your behalf so you can focus
on building your business so it's time
to take games on messenger to the next
level and we're going to do this two
ways one is we're introducing rich
gameplay that will enable real-time
gaming and turn-by-turn gaze two is
we're also opening up a game tab so that
you can find all of the games that
you're playing with and the challenges
that you've been challenged by your
friends I'm really looking forward to
this and I don't know about you but like
I've really enjoyed challenging all of
my friends on games and messenger in the
last couple of months
and now that I have turned by turn games
it's game on again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
