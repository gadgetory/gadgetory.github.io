group of sound bars that tried to do the
seemingly impossible generates around
and hide effects from a speaker that
sits underneath your TV given the modest
dimensions of this system the sony does
better than most with a very natural
performance regardless of the content
and yet the biggest drawback is its
price at $1500 it's more expensive that
our current favorite the samsung h WK
950 plus it lacks surround speakers but
there's a whole lot that sony does right
it's attractively designed with these
distinctive co actual drivers and they
work in tandem with these top mounted
drivers which do a good job of bouncing
effects off your ceiling there's no such
thing as future-proof these days but the
sony is at least up-to-date with three
HDR compatible hdmi ports the speaker
also offers Wi-Fi streaming with
chromecast built-in which lets you cast
from Spotify or your phone to this
speaker or around your house of course
the speaker also does bluetooth the Sony
only supports Dolby Atmos and not rival
format DTS X but there is a whole lot
more content for Dolby right now anyway
with the large dedicated subwoofer the
sambar is able to put in a convincing
performance with movies and music
dialogue is clear and bass effects have
felt just as well as they are heard
music is perfectly natural sounding
which is something that is very hard to
pull off with any sound bar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
