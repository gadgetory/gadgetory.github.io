cnet.com and I'm here with the Logitech
Bluetooth Z 600 speakers these are a PC
speaker that is wireless you can use
them in a wired mode there is an
auxilary input but most people use them
Wireless they do come with a little
dongle for your PC or Mac sometimes
Bluetooth can be a little sketchy with
computers but that dongle allows for a
direct connection with these speakers
and makes it much easier to connect and
it did work for us a couple of extra
features worth mentioning for starters
there is a volume control on the top of
the right speaker but it is a touch
sensitive volume control so you just
move your finger in a circular motion to
raise and lower the volume also the
cords have a flat design to them this is
a cord design that's similar to the core
design and some of the headphones you
see now but the cords are a little bit
thicker the two speakers joined together
and then join into the AC adapter it's
pretty clean design the speakers have a
nice clean look there are three drivers
in the speaker they do deliver bigger
sound than you think then actually
sounded better at higher volumes they
definitely fill a small room of sound
and probably even a medium-sized room
with sound so they do play very loud and
you can obviously pair them with a
smartphone or tablet in Bluetooth mode
and you can pair up to three devices
with them and simply switch between the
devices by pausing the music on one and
then playing music on an other aside
from those mobile devices Logitech is
billing these speakers is a good
companion for ultrabooks
the idea there is that you would have
these sitting on top of your desk and
then you could go around your room with
your ultrabook and stream audio to these
speakers from up to around 33 feet away
that's the standard distance for
Bluetooth devices these have a list
price of $149.99 I don't know exactly
what the street price on them will be
yet but if they do come down a little
bit price I do think they're a decent
value they are a nice looking set of
speakers they seem to perform well and
they are versatile I'm David Carr noise
and those are the Logitech g600
Bluetooth speakers thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
