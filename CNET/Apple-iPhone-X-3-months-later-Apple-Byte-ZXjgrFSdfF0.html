what if you look in your calendar we're
pretty much three months a little over
three months of when the iphone 10 first
launched and you've seen my review
you've heard a lot of the things that i
had to say about it but it's now been
three months later i've used it
obviously every day since then and now a
lot of the things that i've said before
some of held true but there's also kind
of some nuances of using this that maybe
I like more or I don't like more so we
want to get into this of maybe how my
opinions have changed about the iPhone
10 over time now before we get into it
this is a solid phone I think it's a
very good phone it's not a great perfect
you know kind of finely polished perfect
idea of what Apple wants for their
iPhone I called it kind of like their
concept car but it is a great good -
great phone very good phone it's there
so let's get that other way so you guys
go what are you doing on the phone no
all right I still have the iPhone 10 but
the thing that stuck out to me the most
about it really is face ID you know I
was worried about how fast it would be
over time and you hear some of these
caveats when you first get the phone
right you're looking at it it's
unlocking perfectly it's all great but
then over time as you use this phone at
least for me I go back to using the
phone and holding in the positions that
I normally have when I used to have
touch ID so what does that mean I don't
hold my phone exactly up to my face like
this there's times where in the morning
even when I wake up I reach for it out
of my bed and I kind of hold it here and
face ID doesn't unlock my phone so guess
what you got to type in your code
there's times where you're outside at
least specifically in like sunnier
weather where maybe where the Sun and
reflection is shooting out towards you
it doesn't really see your face very
well it doesn't unlock there even when
you're at an office desk you'd like to
leave your phone flat on the table you
can't just touch the home button like
you can with touch ID and unlock your
phone you have to kind of like either
lean over it or pick it up more than
just like a little bit and that just
gets annoying when you think about how
many times this happens over the course
of time I use Apple pay a lot I don't
even use my phone for Apple pay anymore
because you know looking at it and
having
like I'm used to using my Apple watch
for Apple pay but I'm not gonna assume
that everyone is just gonna get an Apple
watch I'm not the person that tells you
hey an Apple watch is the solution for
Apple pay I'm not that guy
so again I just don't like face IDs
responsiveness it's gonna get better
over time but it's just not there yet
all right the next thing that was a big
thing for me and I've made all big
stinks about it was the knotch guess
what I just have come to the point to
live and accept the knotch I still think
it's ugly but it doesn't bother me as
much anymore because there's nothing I
can do about it but this is where it is
a pain in the butt from a standpoint of
the utilities that you see on the top
border now in the past when you would
turn your phone into do not disturb mode
you would at least see that kind of
crescent moon icon to tell you that well
now every time you go into do not
disturb mode right I go down here I
select it then maybe I'm doing a shoot
or maybe I'm somewhere where I can't you
know I can't be loud or I don't want my
phone to set off it doesn't show that
utility on the top so then what happens
over the course the day this happens so
many times I forget that Do Not Disturb
is on and then I don't get calls or I
don't get text messages and you know who
gets mad at me my girlfriend you don't
want that to happen your significant
other because of do not disturb mode
Apple the knotch
you got me in trouble bro so let's talk
about things that don't really matter
with this camera that they're there but
you know I don't really use them it's
got to be the selfie camera portrait
mode specifically right Apple made a big
fuss about this but I don't take selfies
in portrait mode the thing that I really
like really like I was an iPhone 7 user
so I never had a portrait mode on the
rear camera I used that thing all the
time like I'll take a picture I was like
going to town with it like the ice cream
museum you know I told people to stay
there take a normal picture and then I'm
like all right got a portrait mode this
thing and then took a portrait version
of it I love doing that so if there's
one thing that I love about this phone
just because I was an iPhone 7 user
sorry guys and gals I'm not always gonna
get the biggest and baddest um
definitely portrait mode on the rear
camera has been a plus for me but really
if you look at my comparison of this
phone and my review almost everything I
said about it
my first impressions in my first review
have held true I think the biggest thing
that sticks out to me is just that face
ID over time just isn't all that it's
cracked up to be an apple has a whole
lot of work to do with it
is this a people sometimes call this an
incomplete phone I don't think it's an
incomplete phone I think people that got
this knew what they were getting into
it's Apple's concept car it's not
finished it will get better but it still
is a solid phone so there you go I still
do like this I didn't return it but
there you have it it's my three-month
review of the iPhone 10 boom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
