on the red carpet for the premiere of
star trek to be on and this is how we
lifted i wish i was in 3d oh you are for
dinner maybe 15 sure sooo sorry healthy
selfie you see I love you I am thank you
thank you which piece of technology
would you like it to be for reals oh I'm
going to say what I'm sure everyone says
which is the transport right come on the
transporter would that be the greatest
thing in the world did not have to have
cars anymore or airplanes or anything
you know to be able to just say all
right I'm going to go to I'll be over
there in a second just go into the
transporter room and shoot you're there
that to me what else phasers on a care
we don't need any of that I want to
transporter the music you know I've done
the firt I've done the last two Star
Trek films and now this one and and the
first time we're doing it and the first
time anyone has ever done a premiere
live with an orchestra you know which is
crazy for by the way but is a lot of fun
and the san diego symphony is going to
be playing every note of music you here
tonight so we're in the film as the film
is playing they're going to sit right
underneath it and they're going to just
play through it straight and they are
incredible they're really wonderful
they're just and we have an amazing
choir as well and Richard who is
conducting tonight is just the best so
we are gonna have fun night we're gonna
find out I think the fans will be happy
I think where does the first question is
how do you like go about describing
technology in a script oh well there
were some instances we're very specific
about the technology we use because we
needed it for a narrative purposes
to serve a particular plot point and
then there were other instances when you
know we started left a little open
because it's maybe future technology and
one of the things that we have the
benefit was was this amazing crew of
effects people and prop people who could
literally you know make something off of
very you know a dodgy clues that we had
given them so it's sort of depended on
what it was we were looking at and what
we needed it for reality I think you got
to have the the transporter I mean yeah
I mean come on who doesn't want that's
that would be amazing that's that would
be that would be whoever comes up with
that I'm sure it's gonna be very wealthy
yes like do you you know like there's
like a big pressure of sci-fi films just
because the push they have in the
influence they have on the innovation of
that I think it's great listen I'm not
one of those people that think
technology is the enemy I don't think
it's going to take over the world I
think technology in its finest sense can
you know help us all out more than
anything else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
