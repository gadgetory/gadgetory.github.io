it came out then they proceeded to buy
them up in a clip that made every other
iPhone before it looked like a warm-up
act but that doesn't mean we love
everything about the 4s all the time
I'm Brian Cooley with the top 5 things
we hate about the iPhone 4s according to
a recent survey of hundreds of iPhone
users done by change wave research
number 5 is dropped calls 8% of you say
this a fairly modest number but don't go
get cocky ATT change way points out this
is very much thanks to Verizon entering
the market and cleaning up the iPhones
image as mr. butterfingers when it comes
to holding on to a call number 4 dated
coverage and speed 9 percent of you on
this one nothing puts that not your
stomach like the 3g indicator going off
and on when you're surrounded by towers
outdoors but 9 percent of you said yep
that happens to me and makes me wonder
what's so damn smart about this phone
number 3 is screen size 11 percent of
you on this one iPhone users know the
feeling of looking over at the person
next to them and thinking wow what a
cool little tablet they have until they
realize it's just an Android phone then
they turn back to their iPhone screw
their monocle in their eye socket and
squint Apple needs to bump up the screen
size to at least compete with the
smaller Android phones it's a visual era
ample screen size is no longer a luxury
number 2 4G or the lack thereof 30% of
you point this one out this is big 4G is
the most sought-after new feature by
people shopping for a smartphone they
don't care about the technology itself
they just want the phone to work online
faster than a PC with a modem assume
this will be done when the iPhone 5
arrives if not assume Apple will have
its first iPhone flop on its hands
before I take you to number one here are
the top 5 things people say they love
about their 4s led by Siri the world's
most popular party trick and followed
closely by the still best in the
business interface which translates to
ease of use it's amazing how much stuff
you can sell when folks realize they'll
be able to figure it out
the number one thing i phone 4s users
hate about it is short battery life
doesn't matter what your phone does if
it isn't on now Apple's long-standing
policy on non removable batteries means
you can't carry a spare and that's that
kludgy pain-in-the-ass anyway but Apple
needs to improve this most basic
behavior in real life by the way it may
not be a problem with the iPhone as much
as the fact that iPhone users tend to
use their phone more a lot of surveys
have pointed that out but that's not
their problem it's apples for more on
the iPhone whatever generation it is go
over to cnet.com and click on cellphones
and for more top 5s like this it's top 5
