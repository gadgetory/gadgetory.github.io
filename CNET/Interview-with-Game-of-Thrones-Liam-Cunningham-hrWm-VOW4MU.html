know as being such a runaway hit even
with people who wouldn't normally think
of themselves as fantasy fans well I
would include myself as being one of
those I mean when it was first when I
was first approached about a bit being
involved in a fantasy series I was I was
a bit like that but then when you hear
that HBO involved and when you know what
Dan and David who are the show's
creators the least I could do was have a
look at the scripts around as soon as
they arrived
I've been long enough in the game to
realize when you to recognize when you
see a gold has arrived on the carpet in
your you know through the letterbox and
I was very eager to get involved because
I mean it may be a fantasy series but
the fantasy is just an incredibly
expensive backdrop to this story of
paranoia and power and legacy and family
and with extraordinary characters and it
was a no brainer to say yes sir this
understand there's a couple of different
techniques for how they do Devils is
foreshortened fingers yeah yeah yeah
there's more than a couple I mean that
the the default one is is a glove that I
wear which I've had them so up so I can
keep my hand in that position for as
long as possible but I've also in my my
little office at home I've got a
prosthetic that that the guys made up
for me that I used at the beginning of
season three but in which we couldn't
use it there's the same in Braavos at a
bank where I very much have my hand out
and we had to have these little finger
puppets that went over these little
green things that I had to use them so
they could be digitally removed so if
there's like three or four different
methods of removing my ear my fingers I
did there too a couple of gullible
journalists I did tell him that we had
that HBO having the deep pockets that
they have have a micro sergeant on on
set that puts them on at the end of the
series and they they looked at me
quizzically I did have to tell him I was
jogging finally as of the latest book
your characters still alive you know
george RR martin you'd never know what's
gonna happen
doesn't mean you're holding off taking
any big contract jobs for a while you're
expecting me with Game of Thrones for a
bit
as long as they'll have me they'll want
these wonderful people at HBO are
putting shoes on my children I will hang
around as I see worth listen this stuff
is cold this is a once listen once on a
lifetime job I think people people
recognize that there's there's no show
that has been like this has come before
and I don't think there's anything like
it is going to come again and unless in
a bizarre way if people are looking for
especially my game are looking for some
sort of legacy I think in 50 years time
people would still be rediscovering this
show and seeing how it hasn't aged the
quality of it is it's timeless it's it's
it's a beautiful piece of television I'm
able to urge anybody that hasn't seen it
to not talk to their friends go out and
start watching I get the DVDs whatever
it might be and sit down with with a
friend and start watching it it's it's
beautiful television I've been in this
game a long time I'm quite cynical about
stuff Game of Thrones I'm not cynical
about it's beautiful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
