challenge just got a lot more
interesting and we'll explain why
harbors going to help you fight aliens
it's Harvard is going to help you find
it at Harvard Harvard and Japan through
the most adorable little press
conference ever with robots kawaii
tomorrow daily
greetings citizen to the internet and
welcome to tomorrow daily the best week
talk show in the known universe one of
these days one of us is gonna punch the
other on accident I can already see that
happening it'll be great for the Blue
Bombers out for the rest of the episode
it'll be grateful developers here I'm
host Ashley scale that Jeremy's always
kill anonymous how's it going you're
just about to fly off to join everyone
else at it packs out to the Alamo know
if you're gonna be at packed south it's
in the basement of the Alamo packed
south what no it's Oh the Pee Wee joke
remember Oh goes to get his bike at the
basement the alimony all like that I
totally miss that one man sorry it's
really excited about that pack south is
a huge like gaming / nerd convention
that you can go check out here it is new
this year so it's it's San Antonio cuz
you usually pax east in Boston and pax
prime in Seattle but you're not just
going as a tourist you're going for your
for your charity yeah yeah i'm a board
member be allowed to talk about that
yeah yeah we can i'm a board member take
this which is a charity dedicated to
mental health awareness for gamers and
people who write in Game Journalists all
that stuff um and we have this really
cool thing at pax where we do an afk
room so people who feel very overwhelmed
or maybe you just need some quiet time
can come to the AFK room and like relax
for a little bit and there are also
mental health professionals on hand to
talk to you if you need to talk to
somebody that's super cool I'll I can
you go to take this dot org and that's
our that's our charity you can check it
out it's I'm really proud of it yeah
show me a part of it that sounds cool
glad I'm glad you're involved with that
alright so also glad glad you're
involved with the headlines yes
Lotus really to go yeah Logan was on it
very good because I think he was waiting
for me to say he's too much more pro
than we are she really is he's on it um
okay so there is a thing called the
DARPA Robotics Challenge I don't know if
you're familiar with this we actually
need to go because it's local its gonna
be in I think Pomona so it's a little
bit inland by 30 minutes away but it's
it's gonna be here and we can go
spectators can go for free so um the the
Pentagon actually has seven teams like
competing in this Robotics Challenge
like they have seven and they all use
this robot called atlas and so atlas has
been around for a while oh yeah this was
like previously it's been like very
tethered and moved kind of slow I had
some issues now this is the new atlas
they've been okay so they're showing up
to Ellis cuz there's a new rules there's
a bunch of new rules this year in the
DRC which is no tethering so it can't be
attached to anything it has to be able
to get up and recover if it gets stuck
without any intervention intervention
day and it has to operate its on its own
during short communication blackout
periods and the reason why is because
the theme this year is search and rescue
so they're like if there's a
communications breakdown let's say
you're in an earthquake zone and there's
no cell service or any you know there's
any no communication at all just
electronic communication there was this
footage isn't from this this is like
before this is before so they uh this is
DARPA TV they just released this video
about the new atlas and the new atlas is
meets all those criteria and has been
rebuilt 75% of it has been rebuilt and
so pretty much from the legs up like
they were saying from the knees up this
robot has been rebuilt it it's lighter
now it's got farther range because it
uses less energy it has more dexterity
it's quieter apparently the teams had to
use hearing protection to be around the
robot before and now they don't so they
don't they don't need them that's a big
hurdle the job a big that's a pretty big
bonus there and and so yeah each team
each of these seven teams has to use
atlas they'll start with Atlas and then
they have to sort of differentiate it in
their own way to compete in the DARPA
Robotics Challenge quickly can you
explain why the Pentagon is doing that
well so um
okay so DARPA and Boston dynamic boston
dynamics is now owned by google so but
before Boston Dynamics you should work
very closely with DARPA and DARPA is
sort of a government-funded radix yeah
so I would imagine this is sort of a way
to get their robotics people into this
robotics challenge and to make them you
know make cool search and rescue robots
things like that like I I don't think
it's so robot president yeah not not yet
I mean well who knows I mean we always
say like whatever we think of or what's
out there is usually like 50 years
behind what like most governments have
available to them I don't know who knows
it could be that we have maybe brocco
bomb is a hologram I don't know that's
everything makes sense know-it-all it's
all coming together so it's not his off
everyone isn't coming up his batteries
are running batteries are right gotcha
Britta it's gonna be over soon um but
yeah so that's what they're doing over
at DARPA and then I believe when does it
end when is it when can we I think the
competition is in isn't spring or early
summer so it's like may I want to say to
me hey okay it's in a few months there's
a few they have a few months but it's
not like a year from now it's it's soon
they only have I think out 134 days they
have a count down the websites 134 days
to take jar for robot right all right
let's get started all right so it
meanwhile while that's happening search
friendly you're going to be able to take
a class to search for aliens presented
by none other than Harvard Harvard yes
so basically this is a free course that
you can take online and it combines
astronomy chemistry planetary studies
and biology oh I like that in a class
called super Earths and life by Demeter
sasselov professor at Harvard author
Dmitri says Allah so the goal yeah
what's going to this whatever cuz here's
the thing like I'm I am certainly no
scientist or an astronomer any kind I'd
you could have fooled me the goal here
is to give facts that will help students
learn more about alien life how we look
for it and how it relates to our place
in the universe so it's going to be
you're going to help you on your
searches for super Earths exoplanets and
life elsewhere I did this I like that is
it's free it's absolutely free on a site
called EDX the EDX platform so if you're
interested you couldn't go to EDX oh
I've heard of EDX so this is a this is X
a platform where a whole bunch of like
world's top universities offer free
classes like that was coming I was
getting to that you and if you but if
you don't want to take it you can donate
to them and it as little as five dollars
so they can they can they can decide
whether or not to make this like a
normal course at Harvard also so it
starts februari it starts in February
februari tail still time to register
yeah you still have time here's the
here's the thing lasts for six weeks
five hours a week so it's gonna it's
gonna take some time but you gotta do
this at a curious mind horse you know
this is something that you know the
Harvard hasn't done before it's really
like there's like testing this hours
like oh hey let's offer this is free and
then it's kind of see how see how it
goes I already feels about it I took a
out of this i went to EDX is the first
time I've ever been there to that
website it's really interesting a lot of
different courses on a lot of things
that you should just check it out see if
there's anything that interests you but
I'm just being able to learn for free my
guy why not yeah why not exactly and all
just powered cool knowledge is in fact
power that is not how r helps you punch
people that's also true with your brain
with your brain so people with your mind
that's pretty cool the course again is
called 11 super Earths and life if you
end up signing up for it please let us
know yeah love to hear what comes of it
and what you learned that that actually
brings us to our hashtag the day I when
you do that I know hashtag TD class and
we I want to know and I think that you
guys are gonna come up with some really
good stuff what kind of future class
would you want to learn if it was
available right now like about the
future just I mean anything that's like
sort of in our realm so like would you
want to learn about robotics would you
want to learn about how to you know what
what how to you know how to spot
exoplanets so this this class is geared
toward finding alien life right now
didn't have her space here's mine I
would want to learn like an Ender's Game
how to do like battles in like zero
gravity do you member in Ender's Game
light get float around and they're like
shadow you had it they have to learn how
to move their bodies to like land on
perception she would say yes in case the
world starts spinning use there's no up
and down so you have to like learn how I
just like how to expand awareness what
about you I think I would want to know
this is gonna sound really dorky but I
think I would want to know just you know
hug
I think I would want to know how to
create my own 3d printer like I I feel
like I would want something I would want
to learn that but however apps yeah yeah
oh that's kind of cool yeah like how to
use everyday household items eternal
like I don't really learn how to use a
3d printer I'll figure that that's fine
but like I feel like really just if I
could just put something like oh yeah
okay I got this old like printer spool I
think this we put it all together and
make 3d printer that's idea why I was
impressed her I'm always impressed by
people who do this on the internet just
like oh yeah we threw a bunch of like
weird stuff together we made this like
random thing that can prepare for jury
room wow thanks exactly so I'm what's
the first thing you'd print I draw a
food prayer I was doing your prayer
prayer you are guilty printer printer
printer to make food you are in an
endless loop your inception in yourself
right now it says there's different
layers of your printer I thought you
didn't really put a printer in your
printer so you can print while you print
have you printed Ashley and then it it
it wants to print a printer that i'm
done with this show i printed about it
yeah i print a tiny k like yeah i'm in
my pocket a little killed away like a
your security players that's exactly
right exactly right okay so our last
story today of the week i guess cuz it's
thursday oh I love this so much it makes
me like a little bit like Oh squeeze
this is adorable but it's also a little
creepy so be prepared this is from an
osaka based company called v stone they
introduced a new pair of these two
little robots here a little baby little
cute little dorable baby robot or creepy
depending on where you fear creepy
murderous robots depending on your
phobias um they introduce these robots
at the mere icon tech museum in tokyo
and here's the deal with these two
robots so they're talking to each other
right now in the video but v stone
introduce them to reporters by using
another pair of larger androids like
humanoid androids the robot robots
introduce our own robot ladies
introducing these two robots oh my god
here we go at the inception and these
two robots had a conversation with the
two bigger robots what can they say to
each other what's the conversations
consist of so they had a whole
like a bunch of weird like kind of
contextual conversations about different
things but the the point of this is that
they were saying these would make nice
little sort of virtual compare not
virtual robotic companions I think one
of the things they mentioned was the
possibility of like one of these talking
to the L like an elderly person in Japan
who came home they were alone because
there's a very aging population in Japan
and there's there's actually this is
like kind of an issue that Japan is
facing is they're not having enough
people have babies right now and so
there's been a very big shift into like
just aging population without a lot of
replenishment on the low end with kids
so they were saying that they have
they're gonna have this really big older
population in Japan is sort of elderly
population there thinking these robots
make good companions I might be helpful
for reminders and and different things
like that telling the weather served
companion o companion bought for your
you know coffee table yeah we should
totally expect more of this from Japan
they're definitely beat us to the
companion totally made Tamagotchi that's
member that is true they did but they
were called sota and calm you they
talked to each other they talked to the
bigger robots which were like those
full-size lady robot say oh yeah those
terrifying nightmares they are tarrant
they're truly I saw that it was like hey
you have mail and all this stuff like oh
yeah any other actions that they
described that they do so they mentioned
that the purpose of this like this idea
is to develop a fully autonomous
interactive robot and so this is sort of
the first stage of that and there they
were saying that we might see these two
smaller robots come to market at some
point for under a thousand dollars so
soda is powered by which is the one on
the right here the little one that looks
like almost like a mega man astro-boy
yep exactly it's powered by the Intel
Edison chip which is pretty cool and
then they can talk to each other in
Kimber's and then calm you the one that
looks like a little baby is more
sophisticated and is powered by
Raspberry Pi and has a little bit more
like actuation eyes and things like that
so so you can add stuff zoom ibly to it
yeah I'm assuming these will be like
maybe if they do go to a consumer market
it would be like oh here's the basic one
and then here's the one the articulation
is actually pretty impressive the baby's
the baby one has like I think 14
actually like they have like that in its
eyes as opposed to I think it's eight in
Soto one of these
yeah I can't Leo's with you I wanted to
I mean amazon echo is just like a tube
that talks to you but it's like I want a
little robot that was she made it like
that's yeah give you put some pardon not
to get to veer off a little bit but do
you remember those little robots that we
were given at the kikis the little one
that like has he moods yeah they had
moods and stuff like that and I got like
really addicted to like when I was like
man I'm can't believe that happened in
the game and then I make him sad yeah
like really like sadness like see I need
press feels like I just need some
friends I need them I'm gonna need them
to come via robot flesh meet friends are
not happening yeah q4 meet friends
alright guys we're gonna take a quick
break we're and be right back with a
round of into it because it's Thursday
and we're excited about stuff and then
of course your gears our feedback and
our photogra for the day so don't click
away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back welcome back to the show
we've returned I like that you always
have like a little little dance gone
well we can only hear the bass I know we
clearly have the base of the walls so
yeah yeah Tokyo gets really into it is
that's why I into it this week which
makes a while yeah um it's Thursday
which means we like to tell you guys all
the stuff we're super excited about so
this is into it all right so I saw this
and it got published like I don't know
like eight or nine months ago and I
don't know how i missed it but I saw it
recently like look two days ago and I
was so excited because I love sci-fi
films oh yeah old sci-fi new sci-fi it
doesn't matter love middle middle range
weird 50s beasts be sci-fi b-movie
sci-fi I love it all it's great um and
this really awesome video went up oh and
it is the history of sci-fi films in
four minutes and it's like this really
great compilation of all of these
fantasies so because it goes in order
then they had a Louie buñuel there that
we just saw yeah kind of I think it goes
in order by time and so it's it's got so
many great sci-fi moments films brings
me back to my childhood in 1930s in the
30s I know when we were you know when we
were just getting out of the flapper
flapper era we're just trying to figure
out ourselves Einstein's no movies are
they show TV to like you leave twilight
zone no it's film specifically sci-fi
film so there's a lot of really great
stuff though it's like good guy indiana
jones and signs and I it's baseball yeah
that must be powerful so do they have
like music or like what's the they run
through it like you can hear the audio
and I want to say I'm like I will have
washed it two days ago so I I can barely
remember because I my brain is not
actually Napoles all right um I want to
say they put like a little bit of either
the sound effects or music underneath it
but it's you can hear ya I just I really
love this I think it's so great i love
that i've seen every single one of these
no i am watching and i'm like okay i
feel really good about my sci-fi movie
cred because i've seen like pretty much
all but now you know homework if you're
watching it you don't recognize no
that's that's the cool thing it's like
if you're not
if you love sci-fi films and maybe you
see something in that compilation that
which is how I felt there was like maybe
like three or four things ice on there
my gosh I don't know what that is and
then I kind of like did some research
and I'm like okay I have to see this and
there were like movies from like a 30 oh
yeah but um yeah I just I really liked
that I thought it was really cool that
somebody kind of put that together
that's really cool how kids are you
gonna put a link somewhere so yeah it'll
be in our show notes which is it's an
article but we'll also have what's the
title again just in case it's a called a
century of sci-fi in four minutes and if
you go to if you go to our tumblr we
have a direct link to the article that
has all of our show notes keep
forgetting we have a tumblr yes I always
put the direct link to our like article
instead of just the video so that way
people can see all the links to all the
stories oh ok so if you go to the tumblr
which is this the easiest way to get to
that article page otherwise you have to
really dig through our river on Sina
which can be a lot because we publish a
lot of stuff every day if you just go to
tomorrow daily tumblr com you can click
on the most recent winner you get to
look at the phone target for the day two
we always put up the phone toggle for
the day ok cool yeah that's great you're
famous on tumblr chromatography you are
famous on tumblr ok so my into it I had
a problem when I was talking to Logan
was like what are you into and I was
like I don't know I just finished a
bunch of stuff i just finished the
Saints Row game I just finished bioshock
asian whore American Horror Story just
ended like a ton of stuff just ended so
this is what I'm about to get into which
is csgo which is counter strike global
offensive which is let's just lose right
now which is huge right now on which and
I never actually had this time in my
life oh I never had a counter-strike
he's gonna say you never had a
counter-strike bender I never did I was
analyzing Unreal Tournament girl I was
uh I was Splash Damage games so like
quite honored Wolfenstein enemy
territory Wathan Sonya I played quake in
yeah I'm like high school do you know I
did a bunch and I did like i did call
night I did timesplitters I did halo I
did everything but dynamism
counter-strike so I'm really looking
forward to getting into it apparently
like everybody's so good this because
they've had it like baked into their
just the DNA yeah so I'm very scared
they have these new there are gonna be
very great that you can unlock okay I'm
describing this that everyone's like
yeah kale we already know I know but
they have all these crates that you can
so I'm ready to get an addicted to that
ready to live stream the slogan say he's
gonna jump on with me so we're both
going to die hand-in-hand side-by-side
and an side-by-side tourist world
perfect Logan and Kayla lose so that's
what I'm about to get into delightful
you should all we should if a bunch of
you are playing we should get like a
whole tomorrow daily group yeah you
should follow kale on Twitter and so he
has going on because I'm sure yeah I
true that he'll get a wrangle you all
like cat you're not it you're not a csgo
player right that's not your jam you
have a lot of jams but I have a lot of
jams but fun fact I actually I used to
play Unreal Tournament professionally I
was signed with a league oh my god it's
a long time ago I but yeah that was the
thing you trash talk I imagine you were
trash talker um no I lost a lot cuz it's
a bunch of it was against a bunch of
dudes who literally spent you know 18
hours a day playing unreal tournament
yeah but I did okay I wasn't very I
wasn't great but I was good enough to
get signed is there is there videos up
some I don't think so no it's just like
pre YouTube era sorry huh I've had a
very weird I've got a very weird life
you guys that's all I'll say about it um
well from the from the weird to the
pretty awesome it's time for your
feedback all right so hollow whoa this
is the hololens feedback we asked you
guys use hashtag TD hololens tell us
what you'd be using for you guys came
out in full force for this yeah name is
a powerful Twitter handles I've never
seen before you guys welcome to close oh
very first one though is from jos way
who says unrelated to the hololens but
the only reason i made this twitter is
to use your hashtag keep up the good
work yes welcome to Twitter you're gonna
waste a lot of time gratulations yeah
Adam road chosen said i would use
hololens to compare the virtual versions
of new products to real objects that I
already on whoa love that's whoa that's
a good one that's an incredible answer
that's using your brain that's yet to
that's right oblique a harvard class my
brand god you are already a doctorate
alright alright sciency Chris wrote
Rosen said pair it with Siri or Cortana
and boom one step closer my very own
Jarvis throw a little hot rod Radner
why did the quote well our DJ well our
DJ there that's incredible yeah I you
know they're gonna do the voice
interaction yeah I'm sure that meant I
don't think I don't think it's I don't
think it's loaded into hollow ones no
code but it's all over windows 10
Cortana's everywhere i'm going to rahul
wrote to us and said i see it being most
useful for education how to videos will
be redundant imagine learning how to fly
a spacecraft that again using your brain
there I love that because it's like
you're seeing it and doing it you don't
have to just watch a video and then hope
you get it right do you remember that
episode of simpsons maybe do maybe don't
it was like the school had gotten budget
and so they were like what do you want
to spend it on at least was like we need
to get like this virtual thing she puts
it on and it goes hello Lisa I'm Genghis
Khan come join me look you'll you'll
kill who I kill you'll eat who I hate
and pillage the town's iphone they'll be
like that's exactly what you want so
yeah education czar great education you
could go back in time you can see like a
Roman Empire as it as it used to exist
like you can walk through Rome in like
two thousand eight I love all of this i
love that nobody's like I go to cow
tippin like his they're all smart as
well Barney wrote to us and said seeing
my virtual girlfriend walking around the
house LOL haha you know what you get
points for honesty Barney you admitted
shoes virtual get points for that ok
I'll give some points for that that's
honesty points I'm not gonna make a
comment on this one alright ms wrote
choice and said I would really like to
play first person shooter games like
BioShock Infinite and Skyrim using the
hollow lens love that I can't imagine
blame like fallout though or doom yep I
would end up with Revere psychological
trauma my place you could play those
with the ocular with oculus yeah so I
mean but I mean like oh you know I was
just thinking would be amazing is you
know that app runs on bees run have you
ever heard of this yes yeah were they
like partial zombies so well I'm saying
like you basically yeah you put on your
hollow lens if it was lighter weight
than what they have but you put on your
Hall ones and as you're running it's
like you hear the the cues you have the
cues to sprint and do things whatever
and then it and then also you can see
like stuff running yeah so the first
time you start swinging and while you're
running an idea money when I would
yeah that's crazy i love that you went
to fitness yeah fitness weakness would
be good um augmented fitness but yeah so
that's are those are our user feedback
and then of course we always have one
more piece of user feedback and that's
our phone tog refer the day you know
Stewart wrote to us again well I don't
think he's ever written to us before uh
he said I took us on my iphone 6 as we
were flying to LA from Fort Lauderdale
the skies above Florida have never
failed to provide amazing views and my
incredible look look real that is
actually flying yeah oh yeah real looks
computer-generated mm-hmm I was a
ridiculous sunset looks like there
should be like a quote and inspirational
quote oh yeah like never you miss one
hundred percent of the shots you don't
take your let your limits are only as
big as your fist yeah yeah whatever no
somebody make that take this picture
will put it up on them we'll put it up
on our tumblr just take this picture and
put make it an inspiration inspirational
quote you typically says it you can even
yeah yeah you're gonna be like Iggy
Azalea or something like that whatever
you want whatever you want what you said
I think that I think that really limits
are only as big as your fist yeah that's
true your mind fist if you're going to
harbor on your mind fist what is this
guy's name I Stuart so thank you holler
yes do it well played my favourite
viewer for sure yeah a new favorite
Stuart so rarely happens so good love ya
all right well if you want to submit
your phone tog raphy you can email us
tomorrow at cnet com you can also send
over your user feedback if you if you
don't want to use social media but hey
if you hate emails and you do want to
use social media can find us tomorrow
daily Facebook Twitter Instagram
tomorrow daily TV Google+ and tomorrow
