buzz report and now for the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
Motorola Q but no no this is not a fake
out check it out
here it is that's right the Motorola Q
has arrived you can order it online
starting May 31st and it will be in
stores for real on June 5th and it only
cost 199 bucks with a two-year contract
Wow look at that
I can't believe it's real and I'm over
it
it's just so much better when it was a
myth and now for the news the big news
on Wall Street this week was the Vonage
IPO the internet phone calling company
has never been profitable has four
hundred fifty five million dollars in
debt and has admitted that it may never
be profitable and in its first full day
of trading bondages stock dropped almost
14 percent see the dot-com days are over
today's investors are looking for four
hundred fifty five million dollars in
profit and also a business plan new
rules manage catch up and now let's play
our new favorite tech industry game
Microsoft beat the clock in our last
round
Microsoft lost one point by announcing
that Windows Vista would miss 2006
entirely and would ship to consumers in
January 2007 score one o'clock this week
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer steps up to
play for Microsoft he now says that
Windows Vista will ship quote in early
January late January February we are on
track for shipping early in the year hmm
score one o'clock
and there's a new player this week
semantic joins the game with an exciting
new intellectual property lawsuit
Symantec has asked a judge to stop the
development sale or further distribution
of Microsoft Vista which could delay it
even more and possibly forever so folks
at the end of an exciting round the
current tally is Microsoft 0 'clock
infinity I really don't know why anyone
would want to play this game and now for
the latest in the fight against music
piracy a German state prosecutor claims
that authorities have raided a hundred
and thirty homes all over Germany and
identified 3,500 suspects in a crackdown
on illegal file sharing so how did they
find the suspects well German
authorities are using a server that acts
as a distributor on the edonkey
file-sharing Network in fact in addition
to collecting names for raids the German
prosecutor says his Nina and Kraftwerk
collections are hugely popular and
finally in Fitness news Nike and Apple
have teamed up to create a running shoe
that will use your iPod Nano to show you
how far you've gone and how many
calories you burn you can even get Lance
Armstrong's voice in your ear to offer
encouragement if you start to slow down
in fact I am hard at work right now
working on a plugin for the iPod Nano
which I hope Apple will adopt it's sort
of a motivational alarm clock nice right
it really works I'm Molly wood and this
has been the buzz report just one more
mile man just one more mile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
