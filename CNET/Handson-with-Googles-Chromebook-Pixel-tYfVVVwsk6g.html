in Paris and this is the Chromebook
pixel from Google it's the first
Chromebook from Google itself instead of
from partners such as Samsung or Hewlett
Packard and Google is starting off with
a bang that's because the Chromebook
pixel has a terrific 12.8 5-inch display
at 2560 by 1700 pixels this screen edges
ahead of the MacBook Air Retina display
for resolution so text and graphics look
glorious at 400 nits it's really bright
and taking a cue from Microsoft in
Windows 8 it's a multi-touch capable
screen that means you can stab with your
finger at textboxes when filling out
forms swipe when scrolling and pinch to
zoom on sites like Google Maps that
support it the touchscreen isn't as
responsive as I'd like but it's still
natural to use Chrome OS is good for web
apps like Google Docs Facebook and Gmail
which means it works best with a network
connection with today's web technology
at least you can't run native apps like
iTunes or Microsoft Office though that
plus the price tag $12.99 for the Wi-Fi
only version in $14.99 for the Verizon
LTE version due in April means the
Chromebook pixel is definitely not for a
mainstream market it's got a nice and
sleek exterior with no screws visible
anywhere and no loud logo stickers the
hinge lets you open the lid
one-handed the trackpad is just as good
as the screen and in another first for a
Chromebook it's got a backlit keyboard
for typing at night or in dark
auditoriums Google clearly paid a lot of
attention to the details here inside the
Chromebook pixel is a dual-core 1.8
gigahertz Intel Core i5 processor
integrated graphics and four gigs of
memory the Wi-Fi model of the Chromebook
pixel gets a 32 gig SSD and the LTE
model gets a 64 gig SSD but both models
come with one terabyte of cloud storage
with Google Drive for three years on the
outside the Chromebook pixel has two USB
2.0 ports a mini DisplayPort for
external monitors an SD card slot and a
combination headphone microphone Jack
Google promises five hours of battery
life with typical usage and that's a
quick hands-on with a Google Chromebook
pixel I'm Steven Shanklin for CNET in
