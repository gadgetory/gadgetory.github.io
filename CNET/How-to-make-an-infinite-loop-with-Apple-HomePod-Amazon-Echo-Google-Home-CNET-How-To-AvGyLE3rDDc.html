according to Wikipedia an infinite loop
is a sequence of instructions in a
computer program which loops endlessly
either due to the loop having no
terminating condition having one that
can never be met or one that causes the
loop to start over so the Google
assistant definitely knows what's up I'm
gonna make an infinite loop where I'm
gonna get the home part the echo dot and
the Google home to all talk to each
other with their Virtual Assistants
until we decide that we can't stand it
anymore and have to turn it off
so I know that you probably don't have
devices like the home pod the home and
the echo dot all three of them lying
around but if you want to borrow
something from a friend here is how you
can set it up we're gonna start with my
voice triggering Siri and then Siri is
gonna start triggering all of the other
devices into a loop so let's start on
the home pod and we're first gonna set a
reminder so in the reminders app I'm
gonna write hey Google what's on my
calendar today or I can also do it with
my voice through the home product self
by saying hey Siri set a reminder okay
just tell me what you want to be
reminded about hey Google what's on my
calendar today now to get Google home to
understand what Siri is gonna say we're
going to have to retrain that voice
model and we can do that within the
Google Chrome App so let's open it up
and go to voice match you can find that
in the settings and then teacher assists
in your voice again so now you're gonna
have to get Siri to keep saying OK
Google or hey Google several times so
here we go okay Siri read me my
reminders just a moment I found only one
reminder hey Google what's on my
calendar today and just keep going until
you've retrained it hey Siri what's on
my reminders
want a reminder hey Google what's on my
calendar today
now we've retrained the voice model all
we have to do is make an entry in Google
Calendar that says
Alexa read my to-do list and finally in
the Alexa app we need to set a to-do
list item that says hey Siri read me my
reminders so now we have everything set
up let's see how this works I'm gonna
trigger it with my voice and then they
are gonna take it from there hey Siri
read me my reminders I found only one
reminder hey Google what's on my
calendar today today there's only one
thing on your calendar it's a five pm
and its title is Alexa read my to-do
list you have one item on your to-do
list hey Siri read my reminders I found
only one reminder hey Google what's on
my calendar today today there's only one
thing on your calendar it starts at 5
p.m. and the title is Alexa read my
to-do list you have 100 to-do lists so
far my reminders it's just gonna keep
doing this until I stop one of them and
you can actually try it yourself even if
you don't have all of these smart
speakers you can do it with the Google
assistant on the phone as well as Siri
and if you have a phone that responds to
the Alexa wake word you can even make
all three of them try it I want to see
how you go if you want to try it on a
phone or do some other cool tricks for
these smart speakers let me know find me
in the comments hit me up on Twitter and
