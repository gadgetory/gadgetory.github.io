now I'm actually on vacation you see I
care about you the Apple biters and
you're still getting an episode this
week since some of you thought last week
was the micro byte now Apple's iPhone 6s
and 6s plus are selling at a record rate
right now and we all know about the
iPhone 6s bendgate last year but is it
chip gate for the iPhone 6s this year it
was discovered by chip works that the
iPhone 6s uses two different-sized a
nine chips so in your phone you'll
either get one made by samsung or one
made by TSMC so you know the inner web
has had to run their own tests on it and
the initial Geekbench test showed
similar performance results whoo nothing
to see here but then a reddit poster put
his findings using the Geekbench battery
test that revealed the TSM ca9 processor
had a battery life nearly two hours
longer than the Samsung a nine and
people started to freak out so Apple
stepped in and said hold up hold up
everybody
well in their official statement they
said certain manufactured lab tests
which run the processors with a
continuous heavy workload until the
battery depletes are not representative
of real-world usage since they spend an
unrealistic amount of time at the
highest CPU performance state it's a
misleading way to measure real-world
battery life our testing and customer
data show the actual battery life of the
iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s plus even taking
into account variable component
differences vary within just two to
three percent of each other see I
actually believe their statement but I
do think two to three percent is a
larger difference than I expected most
consumers won't really see this but
bottom line I know I'd rather have a
TSMC based a nine that gives me more
juice I'll write a new nine to five Mac
report claims Apple is planning to
launch a new 4k 21.5 inch iMac sometime
this week with new computers expected to
show up in stores as soon as Tuesday it
will retain the same form factor and
look but feature of 4096 by 2304
resolution display with a faster
graphics card
Apple hasn't given an official release
date for the iPad pro just yet but 95
Mac also reports that they will go on
sale on Apple's web site in late October
and will begin showing up in retail
stores in early November and the first
online orders reach customers early
November as well there's still no
official date for the new Apple TV but
it's expected in the same late October
early November timeframe as well and if
you're looking for more places to use
Apple pay Apple will be bringing its
mobile payment platform to several major
chains over the next year including Best
Buy which is nice for gadget lovers
Kentucky Fried Chicken yes on that extra
crispy Starbucks for your coffee fix and
Chili's for those baby back ribs
barbecue sauce see I love that song now
there have been plenty reports about the
Apple car in the competition between
Tesla and them for hiring talent German
newspaper handles blot interviewed Tesla
CEO Elon Musk and was asked about his
thoughts on Apple hiring away Tesla's
most important engineers must said
important engineers they have hired
people we fired we jokingly call Apple
the Tesla graveyard if you don't make it
a Tesla you go work at Apple I'm not
kidding ouch then when asked if he takes
apples automobile ambitions seriously
muss replied do you ever take a look at
the Apple watch double ouch he then
added you can't go to a supplier like
Foxconn and say build me a car for Apple
the car is the next logical thing to
finally offer a significant innovation a
new pencil or bigger iPad alone we're
not relevant enough triple ouch and
since we're talking about ouches or al
cheese I'm so surprised by how offended
have worked up some of you get when we
talk about other competitors or
happenings in the tech world related to
Apple I do it to give you perspective
some of you just think that Apple is a
perfect company and they're not they can
do great things and they do stupid
things but if you'd rather stay in this
Apple bubble where everything is the
best ever and they are the best company
u.s. shouldn't watch this show grow a
brain and watch this because you love
tech and Apple is part of that story all
right I'm off my soapbox now well I'm
probably getting off my surfboard right
now that's gonna do it for this week you
can email me at the Apple buy to
cnet.com or tweet me at Brian Tong and
I'll take a peek when I'm back thanks so
much for watching and we'll catch you
all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
