consider what I want to take it on a
road trip you know spending ten hours a
day in the driver's seat traveling
across vast expanses well with the 2014
Lexus gs450h the answer is definitely a
yes the 2014 Lexus gs450h has two things
that really recommend it for a roadtrip
one it's got a very nice driving feel
it's a luxury car and two it's very
economical you wouldn't necessarily
consider a luxury car to be economical
to have a hybrid system like this one
it's sort of like a a billionaire
shopping for groceries at Trader Joe's
but it all comes together nicely in this
car there's a couple of design cues that
distinguish the GS 450h
from the GS 351 thus 450h has a slight
bluish cast to the lexus emblem up front
that's supposed to mean blue skies kind
of green tech kind of thing and we also
of course have hybrid badges down the
side as well now let me give you a
refresher course how a hybrid
gasoline-electric system works in a car
we've got a gasoline engine we've got an
electric motor and we've got a battery
pack now when you slow down or hit the
brakes that that kinetic energy is
actually captured and generated and
turned into electricity and stored in
the battery when you go forward when you
hit the accelerator the energy from the
battery is sent to the electric motor
and that's used to help push the car
forward gasoline engine also comes in to
push the car forward and depending on
the situation you could be driving under
fully electric power under both the
electric motor and the gasoline engine
or just the gasoline engine and unless
gs450h we've got a really robust hybrid
system the gasoline engine it's a 3.5
liter v6 this engine does 286 horsepower
254 pounds of torque for valve time it
uses an app consume cycle that's
actually our uses the power a little bit
but it's more efficient now with these
systems Lexus is fairly honest about the
total horsepower total output of the
system
they didn't just add the horsepower from
the engine and the motor together they
do a calculation that gets them to a
total system output in this case 338
horsepower that's not bad for a car of
this size and Lexus says it'll go from 0
to 60 in 5.6 seconds
let's get in the cabin and check the
tech I really like the cabin inside this
GS 450h Lexus has done well the usual
job of nice luxury appointments but one
thing I particularly like is they've
gotten using bamboo for this trim pieces
here and they use a satin finish on this
which gives it a really natural feel I
like this so much better than the really
high-gloss wood surfaces you find in
some cards one really cool feature that
I've not seen on other cars are these
automatic seat heating and cooling
controls and if you just hit the seat
heating one once it puts it into
automatic mode what that will do is
it'll look at the temperature you've set
in the climate controls and
automatically adjust the seat heating or
cooling depending on the outside
temperature we have the shifter here
this controls what Toyota Lexus has used
in their hybrid vehicles for a long time
is their transmission it's actually a
planetary gearset it's sort of an
electronically controlled variable
transmission you can throw it over here
to a sport mode you also have a manual
shift mode which seems kind of weird
because there's no actual gears here but
they do include eight program shift
point so it mimics what an 8-speed would
do and I can select those gears by
either pushing up for an upshift or down
for a downshift
let's have these paddles on the wheel
and along with that we also have
different drive modes so we've got this
dial controller here on the console we
have two sport settings we've got sport
if I turn it once to the right and Sport
Plus if I turn it once more now when I
do that there's a little bit of magic
that happens on the instrument cluster
so if I'm in normal mode or eco mode I
have a speedometer on the right on the
left side I have this power gauge this
shows when the car is charging through
regenerative braking shows when it's
moving in Eco mode or it shows that I'm
really on the power but when I move it
to sport mode this thing suddenly
changes into a tachometer it's pretty
cool it's a nifty little feature I like
it for the infotainment system here
we've seen this controller here before
in Lexus vehicles this is what they call
remote touch it's actually sort of a
mouse like thing you you move this
little pad around and it moves a cursor
on this huge twelve point three inch
screen it's not my favorite because when
you move it around it's really easy to
sort of skip what you're looking
when you move the different moved to
different options on the screen next to
the menu button I also have a map button
so I can go directly to my maps I like
that feature and when this auxilary
screen I give you some basic controls
like on the audio screen I can change
audio sources or I can skip tracks and
you go to the climate control screen and
actually choose temperature and stuff
like that I don't know why I'd want to
do it there when it's really easy to do
it with the panel on the dashboard here
you know the maps look pretty good one
weird thing with Toyota Lexus is they
don't do perspective view maps they only
do plan view maps that's looking
straight down on it you can get north up
or the direction of the car but you
can't get on any other kind of map on
here if I want to choose a destination I
actually have to hit the the menu button
then go over here and choose the
destination icon it's not my usual
destination options like address entry
point of interest destination assist is
actually their telematics system so I
can actually push a button and call an
operator and they can send a destination
to the car and here if I choose the
little apps folder I get a series of
apps that are actually connected to my
phone for audio sources even though on
this main menu screen they separate
radio and media which is a little bit
annoying when you go to the actual audio
screen there it's all the same you can
actually choose any of the audio sources
from the screen all of this music is
playing through a Marc Levenson audio
system that's an upgrade in this car 17
speakers it's a good sounding system
it's very well balanced and you can get
good distinct highs you can get pretty
deep bass it'll shake some of the panels
depending on what tracks you're playing
one way I've noticed I was driving down
the freeway fairly flat freeway 70 miles
an hour and I was seeing the prep
computer give me an average rating of it
was approaching 40 miles per gallon I
was really impressed by that so I
assumed that's what a lot of your
driving is that you're your total
average would probably be in the mid-30s
or so and that's that's excellent for a
car of this size this is electric power
steering fairly easy to turn low speeds
I mean there's not a lot of feel here at
higher speeds it halves up a bit
generally it's just a very comfortable
easy uncomplicated car to drive the
suspension gives it a nice ride quality
it's very common it's especially not
soft but it damps out the bumps really
well it's it's a little bit springy and
I really enjoyed the feel this car the
accelerator wasn't always there didn't
always have the power on tap because the
hybrid system was a little fussy that
way but ultimately you know what I feel
like this car does the best is just
cruises all right let's price out our
2014 Lexus gs450h base price comes in at
sixty thousand four hundred thirty
dollars now options may vary by region
but in California you will only have
three choices there's three luxury
option packages now at the base level
the lowest price one which is about ten
thousand five hundred sixty-two dollars
you get the mark leviston stereo you get
navigation you get LED headlights you
even get a head-up display now if you go
up to the top level package $15,000
package you add some driver assistance
features like adaptive cruise control
and Lane Keeping Assist you want those
extra $5,000 if not you're about ten
thousand dollars over total price comes
in about 72,000 so 72 thousand dollars
is a hefty price for a car but I really
like this GS 450h it's it's a good
all-around car it's not a lot of fuss it
has a lot of good technology its
comfortable to drive to work everyday
and it's definitely a car I wouldn't
mind taking on road trip across the
country
