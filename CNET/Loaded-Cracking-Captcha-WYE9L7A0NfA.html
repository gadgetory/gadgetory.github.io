Bridget Carey on Sina comm and it's time
to get loaded Halloween stuff Stanford
University researchers have horrifying
news for website security administrators
most CAPTCHAs won't stop the bots now
CAPTCHAs if you don't know are those
blurring jumbled letters meant to make
sure human is using the website but
researchers invented a way to decode the
letter puzzles on many major websites
including visas authorized.net Blizzard
eBay and Wikipedia
of course these sites have other means
of security but it proved that not every
CAPTCHA is effective however one
company's CAPTCHAs cannot be decoded
Google there seems to be no stopping
them speaking of unstoppable forces if
he thought Boogle TV was dead think
again this weekend the service reemerged
with a software update anyone using
Google TV with a Sony device already got
the update but if you have a Logitech
Revue box well you'll just have to bite
your nails and anticipation because it
can come at any moment as for new
hardware it's coming for you next year
that is this next story might seem like
a monstrosity to hard core console
gamers but Game Stop will now be selling
tablet PCs as soos Acer Samsung Android
tablets are all coming to 200 GameStop
retail stores this Friday each of the
tablets will come with seven games like
Madden NFL and Dead Space
attention programmers and mad
scientist's Microsoft announced today
that Kinect for Xbox 360 will allow for
commercial applications to be made for
Windows starting early next year the
Kinect software development kit or SDK
will that any company create a product
using the technology in the motion
sensor gaming device we've seen
enthusiasts and students invent new uses
for the Kinect before but this will
allow the applications to be sold some
owners of the new iPhone 4s are
suffering from a mysterious bug that's
sucking the life from their batteries
although Apple engineers are trying to
determine the cause the guardians
suggest one possible Silver Bullet
the automatic time zone finder setting
seems to be the culprit behind the juice
drain as the GPS continues to constantly
run turning that setting off seem to
work for some users but time will tell
if that's the end of the battery
nightmare I don't know but my 4s seems
you're running just fit as a fiddle and
no I don't believe in jinxing myself
just because it's Halloween no bad luck
is gonna come my way those are your
headlines for today I'm Bridget Carey
