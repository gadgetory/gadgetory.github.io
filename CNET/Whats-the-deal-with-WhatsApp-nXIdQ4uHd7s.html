message I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your stat update when Facebook agreed to
purchase whatsapp for 19 billion dollars
most people were asking what's what's up
well put simply it's a private messaging
app that's massively popular around the
world and people use it instead of
sending regular SMS text messages
whatsapp has 450 million monthly active
users that's almost double the monthly
active users of Twitter it's not as
popular in America most folks in the
u.s. don't bother with using a separate
app for text messages because many
wireless plans include unlimited texting
but in other countries texting can be
costly especially if you're texting
friends and family living abroad
whatsapp gets around the texting fees
because it uses a data connection it's
free for the first 12 months and only a
dollar a year after that so you might
ask how is whatsapp worth 19 billion
dollars to Facebook it is a shocking
amount of money but you can argue it was
a good deal let's break it down each day
what's up has 1 million new members
signing up it won't be long before it
hits a billion users with every member
paying $1 annual subscription fees
Facebook now is bringing in major
revenue right now more than 18 billion
messages are sent a day on whatsapp that
includes texts and videos and photos but
that's close to the same amount of
regular SMS messages that are sent
around the world each day from all the
cellular companies combined this is
becoming the more popular way to text
whatsapp has a larger and faster growing
user base than Twitter so if whatsapp is
growing more than Twitter and Twitter's
worth 30 billion dollars then Mark
Zuckerberg got a good deal for paying 19
billion when you look at how often
people use the app they use it more than
Facebook about 70% of whatsapp users are
engaging with the app each day compared
to Facebook's 61% engagement this was
Facebook's biggest mobile Challenger but
not anymore

able to buy a media remote for the
console Microsoft announced the Xbox one
media remote will hit stores in early
