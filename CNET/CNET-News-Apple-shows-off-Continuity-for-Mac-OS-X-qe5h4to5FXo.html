it's called continuity so now at Apple
we believe you should be able to use the
right device for the moment maybe your
phone when you're on the go your iPad
when you want to kick back on the couch
maybe your Mac you're trying to get some
work done but we also want the
transitions between these moments to be
absolutely as natural and seamless as
possible
now our continuity features start with
something simple and that's airdrop
because now airdrop works between iOS
and the Mac
it's really convenient but now we have
something where we really take it to the
next level that's called handoff so it
turns out now that when you're working
on your Mac your devices around you and
proximity are aware of each other and
are aware of what you're up to and so if
you want to pick up where you left off
on your Mac on your iPad or your iPad is
prompting you right in the lower left of
the screen just swipe up and you can
pick up working on what you're working
on your Mac right on your iPad and this
this works in the other direction as
well so let's say you're composing an
email on your phone and you walk up to
your Mac well your Mac will notice what
you're doing and prompt you right on the
dock you click it and you can pick up
finishing that message right on your Mac
now we've been able to take this same
proximity awareness and make the process
of creating a hot spot easier than ever
before so now if you're using your Mac
and you're away from a network but your
phone is nearby when you go up to your
Wi-Fi menu your Mac actually without any
configuration ever having been done on
your phone sees your phone and prompts
you so you click it and it automatically
sets up a hotspot you never type a
password and you're on the network that
easily and this works even if your phone
is across the room sitting in a handbag
you just never have to touch it now the
next area we really wanted to handle it
was SMS now we all love iMessage we can
continue our conversation seamlessly
from device to device but then we have
these green bubble friends and you know
they have inferior devices and they
insist on sending us messages and we
don't want to hold it against them but
the problem is that those messages don't
show up on our other devices until now
because now your phone is able the
actives are relayed automatically and
transparently send your messages between
devices now believe it or not we're able
to do the same thing with phone calls so
now when you receive a phone call your
Mac gives you caller ID and you can even
accept the call and use your Mac as a
speakerphone
and believe it or not this works even if
your phone is across the house in a
charger you never have to miss a call
well now that your Mac is all phone
savvy it's also a great way to dial the
phone so if you're in contacts and you
want to dial a number you can do it
right there and even on a webpage you
see a number you want to call you can
call it right from your Mac so I want to
give
so if you're up for it I'd love to give
you a demo now all right so let's check
out continuity we're gonna start with
handoff but to pick up my iphone here
and I was composing an email about our
karaoke night does anyone want to you
know I'm by my Mac so let's use my Mac
here and you notice my Mac actually is
aware that I was using my phone so with
a click I bring up that message it's
right where I left off does anyone want
to go and you know to give these people
some inspiration about what they might
be able to experience a karaoke night
you just summon a picture from last
year's karaoke event now that ought to
get him going so I'll send send that one
on its way now of course this works in
the other direction it looks like
ondrea's is up for some karaoke and he
sent me a URL that's - a good place to
go for karaoke so I can pull that up
here now if I want to show this page to
a friend maybe pick up my iPad you
notice as I look at my iPad let's put
that up on the screen there at the
bottom is Safari
I just flick up and it takes me right to
where I left off it's really amazing
next up pump phone calling uh hold it
one second well this is from my mom now
she she is surely wants to grill me
about the newest fourth tier LLVM
compiler in Safari but this is not the
right time I know you'd all love to hear
from mom but I'm gonna scream I'm so
I'm sorry she's a wonderful wonderful
woman but that's it this is this is my
space
so but you know I would like to show you
how we can make phone calls and so I can
dial from webpages so for instance if I
wanted to go dial a phone number like
this one right here I could just select
and hit it just like this and you notice
I get a option to call right here inside
of Safari but you know I wanted to make
a phone call to a new Apple employee
that's that's joining us is something we
do from time to time so let me just
bring up this here we go let's give a
WWC welcome so let's let's have my Mac
dial via my iPhone I to people like him
all the time or very normal for me Wow
hey it's Craig federighi here hey hey
hey a doctor you're on speakerphone with
via my Mac with over 6000 amazing
developers here at WWDC we all want to
welcome you to Apple
