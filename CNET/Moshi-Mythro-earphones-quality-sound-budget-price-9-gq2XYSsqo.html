cnet.com and I'm here with the Moshe
micro in ear headphones now the name is
inspired by an element in the Tolkien
novels my thrill of that's lighter than
metal and yet a lot stronger than metal
and there's a bit of aluminum in the
housing here so it's not an all plastic
in-ear headphone but it is a rather
inexpensive earphone at around $30
what's nice about it is that it is
lightweight and comfortable and it also
sounds very good for the money
does have an integrated microphone with
a one button remote that remote is a
call answer end button as well as a skip
track forward and back button tap it
twice to skip a track forward and tap it
three times to skip back it won't work
with all phones but it is designed to
work with iOS devices couple other small
things worth mentioning this does come
with three silicone ear tips and the
nice thing about these ear tips is that
they are color-coded there's a little
bit of red on the inside of one that
allows you to tell the difference
between right and left without having to
look for those little letters while
these earphones seem well built I can't
say how durable they are they do come
with a standard straight plug not an
l-shaped plug but in the two weeks that
I use them I didn't have a problem with
them that said they don't come with any
sort of carrying case as far as their
sound goes what's impressive about them
is they do have a lot of bass good
detail as well so it's a pretty
aggressive earphone not necessarily for
everyone but for a lot of today's
listeners and a lot of stays music it is
a good earphone it's also a good value
at $30 I'm David Carr Noy and that's the
Tolkien inspired Moshi my throw in your
headphone thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
