to buy an Apple watch I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update all eyes
are focused on Apple and it's watching
new MacBook but there is some non-apple
news believe it or not in the middle of
apple's event monday google announced a
new update to the android operating
system the latest version of lollipop
android 5.1 is rolling out with
improvements to performance and security
it has device protection which locks
your lost or stolen device until you
sign in with your Google account and
that's even the case of someone else we
set your phone to factory settings this
version also supports high-definition
voice calls between compatible android
5.1 devices like the nexus 6 on t mobile
or verizon and quick settings adds the
option to join Wi-Fi networks and
control paired bluetooth devices but
back to Apple the company also has an
operating system update of its own iOS
8.2 is available now for download and it
packs a surprise when you download it it
brings an Apple watch app that you
cannot delete the app is just preparing
an Apple watch with your phone and it
also includes some videos and facts
about the watch so instead of just
letting you pair of device in the
settings Apple forced an app on your
screen that nudges you to buy a watch
pushy pushy but you should download the
new OS because it pack is a dangerous
security hole the update fixes the bug
known as freak and that leaves users of
safari browsers more vulnerable to
hacking the Freak bug also impacts
Android and Windows computers and
there's more you should know about the
single port on that new 12-inch MacBook
it's called USB type-c and it's a new
type of port and nothing you own uses it
so you'll need an adapter to connect
anything to this back book Apple is
selling simple USB adapters for twenty
dollars and ones with more connections
for eighty dollars you'll be hearing
more about us bc this year the benefit
is that it's reversible no matter which
way you plug it in it works and data and
power travel faster through it in other
Apple news a few more answers about the
Apple watch are coming to light apple
says the battery inside the watch is
replaced
so this is the device that you can keep
alive for several years just don't take
it in the shower apple says it can
handle sweat from a workout but it's not
waterproof Apple isn't the only smart
watch with customizable style Motorola's
watch the Moto 360 just opens its store
to let you customize it with different
metal finishes and straps the watch
starts at two hundred and fifty dollars
but some of that custom pizzazz will
cost you more that's your tech news
