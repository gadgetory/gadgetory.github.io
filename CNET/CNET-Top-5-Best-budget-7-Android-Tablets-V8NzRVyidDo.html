immediately faced competition from
7-inch tablets running Android
unfortunately they all cost too much and
most of them came with two-year
contracts eventually some genius figured
out that the way to compete against the
iPad was to make a solid contract free
tablet for around $200 and Donnell bail
and then this week's top 5 were cutting
down the best cheap tablets under $300
these are the tablets that are keeping
things interesting starting off at
number 5 the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0
now don't confuse this with the Galaxy
Tab 7.0 plus or the Galaxy Tab 7 7 or
the Galaxy Tab 8.9 or the Galaxy Tab 2
10.1 this tablet has more sequels than
Harry Potter but this particular tablet
hits the sweet spot on price $249 it
also has an IR blaster to control your
TV and best of all a micro SD card slot
at number 4 the 2012 Kindle Fire now not
the HD version but the old design the
Amazon updated with a faster processor a
new OS and twice the RAM there's still
no camera and the design is still pretty
blah but the price is a hundred and $59
that's the lowest price on this list and
it makes this tablet a great value at
number three the Barnes and Noble Nook
HD now for $199 you get a lightweight
7-inch tablet with a beautiful screen
and a micro SD card slot and because
it's from Barnes and Noble
it might even shame you into reading a
book or two coming in at number 2 the
Amazon Kindle Fire HD here's another
$199 7-inch tablet with a great screen
you also get that 720p camera for Skype
video chat and some of the best speakers
you've heard on any tablet and with
Amazon you're also getting a great
selection of music and video content
that truly rivals Apple now before we
get them the number one seven-inch
Android tablet let's take a look back at
the top 5 tablet flops remember when
they wanted 550 dollars for the Dell
Streak those were dark times
all right now the number one reason why
the iPad should just crawl back to
Cupertino the Google Nexus 7 I still
don't know how they pulled this off $199
Tegra 3 processor and a completely
polished front end for all of Google's
best software I still say it's a micro
SD card slot away from being perfect but
it's pretty close so there you go those
are the best 7-inch Android tablets out
there right now for under $300 be sure
to check out Eric Franklin's round up
over on iPad Atlas and for more top
fives like this head over to top-5
