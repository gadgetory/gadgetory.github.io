taking a first look at the Samsung
Galaxy Tab this is an android-based
tablet computer running Android 2.2 the
7-inch capacitive touchscreen it's
available on all major carriers starting
mid-november with various pricing plans
this version is in from Sprint which has
the tab for $399 for the two-year
contract plus a monthly data plan that's
a minimum of $29 as a competitor to the
Apple iPad the tab isn't cheap but the
samsung's credit they didn't skimp on
the product we've already seen cheap
7-inch Android tablets like VR co 7 and
they're not great as the name implies
the galaxy tab offers Samsung's Galaxy
smartphone experience in a larger tablet
form on the front you've got a screen
which is covered with a scratch
resistant Gorilla Glass the LCD
underneath is a crisp 1024 by 600
resolution which is on par with the iPad
but since the screen is about half the
size the pixel density is much tighter
above the screen you have a front-facing
1.3 megapixel camera which is perfect
for video chat and across the bottom you
have the typical Android style buttons
for menu home back and search there's a
standard headphone jack on the top and
volume and power buttons on the side
along with a micro SD card slot for this
model from Sprint a 16 gigabyte card was
included on the bottom you've got
Samsung's dock connector and a pair of
built-in speakers flip it over and
you'll see a white plastic back and a
larger three megapixel camera with an
integrated flash overall the feel is
very solid it's about a half inch thick
same as the iPad but not as tapered at
the edges it's lighter than the iPad
easier to hold in one hand and has the
huge benefit of actually being able to
fit in an average pocket that said
compared to the 5-inch Dell Streak it's
large enough to deliver an experience
that's closer to the iPad nine point
seven inch screen the on-screen keyboard
is ample and the screen size is large
enough that it can share the same page
as an email or a webpage the keyboard
itself isn't quite as accommodating as
the iPad but on the upside smartphone
style thumb typing feels natural and the
keyboard responds with haptic feedback
Samsung also includes sweat
capabilities out of the box allowing you
to run your finger over groups of
letters to trigger an auto suggestion
the tabs paperback size is also a
natural fit for e-books and the Amazon
Kindle app comes pre-installed another
big deal here is that the official
google app market is included front and
center giving you access to all the
popular apps Pandora TweetDeck Yelp
Angry Birds they're all here and they
all look great on the big screen
Samsung also throws in a few of their
own unique apps such as the media hub
store for downloading movies and TV
shows apps like contacts calendars and
memo have all been optimized for the
larger screen and because the tab
includes GPS along with 3G and Wi-Fi the
included navigation app does an
excellent job as an in-car navigation
device offering turn-by-turn directions
points of interest and voice search
another little advantage of the tab has
over the iPad is Adobe Flash 10.1
compatibility allowing all of the webÂ´s
flash video content to play natively in
the browser the results are a little
choppy in some cases but it's nice to
have the option so is the Galaxy Tab
better than the iPad it may be for some
people who really want the portability
the camera the flash support or the
extra carrier options but I don't think
the iPad is too much to worry about
honestly with the tab about half the
size of the iPad the kind of different
products the iPad is more of a netbook
alternative while the tab fits into more
of the smartphone and ereader camp it's
a solid device though and if the price
and the carrier contracts don't scare
you off you should definitely check it
out so that's the Samsung Galaxy Tab for
