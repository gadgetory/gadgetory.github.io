are the differences between a large
drone like the Phantom and one of these
rinky-dink
I found this in a cracker jack box drone
what is the difference obviously the
size that goes without saying
covered size already yet but like if I
really missing out on something cool by
just having this little little guy here
um it all depends on what you want to do
with your drone so I yeah what do I want
to do with my drift flying around your
living room hitting your cat in the head
that's the one you want right so so pet
abuse yes this is mainly used well I
mean that in child abuse that goes
without saying as well of course just
scare all the cat's away with the drone
yes um but that one's it was a toy no
camera on that one right um and that one
in particular is made to roll up walls
or also just fly well okay that's cool
that's an interesting design yeah like
that so you got ones like that that are
tiny and don't don't do all that much
right um and then you'd move up and you
got other ones like I got this one here
okay that one there what's this um that
is the sky Viper guy Viper snakes can't
fly
Vee 2400 HD should is it has a HEA you
plug it in so I can do anything okay um
but what might blink anyway that one's
got a camera flies up in the air that's
a little bit more outdoorsy okay you fly
that around your yard flight around your
house too depending on size of your
house I guess right so what am I getting
with like you know everyone sees these
vloggers and everybody they're rocking
that phantom right so things a lot of
money the fam yeah it's a lot of money
because it has a lot more tech in it
yeah it's got a much better camera
stabilization for indoors okay so that
you can fly it you don't need normally
you would need GPS signal outdoors in
order to keep it hovering in place and
not just
flying off so that's what you get with
like the Phantom's you get better
stabilization better features ability to
set it up and fly a flight path are they
harder to fly uh no actually they tend
to be easier to fly bigger than your it
is the fun well I mean here this one is
big but it's essentially a toy um it
doesn't have I don't know if they can
see no oh yeah they could see that so
that thing look at this you got that it
this is essentially a toy it's it's a
larger drone it comes with a HD camera
on okay um but it doesn't it's not just
not gonna fit
yeah the stabilization right it's not
going to stabilize the cameras fixed so
you can't do it you can't like pan and
tilt it right is that a GoPro on there
and no this is cozy
my guess a fake-ass GoPro take over a
small no I
Ducky's in the toy realm when it's not a
full-fledged camera well no I mean it's
a full-fledged camera but I mean that is
not it's a full pro it's not a great
quality I like that it's a faux faux pro
there you go pro pro I'm just gonna wear
this on my face the rest I like that but
again this doesn't have GPS in it
although it's the same nearly the same
size as a phantom ya have GPS ray
doesn't have anything that doesn't have
like the fans you know everything so
what anything it doesn't really the
Phantom 4 is got like collision
avoidance it doesn't really yeah how's
it do that it's got sensors in front so
that does the airbags basically my
airbags not yet yet virtual airbags
maybe does it have a parachute no it
does not there are drones a parachute
there are well there are drones that you
can attach parachutes to that that will
if I have a phantom phantoms are like
1500 bucks right uh not really we that
mean that highest-end one okay 13 yeah
so 30 I'm putting a parachute on my
$1300 drone okay it just like falls out
of the sky I'd like it well ideally
shouldn't users all out of the sky yeah
I guess now so like how does that I do
have new drones have like fail-safes
that prevent them from falling out of
the sky because I feel like what if the
battery craps out well I mean yeah the
whole idea with the Phantom
it's constantly giving you feedback on
the on what's going on with its flight
okay
so if the battery starts to get low it's
telling you that your battery is getting
low you don't have to worry about that
so this is a great episode because I
don't I don't know crap about
researching for the curse word I was
gonna say a different word but then I
realize where we were we already have by
the way Raj in our chat wondering if any
of these chats can be any of these
drones can be used for covert operations
Wohlford a word he used is first he said
stalking then he said area 51 what which
is a little ridiculous but all right a
joint in general pretty noisy aren't
they yeah they're loud I can you can fly
one 200 feet up and still hear it really
yeah they're not they're not quiet
that's why and besides they own either a
helicopter well and for the most part
they all have really wide angle lenses
on them as you know you go up further
away with a wide-angle lens the things
in the get smaller and smaller it's not
like they have all zoom lens sure you
can fly up 200 feet and then sure you
know zoom in on somebody okay and if
you're flying 20 feet above somebody
shooting them in their backyard pool you
know then they're they're gonna know
they're gonna know they're gonna be like
Oh someone's creeping out and they're
gonna take a broom and knock it down and
then probably report maybe with a
shotgun like I've read to yeah sure okay
so do we have to register like which
what kind of drone do I need to register
if I live in the US so it's not the
drone you're registering you're you're
registering yourself as a drone owner a
drone a drone er I don't think that's a
thing but now it is being coined it here
so anything basically any drone over
0.55 pounds so anything over a half a
pound you you have to register with the
FAA why why is it a weight thing um oh I
guess because because if it falls from
the sky or flies into somebody I guess
right I don't know that's just what they
went with this is over this is probably
a pound that feels heavy yes so um so
yeah you probably in order to fly that
you'd have to register yourself with the
FAA and throw um you have to throw your
you get a little number right a
registration number you throw
on the drone or oh really okay just
something fixed inside the drone you can
like put it in the battery cache or
whatever
Keenan wants us to fly the drone but
that would not work out well in this
small studio Oh living room no I feel
like we could do we could do it do you
want to just you go for it yeah okay can
this guy know why not that guy because
we as one might not cover every
tarted-up but you're gonna do some
damage with this all right
I've seen you fly friend what do I do
power on no don't don't do it I'll tow
to that wood let's do it tiny tiny ass
but tiny one with the cage on it yeah
the one with the UH with the so go ahead
turn it on
okay I'm gonna activate this little
there we go put it down floor on the
floor yeah put on the floor all right
mohabbat is specializing that it's a
quadcopter not a drone is there a major
difference uh so yeah it's a common
thing with um with the people who want
to argue such things yeah no technically
I guess it's not a drone what you do I
hit the bottom way you weren't supposed
to hit any buttons it's just what's
takeoff and on this week's item tab you
have a lot of buzzing oh so how does
this work how do I take off um huh how
do I don't know now okay what'd you do I
hit buttons it's not moving
Oh drones up oh okay
there it goes what happened oh man you
know the having the the ball there is
kind of great all right well it was gone
now and that's the story of drones
basically you fly them until they
disappear into a tree right I do so
anyway you don't see a live show yeah
what you were saying what was the
question you had a quadcopter oh right
quadcopter drone yes technically it's a
quadcopter multi-rotor UAV whatever you
want to call it the the basically
everybody decided to call it a drone
and for marketing purposes drone works
really well de yeah you know as opposed
to UAV would you have to explain
everything that's like more of like a
militaristic thing yeah but I mean I
don't know I it's they're all they're
good drugs so they're all
interchangeable terminology yeah and I
don't know that oh look some le came
back to us he came back and when I got
him say get it down
okay I put it the Eleanor fly from here
oh boy I guess man the bouncing part is
kind of great there I'm VIN is
commenting he hates a short flight time
with these toy drones do you find that
with some of them yeah that's all of
them oh they're all basic little
mosquito it's like a little Riddick he's
gonna get well now it's stuck okay well
and this is why we don't fly I'll get it
or enough that you my producer I haven't
no anyway wait no wait before your
question sure let's answer the person
square short battery life all right
short battery life so these are all all
the toy ones is it notes it's doing
stuff
yeah it's upset battery life shut that
off okay anyway uh yeah the little ones
they all last anywhere from five to
eight minutes which is nothing no and a
lot of them I mean it all depends on the
model this one's got a removable battery
some of them don't
I for the ones with removable batteries
because they tend to be inexpensive sure
anyway so maybe canary a couple with you
yeah so you get like 20 minutes of
flight okay instead of five and that's
the that's the main problem with a lot
on show so if you want to fly a drone
like flying a kite probably gonna have
if you have the ability to have multiple
batteries oh boy oh yeah sorry Java whoa
this thing this is a lot of fun this
one's a lot of fun it goes it goes it's
crazy
yeah can you charge them off a like a
battery pack like with Yale phone
absolutely um it's totally doable Joe
where are you with the kicker
oh I'm doing real good with this guy
there see so when you lose Michael
actually have you all ready to fly Oh oh
my god that's awesome who catches their
own drone this one's fun man can I have
it after after I'm done reviewing it yes
well there you go this is like chili ah
prepares oh I'm sorry I've rode the
drone if somebody wants a toy drone
versus professional John what do you
think is the the the the customer level
who who would want what uh I think in
general most people want both mmm
um the toy ones are nice because they're
cheap yeah
it also helps you learn how to fly
without blowing 1,000 bucks and crashing
it into a tree totally binlong you've
you've crashed it bit me maybe maybe
wasn't mine Oh somebody else we will not
talk about all right well fine um yeah
you can get one I think this this one in
front of us is like a 100 hundred
dollars okay so you get that you fly
that around and park for a little bit
and you realize okay I'm ready to move
up to something more serious and flying
this one is a lot more like we said
earlier it's a lot more difficult to fly
a phantom because those do just about
the they're so stable and can fly
themselves basically right and they're
there you know as far as drones go
they're they're really quad copters quad
copters they're the right mm-hmm they're
easy to set up and start flying right
away as long as you said some wood
Technic tech-savvy okay fair enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
