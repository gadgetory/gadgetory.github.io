welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk-show in the universe I'm Ashley
sceva Jeff Kannada is out being super
fancy actor man today on a set but for
now what's at the headlines we've seen
tiny houses coming into fashion lately
but what about a tiny house on the open
seas mini yacht company jet capsule
presented a concept for what they called
their UFO but it's not an unidentified
flying object it's an unidentified
floating object it has a slow top speed
of 6.5 kilometers per hour but it's
propelled by a solar-powered electric
motor the shell is designed to exist
completely off the grid and would have a
way to convert sea and rainwater to
fresh drinking water for you and a
vegetable garden on board that would
serve as your food the cost well jet
capsule says they can make their
prototype for about $800,000 which is
really expensive but they assure us that
homes produced after the prototype would
cost about $200,000 so I guess that's
cheaper all right guys if you're a fan
of Lego this is a really cool idea that
is helping blind kids learn inspired by
the legendary toy blocks Braille uses
raised dot patterns that allow blind
people to read and Braille bricks takes
that concept and translates them to Lego
like blocks to buy three bricks have six
potential bumps on them just like a Lego
block would but these bricks have studs
removed to represent the 26 letters of
the Braille alphabet kids can then use a
baseplate to spell out words in
sentences correct errors easily and also
use the blocks as a normal building toy
the Brazilian design agency who created
Braille bricks released the design to
anyone who wants to create their own
which is pretty cool and also helps to
keep them from being sued by Lego so
high five Brazilian design agency and
also great great idea this is amazing
stuff I really love it when people come
up with ideas inspired by everyday
things that we're familiar with and use
it to help other people and I'm sure you
do too so what story will we talk about
on Thursday I feel like we have to talk
about living at sea in a tiny UFO pod
because
this seems like Waterworld waiting to
happen and I am dying to know what
Jeff's opinion of it is I'm also dying
to know what your opinion of it is so
please feel free to use the hashtag hate
TV over on twitter and tell us if you
would live in a tiny UFO pod in the
middle of the ocean it's a very
slow-moving UFO pod by the way don't
forget that uh if we like your tweets if
we think they're awesome if they're
clever interesting cool we will use them
on Thursday show and discuss your point
of view all that being said let's check
out our phones Agra for the day our
phone timer for the day today is basil
who took this photo on his galaxy s7
edge he says hi I'm basil Aziz age 15
from Calicut Kerala India and I travel a
lot like a lot one day when I was on
route to a Sport Shop I saw the weirdest
thing that could be installed in front
of a building it was a giant badminton
racket which according to them was the
tallest in the world I didn't find
anything to fit that description and the
internet though
anyway this racket is huge I watched
tomorrow daily and I'm a huge fan I must
say you guys are rockin in there and I
wish you guys all the best especially
you ash odd Geoff don't feel bad haha
well he's not here so he doesn't have to
hear that to part the picture attached
with the email was taken on a samsung
galaxy s7 edge this phone is a beast it
takes awesome pictures the dual pixel
technology is really making my day my
name is pronounced basil Aziz and yeah
of course you have my permission to use
the picture I'll stay tuned
ciao then basil basil this is awesome I
thought this would fit into the theme of
spring because you know most people want
to play badminton in the springtime
that's I'm just guessing that's I that
feels like it could be a thing I feel
like in the springtime you just want to
break out your badminton racket and go
crazy so if you guys have something that
is themed spring I feel free to get
creative with that theme you can email
it to tomorrow at cnet.com and just like
basil send us how to pronounce your name
send us your picture tell us what device
you took it on and a little story about
it and also give us permission to use it
on the show it's that easy you can also
find us on social media if you want to
hang out with us on the internet Jeff is
