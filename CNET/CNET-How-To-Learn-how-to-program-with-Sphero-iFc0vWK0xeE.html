co-founder of Orbotix
now you've brought the Olli in to show
us a part of the shape how does the Olli
differ from the sparrow
um so unlike Spiro which is sort of a
more general device you can do a lot of
different things with Sphero Ollie is
really just about driving crazy crazy
driving fun and tricks so all he
actually goes about six and a half
meters per second
if you hit a little ramp on the ground
that's maybe ten centimeters tall it can
it can jump about a metre and a half in
the air and when you're in the air you
can do different tricks you can cause it
to spin directions repeatedly do
different tricks record those tricks and
share them with your friends
so a month and a half ago either would
spark don't you tell us a bit about
spark
so spark is our program to teach kids
programming and basic math skills so
right now we're using Spiro in schools
so we have over a thousand sphero's in
over 125 schools museums and other
places where they're teaching these kids
program using a couple of our apps so we
have an app that we've created for the
phone called macro lab that lets you put
a series of commands in visually so you
don't have to write any code and then
you can play that sequence back alright
so I'm going to give you a quick demo
here of macro lab and we're gonna
program the ball to change color and
then drive forward for a certain amount
of time so you get this little plus sign
just say Drive it's the name of our
macro and now you can hit this plus sign
in the corner to add all these different
commands
so we're gonna add a RGB color command
you can set the color to whatever we
want and with red green and blue I'll
create that and then we'll add a new
command we're gonna add a roll command
so you can give it a speed so we'll say
a little over half speed and then you
give it an angle from 0 to 360 degrees
we'll say 0 degrees which will make it
go straight we'll create that now we
also need to give it a little bit of a
delay so how long is it going to drive
forward so we go down to the delay
command and this is in milliseconds so
1000 milliseconds is 1 second so we'll
create that and then after we drive we
want it to stop so we're gonna add a
stop command so now if I hit this little
play button on the bottom spero is gonna
drive forward for one second and how
have kids been responding to this
program
it's been great super awesome I think
because it's a it's a fun gaming robot
and there's all these games and they get
to play around with it and then program
it they kind of come at it from a
different angle
so it's not it's not an educational
robot that doesn't do anything until
they program it it's a fun gaming robot
that they also get to program so the
kids snap so much fun if they want to
take a little break from programming
they can watch one of our apps and play
the game for a little bit and then go
back to programming and they get really
excited the app macro lab was actually
built for our internal developers so
that we could quickly just test little
ideas without having to write any code
and I forget how it sort of got out to
kids but we realized that this app you
know was so much cooler than just you
know using it internally so we ended up
launching in the App Store and then we
went to a couple schools to start you
know see if it the idea actually worked
to use it as as a teaching tool or a
teaching app and yeah I mean just seeing
the reaction of the kids was awesome and
we launched our spark program
a month and a half ago on April 15th</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
