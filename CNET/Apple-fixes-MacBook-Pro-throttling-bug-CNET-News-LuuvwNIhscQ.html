new product launch beset by an
unexpected flaw that's exactly what
happened earlier in July when Apple
announced a surprise series of upgrades
to its 13 inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro
laptops the most notable of which was
the ability to add Intel's new 6th core
Core I 9 processor to the 15-inch
MacBook Pro almost immediately the first
people who bought these new systems
started reporting problems when they
were running very intensive particularly
video encoding and video rendering tasks
they found that the high-end processors
would throttle essentially the processor
would think that it got too hot it would
ramp down its clock speed in order to
bring the temperature down and then once
it was cooler it would go back up to its
normal clock speed not expected behavior
especially in a very high-end very
expensive laptop people even found that
last year's model which topped out is
just a core i7 processor could perform
some of the same tasks faster without
all the throttling people were mystified
we looked into it ourselves here we
lined up a 20-18 Core 9 9 15-inch
MacBook Pro and the 2017 core i7 version
said it's work doing a fairly complex
task and we saw very simply that our
clock speed went up and down like crazy
ping-ponging along with the temperature
on the new model whereas on the 2017
model it remains steady which is what
you'd expect while Apple now says they
have investigated the issue and
discovered a simple flaw basically a
software bug that was causing this
rattling to happen with these high-end
CPUs it actually affected every new
macbook pro 13 inch 15-inch the core I 9
models and other models people just saw
it in the high-end core 9 models because
that's where they were trying these very
intensive very high-end tasks so Apple
now says the software bug which affected
how the thermal system work is being
fixed with a new update that you can
download now and that should cause this
problem to go away and instead of this
up-and-down throttling you should have
even performance just like you'd expect
we're gonna download the new update as
soon as we can
run some more tests on it but that is
one has been happening with Apple's new
13 and 15 inch MacBook Pros a unexpected
software bug causing CPU throttling that
hopefully has been solved already</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
