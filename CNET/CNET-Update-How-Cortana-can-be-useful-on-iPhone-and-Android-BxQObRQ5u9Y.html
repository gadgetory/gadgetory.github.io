I'm Bridget Carey this is your C net
update Microsoft's Cortana is no longer
locked away in Windows you could bring
the voice-activated personal assistant
to your Android or iPhone with a new app
but she may not be much help she doesn't
have all her windows powers on iPhones
and androids so for example if you try
to use the Cortana app to text someone
the app can't actually text anyone for
you it's just a middleman or is that
middle woman you still have to text a
message yourself but the Cortana Android
app does have a few extra perks you can
activate it by saying hey Cortana still
it could just be easier to use Google
now voice commands so why would anyone
use the Cortana app well it can be
helpful if you have a Windows 10 PC with
Cortana because notifications from your
PC can be sent to your phone for example
set a reminder to pick up milk at the
store and your phone will remind you
when you get to the neighborhood that's
assuming you allow it to track your
location now aside from looking up info
on the web the app can also alert you of
upcoming events or flights on your
calendar and speaking of phones you can
say goodbye to the Nexus 6 Google is no
longer selling the Nexus 6 smartphone
and it's not exactly a surprise this
older model wasn't as popular the screen
was bigger than any other Nexus before
at 6 inches and it was 650 dollars when
it launched that's a top tier price and
normally Nexus phones are more
budget-friendly this year the new Nexus
6p has a slightly smaller screen and a
slightly smaller price it starts at $500
also this is the end for the Firefox
phone Mozilla the company behind Firefox
said it's gonna stop developing and
selling the Firefox operating system it
was a very basic system first launched
in 2013 and it was meant for super cheap
phones and it only had web apps but it
never caught on
not even in developing countries the
Firefox operating system was also used
in some televisions and we may also be
saying goodbye soon to a much larger
tech entity Yahoo the company announced
it wants to separate its alibaba stake
from the main core business of Yahoo
these are
become two separate publicly traded
companies Alibaba is like the Amazon of
China it's huge and it's the most
profitable part of Yahoo so what about
the Yahoo search email tumblr and all
the other core Yahoo thinks well they
could be sold Yahoo's not explicitly for
sale but the company would entertain
offers separating Yahoo's court from
Alibaba makes it easier to sell
now don't forget earlier this year
Verizon bought AOL so anything's
possible but it would be a year before
Yahoo is able to finalize such a split
and it requires approval from
shareholders that's it for this tech
news update and there's more at cnet.com
