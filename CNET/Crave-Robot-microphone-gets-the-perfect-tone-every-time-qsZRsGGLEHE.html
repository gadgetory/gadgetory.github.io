the pan of studio
I'm happy to show you guys one of our
best friends at the studio here his name
is Mike robot
all right so essentially as you record a
guitar cabinet the speaker is 360
degrees therefore if you move the
microphone left to right and forward and
back it's the same as going up and down
so this microphone with this system that
we have build here I have a motor that
allows it to go left and right and a
motor back here that allows to go
forward and backward the way that we
control the microphone robot is I have
an analog controller inside my control
room so we use two XLR cables and plug
them into our XLR tie line that goes
directly into my controller so this is
my robot controller
it's basically an arcade joystick that
allows it to go left right forward and
back and I can actually do both
simultaneously if I really wanted to so
basically the XLR cables are coming from
our Thailand and plug directly in its
get I got a DI guitar track set up on a
amplifier in here going directly into
that cabinet room so I'm going to play
this guitar if I'm gonna loop it and
I'll show you guys how the robot sounds
moving left to right and the difference
is that you can achieve
it's a background story on the robot
pretty much found out the idea from one
my favorite producers Eric Valentine and
from there I was like I need to build
this how am I gonna build this every
band that I've recorded I would ask them
and be like is anyone a robotic genius
or an electronics engineer nerd and
finally I found one guy his name is
Kerry gold grant friend of mine and so
together we worked on this robot if you
pretty much built the entire thing for
me I made it all work the one that Eric
Valentine has ended be super oxide we
also have one they both cost them like
well over $35 to build like at the metal
room so I didn't want to spend that much
money so it looks a little ghetto but
it's absolutely functional
