plus it's plus a second camera there's
now two 12 megapixel cameras built in
the iPhone 7 plus one has the wide angle
28 millimeter lens the same as the
iPhone 7 the other is a telephoto 56
millimeter lens but why have to complete
cameras with two lenses well to explain
it let me show you a traditional
point-and-shoot or DSLR and how the lens
can work as you know and we have many of
these cameras in our lives you can
change the focal length of your lens to
zoom in that's how we get a zoom feature
and that works great when you have a
large camera where the big lens on it
you can move in and out that isn't so
great on the lens you want to put in
something that goes in your pocket or
your purse so how does it work the same
as before you go into the camera app to
take a picture but now there's a new
button right there on the screen let me
blow it up a teeny bit it says one X
it's right above the shutter and when
you go to take a picture it's using the
wide-angle lens and taking a picture
just as always but now with this button
you can do one of two things first you
can just tap it and it jumps to 2 X now
you're taking a picture with a telephoto
lens you're getting the same high
quality 12 megapixel picture or the
beautiful optical lens no software
needed the second thing you can do is
you can put your finger on it and drag
across it and you can zoom from 1x to 5x
as you go beyond 2x you're doing
software zoom but now since it's
starting with that telephoto lens the
quality that image is four times better
than before with software zoom in fact
it's so much better we decided to push
it even further all the way up to 10x so
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
