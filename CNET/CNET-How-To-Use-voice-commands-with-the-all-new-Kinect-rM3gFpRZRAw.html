one has over the PlayStation 4 is the
new Kinect sensor the accessories
included in the box which is one of the
reasons the Xbox one cost $100 more than
the PlayStation 4 however this new and
improved Kinect brings even more
functionality to the Xbox one while
PlayStation 4 owners can opt for the
PlayStation camera which costs 60 bucks
even then the system can't match the
features of an Xbox one with a Kinect
I'm dan Graziano and I'm going to show
you how to get the most out of the
all-new connect the sensor along with
your cable box are plugged into the back
of the system which is in turn connected
to the TV to the HDMI
after completing the Xbox one setup
process which involves calibrating the
Kinect and signing into your Xbox
account you're ready to go
saying Xbox select will display all
available commands on a given page after
setting up your cable settings you can
say Xbox watch ESPN or any other channel
to tune into live TV the volume can be
controlled by saying Xbox mute unmute
volume up or volume down Xbox Live Gold
codes can also be scanned into the
Kinect and add it to your account by
saying Xbox use a code saying Xbox go
home will bring you back to the
council's main menu specific apps can be
opened by saying Xbox go to and then
speaking the app of your choosing for
example Xbox go to Dead Rising 3 new
users can be logged in by saying Xbox
sign-in followed by the users full name
this system can also be turned off with
the command Xbox turn off or powered on
by saying Xbox on Kinect doesn't work
all the time and if you find yourself
repeating commands over and over again
enter the settings by clicking on the
menu button on the controller select
connect and choose connect doesn't hear
me follow the instructions on the screen
and this will recalibrate your sensor
for a complete list of Kinect commands
