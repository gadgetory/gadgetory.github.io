many of you remember the previous
generation I mean this is a whole new
car it's bigger more luxurious and
dangerously close to stepping on the
toes of Hyundai's other big sedan the
genesis v6 what's Hyundai UPS you here I
mean is there really room and it's
lineup for too big look though barges
let's take a look at this 2012 fully
loaded Hyundai Azera try to find out now
there is only a little bit smaller than
its bigger sibling the Genesis about 3
inches shorter from nose to tail and
about three inches narrower I also like
how this front headlight kind of joins
this bit of chrome trim and runs all the
way down the side of the vehicle almost
to the back while I'm back here let me
just point out that the atheras trunk is
actually a little bit bigger than the
Genesis thanks in part to its
front-wheel drive
architecture now otherwise these cars
basically trade blows with interior
dimensions they're about the same size
more or less let's check out the engine
room now as I mentioned before the front
wheel drive Azera is a puller not a
pusher like the rear wheel drive Genesis
the Genesis is also up 40 horsepower and
about half a litre of displacement over
the is there a 3.3 liter v6 that outputs
293 horsepower now this is a brand new
engine for Hyundai and it's no slouch in
and of itself direct injection gets it
255 pounds of torque at the medius part
of its curve and an epa-estimated 20
miles per gallon in the city and 29
miles per gallon on the highway
of course these there is also two to
three thousand dollars cheaper than the
Genesis depending on how you spec it and
it's got six cupholders versus the
Genesis is four
now speaking of cupholders let's take a
look inside of this cabin here now if
you've seen one Hyundai you've basically
seen them all this is an automaker
that's made its career out of reusing
and recycling its tech and making cheap
materials look much more expensive than
they actually are now the is there is
basic infotainment system is pretty much
the standard fare Hyundai infotainment
system that we've seen in all of its
cars before now you've got navigation
here with traffic you've got the ability
to do Bluetooth hands-free calling and
audio streaming down here at the bottom
you've got a USB port and an auxilary
input that can be bridged with a $35
cable to form a high-speed iPod
connection up here at the top we've got
the OnStar Beam blue link button blue
link is basically Hyundai's telematics
service you push this button and you can
ask blue link to get you directions to a
destination the nearest fuel prices you
can have it send a text message to your
friends to let you know where you're
going and when you'll be there you can
have it send a text message to you to
let you know if your car's gone
somewhere without your permission now
making this spacious cabin feel even
more Airy is this right here a full
length panoramic moonroof
this thing lifts and slides back pretty
much giving you a huge view of the sky
above you and making this cabin feel a
lot more light and airy now that's part
of a $4,000 technology option that you
definitely want because I mean basically
look at it it's cool so this is the 2012
Hyundai Azera it's really comfortable
like a you know there's a lot to like
about the thing quiet cabin when you're
cruising around at city speeds and it's
not too much louder at highway speeds to
Mesa grab moves first is the standard
pedal travel is what it is it's pretty
much your car at its default state now
there's also a second mode called active
eco and the active part of active eco
comes into play and that what's
happening is that your pedal travel has
actually been remapped so half throttle
isn't exactly half throttle anymore it's
actually a little less that gives the
car sort of a
of you having a lighter pedal foot than
you actually have regardless of whether
DirecTV Co is on or not the biggest
detriment to this cars performance is
probably going to be the 6-speed
automatic transmission now it's not an
offensive gearbox the problem is that if
you're looking for sporting driving in a
car like this you're not gonna get it
unless you wait for it because like most
automatic transmissions on the roof day
this gearbox is basically short shifting
every gear so that you get the most fuel
economy by keeping your revs as low as
possible that's not good for power
it is good at the pump Hyundai makes it
easy to spec your 2012 Azera or
difficult if you don't like their
all-or-nothing technology option
it's basically $32,000 base and four
thousand dollars for that technology
package if you want the big sunroof in
the better stereo system
