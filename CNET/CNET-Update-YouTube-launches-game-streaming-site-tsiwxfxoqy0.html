Amazon might be delivering your next hot
meal I'm Jeff Bakalar filling in for
Bridget Carey this week this is your
cnet update game streaming juggernaut
twitch is about to get some serious
competition youtube gaming is launching
today and will introduce a new
destination for game streamers and
spectators for what's already a
tremendously popular medium online the
service has rolled out on Google Play
and gaming youtube com you can actually
check it out right now users can browse
various live feeds of game play and chat
with other viewers it sounds like Amazon
may be entering the food delivery seen
reports are surfacing that the company
has started experimenting with delivery
of hot meals in the Seattle area further
tapping into the already established
prime now service but with Maine State
delivery sites like delivery calm and
seamless how can Amazon break into that
already crowded landscape well Amazon
does have a gigantic user base all of
which frequent the site regularly and
have their payment information stored on
the site so if Amazon can become even
more of a one-stop shop well then
customers won't need to look anywhere
else for dinner Rovio the studio behind
the mobile game sensation Angry Birds is
laying off 260 employees Rovio CEO says
the company was quote too eager to
explore new business opportunities so
essentially he's saying that they spread
themselves too thin to be productive
Rovio employees who are working on the
angry birds movie won't be let go but I
gotta be honest that movie better come
out soon because i think the Angry Birds
hourglass is about to run out and
finally Microsoft is reporting that
Windows 10 adoption has been very strong
as of today 75 million devices are
running the new operating system that's
only been out for about a month sure a
lot of that has to do with the fact that
Windows 10 is free for most current
Windows users but it's also because
Windows 10 has seen mostly a positive
reaction from critics and a smooth
launch save for a few of those privacy
concerns
the company though is trying to improve
transparency in that department most
recently by publishing an informational
page on their site that does it for this
update for the very latest head over

York on Jeff Bakalar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
