soul republic shadow wireless a
bluetooth headphone that costs $100 and
comes in two colors at launch black you
see here and a rich ray LG made this
around the neck design popular with its
line of tone headphones and now soul
Republic has improved on that design
with what it calls the first inner
wireless headphone to feature a NASA
inspired biomorphic design it's
water-resistant and you can use it at
the gym but it's not being marketed as a
sports headphone and I wouldn't try to
run with it because the earpieces will
probably slip out this headphone does
seem sturdier than LG's tone headphones
that I found it more comfortable to wear
the ear pieces fit well and the bendable
nature of the cholera conforms nicely
the contour of your neck which is that
guess what Sol Republic means by
biomorphic design battery life is rated
at a decent eight hours and the
headphones equipped with Bluetooth 4.0
and apt ex support apt X is supposed to
make bluetooth streaming sound better
with devices that support it but it's
questionable how much of a difference it
really makes the headphone can't connect
to two devices at once so you can switch
back and forth between them and there's
a three button remote and microphone
integrated into the collar on the right
side wireless range is thirty feet or
around ten meters
I thought the sound quality was quite
good for a bluetooth headphone I put it
up against LG's tone HPS 800 which lists
for $100 but costs around $65 online the
shadow Wireless offered fuller more
detailed sound with deeper better
defined bass it clearly sounded better
this year other manufacturers such as
JBL are set to ship products similar in
style to this headphone so I expect it
will have plenty of competition going
forward that said the shadow wireless is
one of the better products Seoul
Republic has put out for the money and
it's a good value at $100 look forward
to Rive in stores late this spring and
be available in other colors later this
year
David Conroy that's the SOL Republic
shadow wireless thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
