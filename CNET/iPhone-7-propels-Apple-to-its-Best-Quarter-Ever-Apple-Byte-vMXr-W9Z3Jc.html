the apple byte for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple Apple just
reported its highest order ever in the
history of the company this week thanks
to yes the iphone now in its first
fiscal quarter for 2017 which represents
the 4th calendar quarter of 2016 Apple
posted 78.4 billion dollars in revenue
compared to 70 5.9 a year ago it may not
be the most innovative phone right now
but there is no denying the power of the
iphone and specifically the iphone 7
plus apple sold a record 70 8.3 million
iphones up from 70 4.8 a year earlier
and Tim Cook said the iphone 7 plus was
a larger part of the iphone sales mix
compared to any plus model in past years
and that means oh I love that show and
for you young uns look up in living
color with this amazing tool called
YouTube ok Mac sales rose slightly to
5.4 million from 5.3 which is surprising
after the release of the all new Mac Pro
and a sign that it really didn't provide
a significant bump in sales with the new
model and my good friend the iPad it was
another negative quarter selling 13.1
million units compared to 16.1 last year
ouch and I don't even know if they can
ever turn that back around now
during the earnings conference call Tim
Cook was asked about apple's next moves
in the television space and original
content he responded in terms of
original content we have put our toe in
the water doing some original content
for Apple music and that will be rolling
out through the year we are learning
from that and we'll go on from there the
way that we participate in the changes
that are going on in the media industry
that I fully expect to accelerate from
the cable bundle beginning to break down
uh toe in the water I know Apple
typically comes late to the party but
dude put your whole foot in the water
already like this company you might have
heard of called Netflix now we did add
that Apple does have more things planned
for the Apple TV would offer no details
hold on let me guess it's going to be a
new processor with 4k support no TV
subscription service a new
people shows that you can only watch on
Apple music with a subscription yes I'll
write a new report from Bloomberg says
Apple is working on a new chip for
future max that would take on more
functionality that Intel chips currently
handle oh really now the chip went into
development last year and is similar to
one already used to power the keyboards
touch bar it's internally codenamed t310
and is being built using arm technology
it would handle some of the computers
low power functionality and will work
alongside an Intel processor the new
t310 ship could make it into new MacBook
Pros this year Apple's first arm based
mac tip the t1 was part of the new
macbook pro update and helped power the
touch bar for things like emojis
shortcuts for apps and the computers
fingerprint reader now according to the
report there are no near-term plans for
Apple to completely ditch Intel chips in
their mac laptops and desktops and you
know I've been lukewarm on the touch bar
you all know this but for anyone taking
the bar exam it's just a big note that's
because multiple states are telling law
students they either have to disable the
touch bar or leave their macbook pros at
home entirely if they plan on using them
while taking the bar exam in February
the reason the touch bars predictive
text feature could compromise the exams
integrity now North Carolina you'll be
asked to disable it but in New York and
Colorado if you show up with a touch bar
macbook pro you'll have to write your
answers by hand instead of using the
exam soft software on your machine or
you'll have the option to download it on
another machine yeah sounds like fun all
right Apple earpods get bug fixes in a
firmware update but it's not clear
exactly what they address and there are
no new features hopefully it fixes the
random times the audio just cuts out
when I've used them apple also stopped
making their own Apple displays and
instead they now recommend LG's
ultra-fine 5k display but there's just
one problem the hardware can become
completely unusable when it's within two
meters of a router that's just 6.6 feet
away now sometimes the display will
consistently disconnect or even freeze
the macbook pro reconnecting it means
you also need to reboot your computer LG
has acknowledged the issue exists and it
may or may not affect you depending on
your setup but
this is the only display that Apple
recommends you to use on their website
huh you know what's coming that's a bad
apple and remember Justin Long the actor
who used to be in one of the most
memorable Apple TV commercial series of
all time he was the mac guy and now he's
in this Huawei out here take a look I
have a ton of experience in tech have I
ever directed anything before no do I
have a director outfit a star a half to
the vest yes holy crap that's a bad
apple too now I'm not sure what's worse
this or the verizon guy doing sprint ads
because they're both pretty bad but
let's end on a high note according to a
report from the New York Post Prince yes
Prince will finally come to Apple music
on februari the 12th the late artists
and legends music is only on title at
the moment but his songs will now come
to Apple music Spotify Pandora who will
play and more now it doesn't mean as an
entire collection will be available and
come on if you're a real fan you
actually bought Prince's music this is
great news but I also can't play
anything related to prints on the show
because you know as people will try to
take down this video like they did to
that dancing baby in 2007 all right
that's going to do it for this way you
can email us at the alpha x 10 cnet com
or to me a Brian song base want to watch
it we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
