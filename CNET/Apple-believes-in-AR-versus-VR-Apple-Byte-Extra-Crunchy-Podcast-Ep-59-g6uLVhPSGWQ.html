Oh totally totally I like that um use
the Apple for something yes you know you

hundred 61 62 63 eight leave your name
your number not your number name someone
pick someone did someone did leave your
name where you're from we also actually
like you to add on and contribute to the
progression of the show from what I mean
by that is a lot of you have questions
that you won't have answered but for
example last week we talked about AI and
we didn't actually have any calls about
artificial intelligence this week I'm
curious what you guys think about that
is Apple behind it so when we have a
topic of a show where topic that becomes
kind of at the forefront and becomes an
important thing that we go back and
forth about we want to hear what you
guys think so you can contribute to this
again this is your show just as much as
it is ours yes we need the hive mind we
love the hive mind you guys have
contributed plenty of time so let's get
to the show a lot of stories going on
here right now I think the number one
most pent up demand when it comes to
apple products is everyone is asking
about the macbooks when are the new
macbooks coming when will we see them we
talked about it a little bit about it
last week how Apple changed their dates
for their earnings report they moved it
from the October the 27th to the 25th so
macbooks are clearly on our mind with
all the rumors and rumblings are
saying that apple may indeed actually
announced new macbooks on the
twenty-seventh October that would be a
Thursday I believe I have to double
check my calendar say yeah so uh for
those of you who are looking around
wondering what to do just just wait
around then and we'll answer some
questions and our phone calls but just
to give you a current the current state
of why Apple needs these so much apple
mac shipments slid thirteen percent in
quarter three of this year along with an
overall pc market slow now why is it
important so this is if you compare them
to where they were at last year apple
mac shipments lid thirteen percent now
the overall industry when we just talk
about pcs as a whole slid around 55 ish
percent okay but Apple is at thirteen
percent that's a double that's a big
jump we know Apple hasn't upgraded their
macbooks for a long time yes we know a
lot of you are waiting for the next
thing for me all the rumors point to
this new macbook pro with an oled touch
bar and I think it's cool i do i really
want to see how cool it actually is am I
I don't know though if that's enough for
me to buy a new laptop I think that now
these days it's about just giving us the
most powerful laptop we always want new
features I I still think it's really
cool but we've seen this done in gaming
laptops from a razor it's not even if
they put touch ID on it we are in what's
called the post-pc era pc shipments
overall have declined Oh consecutively
the past eight quarters okay overall the
industry overall what does that tell you
what are you guys using your devices for
the most hmm I wonder hmm I wonder what
you guys are using the most right now
yeah exactly the phone exactly a phone
the phone is the computer laptops like a
very secondary thing right now you know
it's like I mean we use them for work
but personal use it's like I have a
phone I don't really need a laptop if
you're in a content creation you're
using a computer of some sort yes and
yes you are using it for email and
whatnot but the this whole idea that
it's going to just change the fortunes
of Apple by releasing an OLED touch bar
it's not going to happen it just isn't
it will the Mac line has always been
kind of an unsaid piece of the puzzle to
their earnings it's part of the puzzle
they bring in I think if I recall right
man I shouldn't actually I don't want it
I don't want to go on a lemon throw out
a number of how many millions of dollars
it makes up per quarter because I'm
gonna be wrong right now I just don't
want to spit out but i but I believe it
makes up somewhere around like still
twenty five percent of their overall
earnings somewhere around twenty to
twenty-five percent and that's a big
chunk you can't just abandon that so the
market overall is down but let's talk
about that phone thing that phone thing
the iphone maybe there's better better
you know greener pastures ahead at least
for the iphone according to Apple
insiders a report from investment firm
UBS we know that iphone sales have
declined last quarter they're most
likely going to decline again this
quarter but momentum according to UBS
from the current iphone 7 is going to
help carry them into 2017 they report or
estimate that it will spurn eight
percent unit growth for the fiscal year
of 2017 fiscal year technically starts
um basically this q4 of 2016 is q1
fiscal year of 2017 so those last three
months october november december is q1
fiscal quarter I see although in our
regular calendar it is q4 of the year so
they oh they expect a eight percent unit
growth and then of course we like to
talk about the iphone x iphone future
iphone 8 or please don't make the iphone
7s that would go don't do that that
would just be stupid no no no no
according to them also in 2018 oh they
expect to see a sixteen percent
year-over-year growth in units purely
because of the iphone i know some people
like saying oh the iphones gonna get a
whole bunch of lift because the galaxy
exploded twice that's not gonna say i
don't know if it's gonna be that big of
lift quite honest I think android over
all other Android manufacturers are
going to see the bay
gains from this whole Samsung debacle so
you people will not go to an iphone
they're gonna go to like a galaxy some
will some will but I don't think it's
gonna be like oh fifty percent of
Samsung Note users are going to go get
an iphone now yeah I think it might be
maybe ten percent me a lot of those
people a lot of those people are touting
like the note 7 was the most advanced
buzz in the world was and now it's not
being made anymore so what's the nest
next most advanced phone in the world
iphone 7 it depends on what you're
looking at for example true uh if you
want it's it's gonna start coming down
to certain features do you want the best
AI in a phone well we talked about that
last week that's a google pixel Google
right so yeah um best camera what is
that yeah that's camera arguably
s'alright yeah arguably according to
dxomark who rates these cameras they say
and they they believe that the pixel
camera is also the best rated camera
overall in a mobile device ever highest
score ever that's pretty big so um it
doesn't mean though here again is the
always it doesn't mean that that phone
is the best one for you yes like it's
not for me hey not for me just cuz a
phone has the best specs doesn't mean
it's the best phone for you like my mom
my mom bless her like I don't even know
yeah mrs. mama tongue I don't even know
what iOS version she's using right now
she might do me using eight for all I
know like do you help her out with that
stole my gosh I I mean I didn't know
there were features on the iphone like
increasing the font size to as large as
possible I didn't know us I don't know
the font could get that large about that
let's just put it that way I'm like what
is going on here but you know a pixel
phone is not going to be a good phone
for my mom there's no matter what it is
not cuz just because of the use of use
abilities ability her change you know
okay even when you just upgrade her
phone it's it's like teaching someone
come let's not even teaching someone how
to write a binuclear had a lot it's
likely your weapon or teaching someone
how to crawl and then walk it's not it's
not even like a bike no it's it's really
it's really hard so um apple iphone 8
iphone ex iphone future whatever you
want to call it prospects obviously look
pretty good and then there were a few
patents that were thrown around this
past week about a new super resolution
camera with this folded design that may
aid in saving space as well as provide
better zoom and image quality and then
there was another patent that was
granted apple recently just overall
about new display tech that really
points to the fact that this next phone
or a future phone will be having
edge-to-edge glass display but
completely not know black bezel
whatsoever I'm will see that look kind
of cool we'll see I this stuff is always
we'll see we'll see how this is if you
want to talk about the future though and
kind of the bane one of the talking
points for our show this week Tim Cook
interview recently by BuzzFeed news and
BuzzFeed is getting a lot of access to
Tim Cook recently I've noticed this
because i follow this he's a fan for
sure um Tim Cook talked about Apple's
augmented reality ambitions now cook in
the past has alluded to the fact that he
an apple prefer augmented reality /
virtual reality cook told to BuzzFeed
news there's no substitute for human
contact and so you want the technology
to encourage that we are high on AR for
the long run I think AR can be huge and
he also echoed these comments earlier at
during an ABC interview and he said this
in earnings reports as well virtual
reality no is exploding now you know
taking you away into these new worlds
and experiences we have the HTC vive we
have the oculus rift and the PlayStation
VR just came out now I own a ps4 have
you tried it I haven't tried well I've
tried it in its earlier form but I'm
going to get one purely because I want
if I had to choose one I would most
likely based on my experiences I would
want to oculus rift from a hardware
standpoint okay because they have these
crazy touch controls but it's going to
cost me a PC and a set up it's probably
gonna cost you around 2,000 3,000 bucks
well guess what I have a ps4
to get a more than capable above-average
VR experience on a ps4 I only cost me
500 more bucks so what do you think what
do you what are you gonna do at a PS
quad we're gonna get one right what why
would you not if you have a ps4 when you
know that the tech is only gonna get
better are you really gonna drop 3 g's
on this right now and I get early
adopters I love you because you have to
we need early adopters in men I'd be the
first to tell you I'm an early adopter
in different things yeah totally we need
all the feedback and stuff but UH one of
my old homies from GameSpot ryan
mcdonald he's tweeting about playing
arkham aside Batman Arkham Asylum don't
seem boiler don't spoil that so I mean
right there like how much are they how
much are they I need them the set up
basically the the full set up is 500
bucks that's not bad that's not bad at
all it's supposed to be comfy um they
say the resolution is a little lower
than your screen so it can bother you
but they say it's good enough I think
that this whole rumbling of a ps4 pro is
gonna help amp up that graphic fidelity
through the headset but again we're
gonna talk yeah we're gonna it'll
improve but again Apple's not playing in
VR they want to play in AR he's all Tim
Cook is always referenced pokemons go as
like a great they are experienced in
come on it was it is and it was but this
is some BuzzFeed also outlined some of
the little steps that Apple has taken
that point to the fact that they are
really deep into some of this AR stuff
but again Apple has yet to connect the
dots to put anything out there like that
we know this in 2013 apple acquired a
company called primeSense this was the
company that was behind the most the
sorry the xbox kinect technology they
built the xbox kinect cameras apple
acquired that company so that was like
the original gaming hardware dance
central is one of my favorite games of
all time game so good right so they
acquired that company in 2013 in May of
2015 apple also acquired a German
augmented reality firm called met Matt
Mateo few months later they snapped up
phase shift there the company behind
real time motion capture technology used
in Star Wars the movies they recently
purchased poached a VR research
scientists Yuri Petrov from facebook
oculus division they also acquired a
gentleman from magic leap which is has
oh you have the ball magic leap is magic
leap is the bomb their goal of an
augmented reality of basically looking
wherever you are and not only just
getting information but experiencing
things like a whale jumping out of the
floor as if it was on the ocean yeah
like jessa cool stuff the stuff that
we've seen from them is pretty well we
can find something so Apple is done a
lot of these different things they have
built the a team of people to work on
augmented reality and they believe it is
the platform and really Tim Cook is not
hiding anything from us this is what
they are going to do to move forward
when it comes to this space because and
I do agree with virtual reality you're
locked away from people but then we see
a lot of games where people are sitting
around a TV seen what the person sees
laughing with them while they're in a VR
experience doesn't magically demo yeah
like a robot underneath underneath a
table like underneath the fidelity yeah
pretty redonkulous pretty ridiculous
looking so we'll see find the whale
thing you know what they're gonna call
you know what they're gonna call their
augmented reality platform right I have
no Apple reality Apple reality I just
came up with that just now it's gonna be
called Apple reality I was gonna I was
saying I hope it's not gonna be like I
reality or something haha I goggle do it
it's gonna be Apple reality I ish you
not I swear that's what again parable
that's turrible turrible we'd like to
take this moment to tell you that we
don't have a word from our sponsor in
fact it's just me and Beecham yes this
is this we are the sponsor right now but
it's a sponsor nothing that dog is our
sponsor in life yes but uh there's
rumblings that we might be getting
someone a next episode swig but we're
still in business oh yeah we're always
in business so I just want to take a
breather we have some more stories here
all in the app world you know Tim Cook
was talking about how he wants an
experience where look it's a shared
experience we like augmented reality we
should be able to reach out and touch
things and be a part of it I don't know
if they're taking this too far but maybe
they're applying some of this we want
people to reach out and touch our
products in stores this is just recently
happened uh in store openings there's a
redesign a regent street store in london
england i was just reopened as well as
apples yorkdale location in toronto
canada apple is no longer tethering and
this is for those you watching there's
some great shots of the reason sir Apple
is no longer tethering their phones with
that kind of like annoying uh cable
cable magnetic sticky thing that was on
there if you pulled it off it's an alarm
they are completely just letting the
products be so you can grab and hold
them and I will tell you this from
someone who worked at an apple retail
store during its first about two years
they may they may think that this is a
good idea it's not a good but when they
first started doing that in our stores
it was not a good idea yeah i mean when
i first heard about that I was like
that's there's gonna be some people
running out of the store with phones and
people tackling people and the violence
if you know if you have ever worked in a
retail store first things first okay
when someone steal something you have to
actually catch them in the act and
basically talk to them but you can't
accuse them of stealing oh you can't
they can put something in their pocket
yeah and you can talk to them they can
even walk out the store but unless you
see them and approach you there's not
much you can actually do to stop someone
from stealing something so you have to
have like fully like full probable it's
not even probable cause even if you say
I saw you steal that handed over they
can say I didn't see anything and walk
away they literally can't we were never
we were told never to chase anyone
because you never know if someone was
around the corner yeah and knocking you
out you I'll tell you one of the
greatest stories that i know and i'm not
encouraging this but an apple reit or
retail thievery okay so during the
holiday season they would put all the
boxes of the ipods stacked against the
wall and people could walk up and just
grab one box and say hey i want to buy
this they wanted it to feel really
accessible okay homeboy came to our
store in a trench coat walked up to the
counter
lean forward and extended his trench
coat around roughly six to eight iPods
grab them pull them in his trench coat
and walked out the store and you guys
you guys all saw him we assume you
couldn't do a couple people saw him do
it so what happens you just get his
picture on camera yeah and you hope to
find him next time but you still can't
you can't it's when it's there's a
difference between stealing from
someone's house versus stealing from
retail store yeah you know the way but
it just is really hard so all I'm saying
is is this this whole idea of
untethering things is not a good thing
it sounds like it's inviting problems oh
there you know everyone has like a loss
prevention percentage was it just last
week we had that guy going through the
apple store just smashing all those
phones like and they were tethered oh
yeah and we know it look there's not
enough security all you have to do is
just run in there grab a couple and run
out oh well I guess their whole thing is
like oh we got iCloud find my iphone
hunted so you might not you I actually
not want to do that that's I'm just
saying so that that's one thing that the
doing if you want to it looks like it
appears that the iphone 7 plus in jet
black is now widely available in us
stores we're talking about everywhere
from major cities Chicago h-town Los
Angeles i know i'm showing you i'm gimme
all shout outs Miami New York Philly San
Diego San Francisco the iphone 7 plus
jet black appears to be readily
available in these stores Wow northern
in northern middle of America they're
just like no apple store in sight look
at that yeah there's also no people this
is how people move flying over there I
got it my love for you Montana and North
Dakota I got nothing but love for you
okay you have you Apple by loves North
Dakota and Montana I remember I flew
over all those states coming back from
together right and all I could see was
just white yeah that white ground yeah I
want knowing I want someone from North
Dakota or Montana to give us a call just
to show us to show this love back holla
holla lata play uh we also have apple
quietly updating their website and
confirming that the nike
Plus Apple watch is going to launch on
October the 28th this is kind of the
s'more sport geared nike partnership
nike branded apple watch with some
customizable faces in and really some
interface stuff but really it's still an
apple watch and it has that sporty
bandwidth like the vault and white and
black and Gray's it's cool if that's you
know if you want to use it like that I
think it's pretty neat I'm in the
tractor metrics and displays them on why
would I assume to believe is a custom
watch face that you can only get with a
nike+ watch because the Nike+ app exists
and you don't have those faces so that's
coming out on october 28 and then just
to follow up with Samsung and Apple we
know they've been going back and forth
back and forth since 2011 over these
patent infringement is swipe to unlock
your phone looks like my phone recently
this past week their case finally made
it to the Supreme Court for an appeal
basically Samsung is appealing the fact
that app they owe Apple basically all of
their profits from the phones that they
sold that were found to be violating
these these patent infringement sore
infringing on Apple's patents let me
just say that properly so the Supreme
Court justices a few of them right off
the bat said we can see how there might
be a similarity but it's not like
someone bought a samsung phone entirely
thinking that it was because it looked
like an apple phone they probably also
bought it for other reasons right it
might have a few other features it's an
android phone so what point no really
right even though it kind of looks like
it yeah it's not like come on no one's
like oh buddy here they might have
stolen our design what smartphones look
like so ultimately it's going to be
about two or three months for the
Supreme Court to finally rule on this
aspect of the case they will then send
it back down to the lower courts to
decide the final final amount that
Samsung owes apple this has been going
on since 2011 people oh my gosh and it's
just interesting how 2016 Samsung's
phone who was arguably finally going to
surpass what the iphone did exploded
twice
so sad so sad so ya know seven they
they're not winning um not not very much
we're for a minute if they were for a
minute they were so you know that's a
lot of the stuff I think that we should
just go hit up the voice mails and see
what you all are talking about in all
right you guys make this show what it is
so let's do it thank you for calling
here we go thank you hey guys i'm
calling from Thomas in New South Wales
Australia Brian Beecham great show by
the way this I guess I just wanted to
ask you quickly I've got a macbook pro
now that I've had for about five years
and I just feel as though from it's time
for me to upgrade should I be waiting
for anything have you heard any news
about the new macbook pro was yet or
should I upgrade now considering that I
don't name performance in a big way it's
only sort of like a working machine
could i downgrade you say me something
like a macbook air and be happy with
that great show guys look forward to
your answer cheers I think the best
answer for a lot of people is look
always wait for new product announcement
because the current stuff gets lower in
price refurbished stuff gets lower in
price if you just need a basic computer
and you don't need anything hi Lee know
anything processor intensive or Ram
intensive just wait till the new ones
come out and then look for scoops on the
refurbished sites like you have to
literally do it right after they
announced it though right after I was
like right after do you want to wait
like a week or something for them to
adjust pricing holding a lot of times
they will already adjust pricing right
when it happens okay so I'm just saying
do it do it and if you're in that spot
cool okay next call hey guys this is
Joel Zwick from New York oh I was just
wondering what do you guys think what
happened if Tim Cook wasn't to see Oh
anymore like what would happen if he
quit was who will take his job alright
talk to you guys later bye now at first
when we talked about this Beach you're
like I don't know cares right right do
you have an opinion beach I don't I
don't really like who would replace him
like I quite honestly I don't know but I
will say this it led me to think and
I've been thinking about this a long
time once Steve Jobs past
everyone said oh Johnny I've is still
there he's the great designer he is the
one that makes apple arms designs and
what Apple is okay I'm gonna I'm gonna
throw I'm gonna let's look at this
objectively do you think we would have
would Steve Jobs would he have ever
approved of the iphone battery pack to
look like that no no there is no way
there's just no way he's all about plain
lines like a and you know what he would
say go back to the drawing board there's
plenty of stories of how nitpicky Steve
Jobs was for those of you that don't
know even if you remember the very when
the imac took on this whole new design
that had that movable neck that you
could move around that was inspired not
by jony ive but because Steve Jobs saw a
sunflower and said let's make a computer
that looks like a sunflower okay that
was his idea and you know it was him who
like grabbed the neck of it and said
this is good enough okay jony ive's to
designs that are his and his alone have
been the iphone battery case or at least
under his watch seriously and the
earpods the air pods okay the iphone
battery case and the air pods think this
is the battery cases the apple the Apple
watch I think a lot of people some
people debate why did you make a round
watch I think the Apple watch is cool I
don't think it's anything we haven't
seen before it's literally just the
rounded corners of a nap and if that's
good enough that's fine I actually
really do enjoy the Apple watch but from
a standpoint of like who approved the
iphone battery case you can't tell me
that's good design I know you can't and
it was also Brosius fixing a problem
with their battery life which points out
something negative about the phone like
having a crappy battery so and I mean I
just ice need to point that out so I
don't even think Johnny I've said that
he always wanted to make like cups like
like when he
was done with Apple he'd like to make
like cups well they just you just
redesigned the grocery bags they did
this the sort a sore back those it does
another great innovation that is a that
that received a patent from apple so I
love again I do not dislike Johnny I've
but there's there's other things like
okay Apple pencil hey bro like you're
gonna have it stick out of your us your
lightning port sorry and there's no
place to put it other than it just
sticks around me you guys didn't say hey
maybe we should just copy Microsoft and
put magnets on it so that it doesn't get
lost like I'm just saying there's there
there's some there's a there's been a
clear disconnect so still oh yeah but
who made the iphone who approved the
iphone battery case I still I still
don't get that like there were a group
of people in a room and they all were
like yeah this is great this is ok looks
great let's put it out sweet that's a
bad apple alright next call wait did I
answer his good guy ya know I did good
rant man I'm just saying hey guys this
is an from Philly um love the show I had
a quick question for you guys I want to
buy a mac i do not know which one to buy
I wanted to get your thoughts on it I'm
not a heavy gamer I'm not doing any type
of editing or anything like that video
editing anything like that I just kind
of wanted a a mac for everyday use I do
have the iphone and a apple watch and
Apple TV so I'm in the ecosystem so I
want to get a mac I don't know which one
to get gangstar all right my man I think
that it sounds like you want a portable
and you don't want to desktop so that's
clear I don't how about this for my use
it's always going to come down to screen
size what you're comfortable with you're
doing multimedia screen sizes king that
will dictate it I'm not a fan of the
super slim macbook yet because I just
don't think it's powerful enough it's
actually kind of slow so maybe it's a 13
inch mac a new macbook pro that they end
up coming out with that fits you or you
can get the current macbook retinas when
they get low in price because
not do anything high-power these guys
have more than enough power press retina
retinas been really good for me Brenda
Zardo vast only thing I like is the body
yeah it's like a little chunky nose like
sharp yeah yeah the edges the sharp
edges yeah but it's fast it works in the
screen looks amazing yeah obviously so I
you know maybe just tweet me and we
could get into it more because it
whenever someone asked me what computer
should buy i do want to know what you do
but it even goes beyond that you know it
always go there's way more like achoice
is there's way more to it than that and
mate you know maybe it's maybe your type
person I could just do an ipad pro even
shoot i don't know ipad pro those i like
a crow I like a small screen personally
like these these pcs right in front of
me yeah I dig these medium you dig him
good size all right next call all right
next call hi my name is Helen and I'm
calling from New York City love your
shows so I'm a big fan of a small size
smartphone I know it's not a train going
on nowadays that's why I was very
thrilled when the Apple made iphone SE
currently I have the phone and I love it
awesome battery life and it does
everything that I need to do with the
phone do you think apple will continue
making 4 inch smartphone thank you I
think it's not going away anytime soon
it's actually a big moneymaker for them
yeah they couldn't even keep it in stock
first molt at least I think two or three
months their their inventory was low on
it so my niece uses the 5-inch than
iphone SE and it's more it's more than
capable for her yeah I mean it's like
just holding in your hand you could tell
a big difference it's much easier like
I'm still complained about my success I
know I talked about going to the se but
I'm just too lazy to like go through
that trouble to do it you know but uh
wait why don't you like your 6s cuz it's
just too big yeah it's too big baby you
know it's like after I've gotten used to
it though I've gotten like more
comfortable i have balancing it when i
push buns will and walk I've heard that
a few times with my iPhone yes with my
iPhone okay lasted hi this is Martin
from Raleigh North Carolina calling
and uh this is a question for both
Stephan and Brian both of you tube but I
would like you two to answer
individually and with your own opinions
so in your opinion what was the best
Apple promo or advertisement video that
has ever been publicly available um for
example you can pick from the 1984 uh
commercial or from the iphone 4 promo
video but would love to know your
thoughts love the show thanks bye ok
this is I thought this is a fun question
so it's the best Apple TV ad or promo
that you can remember or ad campaign if
you're watching and you can chime in
with yours there's plenty I think no
matter what right the Super Bowl 1984 @
is the as always even been rated as the
most iconic television commercial of all
time yeah it kind of looks like today
like what's happening right now you mean
Howard is my present slaves do computers
yeah everyone's just staring at us I
mean I've seen I've seen that glazed
look on people's faces before yeah but
the night so let's get this out of the
way the 1984 commercial is the best one
but I think there were several memorable
ones unfortunately Apple hasn't done a
memorable commercial in at least four or
five years and I'll talk to you and
we'll talk about why Beachum what was
some of your favorite ones or which ones
the campaign that sticks out in your
mind oh yeah when I was thinking about
it and I did like a little search on
youtube and I found the the uh these
guys I'm a Mac I'm a PC yeah just all
right that was a great Hodgman and these
are these are brilliant because great
they really like pointed out problems
with the pc and things that Mac would
help out with what what exactly do you
mean by better by better I mean making
website or photo book is easy for me and
for you it's not oh oh that kind of
better guess what they're talking about
right there the timeout I life and
everyone asks about I life because they
did photos and movies look here's
another I life person yeah it's just
little something to hold my slow jams
yeah yeah and work so seamlessly with I
sorry so uh the get a mac campaign where
they personified the mac of the PC
platforms was a good one I also adds
that stuck out in my mind I remember and
it was kind of playing off on the well
there's a few actually okay let's talk
about they did when they had the UH
macbook pro a set 17 inch screen it was
the the kind of this super big mac book
pro and it was a yao ming and verne
troyer mmm it was a I can't see I can't
even it was the macbook pro um hi can t
remember what it was called a 12 inch
screen I can see this things happen so
fast here it was Yao Ming and Verne
Troyer is this it yeah yes
a lot of non talking between them right
now it's a silent movie presenting the
new 12 inch powerbook the world's most
empowerment full-featured notebook
computer and the new 17 empower the
world's first and only 17 inch notebook
computer there you go cool the power
books that was fun they did they also
had the first very first macbook air
where Steve Jobs he took it out of an
envelope but the TV ad actually showed
it in an envelope I thought that was
actually kind of crazy oh yeah yeah but
look also I mean you can't talk about
Apple ads without time out their iconic
like iTunes colored silhouettes on music
type stuff yeah like also just the music
in the in the most recent like iPhone
videos or commercials you know like the
music is iconic to like whenever I hear
that kind of music I'm like oh that
sounds like an apple add you know it's
like yeah very specific I will say
though that Apple ads in general just
have tanked off because they used to use
a giant day which was the advertising
firm too and they worked closely with
Steve Jobs to come up with some these
really cool campaigns but they don't use
them anymore and that's why you see like
the ads are kind of more like an
experiential like okay I get it like you
know the time be like all hips are cool
my god this like I things out like a
I've seen the side of the pillow
yourself you've seen this out of Billy
times like boring it's not creative like
quite honestly I haven't seen a creative
ad from Apple in at least three or four
years they even did an ad where they had
like I believe and they got pulled
immediately it was like it was someone
from like the genius bar and he's
running like an apple retail shirt uh it
was short lived because they were so
horrendous it was just that bad I'm
trying to search I can't I don't even
know if they exist Apple Genius ads
maybe yeah I don't know I I don't even
know like this it yes yeah it was like
oh this is such duty what do you what do
you mean basically basically it looks
like a Mac great it came loaded with all
the great apps like iphoto I'm
movie garageband not ringing a bell huh
no we sold this to you he did said he's
basically an apple genius no so this is
nothing like a Mac basically not not no
no no yeah terrible worst effin bad ever
awful that's the type of crap that we
got now like dude he's trying to get
that Justin Long energy that is no this
quite manage its this is it's just
garbage or so anyways Apple adds you
need to step your game up but I don't I
don't see it because there's no one that
like is so emotionally tied to it the
way that SJ was in chat day was honestly
is one of the great advertising firms of
all time so yeah so they were there any
other ones up before we before and I can
really think of I mean we've pretty much
covered some of the best ones I'm trying
I did actually think there was the very
first ipod ad and the only reason I
liked it is because at the time it's a
guy like dancing around kind of in his
apartment and they show how he sinks his
music at the time no one really knew
what an ipad was I ipod was no one knew
what like an mp3 player could really do
and in a quick way it um it just showed
off what it could do is the very first
ipod edits we're gonna find it see if
you can it's like the guys kind of like
it's like a grey looking apartment like
it's not i found it this is it
it's kind of everyone in the country
this is bumpin bumpin to music he's like
syncing up his itunes dragging it over
to his ipod it's comping it over and i
own that ipod still today and it works
he's just dancing now everyone who knows
this well people that okay yeah he's
just dancing way too much but again you
have to remember these are ads from
that's like like ten two thousand don't
even know how 1000 2000 those 2001 yeah
man that ipod thing was a game changer
for me oh it was awesome so anyways boys
and girls there you go just a little
nostalgia to look back at some of those
ads i was a great question because I
kind of just set that up for us it was
fun yeah it was really fun okay um you
know what if you guys want to continue
to be a part of this show again all you
have to do is just call us and leave
your name where you're from your message
