Jobs calls it quits as CEO of Apple and
we take a look at his historic career
Plus how to keep your keyboard squeaky
clean and lighten your load with the
help of a smartphone it's all coming up
right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our own unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line actually we're going to switch
things up a bit this week and start with
the bad it's bad news for Apple fans and
employees alike as Steve Jobs has
announced that he's stepping down from
his position as CEO although jobs is
handing the reins over to Apple CEO Tim
Cook he does intend to stay on as
chairman of the board now many are left
speculating what this means for the
future of the company but let's take a
look back at the impact Jobs has had
during his career thus far we're going
to make some history together today
Steve Jobs has made history many times
and he's changed the way we communicate
and are entertained his vision will
continue to define our digital lives for
many years to come and the story of his
life in technology has played out in
three acts act one it's 1977 jobs and
Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak
introduced the Apple to the first
successful personal computer but 1984
brought a much bigger milestone the
first personal computer that was really
personal today for the first time ever
I'd like to let Macintosh speak for
itself hello I'm Macintosh it sure is
great to get out of that bag with a
graphical interface mouse creative
software and whimsical design it was a
completely different animal from the
sterile machines coming from Microsoft
and Intel just as different was the TD
commercial that announced the mac one
they still talk about in the ad business
today and which showed jobs new
technology sells better with a little
hike
but none of that would be enough to hold
back the juggernaut of Intel and
Microsoft and the difficulties Apple
faced in growing the mac business led to
jobs being shown the door at his own
company in 1985 I was basically fired
from Apple when I was 30 that was
difficult when it happened but maybe the
best thing that ever happened to me act
2 shortly after jobs ouster he founds
next to produce a new kind of advanced
workstation computer that runs on an
object-oriented software architecture
which would become the basis of a
dramatically new and better mac OS years
later similarly telling was the design
of the next machine stylish austere and
breakin convention sound familiar in
1986 jobs also acquired the graphic arts
division of Lucasfilm turning it in to
picsart the studio that mainstreamed
animated features and can boast that its
films deliver the highest average gross
revenue of any studio in the film
industry but in classic form act 3 with
jobs biggest he retook the helm of a
nearly bankrupt Apple and introduced the
imac the following year with what was
the first of what we now call a Steve
note imac comes from the marriage of the
excitement of the internet with the
simplicity of Macintosh it was the first
personal computer designed around the
internet what Bill Gates and Microsoft
Word of the PC era Jobs was about to
become to the internet and eventually
mobile area
we got a lot of incredible stuff to show
you today his presentation skills at
events such as Mac world would become
legendary examples of showmanship and
star power in industry it's really
beautiful this is what it looks
detractors would derive jobs hype as a
reality distortion field but the imac
worked an apple began to turn around but
jobs single biggest course change for
Apple was not a computer but the ipod
what is ipod but i haven't had one right
here my pocket in effect there it is
right there introduced in october two
thousand one it was small in size
spacious and capacity and looked good
but more importantly it diversified
Apple away from head-on competition with
the wind tail computer makers while
luring away their customers when iTunes
launched windows support in October of 0
3 i'm here to report to you today that
this has happened apple began to rewrite
the music business become a major media
player and got its first taste of market
dominance but in terms of financial
success nothing tops the apple product
that was built on the shoulders of the
ipod today Apple is going to reinvent
the phone and we are calling it iPhone
but jobs and apples showed an uncanny
ability to once again get the formula
right appear the originator and make a
piece of advanced technology seems
simple magical and fashionable with that
same DNA the iPad arrived in april 2010
we like to show it to you today for the
first time and we call it the ipad and
again legitimize the category that other
companies had only nibbled at the edges
of four years it's so much more intimate
than a laptop and it's so much more
capable than a smartphone Apple has had
its share of flops but they mostly pale
compared to its Hicks and there were
always notes of hubris around the latter
day company seen most in jobs almost
dismissing documented problems with the
iphone 4s antenna we think it's
affecting with small percentage of users
and we think some of that problem is
inherent in most every smartphone but
mostly Apple since jobs return has been
a culture changer as much as a
technology company one of the biggest
success stories in American business and
virtually indivisible from the identity
of its CEO
what more could I say the man's company
personality and vision changed the world
twice over this is the end of an era and
we now resume our regular programming
and take a look at the good if there's
anything we learned since the iphone
came out it's that there's very little a
smartphone can't do it lets you leave
many of your other gadgets at home in
fact here's Brian Cooley with the top
five items that for many people have
been replaced by smartphones
don't you pity that poor Luddite I'm
sure you know who's still carrying
around some dumb flip phone telling you
I don't need a smartphone I just want to
make calls dumbass okay that's a little
harsh but smartphones aren't really even
about being phones anymore I'm Brian
Cooley with the top five things the
smartphone replaces not even including
your home phone line based on a survey
done in june twenty eleven by prosper
mobile insights see how many of these
ring a bell with you number five is the
mp3 player thirty-seven percent of us
don't use one of those once we get a
smartphone you see simple phones were
generally crap or non-functional as
ipods but smartphones are usually at
least okay with their big color screens
touch interfaces plenty of and often
expandable storage oh and they are
connected so they can stream stuff like
Pandora and Spotify and last.fm now you
may find a smartphone a little too bulky
or delicate to sweat all over as your
gym music device but aside from that you
can see why the ipod is rapidly becoming
quaint tank number four is the personal
planner 41.6 percent of us oh thank you
smartphone for jamming a stake in the
heart of those horrible old franklin
covey day planners with their bad
pleather jackets that match your bad
tassel loafers of course syncing
calendars across various web services to
various smartphones can give you a
stress-related disease but at least you
won't die clutching a daybook number
three is the digital point and shoot
camera about forty four percent of us
said goodbye I don't recall the last
time i use my point-and-shoot digital
not even sure where it is to be honest
for many people there just is no longer
a gap between the smartphone on one end
of photography and the DSLR on the
high-end smartphones now take high-res
photos off an HD video they share the
stuff because they're connected they can
gps stamp things all in one little
stealthy device that doesn't say I'm a
tourist oh by the way if you want a
great camera phone check out my other
recent top 5 best camera phones at top 5
cnet com okay the number two thing the
smartphone kills is the GPS portable
navigation device
two percent of us don't use those once
we get a smartphone now there's decent
to excellent turn-by-turn nav in all the
recent smartphones that have come out a
lot of folks will object and they'll say
yeah too many compromises the screen
size is a little too small the power
usage means I might not be able to make
a call multitasking can be kind of
clumsy but you know most of us don't use
and have that often once in a while like
I bet you know how to get to work and
back so gps nav that is good enough is
good enough before I take you to the
number one thing the smartphone is
putting out of business can you guess
what it is here are some other things
that has knocked off from a little
further down the list including a
disturbing 124 percent of us say we got
rid of our computer because we got a
smartphone let's not go overboard here
okay the number one thing people say
their smartphone put in the box to sell
on eBay is their alarm clock right I
don't even know how to set my alarm
clock anymore your phone is your
appointment travel to do and home alarm
device why would you have a separate one
on the nightstand that does nothing but
just wake you up for more top 5s like
this go to top 5 cnet com I'm Brian
Cooley thanks for watching
okay but if that is the case how come my
purse hasn't gotten any lighter now
Brian had some harsh words for folks who
prefer a simpler phone just for making
calls but for some people smart phones
may do too much maybe grandma just needs
a phone with big buttons it's easy to
use maybe you don't want to shatter that
glass touchscreen when you're at the gym
well luckily Nicole and Donald have not
forgotten about you I'm Nicole a senior
associate editor for cnet.com and this
is a first look at the pantech breeze 3
the breeze 3 is essentially a basic flip
phone for AT&amp;amp;T Wireless on the front is
a simple external display that displays
the usual date time and caller ID
information underneath the external
display are three LED notifications for
incoming messages and so forth on the
side here is the volume rocker on the
other side is the micro USB port and on
the back is the 1.3 megapixel camera
flip the phone open and you will find it
very colorful display underneath the
display you get three quick keys that
can be used for speed dial or shortcut
keys if you get the usual navigation
array that includes shortcuts to the
camera function as well as voice command
the overall keep addicts you can see
here is quite spacious each key is quite
large and a little bit raised above the
surface so it's easy to text and dial by
feel the breeze 3 has two different
phone menu modes one is the breeze or
easy mode and the other is advanced mode
for servier users the breeze mode as you
can see here is pretty simple all of the
menu options are displayed in a list
style form factor the advanced mode
opens up the phones full list of
functions as well as displaying things
in a more grit like fashion additions to
the breeze three from the breeze too is
that it also has a new pill reminder
application the breeze 3 is perfect for
senior citizens kids are just cellphone
novices in general the pantech breeze 3
is quite affordable at only around forty
dollars
your two-year service agreement with
AT&amp;amp;T I'm Nichola this has been the first
look at the pantech breeze 3 hey I'm
Donald Bell today we're taking a first
look at the sansa clip zip this is a
super compact super affordable mp3
player from sandisk that's available in
seven different colors and two
capacities there's a 4 gigabyte version
that will set you back just forty nine
dollars on a gigabyte model run $69 now
the basic design of the sansa clip
hasn't changed a whole lot since the
clip plus we saw last year you navigate
using the direction pad up front there's
headphone jack at a micro SD card slot
here on the side a power button up on
the top and a volume control and USB
port over here of course the main appeal
here is the clip on the back which makes
it perfect for working out the
construction is all plastic but so is
just about everything else in this price
range as far as features go you get
music playback FM radio audio book and
podcast support voice recording and a
basic stop watch the clip zip is both
Mac and PC compatible works with mp3 AAC
WMA flack and even subscription music
services like rhapsody battery life is
rated at about 15 hours all-in-all is an
easy mp3 player to recommend it's one of
the best values you'll find under fifty
dollars and arguably one of the best
under a hundred dollars it's not as Tiny
as Apple's nano or shuffle but it's not
as likely to get lost or run through the
laundry either so that's the sansa clip
zip the perfect practically disposable
mp3 player for the gym well there's
times where you just don't want to put
your smartphone in harm's way for
cnet.com i'm donald though see there's
something to be said for simple products
that do one job really well i mean i
wouldn't buy them but if you like that
sort of thing go crazy alarm clocks may
be on their way out but one problem with
using your smartphone to wake you up is
that it's only on your nightstand when
you're not using it what if you want to
know what time it is without digging in
your pocket or better yet the weather
forecast well all you ipad owners have
another clock replacement option
as you'll see in this week's tap that up
welcome to tap that app i'm jason parker
and this is a show recovered the hottest
apps in the mobile space those who own
ipads know that apple's tablet is great
for quick access to the internet and
email and offers tons of apps and games
to make it even more useful but what
about the times when you're not actively
using your ipad this week we're showing
off a handy app that's perfect for when
your ipad is charging and propped up in
the stand either at home or at the
office it's called night stand for ipad
and its main function is to show you
time date and weather information and
you can set alarms to use it as your
primary alarm clock but there is plenty
more here to make nightstand worth your
money the app displays the time date and
weather info in an easy-to-read farm you
can adjust the clock to display in
either black or white and smaller large
sizes and you can choose which side of
the screen you want the clock to display
on but what makes this app more
interesting is that you can display
calming videos as your desktop
background and view info from popular
social sites tabs across the bottom of
the screen include Twitter Facebook RSS
and weather touch the Twitter tab to
sign into your account and from there
you'll see all the latest tweets from
people you follow in a window at the
bottom you can swipe horizontally to see
earlier tweets the same is true for
facebook just sign in and authorize and
you'll be able to view the latest
statuses for your friends and family if
you have something to say you can touch
a button on the left to bring up a
window to post a new tweet or facebook
status with the RSS tab you can display
the latest feeds from your google reader
account if a particular headline catches
your interest you can tap the headline
and read the full story in a browser
window perhaps the most useful feature
as you wake up in the morning the daily
weather is shown under the weather tab
giving you a forecast for the next few
days just like the other windows you can
swipe to see more info in this case
you'll see an extended forecast aside
from all the info you can quickly get
with only a few taps on your iPad screen
night stand for ipad has some cool
aesthetic options that make it more than
just a bland looking clock you have the
option to show
slideshows of images using provided
shots or images from your library and
they have that slow zoom Ken Burns
effect but you also can show animated
movies as backgrounds you get a few demo
movies to see what the animations are
like but you can buy movie packs of 10
movies for 99 cents or spend a dollar
ninety-nine for all four offered movie
packs whether you are using images or
movies as your background you can
quickly change what you see by hitting
the Settings button then adding and
subtracting movies and images from your
slideshow when you're satisfied with
your choices just hit start slideshow a
nice interface feature here is that you
can adjust the brightness for both the
clock and your slideshow by touching and
dragging on screen great for we want to
tone it down at bedtime over all night
stand for ipad is a neat app to have
when your ipad sits charging it's great
for setting alarms but it's especially
cool for getting quick updates from your
favorite social sites with all these
features for 199 at the iTunes App Store
it's easy to recommend anyone to tap
this app that's it for this week's show
if you have any suggestion send them to
tap that app at cnet com i'm jason
parker and we'll see you next time might
I suggest turning off pace time before
you go to bed or don't that's totally up
to you alright it's time to take a break
but stick around we have a lot more tech
review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good our latest
cnet editors choice product is a
keyboard and it's a clickety clackety
keyboard this is not the 80s people are
still doing it check it out hi I'm
Justin you associate editor for cnet.com
this is your first look at the deck 82
mechanical keyboard but first a quick
history lesson the mechanical keyboard
trend is growing thanks to companies
like deck and Das Keyboard producing
their own unique takes on the original
IBM model m keyboard so that one's the
really old clicky keyboard that used to
come with IBM desktop machines so
anyways some people seem to prefer the
click-clack nature of these peripherals
so the new mechanical keyboards we've
been seeing lately like the deck 82 are
modified with mechanical key switches
underneath that atom or tactile typing
feeling then you would with normal
scissors which style keys you get on
current laptops so what makes this one
so great that we awarded it an editor's
choice well first the deck 82 is so
named because it has only 82 keys they
achieved this by removing the number pad
that normally goes on the right hand
side and that also means that a lot of
the secondary functions like num lock
page down home etc those all get
relocated different places on the board
that takes a little time getting used to
it but the compact layout definitely
saved space on your desk and lets you
get your mouse a little closer to your
typing hands second the deck 82 has
ultra-bright backlit LEDs under each of
the key caps that illuminate the
keyboard in darkness in fact the bulbs
are so bright that they also look pretty
cool in broad daylight as well and deck
tells us that each LED will last at
least 200,000 hours or 22 years if you
never turn it off actually the whole
keyboard is very tough to match as well
the bottom has a bolted in steel plate
that makes sure it stays put while
you're typing and the chairs black MX
mechanical switches underneath are rated
at 50 million key presses so what does
it like to type on a mechanical keyboard
well to answer that you need to know
about the different kinds of mechanical
switches available
so most of them use switches by brand
called cherry who in turn uses color
coding to differentiate between
different types of key switches the most
commonly used and loudest are the cherry
blue switches but this one actually has
cherry black switches that are not quite
as loud and they feel a little bit more
pillowy rather than clack e because of
the longer distance you need to push
down on them to engage the letter 60
grams to be exact the keys themselves
are indented at the top to make it feel
like they're molded to your fingers and
the whole experience with the lights and
translucent chassis it makes it feel
like you're typing on a keyboard from
hackers so deck also keeps the door open
to modifications on it's 82 series
keyboard and encourages users to post
their hacks on the deck message board
online and you can buy replacement
colored chassé ease if you don't like
the blue one deck also covers mods on
its one-year warranty which is perfect
for users that like to tinker with their
gear you can read all the details on our
full review on cnet com but that's going
to do it for me I'm Justin you and you
just took a first look at the editors
choice winning deck 82 mechanical
illuminated keyboard thanks for watching
okay if you're gonna spend money on a
fancy keyboard like that you're going to
want to take care of it you're sharing
back in with some tips for keeping your
keyboard tidy most of us spend hours a
day to our desks eating sneezing and
coughing over our keyboards and even if
you're really good about washing your
hands before typing away there's
definitely bacteria on your keys I'm
Sharon backing for cnet.com with a quick
tip on cleaning and disinfecting your
keyboard
first unplug your keyboard or remove
batteries if it's wireless then flip it
upside down and give it a few good
shakes over a garbage can to get any
crumbs or dirt out from under the keys
now grab a can of compressed air to
really remove any other dust or crumbs
from in between the keys and if you have
a mini vacuum now is the time to use
that too if there is still grime stuck
in between the keys dip a q-tip in some
rubbing alcohol and remove the dirt key
by key which might take a while if it's
really dirty now once all the dirt is
free grab it ass infected wife and wring
out all the excess liquid then wipe the
keyboard down including the palm rest to
disinfect the keyboard when you're done
immediately wipe it down with a damp
microfiber cloth and then dry it off
with a dry microfiber cloth disinfect
your keyboard every day and try to do
this whole routine once a week and set
an alarm to remind yourself if you need
to for more tips visit how to Cena calm
and send your questions on Twitter at
cnet how to for a seen it I'm Sharon
Vaknin and i'll see you on the interwebs
just looking around our office here
there are some really gross keyboards
around like mine also don't forget your
mouse sharon has another video
explaining how to clean those two but
I'll give you a little tip you basically
do it the same way all right since we've
already got the bat out of the way it's
time to jump right in to the bottom line
there's no getting around the fact that
Steve Jobs stepping down was the biggest
tech news in the world this week but
rather than pontificating about his
place in history any further let's let
the man speak for himself courtesy of
our friends at ZDNet it's really
beautiful this is what it looks this is
made incredibly durably this is
polycarbonate plastic the stuff they
make bulletproof vests out of but we'd
gone one step further we've double shot
it in rubber all the way around so what
you see in orange is all rubber it feels
wonderful and it makes the unit even
safer to travel with again all on the
back when you open it up it's really
beautiful inside and the imax got a
fantastic 15 inch display but today we
are introducing a model with a 17 inch
landscape display let's go ahead and
take a look at it we are opening 25
Apple own retail stores across the u.s.
this calendar year in 2001 25 and the
first two stores will open this saturday
here at tysons corner in McLean Virginia
and at glendale mall in Glendale
California across the other side of the
country why these two because they were
the first two that we're ready there's
nothing magic about it you can trust
that we know Mac os10 is not perfect we
think it's a tremendous start and we
think already in many instances we are
way above anything else on the market in
terms of certain aspects of performance
in terms of certain features but we're
not stopping there and we are
continuously going to improve this
so that is the best in the world in
every respect and your criticisms and
feedbacks helped us a lot so keep them
coming we are listening today we are
announcing that the second-generation
itunes doesn't just run on the mac but
it runs on windows to exactly the same
thing on mac and on windows not
this is not some baby version of itunes
or the music store it's the whole thing
itunes for windows is probably the best
windows app everywhere there is one more
thing it's one more small
when we were inventing all of the
technology to build this tremendous
technology to be able to do this its way
far ahead of what anyone in the industry
is capable of doing we decided to apply
that technology to something a little
smaller which is this yeah let's see you
again a new 12 inch powerbook it's the
world's thinnest notebook it's so thin
it even fits inside one of these
envelopes that we've all seen floating
around the office and so let me go ahead
and show it to you now
this is that
let me take it out here this is the new
macbook air and you can get a feel for
how thin it is yeah there it is now stop
me if you've already seen this
believe me you ain't seen it you've got
to see this thing in person it is one of
the most beautiful designs you've ever
seen this is beyond the doubt the most
precise thing one of the most beautiful
things we've ever made glass on the
front and rear and stainless steel
running around and the precision of
which this is made is is beyond any
consumer product we've ever seen it's
closest kin is like a beautiful old
leica camera and we'd like to show it to
you today for the first time and we call
it the iPad and again to see the whole
webpage is phenomenal right there
holding the internet in your hands it's
an incredible experience keeping these
devices in sync is driving us crazy and
we call it iCloud the bottom line this
week thanks for everything Steve you may
be stepping out of the spotlight for now
but I look forward to more one more
thing moments down the road and that's
our show for this week come on back next
time for an all-new cnet tech review
until then there are tons of great
videos available every day at cnet TV
com see you next time and thank you for
