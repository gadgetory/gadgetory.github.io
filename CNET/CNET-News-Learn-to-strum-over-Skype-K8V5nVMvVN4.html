music to Jeff Feldman's ears it
signifies his guitar lesson is about to
begin hey Lance I'm doing good how are
you doing already an accomplished guitar
player an instructor san francisco-based
Feldman wanted to learn the finger style
of playing when that Nashville Tennessee
based Lance Allen has perfected
so after lending an ear to Alan's
collection of YouTube videos the two
have connected over Skype for lessons so
thumb from first right technology is so
good right now that just with my
built-in camera and microphone from my
computer I can see exactly what his
hands are doing and he can see what I'm
doing roughly half of Alan's 50 guitar
students take lessons over Skype he
charges them a hundred and twenty
dollars for for Skype lessons twenty
bucks more than in person lessons but he
says that extra fee is for additional
materials others it and then what I do
for my skype lessons in all my skype
students is I after our lesson I'll do a
video recap of the lesson and I'll put
it in a Dropbox and for students taking
a lesson over the computer allows you to
record the conversation for additional
help at a later time that is something
that is an extra value that you don't
get in in normal guitar lessons without
having you know a camera set up and
everything which nobody does with
everyone singing the praises of this
high-tech teaching method I decided to
give it a try
ah although advanced players complain
that remote lessons make it hard to jam
together I saw the benefits they're easy
convenient and still of high quality yes
it's pretty good just don't expect to
see me strumming my uke on a beach at
sunset anytime soon and San Francisco on
cars Tsuboi cnet.com for CBS News gosht</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
