hallways new phone it's the p9 it's the
latest flagship it's got two cameras on
the back and the what about this phone
exciting you anything we mentioned it
straight off these two cameras and next
to these two cameras you'll see the
likening a licker is one of the best
names in cameras so for me alone there's
just an assurance of quality there and
that's is really exciting
it's got the two lenses of is there to
to bring in a lot more light so this
phone could be really good at taking
photos when it's a bit dark and be one
of those dingy bars that I know you and
I both like to frequent sure okay and I
mean do you think it's a little bit
risky though selling your phone on the
promise of photography just because
there are a lot of other companies to do
that companies like HTC or Sony in
particular I know there are a lot of
companies that say our phone has the
best imaging and often they don't always
deliver it is high risk we're certainly
the bar has already been set very very
high we've got some amazing camera
phones but at least they're doing
something a bit different they're
talking a lot about how one of these
lenses is really really good for
black-and-white photography so so
there's a virus there's a bit of a bit
of excitement there by doing something
but it's just slightly different from
what we've already seen we'll be fair to
say that apart from the the camera tech
which seems pretty interesting and
pretty cool but apart from that there's
nothing especially groundbreaking about
this Android phone is that big powerful
exactly yeah it's kind of what you'd
expect from a high-end phone it's got
plenty of power feels nice the whole
there's kind of big bright screens of
that's what you'd want from a good
smartphone really well those are our
first impressions of the p9 but let us
know what you think stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
