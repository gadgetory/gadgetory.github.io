Alfred rang the big story this week
potentially this year is Facebook CEO
Mark Zuckerberg finally appearing before
Congress to answer questions about how
it handles consumer data Zack is already
a minute that Facebook has overlooked
the potential consequences that come
from its mission to connect the world
but will this makeup would be enough
yeah so I don't think he's gonna give
any substantial answers for this I mean
it is interesting that he's doing two
panel not to the Senate and the house
yeah two days but if it's anything like
the ones in November I really don't
think any substantial is coming out of
this the ones in November you know they
with the General Counsel's of Facebook
Twitter and it was Google's yes that
general counsel right someone else knows
it okay so obviously they're a bit more
polished Zuckerberg is not known for
being a polished speaker how do you
think this is gonna go with all these
grandstanding senators and
representatives do you think he's gonna
wear a suit I think he's gonna be very
nice cover suit in order suit before
yeah I just think it'll be very
interesting to see him there I don't
know who else is speaking with him or if
it's just him I know for the Senate
hearing the Judiciary Committee they had
invited Jack Dorsey from Twitter right
and sundar Pichai from Google and I
don't think they're attending I haven't
heard any confirmation from them it's
just gonna be him and it's just gonna be
all these uh senators and these go on
for a few hours yeah and he's not he's
never really spoken out the public for
that long in a uncontrolled environment
right it's always been at they're at a
conference or very short meeting
interviews so it'll be interesting to
see what happens yeah I think he's been
prepping for it for the last few weeks
so you can kind of see with all the
Facebook post that he's been making and
all the changes that Facebook has been
announcing in the in their effort to be
more transparent they announced one
today with the election committee which
is a little bit different than what was
going on you know with the Cambridge
analytical scandal but it all kind of
plays into each other alright so YouTube
speaking of data YouTube is in hot water
over how it deals with kids watching
this videos a group of 20 Child Advocacy
privacy and consumer groups have asked
the FTC to investigate whether it
violates a law that regulates how
companies can collect data on kids
now YouTube argues a service is a name
for kids yeah they're keen and over
and there is a YouTube kids option but a
vast majority of people including myself
still watch alright so have their kids
watch YouTube it's a younger meant a lot
of you know websites have this whole
thing where it's like oh you have to be
13 or over to use this website Facebook
is one of them YouTube is one of them
I think the advocacy group is making the
argument that this doesn't really
protect on anybody and this is kind of
like you're still collecting data on
kids even though you have this policy
that says you know you can't be 13 or
you can't be under 13 or not it's clear
that there are people under 13 using
this so there should be more of an
investigation into this I mean I will
tell you yeah my kid sits in front of
YouTube for at most like 3040 minutes a
day and it's a lifesaver because that's
the only time I can get stuff done and
so yeah and i don't i don't use youtube
kids i just use regular old youtube
that's like yeah it's about the same
thing it's just there's what is it like
less restrictions yes so right now
alright lastly say hello to the new red
iphone just like the iPhone 7 got the
red treatment last year the iPhone 8 and
the iPhone 8 plus a part of the product
red program which obviously still the
profits go to the global fund charitable
organization that funds programs to
combat HIV and AIDS in sub-saharan
Africa so obviously a good cause I
always wondered about how many people
actually bought these things I've never
really seen a red iPhone in the wild
that wasn't like a review unit you know
what would have been great and probably
gotten more sales than the red iPhone
they made like red ear pods people would
mine right here mods those white those
like I'm really tired of seeing them all
the time anyway that is smart you're
gonna have that idea for free yeah you
can't cover ear pods with yeah case yeah
exactly the thing with the iPhone you
can't you just cover it up with a case
should've had red air pods this is a
genius idea
all right well if Apple comes up with
one we know it's Alfred
so alright for those stories check us
out at CNN I'm Roger Cheng I'm alpha
ring thanks for listening
I'm not on my game today running sound
line I was running late and I sprinted
in here and I'm just way off my base and
do I'm doing my best guys I'm doing my
best
I love that the outro loop has outro mp4
on it I don't know if our viewers saw
that how do you how do you know what
file I'm running anyways as always it's
time for me to jump into the chat and
open the conversation to you guys out
there in YouTube land so we can keep the
conversation going and right out the
gate from CPR tech Dylan I just saw the
iPhone 8 product read as online and I
was frothing at the mouth anybody else
here excited about the the product
launch no nope I mean looky-look iPhone
7 in red it looked awesome look
fantastic when we came out when it came
in last year I just I don't think I'd
buy I mean most folks who have an iPhone
I guess it's a good option for you now
if you're looking to buy a new iPhone
but I don't know like I see a lot of
those in the wild I also just don't feel
like I care a lot about phone colors
like ever
usually when a company starts
introducing new colors and this is
admittedly a different situation but
when they're new colors it's like
usually because they've run out of ideas
mhm so yeah for me colors is always been
traditionally a sign that like you're
starting to it should have had just a
notch be red that would be super
controversial I would love to have this
discussion about why that would be why
they should have a red notch I think
that like a sound effect on this show
for like a zinger hmm I got to work on
it add it to the repertoire comment from
Sur enjoy as always on key this looks
like a children's book series after
naughty famous five-seater 7 Tintin and
now we have The Adventures of Mark
Zuckerberg I don't want my kids to know
that story
it's basically Charlie Brown kind of
like the sad sack yeah yeah mixed with
like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep
sure never watch that come on I mean
it's definitely not Suzie and in nature
it's a little
I mean how do you rhyme with a Russian
troll true true gets into some really
dark material there so just back on the
iPhone red I mean we're not gonna see
new features out of this the chair thing
is always nice actually remember when I
was in high school and the one of the
first few of the iPod shuffles came out
I remember getting ready for that yeah
yeah I felt like I helped you know that
was cool then and a look to new then now
it's just like part of it is because the
eight also doesn't look that different
from the seven I'm actually yes
I'm a little surprised they didn't try
to pull this off with the iPhone town or
even like that their iPad unveil that
they had oh that's true yeah I know they
should have just busted out the red iPad
right there the pencil is red there you
go dangerous histories for teachers who
want to mark up their I like it I like
it
Danny Green's asking why there isn't an
iPad pro red good point I don't know I'm
kind of surprised at taking as long and
they haven't done a full red wash across
all I mean I do remember and it's been
noting that when the iPhone 7 came out
like I said there it took them a while
to figure out how to get rent into their
phones so granted last year they were
using a metal back this year this glass
was a little bit easier true but yeah
that's sure they had they she they
should have read across the entire
product line should be an option but
it's not makes a new watch red with a
new Apple watch that like you know how
like the button on stairs for the red
things yeah you if it's like you can
make calls on it to make the whole thing
red do people want a red watch no no not
at all that was about here like the Red
Power Ranger than no let's talk about
Facebook somewhere because we have to
Mike Shawn nothing will change
concerning Facebook unless Congress
passes some privacy laws and I'm not
holding my breath has there been any
conversations up on the hill about
actual legal action to be taken
well yeah so there is the honest ads act
which Facebook is sort of sort of
endorsed at this point I think they feel
like they're they're being pressured to
I think what what's gonna happen here
like the big the big stakes here is you
know depending on how Zuckerberg
performs or what Zuckerberg says before
Congress
that can have some influences to whether
or not Congress might look to regulate
not just Facebook but all tech companies
more closely Europe has already passed a
more stricter privacy law that that
companies have to observe but that
doesn't translate to here in in America
so it'll be interesting to see what the
aftermath is of this of his testimony
because it could lead to stricter
regulations yeah so actually some
breaking news that just happened while
we were talking about this Mark
Zuckerberg has released his opening
statement or not in Zuckerberg but at
least the House of Reps committee
they've released their opening statement
Zuckerberg the opening statement to
Congress he breaks it up in a few
sections first he's talking about
Cambridge analytical and what happened
what they're doing about it okay and
then second Russian election
interference again what happened and
what they're doing about it and let's
see are there any other points I'm just
scrolling through this right now that's
it
Russia and came regeneration see yeah
yeah and his conclusion starts off with
the line well let's the last lines are I
realize the issues we're talking about
today aren't just issues from Facebook
in our community the challenges for all
of us as Americans thank you for having
me here today and I'm ready to take your
questions okay
so it will be interesting to see what
the questions are I think that's the big
that's where Zuckerberg might get
tripped up or that's where we might
actually get some answers or maybe his
luck just clams up and says I can't
comment or refuses to comment it'll be I
want to see what happens there with how
forthcoming years before Congress I
honestly hope for the former let's talk
about alternatives to Facebook Samuel s
is asking how do we get out of Facebook
at this point if you are interested
there are plenty of hashtag delete
Facebook proponents their community and
well beyond its you could leave Facebook
at any time it's not like anyone's
holding a gun to your head the song we
found talked about a great alternative
in the past so that's let's list off if
you need the argument though that
Facebook is like very integral to like a
lot of what people do i ID saw like a
Twitter account today I was something on
like the 11th it's supposed to be I got
facebook blackout day or something like
that where it's like yo everybody on
this day when Zuckerberg
testifying like deactivate or delete
your Facebook Instagram and whatsapp and
I'm like and then it's like for more
information check out our signup page on
facebook doc it's like an events page on
Facebook and I'm like really you're
organizing this delete face will come in
on face so make sense though where else
you know my point is about that that was
like it's so integral to like everything
that we do that it's like you can't use
tinder without a Facebook like it's
there's so many like aspects I didn't
realize that yeah cuz it literally I'm
gonna added tinder user I mean I
recently like just like abandoned ship
on my old Facebook account that had that
Facebook has all this data on me already
and I just made a new one that only I
was like 30 friends and I don't like
anything on it I uploaded one photo and
I like I put a fake birthday and all
this stuff and it all just cat photos no
it's one photo because I feel like that
I feel like even if it was cat photos
like they were oh this guy likes cats oh
recognition like so what was your one
photo it's like that photo I sent on my
resume would for me looking really angry
okay yeah yeah it should only upload
like abstract art and see let's have a
little experiment already start a fake
facebook account and only applaud
obscure abstract art that you create by
drawing in like paint and then I only
put coded messages in there that's a
invented language and an only post
jargon and see what Facebook I like it I
like it let's do it yeah cool experiment
all right we only got a few minutes left
let's fly through and just one more from
Matthew - er how much information does
Facebook get about us if we ever post if
we don't ever post and only ever use it
for messaging they still harvest data
that way yeah I mean it's I mean they
yeah they get bigger data on you
regardless of what you're doing I mean
you're probably better off than most
people that's the experiment that I'm
doing right now with my new account that
I like I don't post and I only use it
for messaging I'm under the impression
that they would still get a significant
amount of data on you because I you know
how you can download all your facebook
data sure so I'm waiting for a month
half they're like here's how much
information Facebook has on you in just
a month when you don't make any post or
anything so I think that like they'll
still make judgements on you based on
who you're friends with and what
or photos that you click on because
it'll be like oh this guy clicked on
this music video or something like even
if you like didn't like it or anything
if you just clicked on or interacted
with it I think they logged that as data
that's at least that's my theory I've
still got a few more days left to see
like what the data will be like once I
download it I'm curious to see what
happens if and when I download my
facebook data in order to head out the
door and if there's a little love note
from developer in this as well because
the first day that I downloaded my data
just like do like a comparison thing it
even told me like you sent a friend
request to like this person at this time
blah blah blah so I think they like log
like every interaction every single
thing alright we are unfortunately out
of time we have to cut it short today
because I screwed up and ran super late
anyways alright anyways VoIP that you
saw her here check us out on SEANET our
podcast is available on itunes tune in
stitcher feedburner google play music
and the amazon echo i will see you all
tomorrow
