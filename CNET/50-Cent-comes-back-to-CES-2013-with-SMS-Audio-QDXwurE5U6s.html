I don't know if I have to tell you this
is you you don't need a 50 cent here in
the house you're like a three year
veteran of CES now you've seen a lot of
things I just tell us how your CES has
been this time around so far has been
great you know when you actually get
here this year will accomplish so much
like a be launched in 46 countries I'm
anticipating successful jharia projects
I'm involved in I anticipated but not as
fast as it actually took place in I mean
I'm excited you see people come and get
a chance to look at the new products and
I get a chance to walk to see yes I
think it should be more popular though
like the general public a lot of people
here at work yeah yeah you know but I
walk it's like taking a look at the
future so you know I think 50 you
learned a lot about CS because I
remember your first year you launch the
line and then you kind of relaunch the
line right and now I mean when you look
at it you've seen a girl a lot how was
that was that frustrating for you or he
was just kind of a patient's thing for
you I mean it's a process and when you
starting up like a new company starting
up you went to you gonna pop your head a
couple times you gonna make some
mistakes and how you recover from it is
more exciting in the process of talking
about how you actually made the mistake
hey for me I mean the first year came
had a 3d rendering you know and by the
second year a quiet corner audio and
that there were a successful company and
had a staff of 20 people that allowed me
and my vision for SMS to come to pass so
which product you know you have a new
2013 line which one for you are you the
most excited about is it whoa yeah I'm
excited about all of them but they oh
they all have different you know
identities and different features that
you know the other ones don't actually
have so which one are you rocking the
most the most the street onia small as
compact so I tried one and it folds up
so I'll put it in mind to ban extra
muscles look even bigger when you got
the smaller have straps look like I've
been doing some work I got a month
alright alright that's cool so also at
CES have you been able to walk around
the show floor or see anything
haven't you know the night I got here I
walked around before it actually started
before it open because I like to know
see that you know what's happening at
even the products that are not actually
available did they look forward to
coming by the time we here next year
they'll be actually talking about how
they launched it in the second or third
quarter and you know that it's
interesting to see where we're going
next so we're gonna see one of those
$25,000 TVs on 50s wall anytime soon are
you talking about that dead 120 yeah 40s
joy I'm like I had to go see it you're
getting just about already oh yeah you
look at it you go hold up oh I don't
have that want to live life on the
highest level we all do right all right
50 well we just want to thank you so
much for your time here enjoy the show
and everything and you know thanks for
comin out all right thank you all right
