machine that brings a new concept to
cooking with the water bath the metal
not only heats up your food but it also
will keep your food cool until you're
ready for your meal to start cooking
here's how it works
sous-vide is a method of precision
cooking during which you place food in a
vacuum-sealed bag and cook it in a
temperature controlled water bath to
sous-vide with the Melo you first fill
the Melos removable container with water
and place it on its countertop base
the Melo detects the weight of the water
and automatically it begins to cool it
down to 40 degrees Fahrenheit that
cooling allows you to keep your food in
the Mellow at a safe temperature until
you want it to cook your meal so you
could put a piece of salmon in the
Mellow in the morning use the Melos
after schedule when you want that semen
to be ready and go about your day
without having to worry about your fish
going bad the mellow is at its best when
you follow the cooking recommendations
of its accompanying app it's great at
circulating water around your food so
that all parts of something like a small
steak are cooked evenly and the app
itself is pretty easy to use select what
you want to cook when you want to cook
it and walk away until your meal is
ready but the mellow wouldn't be a great
appliance if you like to experiment with
sous-vide for example the size of the
container really limits how much food
you can put in at once and if you have a
big piece of meat like a flank steak I
worry about the ability for the water to
circulate around it well and the app is
a little counterintuitive when you want
to put in your own recipes
consider the mellow if you're a moderate
sous-vide enthusiast who wants to make
sure dinner is ready
exactly when you want it to be if you're
still not sure about cooking your food
in a water bath go for a less expensive
immersion circulator instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
