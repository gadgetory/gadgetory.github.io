back for more of that Google Isha's
there's an unofficially leaked Galaxy s8
video from Samsung we'll get to that but
let's start with Android wear a new
report from Evan blast inventor beat
says the Android wear 2.0 watches that
Google confirmed last month will be LG
made and called the LG watch sport and
the LG watch style with an official
announcement coming on February the 9th
now the early renders we've seen are
exactly what we can expect from the
final product the LG watch sport will be
the flagship and larger of the two with
a 1.3 eight inch display ip68
waterproofing with Wi-Fi Bluetooth both
3G and LTE connectivity Android pay a
heart sensor and GPS see that's a watch
the LG watch style will be slimmed down
with a smaller 1.2 inch screen with no
Android pay no cell connectivity no GPS
and a lesser ip67 waterproofing in other
tidbits blast reports both watches will
have a digital crown that is similar to
Apple's watch but no details were given
on its functionality
the watches will go on sale on February
the 10th and the day after the
announcement
all right flexible and foldable devices
are most likely coming this year the
Korea Herald reports samsung's galaxy x
project for a bendable smartphone is on
track with plans to be revealed in the
third quarter of this year now LG is
also in that race and pictures from LG
patents from gsm info shows us what they
might be thinking with their own
smartphone tablet hybrid device now
check out these initial drawings that
show a screen that's slightly detached
on the side edge when folded into its
smartphone mode which leaves this strip
for physical controls but when you open
it up like a tablet the screen covers an
entire surface this is pretty ridiculous
and honestly pretty awesome now again
these are just renderings but reports
point to a launch at the beginning of
2018 for this LG device ok samsung
Display released a couple of videos on
their YouTube channel to showcase their
AM OLED technology but set the internet
on fire because they might have just
leaked out the galaxy s 8 at the same
time s 8 design rumors basically match
the phone that we're seeing
in this video with minimal side bezels
and slimmer ones on the top and bottom
so we wanted to just give you a little
eye candy
Samsung has not confirmed or denied what
it is and they haven't taken it down
either but we're gonna put our money on
it and say that's the next Galaxy s8
alright Google's bringing their Android
1 phone that was originally targeted for
developing markets to the US with a
launch sometime this year for a 200 to
$300 price range even in developing
countries a phone of that price really
isn't gonna fly but they might be able
to make a dent here in the US plus it's
an alternative to the Google pixel that
starts at 6:49 now at CES 2017 they
showcased a lot of smart home
integration let's be honest everyone is
jumping on the Amazon echo gravy train
but Google home still has a lot to catch
up when it comes to third-party partners
Vizio is jumping onboard with them with
their smart cast products that include
TVs home speakers sound bars and
surround sound systems to be compatible
with the Google home platform now you'll
be able to do things like voice control
for your system for volume up and down
pause and play music or even power on
videos TVs and a new way of sharing is
coming to YouTube but it's only
available in Canada right now see this
is cool
you'll see a video you like and you can
share it to some of your contacts and it
becomes a conversation right within the
YouTube app why Canada well Google says
they share 15% more than others around
the world add this to the list of things
I'm jealous of Canada for having
including Whistler maple syrup and
better tasting Hershey's chocolate yeah
look it up so if you want in on this you
need a friend in Canada to add you to a
YouTube conversation so good luck
alright that's gonna do it for this week
you can email me at Google issues at
cnn.com or tweet me at Brian Tong thanks
so much for watching it we'll catch
y'all next time for some more of back
you delicious
ooh delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
