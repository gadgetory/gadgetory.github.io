issue complicated or long commands to
your Google home speaker it's calling
the new feature shortcuts and it's sort
of like a text expander for your voice
here's how to make your own google home
shortcuts when texting from your phone
you may not always want to type out on
my way so you might create a text
replacement where you type OMW instead
and when you hit space it expands to the
full text shortcuts for Google homework
very similarly by allowing you to say a
short phrase instead of a long
convoluted command rather than saying OK
Google turn off all the lights you might
just want to say ok Google goodnight or
if Google home has trouble finding a
certain song unless you ask for it in a
very specific way you might want to say
ok Google play my favorite song instead
you can also just use shortcuts to make
commands feel more natural or easier to
say to create a shortcut open Google
home and tap the hamburger button in the
top left to expand the menu select more
settings then scroll down and tap
shortcuts Google pre-loaded 8 example
shortcuts to give you an idea of how you
might want to use them tap on any of
them to edit or press the plus sign in
the bottom right to create a new
shortcut if you've created any if
tablets for Google assistant the setup
will look quite familiar type a short
phrase that you want to use for the
shortcut optionally you can add several
different versions of that phrase for
instance in addition to work time you
might use get to work or do work in the
bottom text field type out the full
command that Google home should use when
you speak the shortcut for example for
work time you would write something like
turn on the office lights or play focus
music on Spotify
unfortunately shortcuts are a little too
simple you would imagine they would
allow you to string multiple commands
together they don't and unlike with IFFT
you can't create a workaround for that
by using the same short phrase across
several shortcuts to connect multiple
commands to a single phrase that is a
missed opportunity what you can do is
create a simple phrase that plays your
favorite show on the TV without having
to specify which chromecast to play it
on or that the show is on Netflix every
time or you can send a text message to
someone when you're running late again
for such uses shortcut
are fairly useful and a step in the
right direction for more google home
