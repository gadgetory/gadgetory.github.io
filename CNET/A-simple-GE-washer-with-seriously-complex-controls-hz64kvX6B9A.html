GE washing machine would have some
advanced features amazing performance or
do something that made it stand out but
unfortunately that just wasn't the case
it wasn't a bad washer exactly but it
doesn't have anything that stands out
and makes it truly amazing it has a 4.5
cubic foot capacity that's competitive
with other models like this it has
enough features you'll have all the
basic stuff but nothing that's smart
nothing that's advanced nothing that
really gives it an edge over the
competition now if you're looking for
something that's kind of
middle-of-the-road it is not a high end
price it's actually kind of mid-range at
1,100 bucks but the one thing that
really really annoys me is the display
you would think that it would have a lot
of features because there's so much
happening on this display panel it's
confusing you don't know where to look
it's kind of difficult to control the
various functions and I really just wish
that was more streamlined especially
since this model doesn't do a whole lot
if it's between this model and a
competitor I would definitely recommend
the Electrolux model I just reviewed
instead but this model is alright if you
can get past the cluttered display</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
