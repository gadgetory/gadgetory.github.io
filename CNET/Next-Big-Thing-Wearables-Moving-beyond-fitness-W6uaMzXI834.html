we've talked about these before but
there's something new brewing out there
a trend you can either call more
intimate or more invasive first some
perspective on this market new research
from IDC suggests about 19 million
wearables are going to ship in 2014
those are tiny numbers compared to
smartphone shipments small even compared
to tablets but 3x what went out the door
in 2013 and on track to be doing 120
million units a year by 2018 now you
might think something like the foot
logger is just a fitness device and it
can do that as a smart in Seoul but it
goes beyond that they say can also be
used to coach a runner to run
differently to land differently to ease
joint pain how about detecting a fall in
the elderly they say it's excellently
aimed doing that or even going so far as
detecting early onset of Parkinson's
disease which is also typify by some
subtle changes in a person's gate the
towel well she'll it's an oddly shaped
looking fitness monitor because it does
more than just that it's also sort of a
pocket gym that you can exercise on
doing isometric muscle tension exercises
so we can tell you your fitness level
suggest exercises that will improve it
and then reflect those back to you as
you make progress then there's the
Google contact lens which can measure
blood glucose levels but not by blood
contact by eye contact and that solution
around your eye it would then send that
information to your smartphone which
could be running a real-time meal
planner app so you keep your blood sugar
exactly where it should be all day if
you're in a high range it might
immediately notify you and medical
providers if you're in crisis range it
might go straight to your emergency
contacts or even notify EMTs Google
promises whether a data comes off this
product should it come to market would
not be aggregated with all the other
stuff they have on you let's hope so I
watch this category with great interest
because it could move Fitness wearables
from an area that most of us just give
lip service to which is everyday fitness
we always tend to put it off and
minimize it instead moving this
technology to have a real seat at the
health and medicine table and increasing
its relevance and importance store
a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
