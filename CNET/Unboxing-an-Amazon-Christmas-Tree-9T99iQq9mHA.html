it all right give it we can do it we can
do it it event so this is a Christmas
tree that we ordered from Amazon this is
the first year that Amazon is selling
live fresh cut six foot two seven foot
tall Christmas trees you can start
ordering them right now they shipped on
November 19th just in time for the
holidays
ours came via FedEx and Amazon has said
that if you live in Puerto Rico or
Hawaii unfortunately you can't get your
hands on one but we got one and we're
super excited to see what's inside
so we got the tree on the stand I will
say I highly recommend you take it out
of the box you cut off the end and you
shake it out all outdoors because as you
can see it is a giant mess to do this
inside
so we ordered a Christmas tree from
Amazon and it's gorgeous but there are
definitely pros and cons to doing this
it shows up on your front doorstep you
don't have to go to a tree lot but you
really have to put in the work to get it
ready to decorate still I think it's
totally viable if you live in an
apartment you don't have a car and you
can't get to a tree lot it's kind of
worth doing it just know you have to put
in a lot of extra work you can order
them starting today and they'll show up
at your front door
look I'm trying I'm trying now I'm
actually trying now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
