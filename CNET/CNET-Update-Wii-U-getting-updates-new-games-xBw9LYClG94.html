will add the Nintendo Virtual Console to
the eShop it'll offer classic games from

Super NES and the games will cost
between five and nine dollars if you
already bought these games on the
original weed you'll have to spend
another dollar to redownload them for
the Wii U another software update is
planned for this summer this one would
speed up the time it takes to launch the
software and return to the main screen
Nintendo is also updating the miiverse
social network and it's creating an app

smartphone or tablet dial has support
now from Samsung Sony Hulu in the BBC
according to a report by tech website
giga on some current Google TV devices

expectations in its fourth-quarter

feel uncomfortable

it can reveal about people and their
connections a tumblr blog showing some
of the strange and embarrassing data you

actual facebook graph Search's one such
as a search for married people who at
one point said they like prostitutes or
current employers of people who marked
that they like racism now to clarify it

able to see either because these people
are in your circle connections or the
information was shared publicly so it's
