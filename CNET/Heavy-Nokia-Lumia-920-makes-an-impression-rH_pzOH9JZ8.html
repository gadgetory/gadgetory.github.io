this is the Nokia Lumia 920 or as I like
to call it the Incredible Hulk this is a
windows phone running the new windows
phone 8 operating system and I just want
to start by talking about the physical
body and design because when you pick it
up in real life that is the first thing
on your mind it looks a lot like the
original nokia lumia 900 it's got sort
of bezel here in a very black screen and
buttons on the side volume power and
camera button it's also really stylized
and sculpted with a flat top and bottom
rounded sides one difference here is
that the back is also a curvier so it's
actually a lot more comfortable to hold
the original Lumia 900 felt really flat
so there was this empty space but this
kind of curves and contours to your hand
the flip side of that is that it also
looks really thick and bulky it's a very
heavy device 6.5 ounces significantly
heavier than the original Lumia and a
lot heavier than other phones on the
market so when you pick this up you know
you're picking it up you can't
comfortably put it in your pocket I
carry a lot of funds in my back pocket
but this one always felt thick and bulgy
and very uncomfortable on the plus side
it is a nice looking device and when
that Nokia obviously put a lot of care
into it's got this 4.5 inch HD display
nokia is calling it the pure motionplus
display unlike the original lumia this
one it uses LCD technology and supposed
to adjust and bright sunlight if you've
got the screen sets you high sensitivity
you can unlock it and operate it using
your fingernail or even a pair of gloves
now the version I have here is the white
color it also comes in black cyan bright
yellow and red this one is very glossy
in fact it's really slippery in the hand
and I how kind of a hard time picking it
up from a desk and gripping it but the
black and cyan version should come with
a matte finish so that should be a
little bit more groupable AT&amp;amp;T is going
to have the exclusive on this phone it
does come with 4G LTE of course it also
comes with a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Qualcomm snapped
again s4 processor which is nice and
fast and it's got 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage on the front there's
one megapixel camera on the back there's
an 8.7 megapixel camera that uses carl
zeiss optics and nokia's pureview
algorithm I did find that low light
pictures were pretty good just using the
automatic settings and other pictures
were also good there were some hint and
some misc I would say it's a good camera
but it isn't necessarily hands down the
best maybe not the way that Nokia would
like now nokia has added some
specialized apps on here to help
differentiate this product from all the
other windows phones there's nokia sig
lens which is an augmented reality app
there's nokia drive it's in beta and
that supplies turn-by-turn voice
directions that is not native to Windows
Phone there's also Nokia Maps and Nokia
Music which kind of has a Pandora like
feature for music mixing you can also
download some of those playlists for
offline listening so that when you don't
have any data it's cached and you can
listen to your songs and there's one
other differentiator as well wireless
charging using BG charging standard but
this is already built into the phone's
back panel you'll be able to set the
phone down on any compatible Qi wireless
charging ports and charge your phone
without having to plug a cord directly
into your handset overall when you look
at the specs the Nokia Lumia 920 has a
lot of really good ones got this
beautiful screen got a lot of the
high-end features on here and wireless
charging definitely adds something
different so does the Nokia turn-by-turn
directions however what I think is going
to turn people away most going to be the
weight of it and so the heft and also
the dimensions it is pretty big and it
is pretty bulky so people who want to
thinner phone this is not the one for
you if that doesn't scare you like
Windows Phone 8 and you love the idea of
all the other things that Nokia brings
to the table then I think this is going
to be a good fit I'm jessica's all court
for cnet this has been the Nokia Lumia
920 for AT&amp;amp;T
