technology fade to the background we
built that service and today I'm happy
to announce google play music all access
a uniquely Google approach to a
subscription music service
why don't we show it to him Jake let's
pop it up on the phone all access starts
with explore it's the guided way for you
to browse an entire collection of
millions of tracks and from the moment
you enter explore we provide
personalized recommendations based on
your listening preferences so here's
some of my personalized recommendations
we also have a section that we can swipe
over to that shows a featured content
top albums and songs as well as a
playlist from our staff of music experts
it's always fresh but if you want to
guide our assistance we can swipe over
and look into specific genres so we have
a 22 top level genres with more to drill
into and why don't we pick Alt + E and
go in there and show them what it looks
like so once we're in here you see
expert powered recommendations here
playlists that are curated by our music
editors as well as top albums from the
genre and key albums that define the
genre but like everything in all access
anything you see you can immediately
start playing so jeiza picked a track
first here so so far so good but here's
where the magic starts because anything
that I'm listening to an all-access I
can instantly turn into a radio station
so Jay hits start radio the song keeps
playing but in the background all access
has made us a never-ending mix of
related tracks now for curious about
what's coming up we can swipe to take a
little peek ahead but more importantly
we can tap on the playlist icon and see
in detail everything that's coming
and tailor it to our needs so if there's
something there we don't want to hear
swipe it away swipe it away you want to
show in reordering you can also reorder
tracks in the queue so this is radio
without rules it says lean back as you
want to or as interactive as you want
thank you all right sometimes you know
exactly what you want to listen to and
we're google so there's always search at
the top so right now I'm in the mood for
some James Blake once you go ahead and
light that up and so when one james
blake play on over there that's great so
won't we pop into the artist here and
when we do we see a couple things that
are interesting here about how all
access blends my catalog with all the
millions of tracks available to you so
you see here that there's one album that
i previously uploaded to the locker from
james blake but if we scroll down we see
the rest of his tracks and albums that
are available to me in all access
blended together and i notice his most
recent album is available there so won't
you go ahead and tap on that and add it
to my library so by adding it to my
personal library now it's shows up here
at the top it's easy for me to access at
all times my library contains all my
personal music that i uploaded as well
as anything that I've discovered and
added from all access but other times I
just want the music to start I want to
get to music with minimal effort that's
where listen now comes in listen now
brings the power of google to surface
music we know you're going to love
there's always a fresh set of choices in
here so in my listen now view you see
the album i just added as well as some
other tracks that i've played recently
there's also new releases from artists
that i enjoy and you also see
interspersed in here are radio stations
that all access has created for us
automatically with listen now there's
always a great selection of music
available to me from my library and all
access and every day it surprises me i
can't wait for you all to have your own
magic
moments with listen now so so far that's
been all access on the phone but of
course works great on tablet and web
browsers as well so when we pop up the
laptop this is all access on the web
browser as you can see it has the same
great set of features listen now is here
with all my suggested content get me one
click to music I've got my library radio
and of course explore and I can enjoy
all access whether I'm on my laptop on
my tablet or on my phone so to recap all
access allows you to explore millions of
tracks effortlessly on any device risk
for millions of tracks effortlessly on
any device radio without rules it's
completely interactive if you so choose
Google powered recommendations and
one-click access to your music from
listen now and of course the best of
both worlds your personal library
blended with ours that's all access no
there's a lot more I could show you but
really I want you all to try it yourself
so let's talk about how you can get it
all access is priced at nine ninety-nine
a month in the US but we're also giving
everyone a 30-day free trial
best of all it's launching today in the
US and we'll be rolling out two
additional countries soon and if you
start a trial by june thirtieth you'll
pay only seven ninety-nine a month
that's all access it's been my pleasure
to show it to you and now I'm going to
call you go back to the stage thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
