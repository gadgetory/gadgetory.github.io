pristine and appliances here with a
review of home boy now home boy is a
$150 DIY security camera that took a
different approach than a lot of its
similarly priced competition one thing
you'll notice right away is that it
isn't tethered to a power cord this is
actually a rechargeable battery powered
camera this thing is actually designed
to last for up to three months or more
on a single charge so the trade-off is
that it doesn't offer live streaming and
it doesn't have an HD high quality
resolution but if you take a step back
from what you think a DIY security
camera should be you might be really
really impressed with home boy although
it doesn't have HD the optics were
really good it's nothing like the
terrible streaky picture that we saw
with doorbot another thing is that it
has free cloud storage and excellent
alerts that responded every time motion
was detected another thing I really like
is that you can tie this camera to your
phone's GPS so when you leave home it
will actually send you the motion
related alerts and when you come back it
will disable the system and stop sending
you alerts so that you aren't triggering
it every time you walk by another thing
I really like is that this cute little
camera has its own if to channel so I
actually tried a bunch of different
recipes and they all worked incredibly
well one of them was when it detected
motion
I had it send me a text message another
recipe I created sent all of my saved
video clips to my Dropbox account and
the third one actually turned on my
Belkin Wemo insight switch connected
lamp on whenever emotion was detected
IFS functionality is something that
really opens up this camera to broader
home automation applications and it's
something we haven't seen with any other
home security camera the many thing iOS
app has it but of course that's a free
app and more of a DIY security
workaround than an actual solution and
that if functionality also gives home
boy potential smart things integrations
even though it isn't
technically a smart thing compatible
product so even though homeboy is a more
pared down security camera than what
we've seen it really nails the features
it has and it won't take up a ton of
storage or bandwidth thanks for watching
this review of home boy please be sure
to check out my full review on cnn.com
as well as all of our other home
security camera coverage I'm Megan
