seenot appliances here with the 230
dollar Lutron caseta wireless smart
lighting dimmer kit so these products
look pretty basic at first glance there
is a plastic hub that plugs into your
router it comes with two dimmer plugs so
you can connect a lamp and turn them on
or off and it comes with two Pico
remotes that let you control your
lighting manually it also has an app a
Lutron app that lets you set your
lighting schedules and do other advanced
settings with your lights but this one
has something special that we've never
seen before it has homekit capability
and that means that I OS users can use
Siri to access their lights Siri turn
off the lights okay
turned off and there you go it has
turned off the lights within the Lutron
app you can also do some more custom
settings so you could label this your
bedroom light and you're upstairs light
or this one your living room light and
your downstairs light so hey Siri turn
on the upstairs light ok the light is
turned on so you can really do a lot of
different customizations here so you can
group certain lights into certain
settings and set different scenes and
zones that way you can also integrate
the Apple watch so I have the Apple
watch here but if I ask Siri on the
Apple watch to turn off the lights
it will hand that off to the phone since
the phone and the watch are basically
tethered you have to have them near each
other for the watch to work at all this
isn't a huge inconvenience but it
definitely defeats the purpose of one on
one Siri integration with your watch and
your lights and one other thing we've
heard that you have to have an Apple TV
to allow for remote Siri access so if
you're outside of your home Wi-Fi
network and you want to tell Siri to
turn off your lights
it won't be able to without an apple to
now we had heard that the third
generation Apple TV that's the one
available now for 69 bucks should be
able to do that even though it hasn't
been officially announced so we decided
to grab a third generation Apple TV and
try it out for ourselves the good news
is that it worked I was able to turn the
lights on and off and dim them from the
cellular network the problem is that
it's unreliable so right after signing
in with my Apple IDE to the Apple TV it
worked great for a period of time and
then would drop off not exactly sure
where the breakdown is happening there
if it's on Lutron side or with the Apple
TV itself but just be aware that the
third-generation model might work and it
might not as the first hardware that
integrates with homekit that's available
in retail stores like Apple stores and
other places I'm really really really
impressed with it the Lutron hardware
itself works great when I reviewed the
non homekit version of this before I
really loved it but this bumps it up a
notch for sure if you are an iOS fan and
you love the idea of voice control that
really does work the one downside is
that all of that wink and staples
connect integration that you enjoy on
the original smart bridge won't be
available on this smart bridge because
it is a home kit exclusive device all in
all I really like this thing and I think
it is a smart and really simple way for
iOS fans to control their lights thanks
for watching this review of Lutron's
caseta wireless smart lighting dimmer
kit be sure to check out the rest of our
coverage on Sina comm I'm Megan
