got August's free playstation plus and
xbox live games with gold to share with
you first let's take a look at what the
ps4 offers this month it's lara croft
temple of Osiris that's the isometric
top-down game from the same company that
makes those blockbuster tomb raider
games next on ps4 is limbo I hope you've
already played this I mean it's
available on pretty much every platform
ever but if for some reason you never
got around to it I can't recommend it
enough it's an amazing platform game
with a great style devilishly clever
puzzles and most importantly a
heartwarming morbid story across all
PlayStation platforms players will get
the rhythm based platformer sound shapes
along with the 3d puzzler stealth
incorporated to ps3 and Vita owners have
one crossover game this month and that's
castlestorm which is a genre buster that
combines physics-based destruction and
strategic elements finally those of you
still chugging away on that ps3 of yours
you're going to get god of war ascension
perhaps the weakest of the god
wargames last generation but
nevertheless plenty of button mashing
fun okay let's switch sides over to the
land of Xbox this month xbox one owners
will get to play metal gear solid 5
ground zeroes for free which if I recall
correctly from my time with that game it
was a great crouching simulator xbox one
players will also get how to survive
colon storm warning which is survival
zombie game this game will be available
August sixteenth through September 15th
so just take a mental note of that
finally the first person post
apocalyptic horror game Metro 2033 will
be free for the first half of august
while it's arguably better follow up
metro last light will finish off the
second half of the month both of them
are solid shooters though so be sure to
grab them while you can okay that does
it for August as always a tiny caveat
you do of course need to be a member of
PlayStation Plus and or xbox live gold
to access these free games those
memberships do cost a little bit of
money but let's be honest you and I both
know they're well worth it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
