drive in four-by-fours tough off-roaders
like early jeeps or dodge power wagons
in their guts was a second gearbox
called a transfer case that split the
power coming out of the transmission
sending it for a nap and it was
controlled by a second gear lever inside
and then there were geared hubs you had
to get out and lock by hand for Mac's
off-road traction driving all wheels
then was not for the faint of heart but
today it's a highly sought after feature
in cars as different from a jeep as this
jag why well two main reasons neither of
which will necessarily ever take you off
the road
whether in the snow all-wheel drive is
much better than rear-wheel drive or
even front-wheel drive to get power
through the snow to the road performance
all-wheel drive is much better at taking
all the engine's power and getting it to
the road through the maximum number of
wheels to get around a corner fastest or
just off the line this jaguar xj is a
good example of both modes it's
all-wheel drive system biases the power
mostly to the rear wheels by default but
when wheel slip is detected up to 50
percent of the cars power is sent to the
front wheels usually before you even
know it's needed their rear wheel drive
is the classic layout for great handling
except in snow where it tends to spin
and slip and leave you stranded most
cars today are front-wheel drive
mostly for efficiency reasons but that
also does tend to land better snow
traction but both the jewel drive
systems leave half the wheels largely
unused and both suffer from cornering
issues either oversteer when the rear of
the car wants to come around in a corner
or understeer when the front end sort of
plows to the outside of a corner enter
all-wheel drive
do you know Subaru for their obsession
with all-wheel drive today but you may
not know they started all this 1971 the
Leone the first regular car that had
all-wheel drive stuck under it for the
first time you could drive something
that wasn't a truck and get out of
almost any kind of trouble on the road
then in 1980 all-wheel drive got cool
with the arrival of the Audi Quattro and
its autonomous all-wheel drive system
its rally car DNA completely
repositioned all-wheel drive as
something you didn't just use a few days
in the winter it opened consumers eyes
that all-wheel drive is a performance
thing then in 2004 Honda brings out
super handling all-wheel drive the first
that could bias power not just between
the front and rear wheel sets but also
differently across the left and right
rear wheels using power for cornering in
a completely new way that is still
cutting-edge simultaneous and continuous
control and shows that the optimum
amount of torque is always distributed
to each of the four wheels now this 13
Pathfinder is a good example of how cars
have technology that allows all-wheel
drive to become much more gentrified to
be honest you don't need to understand
anything about low range or locking hubs
to get the most out of the system check
it out here's what it's come to
you got a knob now that handles
all-wheel-drive no more big ol levers
and transfer case handles this thing
defaults to auto which is very telling
you can also roll it to two-wheel drive
or put it in lock if you even know what
that's for typically you'll leave it in
auto it'll figure out the rest I first
saw this on Land Rovers they have what
they call terrain response control you
rotate this knob to rock or mud or snow
jeeps do something similar but
eventually I think this highly
simplified control is the real harbinger
of the future and after this the
computer will figure out what you're
stuck in and it will do that knob job
for you
okay now a reality check all-wheel drive
is not just milk and honey and traction
and cornering it's got some downsides
first cost all-wheel drive adds a fair
amount of serious hardware over front or
rear-wheel drive and that can add a
couple thousand bucks or more to the
MSRP complexity all-wheel drive does
create more to go wrong and more than
to be shoehorned underneath the belly of
a car efficiency all-wheel drive cars
may give up an mpg or three on the
highway or on city fuel economy due to
both added weight as well as more
hardware to be turning all the time
depending how the systems design look
rear-wheel drive will still have its
place in particularly performance
automobiles front-wheel drive will
remain the mainstream drive system for
most cars but all-wheel drive is getting
closer to being there
partly because the cost is now fairly
modest to add it on and partly because
it's become so much easier to use these
seamless digitized transparent sort of
think for you systems have made
all-wheel drive a lot more approachable
for a lot more drivers if it weren't for
the cost penalty and some mpg penalty it
would be the pinnacle of getting power
to the road</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
