products possibly we're gonna take a
look into the future by way of patent
violence Apple does a lot of work trying
to come up with new tab so and protect
itself by getting patents fun thing is
patent filings are publicly available
they even have diagrams so I dug through
the last year or so to see what could be
next from Apple let's get to it and
number five is a power watch band
officially it's called dynamic fit
adjustment for wearable electronic
devices the patent covers are wearable
that you can interact with think like an
Apple watch that includes a tensioner
that were loosen or tighten the strap
it's kind of like the power laces from
Back to the Future 2 oh yeah Apple was
granted this patent in October of this
year at number four are the Apple
glasses the images depict a pair of
clunky glasses that allow you to slide
in what looks like an iPhone in some
ways if this is something Apple really
wants to do it would explain why on
earth Apple is obsessed with making the
iPhone thinner and thinner and thinner
because the end goal is to wear it on
your face and if you're wondering why
the designs are relatively ugly figures
and patents are you too simplified to
illustrate how it works it's not for
marketing number three is a foldable
iPhone this patent shows off a device
that can be tented like a yoga laptop
here the display is actually bent around
the hinge this would allow two people to
view the device at the same time this
patent also covers a variety of devices
including a tablet a laptop a watch
headphones phones and more another
patent held by Apple shows a really
bendy iPhone looks like a squished
mattress and number two is a windowed
iPhone this one's kind of strange Apple
has a few patents filed on electronic
devices having displays with openings
this figure figure 18 shows a device
that would have a transparent window
that may be formed from openings in the
display the thing is that opening still
has pixels from the display the filing
says the display pixels in the window
region may be used in forming a heads-up
display this patent covers a wide array
of devices including tablets computer
monitors and phones
and at number one is some kind of scroll
this patent is entitled electronic
devices with retractable displays it
covers a device with two housings that
can be pulled apart to support a
flexible display speakers mics cameras
and other components would live in the
housings magnets would keep the two
housings together when not in use that
just sounds incredibly cool now remember
a patent is not a guarantee we will see
these technologies in one or more
products but it's always fun to try to
figure out what's next who knows maybe
Apple will have one device that combines
all the patents we covered that be some
kind of scroll with a flexible display
that you can wear on your face and see
through that automatically adjust to the
size of your head that's just crazy for
