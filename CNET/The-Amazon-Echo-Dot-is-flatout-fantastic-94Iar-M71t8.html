full-size speaker with a brain on top
Wi-Fi Bluetooth radio next to the cloud
so that Alexa can figure out how to
respond to your question or command well
now there's the Amazon echo dot and this
is basically just that brain no
full-size features its cost half the
price of Amazon echo but does everything
that echo does it just doesn't put out a
full rooms worth of sound the good news
is that echo dot makes up for this by
allowing you to connect to your own
speakers either via a 3.5 millimeter
cable that comes with it or over
bluetooth that's a fantastic feature and
something that the original Amazon echo
can't do now when I say this the echo
dot does everything that the echo does
that's exactly what I mean it's the
exact same set of Alexa smart you can
ask it for music whether the news for
random trivia just watched by say Alexa
what's the weather in Louisville today
you can even use echo dot on its own
without any external speakers at all it
has a set of built-in speakers that are
about as strong as the ones in your
phone to your tablet that's not enough
to fill a room with audio but that works
well as an Alexa access point maybe for
a bedside table or in the kitchen all in
all I think this is a pretty fantastic
product and a great application of
everything that we loved about Amazon
echo into a smaller package that's
easier to afford at ninety dollars
I say it's a deserving Editors Choice
winner frankly Alexa's never sounded the
best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
