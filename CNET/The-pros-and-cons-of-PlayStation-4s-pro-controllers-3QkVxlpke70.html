you are the two professional grade
control is officially licensed for use
with the ps4
we've pitted them against each other
across a range of categories like button
field button placement and the
accessories that you get hopefully
you'll get a good feel for both
controllers and work out if one of them
is the one for you now the Nikon's made
a really good move by keeping the left
thumbstick where sony has had the d-pad
since the ps1 the right stick has a
rounded logo on the top and I found that
got quite slippery after a little while
razor has gone for the conventional
DualShock joystick placement with the
roger they've also included removable
silicon covers if you want a different
tactile feel to the standard rubber
surface the revolution's joystick
placement is superior and it's something
Xbox owners have had forever the net
cons for programmable buttons are all
underneath and set almost flush with the
grips children are raised to make
hitting them easier but I found they
needed more forceful push which shift
your hands away from the triggers I
couldn't reliably hit em1 and em2
the ride you also has four macros - on
the underside of the controller and -
located right next to the triggers
they're all really easy to hit and if
you wanted to you can even remove the
triggers underneath leaving the button
flush with the controller
accessing those additional buttons is
also way easier on the ride you they've
got a quick control panel on the bottom
that lets you assign those macros on the
fly switch profiles mute your mic and
adjust the volume the revolution has
four profiles where the ride you can
only store two custom settings so in the
face button face off I've got to go with
the Nikon I just really like the size
and the feel
I thought the razor's buttons were a bit
small and a bit clicky it's really
interesting because I really like the
mechanical keyboard feel and sound of it
but also the the fact that the macros
are so much more accessible means you
don't really need larger face buttons
providing access to four extra buttons
across four fingers also makes a lot
more sense than - after a few hours of
practice I'd completely replace my use
of the face buttons with macros leaving
my right thumb free to continue to aim
at targets you can also turn on hair
triggering and reduce the amount of play
in the triggers by locking them off the
revolution requires a dedicated app the
advantages you get for separate profiles
and a lot more customized ability in
terms of sensitivity on your triggers
and your thumb sticks but you have to
put the effort in to get it working
properly the revolution also gives you
one other way to customise the
controller it's got internal channels
that let you add weight so you can get a
feeling right in your hand
but there's just something about the
shoulder buttons on the revolution and
the grip that has it feeling a little
bit off one of the things I find really
crummy about the Nikon is it doesn't
have an app for Mac computers so I can't
actually do any of the customization on
the other hand customizing controls on
the ride U is super easy you hold down
the assignment button the macro and the
macro you want to map to it the
controller vibrates confirm and that's
it we've got to give this one to the
ride you right like being able to map
jumping switching weapons reloading to
your trigger fingers it just feels so
much more natural both controllers
accorded the ride you connected by a
micro USB and the revolution uses a five
pin which probably explains the superior
audio quality in the neck on the Nikon
is just super clear I had to turn the
volume down because chat was just too
good yeah the ride you it was a real
letdown especially in comparison to the
Nikon the unit we tested it was worse
than a standard ps4 controller the ride
use silicon grips
removable triggers and thumb stick
covers make it the better built
controller it also includes a hard shell
travel case while the revolution only
comes with a soft carry bag the ride you
is the pricier controller but those
extras make a decent case for paying
that little bit more so I think it's
obvious I'm completely sold on the right
ear buttons feel better the macro is
easier to access it's just it's the
control I kept going back to I'm
inclined to agree I mean it's more
expensive but it just felt better in the
hand the first time I picked it up but
it's not perfect the audio quality was
disappointing and two profiles felt
restrictive if playing multiple games
while we preferred the ride you the
Nikon does have a lot going for it
it's a controller for someone who wanted
to tinker and get it working exactly how
they want and a few of our colleagues
and friends were swearing by it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
