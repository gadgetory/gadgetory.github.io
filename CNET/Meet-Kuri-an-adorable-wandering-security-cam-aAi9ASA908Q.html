friendly home robot companion it's the
first product from Mayfield robotics a
startup from Bosch when I first heard
about it I thought it was going to be
sort of like an Alexa taped to a robot
vacuum but what curry tries to do and
where it tries to separate itself is
with personality
it looks at you it smiles with its eyes
it has a number of different greetings
that are called wait for it Romo cheese
curry can follow you around it can
respond to voice commands you can have
it patrol your home and take pictures if
there's anything out of the ordinary if
your dogs on the couch Curry's going to
understand context send you an alert and
you can use the speakers and Guri to
yell at your dog it also has a four
microphone array so it can hear you and
know where you're talking from and then
look at you when you give a command in
an extra bit of coolness curry actually
uses lasers to help it map your house so
it can know where rooms are and not run
into objects on the way curry it's all
about the personality all about the
adorableness it can also do podcasts it
can also sync up with IFFT so hopefully
in the future you'll be able to do a lot
of smart home functionality I'm still
hoping for some alexa like use here to
help justify the $700 price tag and it's
gonna be out by December of 2017 by the
time it launches I'm hoping for a bit
more smart home functionality and a few
more voice commands but for the time
being I can attest it's got the adorable
part now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
