display from the looking glass factory
it brings you a slice of virtual reality
without the cumbersome or isolationist
headset unfortunately it's hard to
convey exactly what the 3d content looks
like or how liberating it feels to
interact with it without having to gear
up you don't get the full surround
experience you would with a headset but
that's not really what this is for if
you do any kind of 3d designer
development this lets you get a real
preview of your work such as seeing
textures dimensionally as you paint them
previewing 3d printing or doing a
presentation to a group while it looks
like a big glass block it's actually
comprised of layers of refractive
material and there's a lot going on
under its hood its software generates 45
views of a scene or object which the
display refract differently based on
your viewing angle you can use different
types of controllers with it for
instance the one we used was a leap
motion hand tracking device but you can
pair it with depth cameras like
realsense or game controllers like
Nintendo's jaikon there'll be a library
of free apps when it ships you connect
it to a system preferably one with
discrete graphics via HDMI and USB see
it comes in two sizes an 8.9 inch and a
15.6 inch they're available for
pre-order at a discount for four hundred
and two thousand dollars before they
jump back to their normal prices of six
hundred and three thousand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
