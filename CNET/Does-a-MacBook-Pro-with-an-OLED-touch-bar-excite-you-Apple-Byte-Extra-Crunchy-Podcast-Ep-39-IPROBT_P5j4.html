information to the table and it's also a

you that extra munch with that Apple by
crunch yeah we had a lot of good calls
this week we had we had we got tons so
we can't wait to get to those so let's
just jump into the show starting off
right now macbook pros we have heard so
much about the iphone people have been
asking about macbook pros and people and
asking you about macbook pro steven
Beecham lot of phone calls about macbook
pros actually pros foam macbook pro fo
sho so here's the latest story according
to digit times and it's also been
cooperated by 9to5 mac the new macbook
pros the fully revamped redesigned ones
that i have been telling all of you just
to wait for for about the past year but
also just wait till WWDC it appears that
they might be coming a little later but
they will be coming according to these
reports in the fourth quarter of 2016
with an all-new thinner and lighter
design but here's the hot stuff the new
macbook pros both the 13-inch and 15
inch models are expected to come with a
new OLEDs play touch bar there's going
to be an oled kind of if you've seen
something like the razor laptops gaming
laptop they kind of have this touch
panel they
Oh LED strip that replaces the function
keys located above your actual keyboard
a nice long line they're not a
touchscreen not just on the keyboard
it's like well we don't you know we
don't exactly really know what it is
other than it's a OLED touch bar maybe
the icons can change maybe depending on
the app that you're using they might be
context-sensitive you might have media
controls at one point or if you're using
something like Final Cut Pro you might
have some quick shortcuts or something
like iTunes which needs all the help it
can get for for quicker hey you know
what instead of navigating that thing
I'd rather just like typing icon for
movies TV shows music podcasts the Apple
by podcast specifically just just talk
to me so the report is that it will
include this OLED touch bar there is no
word of what type of functionality this
will have but this is going to be a big
jump a big move for the macbook pros we
haven't really seen any drastic design
change we know about the processors but
this will be the according to ming-chi
kuo digit times the biggest revamp we've
seen in four years it will also these
are expected to support both USB and C
and Thunderbolt 3 right so we have this
whole story about the macbook pros and
I've been telling people to wait till
WWDC and it looks like you'll probably
have to wait a little longer but you
might see something a little earlier
still in the shape of macbooks an
additional report by digit times from
ming-chi kuo says that the new macbook
right we know we have that ultra-thin
kind of super sleek ultra thin design
right now yeah that's in a 12-inch
format the report says that Apple is
going to release a 13-inch model and it
kind of sounds weird because you're
saying why would you have a 13 inch and
a 12 inch model of this super ultra thin
that's just a one inch difference lynch
is all it is it makes all the difference
to me um but with this laptop they're
saying that the macbooks ultra-thin will
pretty much be the super portable for
apple's line the new macbook pros we
just talked about will stay that
hi in full feature rich feature packed
macbook pro and then the current macbook
air's yeah those guys that are actually
still pretty pretty thin and slim will
move down to the budget laptop and when
we say budget apples budget laptop right
now is around i think they start at
eight ninety-nine for an 11 inch budget
laptop 899 after tax and applecare that
ain't what you like a thousand dollars
or many budget but that's that's the
Assumption how Apple is going to kind of
lay out their line three different
specific lines pro ultra thin and air
which will be the budget line so we'll
see the the thing about this is this 13
inch ultra thin is expected to be
available the third quarter of this year
and if that is the case we should
definitely see that at WWDC and I really
hope that man WWDC has to be a feature
showcase for the new macbook pro it just
has to be to me you know I'm a little
disappointed actually buy this
touchscreen strip you're talking about
because why don't they just make a
touchscreen laptop I mean it's put it in
the screen yeah put it in the screen
please I mean it's so much more useful
to you I've had I've had a touch screen
for three or four years now and I love
it scrolling hitting play on a video
every website has a big button now you
just push the button it's so much faster
than using your you know mousing around
or using your little trackpad to like
find it and hit the button it's so much
faster and Apple makes awesome displays
so why don't they just make a
touchscreen display well I will also
tell you why hire here's the thing it's
mine honestly rip what is this strip
come on come on a touch more shrimp what
we want to touch marsh we want
touchscreen yeah look the other issue
that Apple has here and maybe maybe they
surprise us maybe they bring a touch
screen laptop to the table is they don't
have software to support it yet they
really don't this is the conundrum that
Apple is facing where you can make all
this cool stuff but right hardware and
software together Apple has no answer
for that right now and they sure ain't
gonna give me an iPad pro with iOS
laptop no that ain't that's not gonna
cut it ladies and gentlemen yeah it
doesn't cut it right now it doesn't cut
it already so your point Stephen one
hundred percent right on the money touch
bars like oh that it could be cool but
remember let's rewind back to December
when you and I had our prediction show
we talked all about the product line I
said arguably apples laptops will be the
most exciting product this year just
from a standpoint of it's time to revamp
them but are they really going to be
moving so many units of these laptops
that's gonna make that much of a
difference probably not so look I like
the fact that we see these new stories
it's exciting it's something new people
want something new they always get
excited when you're like oh a thinner
design a macbook pro cool but how
important will this touch bar really be
how I'm really know but like last week
we were talking about that ipad how you
can use touch ID on the ipad through the
screen right with that high frequency
thing that that was going to sound
sending the waves maybe they're setting
it up for that they put in the laptop
they could be maybe that's maybe that's
why they're building this little strip
so that you can use the touch ID yeah i
did your you will you make a great point
i did forget to mention that that actual
laptop although they don't include it in
the same detail they do say that the new
macbook pros that are expected to come
out we'll have a touch ID sensor yes so
it could be part of the touch bar quite
honestly it would be funny if this touch
bar is really just a little square on
the corner that's just for touch ID
right you don't we gonna get all greasy
and gross gonna clean it with win you
never know with these rumors and stories
but this is the information that has
been presented to us by digit times by
ming-chi kuo and corroborated by nine to
five max so really two laptops coming
this year a revamp macbook pro line 13
and 15 and then a new 13-inch potential
ultra thin so we will wait and see
alright ok let's talk iphone 7 plenty of
rumors this is like cornucopia myriad
rumors of the iphone 7 the first one
comes to us from a photo leak that
showed off a component of this dual
camera module now this is from oh sorry
i know i was about to sneeze that sounds
really bad
to get these button right there if you
need it sniffles button press the button
I'll do sniffles button next time okay
but a Steve hammer suffer from nowhere
else fr showcase an image of a dual
camera component that is believed to be
part of the iphone 7 plus but even more
interesting in these pictures and for
those people watching beach i have a
link in the beetle that they might be
able to see but i'll still talk those
pictures are really interesting because
it also shows SD card capacities that
are rumored to be linked to this 7 plus
it shows us 16 it shows us 64 it also
shows us 256 gigs well so could the new
iphone 7 plus bring 256 gigs of storage
based on these leaks possibly this is
from steve hammer Stauffer nowhere else
so far i think the biggest concern and i
talked about this in our actual video
show that's posting later today dude
they're still showing me 16 gigs as the
starting jump off point for a freaking
iphone are you kidding me that's crazy
like his Apple still gonna do this crap
I can't tell her we we might have to
start a movement like we have right now
there's all these movements going on
black lives matter asian american actors
matter transgender bathrooms matter we
need 16 gigs on iphone don't matter it
doesn't matter doesn't matter it's
horrible it is horrible i get the 60 for
it i already feel that's what I'm
talking about videos and I'm like oh
it's time to start a new movement all
those movements are kind of getting
played out I'm playing around guys don't
take it all seriously you know i'm
joking please but the fact that i have
to disclaimer that is really sad these
days right oh yeah we'll get common yeah
we will but 16 gigs doesn't matter it
doesn't matter i like don't matter
though it's kind of cooler 16 gigs don't
matta 16 gig don't matter so what would
be the lowest 64 mounted bike 65 or no
no fine 32 32 32 you'll fill up your
furniture at least Sam so he's doing 32
it's better than 16 we will move along
otherwise I will talk about this from
them
next hour I can't wait till we can get
to Terry's on there to Terry's that's
funny all right like $2,000 iphone next
up report from LG an apple say that I
don't know if we did this last week did
we do this last week man my brain is my
brain is mush but basically Sonia's
believed to be the component supplier
for that dual camera for the iphone
reports say that they have been lagging
an LG will now take its place at the
primary supplier for the iphone 7 plus
dual camera component cool I think we
did talk we did you know what we talked
about optical image stabilization for
the 4.7 inch and we both shared about
that yay next story thank you this is
just a call back new iphone 7 schematic
images again they're schematics run in
wild show what is believed to again be a
dual camera spot exclusively 7 plus
model but no smart connector we've
talked a lot about the fact that they
had those three magic dots on the iphone
7 plus seen typically in the ipad pro
and the ipad pro line 12 point nine inch
in 9.7 inch also kind of exciting
because you could really make a lot
slimmer profile battery charging case
because it provides both data and power
sure people talk about a keyword but I
really think like a battery case would
be able to take the best you know be
able to use this to its advantage the
best out of any product out there so
that's thrown out there we also have
purported photos of the back of an
iphone 7 now one of the big things that
we've seen now in renders in schematics
is that the actual camera lens for the
4.7 inch iphone is bigger is larger
that's always a good thing so images
have been showing this off and also
confirming if these are table would be
believed the antenna lines being removed
but there's a look at it for those of
you watching again a large it the bevel
nice yeah the bevel of it is a little
different but it's the bigger camera
lens is always a good thing for the
iphone okay on finally in another iphone
7 news flash rumor flash purported
photos from know
else FR show a case design aligns with
the whole camera thing we're talking
about but has four speaker grills
basically this case shows off the
speakers as if it's aligned like the
iPad pro for two on each side top and
bottom we haven't seen that anywhere I
don't know if this is just some crazy
person making up stuff and throwing out
a case we know cases can be true can be
real can be fake but this is look all
these 5 6 7 7 iphone 7 stories all
dropped this week really so people are
talking we have surround sound on her
iPhone may be true stereo sound so I
guess that's a 4 then not 4.1 that's
just for yeah it's just for so I'm
almost surround sound almost almost
another thing is that economic daily
Taiwan economic Daily News is reporting
that this new iphone 7 Apple is real
really believes in it because they are
prepping and have told their suppliers
to build as many as seventy eight
million iphone 7 units for launch that
would make this the largest ramp up
before up to the iphone 6 the iphone 6
had a huge ranch up for simple ramp up
for suppliers Apple expects this iphone
7 to be the same we saw Tim Cook touting
about how this new iphone you have
things that you can't live without water
oxygen food fire shelter fire fire fire
fire fire hey hey they're gonna build
these guys are gonna build 78 million
they're gonna get higher is a few more
people no I'm sure there's more workers
that's a lot of my people right there
man there were in our they are working
already um transitioning over to the
iphone future look i'm sorry there's a
lot of hype now around this 10th
anniversary iphone it gives not called
the iphone future that is what we call
it here on the show most likely they're
gonna be really boring and call it like
the iphone x but then they'll say call
the x10 that's what everyone's been
saying i own tax i think you like i'm
pretty much the everyone on the
internets that's their guess and i also
think that
will follow in line with the x-men
movies naming so they'll have the x2 you
guys let's not do that then the x3 last
stand which is a horrible movie that
will just do then we'll go iphone X
first-class iphone it Days of Future
past iphone X Age of Apocalypse oh man
please please let's not get on the
superhero bandwagon they aren't going to
do that they weren't going to do that
but this report says a surge in OLED
equipment orders are linked directly to
iPhones why is this so we have this
supplier who form for companies like LG
and Samsung they need equipment to build
OLED displays they had orders four times
the amount in a single quarter it was
around seven hundred million dollars
they equaled up to one year's worth of
order so this is applied materials as
the company right so they reported that
hey we had a boost for x order size this
quarter equivalent to a whole year
clearly indicating that some certain
mobile company is ramping up from some
certain type of OLED display and based
on the timing of the equipment getting
these manufacturers that would time it
out for next year that's crazy 700
million in a quarter Wow I'm sorry
there's a lot of hype already around me
again I'm not gonna say I'm gonna skip
the iphone 7 yet I bought every iPhone
except for the 5s I skipped I went from
five to six I did not get a 5s but
they've got to really do something for
me to be like yeah I'm gonna get a seven
even though I review this stuff I gotta
have it I skipped the 5s yeah I'm more
than willing to skip again if it's not
that great I'm in every other iphone
adopter so I probably will skip the
seven and just get the eight when it
comes out once my four maybe just wait
till my phone dies yeah and a lot of
people will call me out and be like oh
you you're supposed to review the stuff
like look I'm I'm trying to represent
you all like a consumer i buy all my
stuff repeat we all buy all our stuff
repeat i buy all my things yes and um
you know gotta represent for the people
gotta represent represent our
in a fun story this one it this one's
probably like my happy story of the day
over the week tim cook believes that the
iphone might have actually been
discovered in 1670 what am I talking
about alright so Tim Cook was at startup
fest in Europe and amsterdam and he was
on stage and he was being interviewed by
the former European Commissioner for
Digital Agenda her name is Neelie Kroes
and in this queue a kind of session in
front of an audience she asked him just
be like oh um you know were you there
when the phone you know where and when
did the actual iphone kind of come to
fruition not the day it was released but
when did it actually happen in Tim Cook
kind of jokingly said oh yeah you know I
thought I knew but then I saw a
Rembrandt when we went to the
Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and it looks
like to me that someone was holding an
iphone so it does we're gonna you know
we have the picture here uh it does kind
of like kind of ish like it's like she's
making a dog video with the dog in her
lap right now no it's a sunny viral
video so this piece of work is actually
not a Rembrandt it was done by peter de
hooch in 1670 the name of the painting
is called man handing a letter to a
woman in the entrance hall of a house
wait is that him that's a man yeah yeah
you don't know the iphones man well man
handing a letter no no the dude with the
iphone i think that's the letter ok
that's what it looks like a woman
there's a woman sitting them down with a
little cute dog that is not to me those
a dog that size that is smaller than
your thigh is a rat and I'm sorry for
all you listening I'm used to golden
retrievers babies it's your wah wah I'm
used to a big dog that I could that is a
dog there's like dress them up and
clothes and stuff hi hey that's the
worst they call them toy dogs dude
that's not a dog that's a dress up toys
my favorite as the word entry at the
Westminster Abbey dog show is the toys
I'm telling you Paris goobers tell me
what your favorite dog is because I know
it ain't one of those little pipsqueak
chihuahuas they're just like I mean I
eat those things
haha so this is prior art to the iphone
yes night sixteen sixteen seventy wow
there you go the the iphone so I've got
a funny thing I got a funny thing to
just piggyback on this did you ever hear
because this this came up and talking
about it did you ever hear about the
time traveler from the from the Mike
Tyson Peter McNeeley fight did you know
about this okay um while i'm talking
about this in the document go to the
cnet link um it's about the same story
okay open it up and scroll down and i
want to tell people about this time
traveler thing so basically it's a
boxing match with Mike Tyson Peter
McNeeley long time ago long time ago and
in the crowd there's you'll see it for
those you watching but in the crowd
there's a guy holding like a white
device Oh with like a lens in a circle
that in there and at the time there were
no there were no cameras there were no
cameras like you know these are this is
your this like the canon s110 razão
tour at all that looked like that at all
and everyone is trying to figure out
what exactly was that device I'm telling
you just search up time traveler Mike
Tyson fight and you're gonna be like
even has like a flash i'm telling you
i'm not even i'm not even messing around
so there's some Tim Cook may not be
wrong there's something to it he's from
here from six sixteen seventy and I
think was that fight in like the early
90s I believe probably that that's when
Mike Tyson was that it biggest look at
that that is so weird yeah it was it's
insane people gave me like what and i'm
telling you i love this video i love
videos like this that's what i'm talking
about so fun five million six million
views almost so you know we also love we
love you all the apple byte nation you
guys call us and make our show what it
is today so again the number 1 806 162
638 call us leave your name your message
but we're going to go to our phone calls
and talk to you all and again i called
out for the ladies that to check in with
us and we'll see if we got someone to
represent all right here we go okay
number one
hey brian Tong did he shake up from al
monte california i just want to ask a
question did you think all the features
that were rumored for the 10th
anniversary iphone is gonna affect the
sales of the iphone 7 like maybe from
the bezel of the bezel is display things
and i love the show guys keep it up keep
up the good work okay so i think in any
case because Tim Cook doubled down on
secrecy and we know nothing about the
iphone 7 or the iphone 10th anniversary
it's like come on uh no matter what
they're all rumors i'm gonna make my
purchasing decision based on what the
seven has when it's officially announced
but i will tell you right now the 10th
anniversary phone sounds like the phone
to get oh yeah definitely it's right i
mean just the design the potential touch
ID with no home button wireless charging
OLED display it's kind of sad it almost
sounds like a samsung galaxy phone but
I'm talking about I love the apple byte
so you know wait till the actual stuff
comes out and then make a decision that
that's what that's what I always say hey
real quick papa snarf yeah Papa Stanley
YouTube chat room is saying that that is
a casio camera and that that video was
debunked a while ago some sort of Cassie
okay my God why do I to kill my gotta
kill my dreams like seriously we like
never sure we don't know that for sure
this is papa snarf is telling us this I
will tell you on periscope someone put
wrote the same thing I'm like do don't
kill my vibe don't kill don't harsh my
vibe right now don't harsh my mellow
please alright so yeah it's sure in my
in your mind right now you're like I'm
gonna wait for the 10th anniversary but
just wait till the actual phone gets
announced that making a decision and and
then maybe you're like okay I'm good
I'll get one we'll see we'll see what
tim says we can't live without yes I'm
so curious to see what we can't live
without I'm too i am too okay next call
hi my name is Josh carb i'm calling from
ambler pennsylvania my question is
simple i love my ipad mini 4 but i'd
really like to see an ipad pro 7.9 inch
my question is do you think that will be
the next iteration because i'm debating
whether to hold onto my ipad mini 4 and
just wait for the fall or upgrades you
and ipad pro 9.7 inch thanks you guys
are awesome i love your shows the videos
it really makes my life better thank you
nice we love that we're here you really
we can you make our lives better by
contributing with that call and I guess
we I feel like flattered that people say
that yeah hearing that call made my life
better thank you made my day better for
sure for sure so the question about is
Apple gonna bring the ipad pro features
the mini my right off the top just
knowing how Apple things i would say i
know only because by giving you
something more something extra to
differentiate the mini line from the
from the proline that's what they want
you to do they wanted to be like I want
that extra stuff I'm going to upgrade
I'm going to spend more money so I could
be wrong but I don't expect to see the
ipad pro features coming to a mini
anytime soon yeah if you're happy with
your iPad just hang on to it for as long
as you can but I think he wants a bigger
I feel like he wing it yeah yeah that's
true I'm thinking I think he's compelled
by the new features the ipad pro
probably the true tone display that's
not in my 12 point nine inch ipad pro oh
we know about that one well don't we
don't we we do I've talked about it
every episode um but yeah so if you
really like that just just make the jump
it's honestly I do feel like it's worth
it and the bigger screen is awesome I
roll with a 12.9 dude that's a big one
and its glorious I love that thing it's
probably one of my favorite products in
a long time from Apple that I'm like I
genuinely really like this and i know
i'm in a minority so it's all good
that's cool let's go alright next call
louis from the Bronx hey what's up Lewis
from the Bronx District auction that
with the Google I
the spark home or the google home
everything like that do you think that
Apple would use the beats a speaker next
generation sort of like Alexa or Google
home hybrids or will they just not do
anything with in focus more on software
this year all right look at pockets what
what do you think beach I think it would
be awesome if you were like yo dr. Dre
turn on the lights went on Cirie anymore
you be like yo dr. Drake turn on my
itunes please play some dr dre thanks i
think that'd be awesome so you just be
called like Dre Dre yeah hey Dre high
drive with hi Dre hey Dre hey JJ hey JJ
I think that up again we talked about it
sometimes when we talk about these
stories it just becomes more depressing
to me that Apple is behind on a lot of
this stuff like look google actually has
the voice technology to make to
potentially again make the Google home
really special amazon was first it took
them like three years to establish this
they have all the partnerships apple
doesn't have the best voice recognition
software technology apple also isn't
good at making partners in general they
like to play in their own their own like
walled garden they're not really like
hey come on in let's be a part of this
we've seen in general how hard the smart
home is to conquer because of all these
competing platforms and languages that
these devices use to talk to each other
Apple hasn't been able to wrap their
head around that quite honestly google
has it if anything out of all the
devices amazon it supports the most
smart home devices with that Alexis set
up so i think that apple can try to but
in my mind if they got into the race
right now they would be clearly right
now a third-place contender oh yeah
there would be way behind they would be
third just purely because of the voice
recognition on it Siri has gotten better
but it's still not on the same level as
google and amazon right now has the
advantage of partnerships that could
change with this stuff can always change
but whenever you enter a market you want
to be the top two dogs you don't want to
be number three and right now if Apple
did it they'd be number three and
is this boat they missed the boat and I
don't think that they would be using Dre
Dr Dre branded beats beats head speaker
I don't think that they would be using
that at all would be some sort of Apple
special apple thing you know like I come
in amazon so much and i'm glad that
google gave them props at google i/o
amazon create a product that no one knew
about no one had an idea if it would
resonate they decided to put out it put
it out there they believed in it and
look all of a sudden is starting again
all this momentum of this is the new
smart home assistant this is the new you
know AI interface that we can talk to
and that used to be Apple that came up
with that type of stuff is stuff we
didn't know we wanted and now it's
amazon that did it and i commend them
completely that's awesome according to
this dr. dre video they're working on a
dr dre android let me see what is this i
was just watching this I was trying to
find dr. Dre music and then I see dr.
Dre is an Android here watch this okay
no one can snow one can see this though
there's a lot of people watch the video
oh yeah here he is yeah okay he's just
you know there was a scene right dude it
was just his legs were in shackles he's
doing dips on parallel bars dude oh here
we go yeah see they're working on it ok
this is Apple this is out the Apple
headquarters ok anyway sorry besides
throwing a little segue there hey you
deserve to you the show as yours as much
as his mind so feel free to insert any
non sequitur videos that no one can
watch what they listened oh man but uh
yeah it's disappointing that we haven't
seen that product friend amazon got to
it i can't say it enough I just think
it's all moans way ahead of think I
think it's awesome it's super cool it's
really cool ok next phone call on the
sea jailbreaking illegal oh no it is not
illegal it can't be illegal can it void
your warranty if you brick your phone
and somehow can't bring it back to life
yeah is it risky
is it annoying because you always have
to play the rat race yes we talked about
it all last week but it's not illegal so
if you want to live dangerously young
man jailbreak yes jailbreak it if you
want to live dangerously that's what I'm
saying okay last phone call last call hi
this is stephanie from canada i love the
show keep up the great work i want to
know about the developers conference
because i know it has a high ticket
price what is the benefit what is the
value of attending in person I think
maybe I'm being too optimistic to think
that they give you free samples of
products that they introduced but I'd
love to know what the benefit is of
attending thank you well one of the
benefits is that you can stand up and
clap for Tim Cook when he walks on stage
oh yeah that's why I would register for
WWDC mean person which is very exciting
I mean some guy paid like five hundred
thousand dollars for that charitybuzz
auction to to go have lunch with them in
person yes first of all stephanie way we
got a call two ladies out there Hey
ladies hey lady ladies thank you for
calling and responding to our call to
action Stephanie yeah um but one of the
here's the advantages of WWDC as a
developer first of all there is a
lottery system to get into it so you
can't just sign up and go anymore it's
in such high demand that you have to go
through a lottery process to then have
the ability to buy a ticket I believe
the conference is somewhere like around
a thousand bucks damn I could be wrong
is that I TT days yeah it's one of the
entire convo the other advantages as a
developer there are lots of sessions and
panels that get you inside into the
api's the hooks that Apple is making
open to developers for people to create
apps people to create third-party
products that work with apps it's all
the stuff behind the scenes that we
benefit from for programmers and
engineers so that's really what is also
you can sometimes see new product there
it's always fun to be it like a new
announcement I will admit that it is fun
when the products are cool
if they do a keynote for the next
generation Apple battery case I will be
furious and no one better stand up for
that but um it's fun to be at those
things now we stay here because you know
we're kind of I don't want to say we're
jaded but it's actually we can actually
talk more smack here than we can during
a live keynote yeah and it's right down
the street it is by the CBS I building
and take a look where we work and then
the others yeah that's true and then the
other part of that is they do not give
you any free stuff this is Apple you
might get a t-shirt maybe maybe
Microsoft will give you like a laptop
and a surface and an xbox yeah google
will give you google cardboard and maybe
a chrome yes they've done stuff like
that like they've done tablets in the
past yeah I'm apple notebooks I think
Apple you're lucky to attend your your
actor keynote at their pleasure the
privilege so um you know that's what's
going on but i think that the developers
conference as a developer come on it's
the largest you know one of the uh well
by far the largest app store i want to
see the largest mobile platform that
goes to android but it is the largest
app store where people are making that
money so oh yeah it's good it's cool so
I think that's it that's all that's it
balls thanks for calling from kannada we
appreciate how nada there you go so
again ladies and gentlemen boys and
girls thank you for hanging out with us
at the apple byte extra crunchy we will
be here again next week talking all that
talk all that much all that crunch say
goodbye mr. steven Beecham thanks guys
for watching we'll see you next week and
have a good weekend oh yeah enjoy that
