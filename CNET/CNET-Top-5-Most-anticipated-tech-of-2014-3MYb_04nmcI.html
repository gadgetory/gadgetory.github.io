for all the cool new toys so what's
coming down the pipe Donnell Bell and
today's top five I'll be counting down
the most anticipated tech of 2014
personally picked from our list of over
20 upcoming guidance over on CNET
starting off at number five some good
affordable 4k TVs if you want 4k right
now you're either gonna go broke or go
cheap now the first guy to make a
quality 4k TV that people can actually
afford stands to make a lot of money now
right now the smart bet is on Vizio they
have a P series of 4k TVs due out later
this year starting at $1000 has our
Kelly endorsement written all over it
at number four Faith's tech and call it
wearable tech if that makes you feel
more comfortable but I'm not talking
about cute little bracelets this is tech
for your face we expect to see a second
generation of Google glass later this
year that'll be more than just an
expensive fashion statement hopefully or
if you want to go all-in you should be
able to strap on a consumer ready
version of the oculus rift virtual
reality headset this year all we need
now is some kind of Google smart diaper
and we're ready to enter the matrix
coming in at number three stuff for
gamers I mean beyond the oculus rift
there are two interesting milestones in
gaming in 2014 first we're going to see
the arrival of dedicated steamos
consoles giving some new competition at
Microsoft and Sony we recently saw a
bunch of these themed boxes unveiled at
CES it's gonna be interesting to see if
gamers and game developers actually take
to these we're also gonna see the launch
of PlayStation now this is Sony's
ambitious attempt at virtualized gaming
over an internet connection
this will bring backwards compatibility
to the entire catalog of PlayStation 3
games to a range of internet-connected
Sony products including the PlayStation
4 how well it works and how much it will
cost is still anybody's guess coming in
at second place Android phones and the
best of the worst part about being an
Android fan is that there's always a hot
new phone popping up to make your
current one look like crap
now some of the marquee phones we're
expecting sooner than later are the
Samsung Galaxy s5 the Galaxy Note 4 and
the Google Nexus 6
expect better screens better cameras
faster processors and a new Android OS
that will start with the letter L like
lemon licorice lollipop or something all
right and now the number one most
anticipated tech category of 2014 as
evidenced by fanboy tattoos and lines
around the block Apple stuff love them
or hate them everyone wants to see what
Apple has up their sleeve especially
since this year Apple is due for a major
design refresh of the iPhone the iPhone
6 we're also still on orange alert for
the arrival of an Apple iWatch in the
long rumored Apple TV TV and a new crop
of iPads the thought of all those
products rolling out the same year is
enough to make even the most casual
fanboy wet the bed so there you have it
5 reasons any tech fans should stay
excited for 2014 but for a peek at even
more gadgets you'll see this year check
out our full list over on CNET and for
more top fives from me
