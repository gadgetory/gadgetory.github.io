CNN's live coverage of the Facebook f8
Developers Conference
so CEO Mark Zuckerberg is gonna soon be
giving a keynote presentation revealing
all the new technology that's coming to
the social network as well as what's new
on the Virtual Reality side of the
business with oculus VR but with all the
drama surrounding Facebook these past
few weeks you can be sure the tone is
gonna be a little different at this
year's conference my name is Bridget
Carey and with me to talk about it are
my New York colleagues
Aya's Akhtar and Ben Fox Rubin now
here's what's gonna go down
Facebook is Zuckerberg is gonna be
taking the stage shortly but we're gonna
be broadcasting that feed when he does
before that before his presentation
we're gonna be breaking down what you
can expect and we're also gonna hear
from our reporters at the event on the
ground in San Jose California now if you
want to be part of the conversation hop
on over to Twitter share your thoughts
share your questions and use the hashtag
CNET live all right guys what's your
take on what we're gonna see today we're
gonna see nothing but damage control
jewelry so we've got lots and lots of
stuff that's been going wrong lately for
Facebook in the press you call this this
data breaches you've got fake news
you've got the hashtag delete Facebook
you've got board members leaving you've
got tons of things happening and they
got to figure out a way that to turn
things around because otherwise it's
just gonna be more of the same dour
token seeing and apparently they've
already started with the damage control
before the event has even started Mark
Zuckerberg went on Facebook ahead of
time to say that we've got a new thing
called clear history which essentially
is going to allow you to get rid of more
of your history on Facebook a lot more
easily so it's not just a one-way street
where you add things into Facebook and
have a really hard time deleting them
yeah so like it's to get more into clear
history basically if you had any website
or app that has got your history you can
clear it but it's also not very clear
how yeah I mean it's similar to a web
browser that's that's essentially what
Zuckerberg specifies about this but he
also said that it'll-it'll con
screw up your preferences a little bit
more Facebook's not gonna work the same
way or as easily or maybe you're not
gonna get as many relevant ads as you
had been before if you actually use it
I've got the post up right now in my
laptop because dr. Berg's posting about
the the properly written version as in
the PR news room and they explain this
and take several months to build your
history and then we're looking forward
to doing more and it's not exactly like
it's gonna be fully baked when they
introduce it in about half an hour yeah
well yeah there's there's lots about the
privacy obviously lots of what else what
else have they been doing lately add
there's a new data download tool I've
read about where before you could always
download your data but now they're
giving you more data to download I don't
know if Zuckerberg is even gonna mention
that in his presentation but apparently
there is now you know it's part of that
feeling of I don't have control maybe
you'll feel like you have control if you
get to see more of what advertisers have
on you but I mean then again the clear
history racing is the more control part
yeah a lot of these things I feel remind
people about the scandal with Cambridge
analytical and also the election
meddling it's kind of like giving people
more tools increasing transparency those
are all positives obviously but at the
same time f/8 is a big long commercial
for Facebook so it gives them an
opportunity to really surprise people
and press people hopefully blow them out
of the water with some cool technology
some cool hardware and flip the script
and maybe he's smoking cool don't always
go together they used to a long time ago
now it's just for the old people I think
what is now the old is that yeah about
last year's show I mean what was the big
talk it was around VR and having
Facebook spaces have an avatar of
yourself and have a chat with someone in
VR and there was also some talk about
augmented reality in a camera where you
could do more effects on your phone with
the camera and having little things
float on your camera in whatever you
share but I mean is there gonna be more
of that more more VR talk I mean to make
us feel like it's cool I don't know well
maybe hardware right potentially oculus
right I don't know yes I mean they've
teased the oculus Go already we've tried
it out so there's that scene afternoon
one thing was it game developer Scott
right right about a month ago you know
got a look at it this is the $200
headset we're seeing Scott Stein who got
a chance to check it out
this is one of those you don't have to
put a phone in it and no connection to a
PC so that that's their big sell maybe
we'll get more information it's an
all-in-one devices most cost by $200
Facebook hasn't mentioned when it's
coming out yet and when Scott was
reviewing at least talking about his
hands on it nothing negative to say
about this it seems like at the entry
level device and it doesn't give you as
much freedom as a much fancier rig but a
$200 and your phone's not locked up into
it it seems like a good way to get
people into VR if they're willing to do
it I still think the idea of Facebook
spaces because VR can be so solitary to
have other people with you could be good
but it's still kind of weird it's a
software company this is the most
exciting hardware they got gonna be a
boring show so there is also the
potential of a smart speaker but oh my
god but apparently they've they've
scrapped plans to show off a smart
speaker at this event because of all the
controversies but the idea of them
coming out with something like a smart
speaker I think could be really
interesting particularly because their
social network and a software company so
maybe they would bring something
different to the table it's not exactly
a great time to have a always listening
device for Facebook in your home when
people don't trust them for privacy
right so I'm sure they are kind of pause
on that and put more of a focus on this
whole like can we even trust Facebook
conversation and what would you use a
Facebook smarter speaker for like the
bots would you be able to talk to to it
that way and there's no chat bots have
been a disaster to me I mean it's a
strong it's a strong statement but I
exactly know one uses it it feels
robotic it doesn't bond but you know
yeah but it doesn't it it's missing
something still so are we gonna see that
they made improvements to their bot chat
I you're not really sure yeah I mean in
general I feel like they've been a
little too lacks with their privacy
issues with their privacy controls it
looks like they're at least doing a
better job of trying to firm some of
those things up and I would I would
probably expect Mark Zuckerberg to at
least start with some sort of like make
OPA even though he's been doing a lot of
apology tour stuff already opening up to
eight and talking to the developer
specifically about that that's what
that's what this audience is I think
that would probably be a good starting
point in building from there you know
okay
having developers in the audience this
is supposed to be for them
Facebook just made changes so these app
developers can get less of our
information to sell you know or to get
less about us so they can target ads you
know in different ways not as not as
well targeted I think they're happy
right now I think they want to hear from
Facebook on well if I can't tell what
Bridget likes from all the different
other things she does how am I gonna be
able to target Bridget better you know
or whoever it may be right I've been
reports that some developers are unhappy
with it they don't want to go to the
conference and they're bothering with
this because they can't use the platform
in the way it used to be used but that
should lead into a whole other set of
apps and other developments that we
probably wouldn't have foreseen because
they have to work with with constraints
so maybe these apps will be a little bit
more respectful about privacy but you're
right there are gonna be a lot of
developers who are just ticked that they
cannot make the same kind of moves that
they used to mm-hmm Oh from a consumer
perspective though guys like are you
excited about the hardware that we're
talking about so far like the smart
speaker or oculus go
do you like the privacy tools is this
something that like if Zuckerberg takes
the stage and starts talking about this
kind of stuff with that you know be like
hey that was a pretty good show that was
that these these are good things that
they're actually pushing forward if they
can get me to care about AR in any way I
feel like last year it was like a ho-hum
kind of thing when we saw the AR camera
inside of the Facebook app and that was
just a beta like and then Facebook
spaces I'm not excited about VR I'm just
I'm just kind of going alright that's
cool like I can talk to people virtually
okay thanks well I think in a tuna dog
price point if this it's a starter
that's not a bad entry-level device and
if that thing gets further down to like
149 and 99 dollars at one point with
that problem in here and a half then
people get excited about yeah hundred
dollars I find the into the tech just to
have it around whenever there's a video
to see yeah it's a lot of buy-in do you
have to have this one device and you I
mean you can share it but still a little
weird cuz it's this personal device
that's on your face so I think that's
the biggest problem with VR in general
you know
no phone you have to stick into it right
I like I do like that but yeah
200 is still not quite at the sweet spot
maybe no I'm excited where this is going
I mean if you want VR to go mainstream
at some point you have to have these
entry-level devices come in a price
point that is not as terrifying because
otherwise you're looking at thousands of
dollars if you want to have a rig that
can run HTC vive you can get the vibe at
a certain price but you need a PC for it
not needing a PC or a separate phone
that could get some people but still
prices the price I think we are if
that's where they want to focus on maybe
that's a little bit more targeted for
them it's it's hardware so that could
get people excited but we were talking
before the show about what was it the
2016 f8 where they were presenting this
in Zuckerberg was presenting the site 10
year 20 you've got that road map up in
my laptop right literally literally
including things like that lasers are
here I'm not making this up you got
connectivity drones satellites and
lasers terrestrial solutions telco infra
and free basics right here this is their
plan for two years ago are you gonna
hear a lot of that positive spin about
Facebook connecting the world then we're
doing good forget the Russian trolls we
are connecting the world with laser
beams from airplanes and I don't know
how much they're gonna dwell on that
honestly but I think I think one thing
my ears are gonna be perking up for is
how many ways Zuckerberg is gonna say
that AI computers are gonna solve their
problems that computers have started
which is the whole you know mess really
right now I feel like he wants to throw
more AI at being able to solve the
problems of fake news or or just in
general all the nastiness that we're
hearing about but can more AI fix the
problem just that just ahead of the
event too we saw that they were beta
testing something else right the Zamboni
you're talking about or you know is this
hate speech right okay so so yeah
there's been some reports up where
people are going on their Facebook feed
and they're I think we can throw up some
of the photos too we're on the bottom of
every single post there is a exclamation
mark alert asking does this post contain
speech here's one that someone posted on
Twitter where underneath an ad for going
to the Bahamas there is a does this post
complaint a speech if you have to rely
on everyone you know I mean this is
probably a test that went wrong I don't
know if they're supposed to go live or
not maybe it's just a small test but you
to rely on people just hitting yes or no
and if something they see is hate speech
like man that doesn't seem like a smart
approach you would expect Facebook to do
a much better job with that this seemed
like a very clunky approach to trying to
do something like that like if you're
looking at a baby picture or a picture
of somebody's cat and you have something
this cat well it goes the same with the
up voting and down voting comments this
thing that's being tested now in New
Zealand and Australia where you can just
like on Reddit a vote and down vote a
comment on someone's post are people
gonna be able to use that in the same
way that they do on Reddit they just
gonna down vote things they disagree
with or down vote truly you know things
that aren't great for the conversation
it sounds like being able to just
superpower the echo-chamber a little bit
more like people complain that your
Facebook feed or your Twitter feed is
already an echo chamber of like-minded
people if now you're gonna be down
voting I feel like that might be one of
the negatives out there that is
absolutely a great point because if I go
in and I have friends who disagree with
me politically or whatever it may be and
I want to actually have a conversation
you're just gonna get everyone just
dogpiling on you with down bows not
wanting to have a conversation well the
thing is any of these systems could be
gamed right you can game reddit you can
game this dislike button or not they
want to call just like button down vote
button that's being tested you can game
pretty much anything so the question is
whether they're AI technology's gonna be
able to correct for this or not and I
think Zuckerberg and his testimony had
said to be able to identify a hate
speech and things that shouldn't be on
Facebook would take several years with
AI to get anywhere close which is
reasonable considering there's how much
data being posted per day from regular
people bots and everything else you've
got tons and tons of bad actors good
actors on these on this site and that's
a huge huge responsibility for Facebook
regulate yeah not only that but machines
in general don't understand nuance or
sarcasm sometimes he wants in
conversation that yeah like I had a
friend on Facebook this week
say he got blocked from Facebook because
he was just complaining about something
and he said I hate white people and he
was instant he says oh I've been blocked
for saying this and did he really mean
hate speech against white people I don't
know but a clearly Facebook doesn't know
how to control or know what is what and
it takes a it's it's nuanced yeah
absolutely
not I'm thinking about this remember
YouTube's got a very similar problem
that comes to hate speech and with the
bizarre content being on there for years
copyrighted content all of this stuff
and they had to figure out ways and
they're still figuring it out because as
a platform gets as large as at YouTube
or Facebook you run into this problem
because you can't police everything
knee-jerk like do these three words mean
what I think they mean in this
particular context the video start this
way and in the middle it turns awful
it's gonna take a lot of time I wish you
sensitive n should we not be police you
knit as much I mean is Facebook trying
too hard to police if you can't do it no
I don't think that I think they could be
trying harder and everyone I think that
but the thing is it's just this is this
sounds like I'm being an apologist this
is growing pains they have what 2.2
billion users monthly active users
anybody else would kill to have that
kind of number well maybe not kill but
they would do other things to get that
number and when you reach this critical
mass you have to figure out what you're
doing right so like it's it's gonna be I
think the next generation of humans will
understand that Facebook is not where
they should be going for trusted news
sources unless Facebook has totally
changed in 30 years but assuming that it
survives 30 years so it's just a
learning curve like just you know back
when I was a kid you go to the
supermarket and you see the picture of
the batboy National Enquirer you like
well that's not real monsters nobody
else is not real but nobody's telling
anybody on Facebook this stuff is not as
legitimate as it could be well we do
have someone who is real on the line
right now it's Skype on the floor
we have Lexi's the beauties from seeing
that online calling it from Skype
remember phone alright hi Lexi can hear
us
then how're you guys doing hello from
San Jose from the West Coast views
bright and early here and I am live
inside Facebook F a big developer
conference and there is a lot of people
here it seems like a much bigger crowd
than last year we've actually moved so
last week words in the actual theater
across the road from the Convention
Center this here it's in the convention
center itself much bigger space there's
lots of tables for the press and then
actual developers and attendees in front
of us and all around kind of funny the
you can usually tell the vibe of one of
these conferences by the music that's
being played
so usually it's kind of like dinner
indeed heavy techno house you know
things to ask you off this morning has
been a little bit more mellow and kind
of funny
he also has a team from Mad Men that
that's a song sorry I mean I didn't know
this sort of safe especially after you
know as you know rich Navy but then he's
just sitting over here our Facebook
reported a higher he mention is kind of
funny that that why not given you know
obviously all of the the issues around
advertising and data that's happened who
favor Facebook so it's really
interesting that they chose to play that
song and stand up and give you guys a
little bit of a feel and see if I can
flip the camera it's very bold very very
blue yeah so it's giving everyone a not
so avatar style though here but some
this gives you a bit of a look inside
this a little bit your leash
yeah it's massive and this is this is
like half way down look how far back it
goes I don't know the picture is clear
enough but it's very dark but it goes
all the way back to those blue lights on
the curtain back there so absolutely
huge massive crowd and obviously
everyone here is you know really
thinking what's the first thing that
that market is going to talk about it's
gonna be privacy it's got to be so big
question about about data so I I'm
expecting my
come out and just off the bat start
talking about that because there's
really that's the big question on
everyone's lips like what's he gonna say
so looking forward to that seeing what
he has to say and there's also a lot of
oculus demos lined up around the actual
conference center and in the press room
lots and lots of VR stuff so I'm
assuming there's going to be a big
emphasis on that too during the keynote
do you have like an agenda of like
what's gonna happen after Zuckerberg
talks for the keynote are you going
there any like demos that are on your
like to-do list
sorry there's a lot of things happening
there are a lot of sessions now
unfortunately with a lot of the sessions
you can't take a camera and we're being
told that explicitly so you know
broadcasting from inside the sessions
there's a few on inner artificial
intelligence is those come on oculus
it's all across the board and what
Facebook covers you know news and so on
and live-streaming and broadcasting but
if I go into them it definitely won't be
your reporting live because it's a big
but I'm hoping that there'll be some
cool demos like they were last year we
saw there was Facebook spaces which was
that like avatar in virtual reality I
got to try that loss to you so there's
something like that I'm hoping that just
out in the general areas I'll be able to
get some hands-on time and show you guys
are there any oculus goes on your seat
or to get me checked idea good boy this
is reporting for you everybody yeah and
you say anything 9:00 our notes are
privacy when it to you have that privacy
rights and you gotta know exactly one
thing I do like though just quickly I'll
show you look at this I'm such a geek I
love this how Astrix on the table with
my laptop like look at that seriously
that's a nice touch I think they know
how to make different learners happy I
think I think I've been displaying these
events where there's no power there's no
Wi-Fi and they want to really make it
the press very comfortable and happy and
not complaining exactly well I went on
to LTE because the wife you actually got
really slow so I drove up but I'll see
if I switch back but not video tasks it
seems to be okay but we'll see how we go
when you're in line I mean is everyone
just whispering constantly that you that
you can overhear talking about privacy
or is there any other more excitement
yeah I think or another it's it's really
the hot topic on everyone's lips I mean
obviously as soon as the Facebook noobs
dropped literally like 20 minutes before
we walked into this area about the clear
history I'm clearing your brows that
it's rooted in Facebook and all the data
that's you know used and gathered about
what you're doing from other side that
was a big news like everyone stood have
started going oh did you see what was
drop and say that was big and I'm
assuming that that's going to be a large
part of what mark is going to talk about
in a couple of minutes it's coming up
really soon
sorry yeah as soon as that happened
everyone was like what oh okay
scrambling to kind of you know see what
it was all about and make sure that
everyone had to cover it up well thanks
for giving us a peek inside I am yeah I
guess we're all looking forward to what
other kind of demos I think when you did
space book spaces last year that was
pretty cool cuz you got to like change
your hair and stuff I don't know what
they're gonna be doing now but I'm a
software side but I guess we'll wait and
see when we're done we're gonna come
back to you too to see what else they
got going on right sounds good yeah I'll
talk to you guys after the keynote and
enjoy the shart okay thanks Lexi bye
very blue Big Blue Room not too somber
it's just blue what are they calling
yeah and there's a lot of people in that
room and there's gonna be tons and tons
of viewpoints and opinions based on
whatever Zuckerberg says he's been
watched so closely in the past no recent
memory let alone all the rest of his
life this point he's got to come out
when I see a sock Roboto we're gonna see
a more friendly Zuckerberg what do we
thinking we're gonna screw this chance
to be friendly during the I don't know I
have my opinions but during the
congressional hearings yeah there were
so many easy ways for him to crack a
smile or to make a joke or just be at
ease after hours and he was just still
the stiff guy so maybe have some jokes
written in his script I mean last year
he made some jokes about like Fast and
the Furious FA you know movie coming out
and it was kind of like and so he's
never really one to joke I guess he's
not yeah this is this is a little bit
this is much more scripted and it's much
more his own place like he he
created this house and he's the boss in
it so I feel like he's generally more
comfortable in this type of situation
than obviously a congressional hearing
where he's getting a lot all sorts of
questions about like how did you create
this company that's now this world plus
he's also like everyone in attendance
gets Facebook and I said he has enough
to explain the internet to everyone and
to a certain extent a lot of people want
to see it succeed they want to see him
succeed these developers they make money
off of the platform and they want to see
it continue to grow so in that to that
extent I think that you're probably
going to see Zuckerberg show off you
know be out on his own to as best as he
can be he never really to me ever came
off as being you know kind of the the
somebody that you would go and have a
beer with but at the same time a very
interesting experience as he orders a
beer that he's killed himself
[Laughter]
very odd mark Mark Zuckerberg new years
challenges where he does all kinds of
bizarre things yes yeah in case in case
of no one's getting anything good he
does actually hunt and eat his own food
that he does that one year yeah I don't
know if he still does it yeah so it was
big deal I I did want to mention one
point going back to what you had
mentioned about the 2.2 billion monthly
active users Facebook financially is
doing great you know they came out with
their first quarter earnings and you
know the numbers are all looking really
fantastic so despite all these concerns
that we're talking about from the
dollars and cents perspective this
company is very healthy very strong and
it's not going anywhere anytime soon not
going anywhere but are people's
attitudes and how they're using it
changing anecdotally people I know all
my friends they still have Facebook but
I hear more and more and I delete it off
my phone and I only use it when I'm at
the computer I don't really upload my
family photos and that as much I'd
rather and do it on Instagram so are you
watching as much on a video that's where
they want to make money that's where
they want to grow are people watching
Facebook video as long or they just
scrolling seen the news moving on to
another network it's funny that you say
that they go to Instagram that's what I
did to off of Facebook but I'm not
really off of Facebook I'm at Instagram
which is also Facebook so this
because it's another there's an
alternative but also that was at the
hearings what our Facebook's competitors
and it's like Instagram but you own
Instagram so that's fine
they have another alternative is that
even if you really hate the proper
Facebook experience you can go to
Instagram and just have all of these
beautiful pictures and video ads there
too or just videos there so they have
enough options that you don't want any
of that go to whatsapp and you go I'll
just talk to you guys wait that's also
Facebook somewhere else
Bridgette I said say your friends are a
bunch of liars but I would probably say
a lot of people love to hate Facebook
and they say publicly oh I deleted it
off my phone or I don't use it as much
but I think that their own personal
experience is very different so the
hashtag delete Facebook move Ben I don't
really see that as having a material
impact on the company in any way because
Facebook got really good at being
addictive people like going on there and
just going through the newsfeed so they
do not like it they don't know why
they're doing it but they're doing it
because we're hooked right and so yeah
that was our conversation earlier this
year what responsibility do these
companies have to help us not be so
addicted to our phones I think Facebook
doesn't have to address that at all with
everything else that they're doing you
can put the phone now just put this over
your eyes yeah that'll help okay not a
problem we got this wait you know we got
the tech for your face so you can put
down the Facebook right okay put the
face back in the face that's the whole
point but so well monthly active user
numbers includes people who log in using
Facebook right so you don't necessarily
have to even go to this site I don't
like apps when you log in with your app
like Instagram as well so so even if
people say I'm not using Facebook they
still might be using Facebook yes
yeah and that's how they get such a big
number I mean 2.2 billion just from from
a broad perspective what is that that's
one in three people in the world
yeah which from a platform perspective
is staggering they're probably not gonna
grow as quickly as they used to but at
the same time that's it's incredible to
think about how many people have been or
go on Facebook or use Facebook services
or log in with Facebook on any given
month so yeah they have an enormous
amount of power and with that comes an
enormous amount of spider-man
responsibilities Thank You Uncle Ben hey
everybody you know okay so where were we
last year people were talking about
Facebook and the fake news problem after
the election will Zuckerberg addressed
this and you know what he kind of
touched on it and just moved right along
and and kept things upbeat but things
haven't changed that much people you
know are still using Facebook like
you're saying you know oh it's just a
bunch of complaining that they you know
they are they feeling pressure at all
that if if nothing's changing on them on
the numbers side where's the pressure I
think there is some pressure still there
is the controversies I would argue have
gotten worse the election trolling
situation was obviously bad Cambridge
analytic blew up for Facebook in in a
much more significant way this was the
first time that Mark Zuckerberg ever had
to do congressional hearings so there is
a lot of pressure on the company to make
changes we're seeing that with clear
history that is something that they were
probably loathe to do for a really long
time because they love gobbling up your
data and they'd rather keep it for a
really really long time so we are seeing
some changes in facebook it'll be
interesting to see if they continue if
they keep this up or they just do just
enough to you know move on from the
controversy there's many things to get
to get the generation that has always
been on Facebook to want to participate
more and not just passively read because
if you get people who just log on scroll
and leave that weakens the relationship
yeah reason playing why they have to
download button potentially yeah you're
gonna have these changes is this hate
speech and they're actually bringing you
into the process maybe that'll get you
to participate but I mean it's it's a
massively large platform and they've got
to forget what they're gonna do with
that but 2.2 billion people that's what
else can you do
at some point you'd be like okay that's
enough humans that's it never enough
that's why they were developing the
lasers in the first place they were
gonna bring you the Internet to the
developing world with airplanes with
airplanes and way to grow is to give the
Internet to places they don't have
internet yeah like remote access areas
that they look like on on phones that
can't hand
this this massive app that I have on my
iPhone the six apps that have a
messenger camera Facebook Instagram I I
think that ultimately they're not going
to talk about these big world gobbling
concepts this was affirmed two years ago
before all the scandals happened and
that's probably why they didn't move
forward with doing the smart speaker
because of the privacy concerns so a
more humble approach but you know the
Zuckerberg did recently kind of say his
focus was gonna be more about
communities right he says you know what
to fix the problems of Facebook we want
to focus more on you know the little
network that you have with your
neighborhood the little knitting network
you have or this motorcycle enthusiasts
Club and and that that's the way you're
gonna grow that interaction so while
we're talking about how we're annoyed
what we see on our feet as we scroll by
but maybe you'll care more about that
small group of ten to twenty people that
are really into that one interest you
have so I wonder how much we're gonna
hear about communities talk considering
that was his priority he talked about a
couple months ago hmm definitely I know
are you in communities like those are
the ones that I'm actually in no but I
use whatsapp for that stuff all the time
so it goes back to the point that we
were making before that even if you're
not using Facebook proper for some of
these things Facebook did a really good
job of gobbling up some of its
competitors so it's really hard to
socialize on the internet without
actually using their you know universe
of apps unless you were on Google+ I
guess alright guys I just got word from
my producer new development f8 comm is
down oh god is it yeah so it looks like
the page for this conference yeah I'm
also seeing this one down you're stuck
with us for a little bit longer than
people maybe they're getting the feet
ready because it was supposed to go live
right now it's good it's it's just it's
this is what you're seeing arrow 503
yeah I'm pretty good about about how
Facebook can handle you know all of our
data somehow reminds my CES we had to
see that's blackout and now this I'm
gonna check this on my phone too all
right well when this does get back up
the game plan is that Zuckerberg is
gonna take the stage and we will
throw to that feed when that happens
it's supposed to go for about 90 minutes
and then stick with us and while you're
like watching you know share your
thoughts on Twitter with the hashtag see
net live tell us what your questions are
your comments as it goes on because as
soon as it ends we're gonna come back
here and digest it all and and take your
question are there any questions so far
in the feed right now there's one do you
think that Facebook will take more
control of fake news from Joseph more
control of fake that's what he says it's
like choosing what is or isn't fake news
that's a touchy little area because if
you start saying what isn't isn't news
then you become more of a media company
and that you're trying not to have the
the label media company because then you
have to undergo more regulations mm-hmm
more scrutiny yeah I think they've
already talked a lot about trying to do
initiatives from around fake news and
partnering with media companies so they
themselves don't have to do it directly
so I would expect maybe they won't touch
on that I think that my expectation is
is they're gonna touch a lot on the
privacy concerns they've already primed
the audience for that with clear history
and some of the other things are they
gonna go on fake news to I don't know
like that's that's like a lot for people
about a negative - exactly I want to
keep it positive right didn't we say
Google does something similar like it's
actually create like a consortium that
can validate and just have like a little
tag so Facebook necessarily isn't being
the one to judge what's fake or not it
would be this consortium and they could
have a little like a verified check oh
yeah this is from the consortium said
this is real which I think that would be
probably smarter for them so they don't
have to deal with the intricacies of
being a media company right right you
know
then again Google still gets a lot of a
lot of complaints and flak for the fact
that they have an algorithm that can be
works like you said before they know
that is still picking and choosing what
is hot and what is not on the top of
your feet so you can have that
consortium but so Zuckerberg might
actually be able to avoid talking about
too many negatives by just doing like a
catch-all type of situation to say that
you know we have these tools and we
would send them out into the public I
think
going live so I guess the websites
working again but alright we're gonna go
right now to Zuckerberg he's talking at
the f8 conference it's going to last 90
minutes and stick with us hashtag scene
that life is not the future we have real
challenges to address but we have to
keep that sense of optimism - and what
I've learned this year is that we need
to take a broader view of our
responsibilities it's not enough to just
build powerful tools we need to make
sure that they're used for good and we
will and we're idealistic and you know
we've always focused on all the good
that connecting people can bring and
there's a lot of it just since the last
f8 and we've seen the me2 movement and
the March for our lives organized at
least part on Facebook we've seen people
come together after hurricane Harvey to
raise more than 20 million dollars for
relief and we've seen more than 80
million small businesses use these tools
to grow and create jobs but we've also
seen people try to use these tools for
harm and that goes for Russia
interfering and elections for fake news
for hate speech and for data privacy
issues so we're investing a lot to
address these issues and keep people
safe and I'm gonna go through all that
head-on in just a minute because I think
it's important that everyone here knows
exactly what we're doing to address them
but we also have a responsibility to
move forward on everything else that our
community expects from us - to keep
building services that help us connect
in meaningful new ways as well you know
the hardest decision that I made this
year wasn't to invest so much in safety
and security that decision was easy
right I just went to the people who are
running those teams and asked them how
much we could possibly invest
productively and then I transferred all
those people to them the hard part was
figuring out a way to move forward on
everything else that we need to do - you
know recently I was having a
conversation about what Facebook stands
for what is that basic idea
that the world would lose if Facebook
went away but when I was getting started
with Facebook back in 2004 what struck
me was you could go online at that time
and find almost anything or you could
look up any information you could find
any product you could read news you
could download movies and music you
could find almost anything except for
the thing that matters to us most people
so I started building a service to do
that to put people first and at the
center of our experience with technology
because our relationships are what
matters most us now that's how we find
meaning and how we make sense of our
place in the world now we're not the
only ones to build a communication
service but we are the ones who do it
again and again in all of the different
ways that people want to interact online
this is our DNA and we have built and
grown service after service that put
people and our connections our
relationships at the center of the
experience and we've come a long way but
what I look out today it still surprises
me how little of the technology that our
industry produces is designed to put
people first our phones are still
designed around apps that's not that we
think that I believe that we need to
design technology to help bring people
closer together and I believe that
that's not going to happen on its own
and so to do that part of the solution
they're just part of it is that one day
more of our technology is going to need
to focus on people and our relationships
now there's no guarantee that we get
this right and this is hard stuff we
will make mistakes and they will have
consequences and we will need to fix
them but what I can guarantee is that if
we don't work on this the world isn't
moving in this direction by itself so
that is what we are all here to do and
that's why I want to talk about today I
want to start by talking about keeping
people safe
and then we're going to discuss all the
things we're doing to keep building
services to help us connect in
meaningful new ways and I want to start
today by talking about protecting
something that is really incredibly
important to all of us and that is the
integrity of our elections
in 2016 we were slow to identify Russian
interference we expected more
traditional cyber attacks like phishing
and Malware and hacking and we
identified those and notified the right
people but we didn't expect these
coordinated information operations and
large networks of fake accounts that
were now aware of so I sat down with our
teams after this and we said we will
never be unprepared for this again and
since then there have been important
elections like the French presidential
election the German elections the
Alabama Senate special election last
year and we've been more prepared we
deployed new AI tools that successfully
identified and took down tens of
thousands of fake accounts before they
could do anything we've traced the fake
account network back to Russia and taken
down their network we're doing more
we're requiring everyone requiring a
running political and issue ads or
running large pages to be verified with
a government ID we're making ads more
transparent so now you're gonna be able
to see who is running a political ad who
they're targeting how much they're
spending and most importantly what other
messages they're sending to different
people that is a higher standard of
transparency than TV ads then print ads
or anything else you will find on the
internet by the end of this year we will
have 20,000 people working on security
and content review at Facebook and we've
created an independent election research
commission so independent academics can
give us ideas and hold us accountable to
make sure that these systems work now
this is an important election year and
not only the big us midterms that are
coming up with their major elections
around the world in Mexico and Brazil
there are elections coming up in India
and Pakistan and more and we are focused
on this
beyond elections we are focused on
fighting fake news more broadly and
there are really three categories that
were focused on here the first category
is just spam right these are people who
aren't ideological they just want to
make money and a hucking the most
sensational junk that they can come up
with to get you all to click on it these
are the people in the 90s would have
been sending you viagra emails and the
PlayBook here is pretty simple right
it's to take down their ads on their
sites the kamek money build tools to
detect and reduce the distribution to
remove their economic incentive and then
eventually they just go do something
else to go make money and you know we're
starting to to see this the second
category is fake accounts and the idea
here is is less focused on looking at
the content specifically and more
focused on trying to find bad actors and
getting them off the network so some of
this is nation-states who are
politically motivated like we talked
about before but all of this were
fighting in the same way with AI tools
with thousands of content reviewers and
verifying people who are running large
pages and running sensitive ads now the
third category is people real people who
are just sharing provably false hoaxes
and the PlayBook here is building tools
to get better at flagging content that
is going viral so fact checkers can look
at it so we can show it less and for the
people who do see it to make sure that
they see related articles that are more
accurate that put this in context so
people can understand what's really
going on so a lot of the work over the
last year and a half has been bringing
on more and more fact-checking partners
all around the world in different
countries who speak all of the different
languages that we need to cover there's
a lot more here to do but these are the
three basic categories and we're making
good progress on all of them I also want
to talk about data privacy and what
happened with Cambridge analytic I was a
major breach of trust an app developer
took data that people had shared with
them and sold it so we need to make sure
that this never happens
so we're taking a number of steps here
first as you all know we're restricting
the data that developers will be able to
request from people now the good news
here is that back in 2014 we already
made a major change to how the platform
works to prevent people from sharing a
lot of their friends information so this
specific situation could not happen
again today and since then we've taken a
lot more steps as well to restrict other
data but there's still more steps that
we're taking to do this even further
with groups and events and the data
available through log in to prevent
future issues that might come up second
we need to make sure that we find any
other bad apps that are out there so
we're currently in the process of
investigating every single app that had
access to a large amount of people's
information before we made these big
changes in 2014 and if we find anything
suspicious now we're gonna bring in
independent auditors to do a full audit
and if any data was misused then we'll
ban that developer and we will tell
anyone whose data was affected we've
also started putting a tool in front of
everyone that shows them all of the apps
that they are using and lets them easily
remove access to the ones that they no
long I want to use and with the GDP are
coming up in Europe we're asking
everyone around the world not just in
Europe to review your privacy controls
so to all the developers who are here I
know that the vast majority of you were
focused on building good things we need
to take these steps to make sure that
everyone on our platform is focused on
building good things and I believe that
putting in these stronger protections
now we'll give you more ability to keep
building for the long term now I also
want to share one new thing that we're
working on with data privacy and we have
a lot more updates like this coming but
this is an example of the kind of thing
that we are working on in your web
browser you today have a simple way to
clear your cookies and clear your
browsing history and the idea is that a
lot of sites need this data to work you
need cookies but you should have the
ability to go in and clear your history
at any point that you want so we're
working on
version of this for Facebook too it's a
simple control where you can clear your
browsing history what you've clicked on
the websites you visited and so on and
we're gonna call it clear history and
we're starting with something that a lot
of people have asked about recently and
that's the information that we get from
websites and apps who are using
Facebook's advertising and analytics
tools so you can you're gonna be able to
use this tool to see the information
about the apps and websites you've been
directed with you'll be able to clear
all this information from your account
and you'll even be able to turn it off
having this information stored with your
account going forward now to be clear
and when you clear your cookies in a
browser it can make parts of your
experience worse or you may have to sign
back into dozens of websites may have to
reconfigure some things and the same is
gonna be true here or your Facebook
won't be quite as good while it
relearn's your preferences but after
going through our systems this is the
kind of control that we think that
people should have so we're building
this and we're gonna have a lot more
like this to talk about soon
so overall we're going to keep investing
heavily in security and privacy but
security isn't a problem that you ever
fully solve this is norms race and we're
gonna be working to stay ahead of our
adversaries forever so while we're doing
this we also have a responsibility to
keep building services that bring people
together in new ways now if you've been
to f8 before you've seen this this is
our 10-year product roadmap and it sets
out all the different areas that we're
working on and when we expect these
ecosystems to be fully developed and
across all our products our goal is to
give everyone in the world the power to
share anything they want with anyone
anywhere and to build stronger
relationships to break down Geographic
barriers and to meet new people and
interact in new ways we have a lot to do
here so we are going to focus on keeping
built and we're gonna keep building even
while we focus on keeping people safe
and we're going to talk about what we're
gonna be doing across the rest of the
family of apps for the rest of today so
let's start with the Facebook app like
all of you we want to build something
that's not just fun to use but is good
for people so we've got a lot of
research to understand what parts of the
internet and social media are good for
our well-being and which parts aren't
and the summary is that when you're
using the Internet to interact and to
build relationships than that is
associated and correlated with all of
the positive aspects of well-being that
you'd expect a better long-term health a
better long-term happiness feeling more
connected feeling less lonely and so on
but when you're just using the internet
to consume content passively whether
it's video or news then that is not
associated with these same benefits to
well-being and we've heard this feedback
from a lot of people too you know people
want Facebook to be about friends and
interacting with people so we're going
to do that and I'm going to talk about a
few new ways that were
just on taking the experience and in
this direction we're rolling out
something that we call watch party which
lets you watch video and chat with your
friends so you know let's say that your
friend is testifying in Congress for
example now you're gonna be able to
bring your friends together and you can
laugh together and you can cry together
some of my friends actually did this
let's not do that again anytime soon
people often tell us the groups are the
most meaningful part of Facebook you
know you can feel like you belong in a
community you can meet you people who
share your values for some people this
might be a support group for new parents
for others it might be about a disease
you have for others it might be about
finding people to come together and
volunteer with and people want to be a
part of meaningful communities so today
we're launching a new groups tab to make
groups more central to the overall
Facebook experience so for me I'm gonna
have all my groups in one place my
family group my running group my game
group my sheepdog appreciation groups
all in one place now to help more people
grow their communities we're building a
joined group button and plug-in that
admins and developers can add to their
websites and and their emails you know
this is important because a lot of what
we need to do to help more meaningful
groups form is just give more tools to
creators every great community has
engaged leaders so a lot of what we need
to do is just give more people the tools
to be community leaders all right now
talking about meaningful relationships
did you know that one in three marriages
in the United States start online and I
can't tell you how many times I'll be
walking down the street in some City and
a couple
come up to me and they'll say that they
met on Facebook and sometimes they have
their kids with them and they'll just
point to them and they'll they'll say
thank you I have to say I mean these are
these are some of the moments that I'm
really proud of what we're doing right I
know that we're making a positive
difference in in people's lives but you
know the reality is today we haven't
even built any features to help people
find partners and there are 200 million
people on Facebook who list themselves a
single so clearly there's something to
do here and if we're focused on helping
people build meaningful relationships
then this is perhaps the most meaningful
of all so today we are announcing a new
set of features coming soon around
dating
now this is gonna be there's gonna be
for building real long-term
relationships all right not just hookups
it's gonna be in the Facebook app but
it's totally optional its opt-in if you
want you can make a dating profile and
and I know a lot of you are gonna have
questions about this so I want to be
clear that we have designed this with
privacy and safety in mind from the
beginning your friends aren't gonna see
your profile you're only gonna be
suggested people who are not your
friends who have opted into dating who
fit your preferences although I can't
promise that you're gonna get emai it's
a tough world all right Chris Cox will
come up in a bit and walk you through
this in more detail because I want to
make sure that you all see all the
details here that we've built in around
privacy and safety but the bottom line
is we want Facebook to be somewhere
where you can start meaningful
relationships
so we're excited to start rolling this
out soon now another way to help people
connect in new ways is through commerce
or we started building marketplace
because we saw that one of the most
popular uses for groups was building
these buy and sell groups so people
would start groups like Bay Area moms
buy and sell where people would be able
to come together and ask for advice on
all the gear they needed and meet people
who are like them and can ultimately buy
and sell things with people who they
have something in common with and
marketplace is now live in more than 70
countries more than 800 million people
around the world to use it monthly
including more than 1 in 3 people on
Facebook in the US so this is starting
to be a pretty big deal and it's helping
people learn more income and connect in
a new way
all right so this is Facebook we are
focused on helping people build
relationships with friends and family
groups and meeting and interacting with
new people now let's talk about
Instagram so our focus here is helping
people capture any moment they want and
come together around shared
interests some of the best stories that
we hear are around ad hoc communities
that spring up on Instagram and more
than 200 million people use Explorer on
Instagram every day since we launched
hashtag following and just last December
more than 100 million people now follow
hashtags so we want to make it even
easier to find the communities for the
things that you're interested in so
we're launching a completely new design
for Explorer that is going to organize
the content around topic channels now so
now your Explorer is gonna be even more
focused on the things you're interested
in we're also focused on new ways that
people are going to be able to use
Instagram to communicate and build
stronger relationships so it turns out
that a lot of people are using live
video basically just to hang out when
you can't be physically together or it's
amazing how much of all of our use of
these social tools is just to get as
close to feeling like we're there with
someone when we can't physically be
there so today to make this easier we're
announcing video chat and Instagram
you're gonna be able to just tap on a
new camera icon right in the the top of
any direct thread that you have and
you're gonna build a video chat one on
water with groups you're gonna be able
to minimize the video while you're
chatting and using Instagram and and I
think that this is gonna be a really big
deal and people are really gonna like
this we are also building more creative
ways for people to share an Instagram
Anna last year at f8 we announced the AR
camera effects platform and today we're
bringing it to Instagram
so now anyone is gonna be able to build
face filters and effects when you go to
your camera you're gonna be able to see
effects that are relevant to you and
from the accounts that you follow if
you're browsing stories and you see a
cool effect you always be able to try it
on so we're excited to get this in
people's hands soon alright now let's
talk about whatsapp so here our focus is
on building new ways for people to
connect privately with close friends and
and and groups and businesses now before
we dive in here I just want to say
yesterday Yong Kim the founder of
whatsapp announced that he is is leaving
us and moving on and I just want to take
a moment to thank you on because Yong
has done an amazing job building
whatsapp he has been a tireless advocate
for privacy and encryption a lot of you
probably don't know this so remember
this but what's up joined us in 2014 we
actually hadn't rolled out full
end-to-end encryption yet Jana and I
talked about how to do this together and
one of the things that I'm most proud of
is that we have built the largest fully
encrypted communication network in the
world and this would not have happened
without Yan and I am deeply grateful for
the work that he has done so please join
me in thanking all right now video
calling is also one of the most popular
features on whatsapp already you know
what I'm traveling and I can't be there
to put my girls to bed at night it's
really nice to just be able to see their
face and talk to them and a lot of
people agree right around the world
people are already making more than 2
billion minutes of voice and video calls
on what's up alone and today we're
announcing that we're bringing group
video calling to whatsapp soon to
all right I want to talk about stories
for a minute
so across our whole family we really got
all in on stories as a format for being
able to quickly share video and photos
throughout your day and you know in each
of the apps that we've launched it it's
it's evolved to be somewhat different
but it's it's growing quickly Instagram
was the first to really take off here
Facebook started a lot slower but it's
now starting to grow quickly too and do
well but whatsapp has been by far the
biggest of these products more than 450
million people are used whatsapp status
every day and it's growing really
quickly so the next phase for whatsapp
beyond just communicating with your
friends and family is gonna be helping
people connect with businesses as well
and you know today and a lot of people
don't want to call businesses or you
just wanna be able to text that's a a
really big shift in how we all
communicate and I think that's just
gonna be a really big deal here so
earlier this year and we launched What's
Up business to let small businesses
create a presence on whatsapp and give
them some tools for messaging and
already in just a few short months more
than 3 million people we're already
using whatsapp business and it's growing
really quickly so now the next step is
going to be giving large businesses
tools to be on whatsapp - and we're
working on this now for Messenger we are
focused on building richer ways for
people to connect privately with their
friends and family and businesses - and
when you're messaging you really want a
simple and fast experience so we're
taking this moment to completely
redesign messenger to focus on these
ideas and here's what the new messenger
is going to look like it's clean it's
gonna be fast and David is gonna come
and talk about this in a bit more detail
and in just a little bit now I mentioned
earlier that we are bringing the AR
camera effects platform to Instagram and
we're also bringing
this to the messenger platform as well
it's going to be a really fun way for
people who use augmented reality to
connect with their family and friends
privately and in real time now I don't
know about you guys but um but my
daughter's what um what I call them when
I'm traveling you know they they love
these effects right
Priscilla will be there and Max look mom
my dad has a bunny or an ogre all right
we're seeing good momentum for messenger
business too with more than 300,000 BOTS
and businesses now using these tools and
you know people are sending more than 8
billion messages between messages sorry
between businesses and in people every
month all right so that's messenger all
right so now let's go beyond our apps
for a minute and talk about virtual
reality and the future so our goal here
is to create this real feeling of
presence right like you're right there
with someone even if they're halfway
around the world and you know this idea
of being physically your being feeling
like you're there with some even you
can't physically be there some we've
talked about a lot today with video chat
but over the long term virtual reality
and eventually augmented reality are
gonna take this to a completely
different level or it's not just gonna
be about you know being able to see
someone's face on a on a small screen
I'm you're gonna actually be able to
feel like you're there with someone so
here's an example of how compelling I
think that this is going to be you know
now if you have some photos from your
childhood home we can now use computer
vision to fill in the gaps with this
pointillism effect and recreate the
rooms of your childhood home where you
grew up so you're gonna vote to go into
VR with your family and visit and feel
like you were right there it feels like
you're in a dream it is wild so this
work of mapping out immersive spaces is
just another important step on the path
to creating this real feeling of
presence
now in addition to software you know
we're all building hardware so we've
been preparing oculus go for launch and
the big news I have to share today is
oculus co is shipping today starts at
$1.99 it is the first really affordable
standalone virtual reality headset it's
launching with more than a thousand apps
and it has the highest quality lenses
and optics that we have ever built into
a VR device oculus co is going to me
it's the easiest way to get into VR and
we think that this is going to be how a
lot of people experience virtual reality
and virtual presence for the first time
and to make sure that all of you get to
experience this to everyone at f/8 is
getting a free oculus go
we're excited about that too all right
all right so this is how we are thinking
about our responsibility to keep people
safe and also to keep building we're
here to build things that bring people
together and to put people in our
relationships at the center of our
experience with technology where they
belong because for all the challenges
that we face today the vast majority of
what happens on these services is people
getting closer to the people they care
about even when time or distance get in
the way and we can help more people do
this whether it's reaching out to a
friend that you lost touch with or
finding a group to belong to or just
sending a video to your sister of your
kids the best part of what you do isn't
on Facebook it's the relationships you
build and what you can go do together
that is what this is all about so if you
believe like I do that giving people a
voice is important that building
relationships is important that creating
a sense of community is important and
that doing the hard work of trying to
bring the world closer together is
important that I say this we will keep
building
we need to keep this idea alive and that
is what we are all here at f/8 to do
together so yes this is an important
moment we need to do more to keep people
safe and we will but we also need to
keep building and bringing the world
closer together thank you for coming out
today thank you for everything you're
doing to bring people together have a
great update all right let's talk about
dating actually one of the great ironies
for me is that when a lot of us join the
very first version of the service in
2004 back when it was just a handful of
college students we were convinced that
dating would be the next feature
Facebook was gonna add after all all the
college kids were finally in one place
so it turns out you were right just 14
years too early so I first wrap my head
around what Facebook was gonna be in
2005 when I went into the early office
to interview for a job as an engineer
this is 156 University Avenue and High
Street the founders and a handful of
engineers had moved out there to try and
find some more folks to join their team
and I wasn't sure I wanted to work there
but I really wanted to meet mark so I
decided I'd go in there and interview
for a job and I remember the office when
I got inside was very frenetic energy it
was sort of like a plane ascending to
new altitudes with the engine and the
wings shaking and here you had the small
team of engineers trying to keep
everything running and I liked that
anyway mark wasn't there that day Justin
Timberlake was not there either
but instead I met Dustin Facebook's
co-founder Dustin Moskovitz our head of
engineering and I immediately liked him
he was humble he was smart and he took a
moment out of his busy day keeping this
engineering team running to take me into
a corner office and begin to explain to
me where they were going and he drew for
me a picture on a whiteboard of a graph
and I thought he was going to give me
like the Traveling Salesman problem and
I was gonna write code but instead he
starts talking about this idea that the
way they see Facebook is the seed of a
collaboratively created directory of
people and it's authentic it's
up-to-date
it's interconnected so like Wikipedia
you can explore people and things
through their relationships with each
other each person is responsible for
their own representation and we think it
could grow beyond college and I found
that idea very simple and elegance and
it began to get the gears turning for me
maybe I should check this place out and
that was really the founding idea of the
company for years each year the company
would identify a set of barriers to take
down to allow more folks to use the
service so in 2005 high school in 2006
other English speakers in 2007 a
crowd-sourced translation tool going up
to 2017 how do we make this thing work
on a Nokia c3 on a 2g network in Delhi
at night an adversarial networking
condition and each time we've launched
in a new country or a new place we've
learned that Facebook wants to be
something different in Indonesia we
learned Facebook wanted to be a
marketplace in Thailand we learned about
the importance of helping small
entrepreneurs scale businesses and reach
new people in Egypt we learned about
Facebook as a political tool the other
thing we've learned as the network has
scaled is that people want
specialisation in the tools that they
use for different groups so for the
closest people to us our family we want
message in your parents your kids your
siblings your significant other for me
this is a message thread with lots of
baby photos and the occasional spat
the same is true for your close friends
the six or seven people that you rely
upon on your worst day the people you're
constantly in touch with the average
person on our messaging services sends
80% of their messages to five people and
a lot of those messages are just a one
person their best friend or significant
other so messaging is going to do a lot
for us but the most important thing to
focus on is how it keeps us connected
with the people who matter to us most so
David and Mubarak are gonna be up here
to talk about that a bit more going
further out all of our friends is really
what Facebook and Instagram do most well
is helping us stay connected with
hundreds of people now on Facebook last
year we began to hear that the influx of
video and public media and content into
the system was drowning out what people
wanted the most which was not to miss
thing from friends and that's why we
announced a big grant can change in
January which will help people make sure
that they don't miss stories from
friends and from the publishers they do
see will prioritize publishers that are
trusted that are informative that are
local and then are inspiring
conversations between people the
emerging research on well-being and
Facebook tells us that Facebook is
better when it's about conversations not
just passing time which is what we're
committed to and then at the story level
we've gone through each component to
understand how we can inspire a better
conversation so again you'll see more
things from friends and more things from
publishers that are trusted informative
and local when people see articles from
publishers they don't recognize we're
making it a lot easier for them to go in
there and understand where the story is
coming from when was the publisher
founded where are they based what are
some of the other pieces they've written
recently what are some pieces from other
trusted sources on that same topic and
how has the article traveled through
Facebook we hope this helps people make
better judgments and determinations
about what they can trust we're also
looking at improving the quality of
public conversations it turns out good
old-fashioned up voting and down voting
look like they close the
gap between comments that have invoked a
lot of emotion but may not be civil so
we're gonna be rolling this out as
quickly as we can to improve the quality
of the conversations that are happening
among lots of people on the platform now
the up thanks so the other big trend
that Mark talked about is the format of
right now it's pull not push it goes
away and it's the aspect ratio of the
phone so it feels like you're in the
hand of the viewer we've noticed that
the growth here is just really insane
here you see two trends the first is the
increase in sharing of any visual media
and then the second is that the stories
format is on a path to surpass feeds as
the primary where people share stuff
with their friends sometime next year
on Facebook we're focused on the unique
things Facebook does well in this format
so groups how about a group of parents
whose kids are playing soccer together
have a collaborative story where they
can have their own video diary of the
game events making sure that friends at
a concert can have a collaborative
format for for sharing that experience
together video clipping is something
people love to do on Facebook so we're
gonna make it easy for people to grab
the moment or the frames that they love
the most and then add their own
commentary so that it's personal things
like profile photos people should be
able to create nice stories about them
and then birthdays instead of all of us
writing on your wall to wish you a happy
birthday
how about we pull together over the
course of the day a photo and video reel
which you then received as a package at
the end saying happy birthday again
focusing on the unique strengths of the
Facebook platform when applied to this
format the other thing we're seeing is a
huge amount of stories coming from the
camera roll screenshots especially of
music and this is a rather tedious
process to create these and then when
you're seeing them it's kind of annoying
to go find the song and that's why we're
so excited today to announce a third
party stories integration so that any
app developer can
immediately share to their stories on
Facebook or Instagram the platform of
their choice so it'll work like this
you're on Spotify you're listening to
your favorite song you decide you want
to tell your friends about it you choose
Instagram or Facebook the platform of
your choice
you can right there in line add some art
make it look the way you feel and then
on the consumption side when you see it
you can drop right in there and then
there's a deep link into the song so you
can start listening right away I can see
myself doing this with an entire mix
with a run from my favorite running app
from GoPro videos anything that you love
to do making it easy to quickly share a
moment from that experience that's
relevant out to other people so this is
launching in beta starting today and
we're excited to see what you all build
ok so that's what we're doing to help
people share with friends groups like
Mark talked about is the next layer out
where some really interesting stuff is
happening on the platform today so
groups has been around for a while but
its growth is outpacing the growth of
Facebook overall today 1.4 billion
people are using groups every month and
about 200 million or so we think are
super meaningful groups this is Lola
Alma Lola
you see over here Lola
Lola is a chicago-based journalist
originally from Nigeria who started
females in Nigeria a group for women to
tell stories about issues related to
them people are cheering to you Lola and
we've learned that the leaders are the
reason that these meaningful large
groups happen your story as you told me
was very common which was you started
this group added a few friends woke up
the next day and it was doubling and
doubling and doubling and doubling and
we know that you have a full-time job
outside of this and managing a group
with 1 million people in it is a lot of
work this is a group that has meetups
and cities all around the world they are
scooper close friends now their kids
play together they have merchandise Lola
is a major hero to them and we've
started asking what we can do to help
folks like this succeed on our platform
Thank You Lola
so we've started learning from the top
group admins on the platform what could
we do to make this easier and how do we
build products that let the next
generation of leaders start to have
groups that cater to what they want dr.
Hollis Aubrey is up here she founded the
physicians moms group this is a group
for new mothers in the US who are also
doctors and according to her one in four
women in the US who meet that criteria
are in this group it's probably the
world's best medical advice for parents
this grew full of doctors and so we've
continued to learn what tools these
folks need to have groups that are super
healthy and do really really well
and that's really been the roadmap for
groups over the past year is tools that
focus on making the life easier of the
people leading them and also just makes
the group's conversation a lot more rich
like Mark mentioned we're also gonna
make it easier for folks to use groups
on the platform by rolling out a groups
tab later this month so if you use
groups a lot this will make it easy for
you to check up on them it will also
make it easier for you to discover new
groups related especially to niche
interests I'm a owner of a pit bull
anybody who owns a pit bull knows that
they're incredibly sweet even though
they have a bad rap and so I'm looking
forward to using this to connect with
more folks who have the same experience
and share tips we're also building
features to make it easier for groups to
do things together like watch video
watch party is something we just
announced and we've been rolling out
gradually this is just the experience of
watching the same frame of the same
video at the same time with thousands of
people all around the world it takes
advantage of the same technology we use
to build live which is really low
latency experience that creates that
feeling of presence that mark talked
about today we're showing a sneak
preview of a new feature called live
commentating which will let the group
leader or the video creator or anybody
in the audience put their face into the
screen and narrate whatever it is that
they want to say about what's being
watched this is just about making the
experience of watching the video they're
more social so that's a little bit about
groups we've also started looking at
further out than that what are the
moments on the platform where people are
finding a friend of a friend or stranger
and having something important or
meaningful happen and what can we do to
build more tools for that which is what
gets us to dating so this is Raman and
Priya like Marc said they were one of
many couples who's met him in us over
the years to tell us the most important
thing that ever happened to me on
Facebook was meeting my partner so this
is a couple who met and then got engaged
got married and had kids so Marc posted
a photo of them in 2016 and the comment
thread on it was overwhelming we
basically had thousands of responses of
people who had met on the platform
sharing their personal story and
photograph and this is what got the
gears turning for us that we should
probably pay closer attention to how we
could build a service that helped folks
who want to do this do so in a way that
was opt-in in a way that was safe a way
that took advantage of the unique
properties of the platform and didn't
get in the way of everybody who wasn't
interested in dating and so that's what
we've designed so this is Jennifer she's
just moved to Chicago she's interested
in dating
she likes running and college football
so she this is her Facebook profile she
would see in the upper-right a place she
can tap to go to dating home the first
thing she would do here is set up a
dating profile this is just her first
name it is not visible to her friends
it's only visible to folks using the
dating service and it doesn't show up in
newsfeed or anywhere else when she's
done that she can go browse events and
groups this will let her see things in
the city and groups related to her
interests
once she does that and we like this by
the way because it mirrors the way
people actually date which is usually at
events and in institutions that they're
connected through so let's say she sees
a grew an event she wants to go to she
can go and unlock the event so unlocking
the event will mean she shares her day
profile with other people who are going
to the event are using the dating
service and have also unlocked it then
she can browse people who were there say
she wants to talk to Jay she'll start a
conversation with a photo from his
profile this will encourage we hope a
more meaningful interaction then if he
wants to respond they'll do so in a
private messaging inbox connected to the
profile this is text only as a safety
measure and it's not connected to
messenger or whatsapp because folks
wanted this to be in a separate space
and not commingled with the rest of
their inbox so we hope that this will
help more folks meet and hopefully find
partners we're excited to share a lot
more on this over the next few months
okay on a more serious note we've also
seen people use Facebook to come
together in a moment of crisis or during
a disaster
we know that 160 million people each
year are affected by a natural disaster
and Facebook is a place that people go
to tell their friends and family they're
okay and also ask for help and
coordinate relief so that's why we built
safety check safety check is a tool that
lets people do just those things and
we've recently rolled out new
functionality so that businesses and
NGOs can offer services to people in
need like free rides food water shelter
pet supplies whatever it is that folks
need can be matched by people who want
to help this has been activated over a
thousand times and notified more than
three billion people that their friends
and family are ok today we're announcing
a new feature here which is the ability
for people to provide first-person
accounts on the ground to folks who are
in the middle of that place or who want
to look in and figure out how they can
help this will help with things like
traffic road blockages floods fires etc
the other area we've seen a lot of
really interesting emergent behavior was
in India around blood donations now
India is one of many countries where
there are blood shortages and people
would when a friend needed blood asked
the network of friends and family around
them for help so we thought about and we
looked at we worked with blood banks
clinics locally to figure out how we
could help make this more structured and
more efficient so we've built already
the ability for folks to register as a
blood donor there are 8 million people
registered in India Pakistan and
Bangladesh
making it the largest online blood
matching service today we're announcing
a new zone which is a hub for all of
this so that it's more easy for clinics
blood banks and donors to find one
another whether it's in a time of need
or whether it's entering a moment where
somebody wants to give blood this is the
kind of thing we're interested in
rolling out more broadly as we continue
to build functionality into the service
so these are just some of the ways we're
looking at helping people have finding
these interesting moments where they
meet somebody or something important
happens and we can build a tool to help
make it work and that's really what this
conference is all about put it not
putting technology to work in the
service of people and our relationships
with each other
I'm really excited you're all here today
for f8 we're here to build things so
let's have an amazing conference thanks
everybody
you're gonna hear from Jody Shilpa and
Tamar to talk a little bit about
Instagram Thanks
hi I'm Joel pasar car I'm tomorrow
Pierrot
and I'm Jody soup Instagram is the best
place to share connect and explore with
the people and interests that matter
most to you and we're all super excited
to be here today to get to show some of
the cool new products that we've been
working on every day hundreds of
millions of people connect through
stories on Instagram but we're always
looking for ways to improve the format
to make it easier to share any moment
even when nothing's going on
like when I'm bored and I just want to
share my favorite song or playlist
thanks to the Spotify integration Chris
talked about now I can share a sticker
of whatever I'm listening to directly to
Instagram from my Spotify app and in
addition to being able to easily share
from Spotify as you can see here now
anyone can also share their latest GoPro
footage directly to IG as well our team
also really cares about building
creative tools that help people uniquely
share on Instagram whether it's the new
focus format that lets you up your
selfie game or boomerang which turns the
mundane into something fun or even a our
face filters that help people feel more
comfortable sharing and make their
friends laugh but we've just barely
scratched the surface of what's possible
with augmented reality last year
Facebook announced the ability for
developers to create their own effects
for the camera and today we're excited
to bring that ability to Instagram as a
closed beta
here's how it'll be different on
Instagram the effects are partners
design will only show up in the camera
of their followers so that the effects
really feel authentic and genuine and to
the user but non followers will also
have a way to find and use the effects
let's say team creator Liza Coe she
creates a funny new filter if I follow
Liza I'll automatically see the filter
in my camera but if I don't follow her
I can also try on the filter from any of
my friends stories who posted with it or
any of the direct messages that they
sent using it this sharing model gives
third parties a new channel to interact
with their followers and reach new ones
and it gives users a set of new creative
tools of expression and interaction that
can be tied to real world moments on
Instagram like being able to dunk on any
of your friends during the playoffs
through the finals courtesy of the NBA
no matter what the occasion we're really
excited to see what you'll do and one of
our top AR developers is actually here
today to show us what he's been working
on so let's bring him out
just bomb has 8 million followers on
Instagram and is the most followed pet
in the app hi Jess Fong thanks for
coming to f/8
can you show us what you've been up to
Wow
you've been really really busy can you
show us the filter that you've been
designing oh it's so cute
look at that now when you don't have
jiff palm in real life for your selfie
you have his filter with all his
cuteness in it that he's designed for us
thanks Jeff Tom nice work
we're really excited to be working with
partners like Jeff um to bring more fun
and interactive tools into the camera
and we think some of the most
interactive experiences can actually
happen in real time so I'll hand it over
to Shilpa to talk about video chat
thanks GOP and thanks jiff palm real
time video is one of the best ways to
share an experience with your friends
that's why a little over a year ago we
launched Instagram live since then we've
seen over 100 million people use live
video every day however we've heard from
our community a desire to use this
technology to talk privately with their
closest friends and that's why today I'm
really excited to announce a video chat
a new way to connect on Instagram direct
when you can't be together this is me in
high school now I don't know about you
all but when I was in high school I
would instant message my friends or talk
to them on the landline phone this meant
that when my best friend didn't get into
her dream school I couldn't read her
facial expression to figure out what
kind of support she really needed and
since my brilliant sarcasm is a little
difficult to convey over text most of my
jokes fell flat when instant messaging
with my crush video chat is incredible
because it deepens friendships and it
prevents things from being lost in
taxation often you need a real facial
expression or a laugh to really convey
an emotion this is particularly exciting
for Instagram because your friends are
already on the platform you don't need
to download a separate app or even ask
for a phone number if you want to use it
in fact let me show you how easy it is
so here I am in Instagram first I'll
swipe over to direct because that's
where I already have conversations with
my closest friends now let's say it's
Saturday and I'm trying to figure out
where we should go to brunch I tap this
button to start a video chat and soon
we're all able to hang out together now
let's pretend I'm looking for some
inspiration for where we should go I tap
this button and soon the video player is
minimized I swipe on over to feed and at
this point people can still see and hear
me but don't worry
can't see my screen now once I find
somewhere I want to go I hit share and
then I send it back to the thread so my
friends could give their input so
whether you're one-on-one or in a group
we think video chat will be a powerful
and seamless way to connect on Instagram
we're currently testing video chat and
look forward to rolling it out soon in
the coming weeks now I'll hand it over
to Tamar to talk about how we're making
Explorer an even better place to
discover interests you love on Instagram
thanks oppa in addition to discovery in
addition to sharing people come to
Instagram every day to discover the
world around them and connect with the
people and the things that they love
skateboarding fans love seeing the
latest tricks that are trending nail art
aficionados are looking for fresh ways
to express themselves and slime
enthusiasts all agree they find slime
oddly satisfying so what do these people
have in common
they've found communities on Instagram
that share their curiosity interest or
passion but navigating the wide world of
interest can be overwhelming so we
started working to help people discover
and connect with the world around them
we launched the ability to follow
hashtags back in December and since then
we've seen more than 100 million people
around the world
follow hashtags and one thing we've
learned is just how many different
hashtags and interests are out there I
happen to follow hashtag slime and I
make it every weekend with my kids so
how did I become slime obsessed well I
found it on the explore page explorers
Corps to discovery on Instagram millions
of people use Explorer to get inspired
and find awesome content and today we're
excited to give you a sneak peek of the
new Explorer now Explorer is organized
into topic channels based on your
personal interests and tastes
you can easily browse across different
topics and dive deeper when you want to
see more you have more control over the
content you're seeing so it's easier to
find exactly what you're looking for
Explorer has always been powered by
artificial intelligence in order to
deliver a cutting-edge experience we're
augmenting our ai-ai-ai-ai with content
classification and curation signals from
our community our goal is to provide an
even more personalized and easy-to-use
experience that is tailored just for you
but as we work to make it easier to
share connect and explore across
Instagram it's equally important that it
remains a safe and supportive space
that's why last year we launched a
comment filter that automatically hides
offensive comments but that was just
step one today we're taking our Comment
filtering technology even further by
launching a bullying filter that hides
language intended to harass or upset
people
this type of language is complicated to
identify so we've advanced our machine
learning systems to make it possible so
much of the Instagram experience is
about how your connections and community
can support you we're committed to
getting this right and we're excited for
what's to come I'll now hand it off to
Mubarak Imam to talk about whatsapp
good morning five years ago
my husband asked me if I could work
anywhere for free where would I work my
answer was simple what's up
I'd been using it since March 2009 just
two weeks after the app launched I was a
huge fan and still AM and that is
because whatsapp helps us deepen our
personal relationships with friends and
family no matter the distance it
fulfills a fundamental human need to
communicate it is the only way that my
family which is split up across four
continents six different countries and
eight cities stays up to date on each
other's lives this is the closest thing
that we have to sitting around my
grandmother's dining table every night
in Lahore Pakistan for nine years we've
helped families friends and loved ones
communicate by focusing on three core
principles simplicity reliability and
privacy so let's talk about simplicity
we prioritize quality over an abundance
of new features and this means that we
say no to things that add unnecessary
complexity to the app second reliability
whatsapp has a data light design that
works well on the lowest and smart
phones no matter where you are in the
world this matters on ordinary days when
you're exchanging messages with your
loved ones but it really matters on
exceptional days - such as after last
year's earthquake in Mexico City when
whatsapp was one of the only messaging
services that worked reliably in the
first few crucial hours to help find
people that were still trapped
lastly privacy and security are really
in our DNA at whatsapp we collect very
little information about our users and
since some of your most personal
moments are shared on whatsapp a few
years ago we built end-to-end encryption
by default into our app it means that
when you exchange messages with your
loved ones or call your friends nobody
not even whatsapp can read your messages
or listen to your calls with 65 billion
messages that are sent every single day
on whatsapp as Mark mentioned whatsapp
is the world's largest implementation of
end-to-end encryption we also really
believe that your messages should be in
your hands that's why whatsapp does not
store your messages on our servers once
we deliver them our features are also
designed with privacy and security in
mind so take for example live location
which we launched last year it lets you
share your location with whoever you
choose privately
again this is enter and encrypted which
means nobody not even whatsapp knows
your location imagine how this matters
in parts of the world where a woman who
might be stuck in the traffic in Karachi
after the monsoons or university student
in Caracas can let their parents know
that they've arrived home safely what is
really exciting is that every single day
we're working hard on introducing new
ways for people to stay connected around
the globe last year we launched whatsapp
status this is our stories feature so
you can share the fleeting memories that
you have throughout your day whether
it's a photo a gif a message just with
any or all of your contacts and as Mark
mentioned even though it is pretty new
what's up status is by far the biggest
stories product in the world with over
450 million daily users thank you
voice and video calling have also become
immensely popular on whatsapp and our
engineer's work really hard to make sure
that you have clear video and voice
quality everywhere around the world and
today people make over 2 billion minutes
of voice and video calls every day on
whatsapp and now we're excited to share
the group calling is also coming to
whatsapp in the coming months ahead
where you can get together with friends
and family regardless of where you are
in the world and in the next few thank
you and in the next few months we're
also bringing stickers to what's up so
people can express themselves with even
more nuance and what's exciting about
this is that this includes support for
third party sticker packs created by
developers like you so you can help
create localized stickers for people
around the world to use groups are also
really an essential part of whatsapp and
we've recently added a new feature we've
recently added new features that give
users even more control groups are
intended for intimate conversations with
family friends personal communities and
organizations and so did day I'd like to
share two stories with you that
illustrate that for example in India
groups are being used to help and
support farmers farmers sometimes endure
really brutal working conditions and
many are in debt because of
unpredictable climates unfortunately
this drives many farmers to contemplate
and potentially attempt suicide one
farmer named judgment widowed in
Maharashtra had attempted suicide
because he saw no way to get out of debt
his story was shared in a whatsapp group
created by a non-profit collie of rostra
that supports distressed farmers and
their communities the group brought
together government officials
agriculture experts and legal advisors
along with farmers in the first time for
the first time who helped
pay off his debt repair his irrigation
system and build a well his lifelong
dream and today I Russia has more than
22 such watsapp groups with over 2,000
farmers universities are also using
whatsapp as a tool for students to
communicate from enrollment all the way
to graduation at the universidad de sao
paulo
professor paul or nozzles uses a support
system on whatsapp for his students by
encouraging them to share information
discuss class assignments and continue
conversations all in a safe and private
environment on whatsapp it's not only
the people that use our products but
millions of businesses are also using
whatsapp to connect with customers from
clothing companies in Europe to bakeries
in Brazil and now we're bringing two
products to make these connections even
more seamless for you this year we
launched whatsapp business it's a new
Android app for small businesses which
has more than 3 million people using it
and we're also testing another large
solution for big businesses the goal is
for businesses to have a presence on
whatsapp for the first time as well as
additional features that make it
possible to manage a really large volume
of messages this includes away messages
quick replies labels and many other
features to come so we share two stories
with you about how businesses are using
this take for example in Madrid Spain
where Marta Gonzalez turned her passion
for ceramics into a business by teaching
classes in her studio and selling her
own designs for her business called
martha ceramic a-- whatsapp has become
the tool that she relies on every single
day to run her business and coordinate
her classes so that she has more time to
be creative as an artist and focus on
her students her favorite feature is
voice messages because she can send
personalized greetings and communicate
with people even when our hands are
messy and dirty in this too
another business called sale stock in
Indonesia is piloting our whatsapp
product for larger companies there an
online clothing company that uses
whatsapp to provide delivery rates and
personalized recommendations for
customers in the app and nonprofits are
benefiting from this - I wanna show the
story of pre-cal foundation a South
African nonprofit that is piloting a
program called mom connect it uses
whatsapp to provide new mothers with
critical pre and postnatal care and what
is truly remarkable is that
communication between mothers and
clinics has gone up by over three times
since they switched to whatsapp this is
really the power of whatsapp the stories
of people organizations and businesses
around the world that use whatsapp in
ways in which we never imagined really
inspire our work every single day at
whatsapp and from all of us that work on
whatsapp it is an honor and deep
privilege to serve you and next here to
share with you exciting developments
from messenger please welcome David
Marcus
good morning I hope you're having a
great f8 so far yeah all right awesome
we now have over 200,000 developers
building for the messenger platform so I
want to start by thanking all of you for
your understanding as we had to pause
approving new experiences on the
platform in the last few weeks seven
years ago I was sitting in this audience
with my startup building for the
Facebook platform so hi I know how
painful and stressful those weeks can
feel and I just wanted you to know that
we're super super thankful and grateful
for your understanding as we went
through this process the good news is
Mark shared with you earlier is that
we're now fully open for business again
and emai will share more details about
that in his section right after me in
the last year we've been really really
busy making messenger better for all of
you starting with groups we've added a
our capabilities for group video chats
we've added admin support joined by link
mentions and reactions to the main group
products games have also become a lot
bigger on the platform with now over 500
titles built by 200 game developers who
are now monetizing those games really
well and speaking of monetization and
payments we've made a lot of progress on
payments too by launching p2p payments
the same experience that you have here
in the u.s. in France and in the UK
messenger light is now also available to
more people in more countries and now
supports video calling which was the
number one requested feature from people
using the product and talking about the
number one requested feature this has
been one of mine for a very very long
time
it seems like a small thing but it's a
really big deal the ability for you to
now send 4k photos 360 degree photos and
HD videos superfast to all of your
friends this really makes messenger one
of the best ways to share rich media
with anyone you want now messenger Kids
has also found more and more product
market fit with families all over the
country I use it with my youngest
daughter when I'm traveling and she
loves all of the face filters in effect
and I know that I can be in control of
who she can communicate with at all
times which is great on the platform
side of things we've been continuing to
invest a ton in the last year as you all
know but one of the capabilities that I
really really think is going to make a
big difference is our customer chat
plugin our customer chat plugin enables
you to embed messenger on your own
website and for the very first time
continue chatting with your customers
long after they've left your website
which is great for both customer service
but also for marketing because you can
continue retargeting customers after
they've asked you for a question on a
product last year when I was here one
year after opening the platform I shared
with you that we had over a hundred
thousand live experiences on the
platform and this year I'm happy to
update that number to over three hundred
thousand
but more importantly what we've seen is
that the engagement of people and
businesses on messenger is growing at a
really rapid and accelerating rate last
year we had two billion messages
exchanged between people and businesses
every month and this number in one year
has quadrupled to over eight billion
messages every month this shows that the
platform is finding product market fit
has a ton of momentum and is driving
success for businesses over the world
but we haven't done this by ourselves we
partnered with awesome developers
solution providers advertisers and
marketers all over the world and it's
been amazing to watch all of you find
product market fit get success grow your
businesses this year so let's hear from
a few of you now in a startup you have
to do everything yourself
so first time can be a little my name is
Dmitry and my product is admin my name
is Brent blanks and I work in turns
relief my name is Jimmy and my company
isn't at home
my name is F Shabazz and my company is
called fuchsia shoes it was still a
small business and to be able to reach
as many people as possible we were gonna
need a way to scale those interactions
so it was really about what tools can we
use and Messenger was an obvious choice
who started building Edwyn and messenger
what's evolving with us during Hurricane
Maria and Puerto Rico we got a number of
messages from individual
who either were affected by the storm or
they were there to help with their
response efforts the more that we can
get the bots to take care of the
functional stuff like shipping
notifications the more of those great
conversations we can have instead of the
customers waiting for a day or two our
bot will address those questions and
help them pick a shoe immediately for
the first time ever messenger gives
direct relief the potential to expand
our work to a place that it's never been
before the open rates of emails are
around 16% whereas if we send a more
personalized message through messenger
BOTS
the open rates that we are seeing is
around 90% one of the things we noticed
is that people who come through
messenger spend 20% more than other
people
messenger cut a lot of costs in time and
money for us and we invested all that
spare time into the product and I think
that's why we are so successful at this
point these are truly awesome success
stories but it's not only about small
businesses and startups it's also your
favorite brands from all over the world
that have invested in messenger and have
found great results in success from
Qantas to TD Ameritrade that have
redefined customer service on messenger
to Comcast and t-mobile who are really
engaging their customers in a brand new
way so I want to turn to page now enough
about the past let's look to the future
last year I was here and for the very
first time we talked about M suggestions
and since then we've added a lot of
capabilities for M suggestions it
learned new languages it can suggest
more things but this year were really
excited to announce M translations for
the very first time you're going to have
the ability to talk to almost anyone you
want in the world at an unprecedented
scale even if you don't speak the same
language and this will power connections
that weren't possible before and all
kinds of different circumstances
and definitely make the world a lot
smaller as far as the platform is
concerned we're continuing to invest and
as Mark highlighted before we're
bringing AR to the messenger platform
and what this means is that you'll be
able to build native AR experiences
combined what your bought creating the
very first conversational AR experiences
and you can see some of the examples
around me right now
this is going to be really powerful
because you'll still have the
conversation behind those effects and
we've been very lucky to work with
amazing brands like Nike Asus Kia and
Sephora to build those amazing
experiences on our platform I now want
to zoom in on the Nike experience
because my son is a total sneaker head
and he converted me into one so having
the ability to announce the first-ever
shoe drop on messenger on stage in front
of you is awesome in more ways than you
know so let's take a look first you go
to the Nike sneakers experience and
provided you have the right secret emoji
code you can unlock a bubble that then
loads up the AR effects that Nike has
built right into our native camera the
awesome part with this is that now
you're in the room you're sitting in and
you have this awesome podium that shows
up and a brand-new pair of kairi's just
drops in front of you literally and you
can actually walk to the shoe get up
close and personal with it take photos
and videos and share them with your
friends ask them for their opinions and
when you're done with it and you close
the camera you're back into the
experience where you can buy the shoe
right then and there
the
the awesome part with this is now now
because you're in a thread and messenger
if you're a real sneakerhead you can ask
for all the notifications for the next
shoe drops and those are really
important notifications if you like the
sneakers I really can't wait to see what
you guys are going to build with this
because I think that creative companies
and marketing agencies will have a blast
creating those new experiences on our
platform now I really want to thank all
of you on behalf of the whole messenger
team because obviously we wouldn't have
gotten here without all of you in two
short years this platform went from zero
to a thriving ecosystem of partners
fueling success stories from all over
the world but it still feels like it's
early and we have so much more work to
do together to tap into the full
potential of the platform we've built
together so let me commit once more to
you that we're fully invested in the
messenger platform that we will continue
listening to your feedback we will
continue making it better so that you
can be more successful on our platform
we have six sessions for you this year
more than ever so please make sure to
check them out we also have an awesome
booth while you'll be able to try these
experiences for the first time hands-on
and we'll have surprises for you there
but before I leave this stage I want to
show you what the future of messenger
will look like mark showed you a little
bit of it I'll show you a little bit
more so this is something we've been
hard at work on from the very beginning
of this year and definitely something
we're very excited to announce but more
excited to actually deliver to you very
very soon let's take a look
all right what do you guys think all
right that's it for me today thank you
and now I'll pass it on to e me thanks
hello everybody how are you doing
we've still got the energy going all
right all right all right
my name is the mayor Chavonne and for
the last eight years I've been part of
the partnerships organization here at
Facebook and across many of those years
I've got the opportunity to work just
like Mark many of you out here and
probably have met more developers and I
could even count but the thing that's
actually fairly special and unique about
it is that I remember a lot of you and I
remember many of your guys stories
that's mainly because they've been
unique and our journey together has been
unique in itself the very first
developer that had the opportunity to
work with when I started that this
company was a relative unknown so a
30-person
european start-up with a few thousand
users now over our journey and over
working with them there are plenty ups
are plenty of downs but through it all
we remain committed to a couple of
different things one this idea and this
notion that building together was
actually the most powerful thing that we
could do and two was this vision that
the more personalized and social future
that we wanted to work towards together
then we're on similar journeys with many
of you which is a beautiful thing right
now I just wanted to thank you I don't
think you've heard thank you enough or
say it again thank you thank you thank
you
because recent events and the evermore
earth
tech people's data has required us all
that evolve and to change our prop
we know can be disruptive and as we
reopen the app review process we've
moved more and more of our api's behind
wing is taking a higher level of
expectations we look at your application
that uses submit to the Facebook
platform
well that was a bit of a glitchy end the
day one came out from Mark Zuckerberg in
the Facebook team welcome back for those
of you still with us I'm Bridget Carey
and with me in our New York studios is
eyes Akhtar and Ben Fox Rubin and we're
here to digest what all we heard today
when I asked the f8 bot if they can fix
the feed on my computer right now
because if it's just it looks like it
was a global problem but it was just
kind of like stuttering and so now we're
back because although it might still be
concluding on the side of the folks in
San Jose we're just gonna talk about all
the highlights here well the box says
I'm sorry to say I don't have that kind
of data so it can't help us the only
data out of Facebook doesn't have you
know for a company that is talking about
all this live chat it was a rough start
the f8 web site was a town and we we got
the fee cuz we were tapped into it but
then yeah now it's a a choppy end what
were some of the big highlights though
from what we did see dating that was
probably like the biggest take away
don't you think oh yeah that was pretty
interesting like it seems like this was
the in case of emergency situation when
it came to dating they have all this
privacy issues they have no have all
this terrible information like what can
we do that people will talk about what
bring on a puppy and we'll talk about
dating that seems to have works always
that a happy fuzzy feeling yes bro man
it's any part of Facebook they just
didn't have you know fireworks or
cupcakes any of those are stickers oh
yeah yeah yeah they'll put that in the
Instagram and whatsapp
yeah but ultimately I feel like why
didn't they do this sooner it seems to
make a lot of sense to me if the whole
idea as Mark Zuckerberg said so I'm
stealing this line from him the idea is
to connect people and great meaningful
relationships wouldn't making Facebook
into a dating site be so much of that
why don't we break down what that dating
site is because it is not exactly like a
tinder for a hookup C specifically said
this is for meaningful relationships but
also this isn't something that it's
gonna have an algorithm to match you
with strangers that are
by you have to do a little work here one
it has to be switched on it's not gonna
show up in your news feed this isn't
something your friends can see it's
gonna be focused on events and groups so
if you have in your profile that you're
interested in dating and you're looking
at events nearby you can turn on the
feature to unlock let's say there is a
music event happening at the park on
Saturday I can go to that of a specific
event and say hey everyone else in this
event who's also interested in dating we
can all see each other's profiles and
maybe then start a conversation but what
I found also interesting that on chat
people are talking about how you cannot
access these dating features if your
status says you are married or dating
relationship right right or in a
relationship so they're not gonna have
an Ashley Madison kind of situation but
why even go down that route I mean this
is it
I guess they want to keep it safe and
and not have controversy but then you
are making rules and tell you what what
they can again which is controversial
for another reason yeah I don't know
that's that one's pretty tough it's
because if they decided to go down the
route of we're gonna turn a blind eye to
your own relationship status that you've
told us and it's publicly available that
could now I'm gonna blame Facebook for
my relationship going south if the
significant other is like now using
Facebook to date behind your back right
yeah but it's yeah so that could blow up
for Facebook I think pretty quickly had
they not gone down that route so
obviously they're probably gonna get
knocked to a certain extent for
moralizing
a little bit but it's probably gonna be
less controversial for them to pick this
route than the other one what's your
dating feel here I think it's it seems
like it is strange that took so long for
Facebook to be in this world when it
comes to having the your status actually
matter yeah I guess they have to figure
something out they have had problems
with us in the past they had ideas for
gender and how they're gonna I guess
classify you what you could classify
yourself as and your real name and all
that other stuff it's another one of
those growing pants kind situations so
they probably get a little bit of flack
and if you want to switch it to it's
complicated I guess you could always do
that but I could be like a tone deaf
kind of respond so we'll see what
Facebook you're married
well you know when I first heard him say
they're getting a dating I was like oh
my gosh you'd give me more data I've
seen a lot of that feedback on fit on
Twitter people are feel like you mean
well in a time where they're criticized
for taking data there's not more dating
data but actually when I heard the
presentation I was I was okay with it
the tone seemed appropriate it was about
if you're going to an event or if you're
part of an interest group then you can
have a conversation like normal people
do to talk about something the dating
industry and all the dating apps though
the matches and the fishes and all of
those things they are era massive
company they're not trying to
necessarily take that over it's just a
game of which the owner of tender IAC
their stock is down 12% today they are
definitely feeling the pain from the
fact that Facebook is getting into the
dating scene because I mean do they even
mention how much this is gonna cost this
is an opt-in service but if it's free
you're already on Facebook if I'm the
folks that own match.com tinder plenty
of fish whatever I'm definitely nervous
now that this is this is a huge platform
there are already people on it and now
they could potentially use it for dating
and not pay my site to use it for dating
instead if I'm a developer or someone
who's making a group or making an event
that this is great cuz now you get
people who are really engaged and going
and not just saying yeah I'm interested
in going and forgetting about it cuz now
they have reason to go and reason to
meet people you know one of the other
things they mentioned in the keynote is
that you will not get paired with
friends so you could imagine that some
people are like coming friending this
person trying to get out of the process
and then you're gonna have the signal
literally yeah so you have to signal you
like why did why did this person
unfriend me oh no before you want friend
them find out what all their likes are
what their favorite book it just put all
of that in your profile
it's not gonna be creepy at all there's
nothing weird about doing not at all but
that's gonna happen I mean Facebook
before tried to match you with careers
now they're just trying to match you and
a love connection I guess right all your
relationships your bosses your
significant others next your kids are
gonna have like oh this could be your
kid yeah
yeah Oh broadly pretending that out of
it I think they did do a good job we
started this conversation talking about
all the controversies and they did do a
good job of really hammering the point
that we want to be the place for
meaningful relationships meaningful
communication and and and they threaded
the needle I thought in a pretty good
way as far as talking about during
disasters or floods that you could use
safety checks so that's that is a
difficult time in people's lives but
Facebook also wants to be there for that
too what about the tone when we before
this kicked off we were going about how
this is gonna be damage control and I
feel like that first 15 minutes were
Zuckerberg kind of went through
everything it was very like I am
confident this is great let's keep the
mood yee-haa rally hurrah I don't know
it what was your take rally sounds about
right
yes wants the developers to keep making
apps and all kinds of things for
Facebook without them they've got very
little to go on if you want to get new
creative works done you need to get all
these people excited for you so yeah it
did sound like a rallying cry in the
first 15 minutes of taking on you know
what are the thing fighting fake news
and all of these huge issues that
Facebook's been facing so that was like
the original tone then that totally
shifts it what did you think yeah I
totally agree I think it was very much a
call to arms and Zuckerberg did a good
job of addressing a lot of that stuff
head-on at the same time taking 15
minutes out of the presentation and the
very early part of the presentation to
really hit on those negative points
really conveys how much Facebook has to
come back from some of this stuff I was
wrong he did have more humor this time
just like you said because this is his
playground I mean some of the jokes that
we saw were you know they made him a
little more relatable cuz he was a
little more comfortable or more rehearse
than one of the other but what was the
joke about like if you want to have a
group chat what was it no it was watch
party I'm a watch party with your
friends when someone's testifying on the
hill you know his own testimony there
yeah and he also did like a filter of
him like looking like a bunny for his
kids
very very very humanizing
relateable that kind of thing yeah yeah
I to me it seems like it was a they did
what they were what they needed to do is
a good presentation in that regard I
don't think all their problems go away
obviously I think that's important to
remember that but you also oculus go is
another one that's important to mention
as far as some of the bigger plot points
from the presentation oh right now
it's available now right like you could
just you could just order it I believe
this the list the news that it's
launching now of course everyone in the
audience got one you know to kind of
make everyone excited about using it but
hey this is a hands-free VR device no
need for wires to your PC no need for
putting your phone inside so now we have
hands-free you know VR and Facebook
sitting into dating I just wonder you do
that's coming for so you can use that
yeah okay that's we're moving it but
otherwise it's not tethered to anything
right it's basically not wired anymore
just quickly saying they're like oh we
want talking about hardware he spends
about two minutes on it hundred million
dollar starts at $1.99 they all look
today and then we just moved right on
from that it wasn't a surprise cuz it
was announced already just the
availability was the news I guess so
maybe there'll be more demos and more we
can learn about that as the as the
developer conference goes on a lot of
talk on both Instagram and whatsapp and
while it was going on we were we were
discussing here at the table things were
sounding pretty similar yeah the only
way that you could actually figure out
the difference between what the
presentation was wise by their color
coding in the background that oh it's
green background so this is a whatsapp
feature it's it's a pink background with
a dog in the front so it's a inside
video chance coming to its volts it's
what's up it's messenger it's Instagram
all three also have stories you have
messenger Instagram what's up stickers
you know stickers are in both things so
yeah it felt like they were kind of like
giving you the option have all these
features in all of their products so I
guess you don't have to choose which one
you want to use you'll have the same
experience more or less maybe they're
just hedging their bets so if something
goes wrong with Instagram they can
distance themselves from it something
goes on a messenger they can distance
them from that and then there's what's
that so any of them they're like look
we're not that were these guys and again
Instagram has a little dog which is
super important they
a little dog on the stage you guys know
what it was called at well really quick
I'm gonna interrupt you they're actually
good the feed came back so we're gonna
throw right back to that ready
talk about oculus now screen and reality
and it works just like the best Smart
TVs out there use the controller to
change channels navigate around and
choose between live and on-demand
content and starting this summer you'll
be able to invite friends cousins and
grandparents to have a watch party in VR

oculus TV launches this month and we're
adding tons of great content partners

another awesome way to spend quality
time with friends in VR is oculus rooms

it is my honor to introduce a phenomenal
Facebook colleague who's going to talk
about the amazing worker doing to
connect people in and beyond VR please
welcome Rachel Franklin
Thanks you go you just saw how we're
bringing VR to everyone with the most
accessible headset yet we're also making
immersive technology social from the
start because virtual reality and
augmented reality can help connect us in
meaningful ways even when we're not in a
headset that's where the Facebook
platform comes in Facebook is where
people come together and share and where
we create communities around the world
with new formats that spring from new
technologies we'll be able to share the
moments of our lives and even richer
ways our connections to people will
deepen we're working with developers
like you to create a new generation of
media that can express the power of
moments big or small and make sharing
those moments seamless within and beyond
VR for everyone I want to talk about
three ways we're doing this by creating
by capturing and by making it possible
to remember the moments that matter most
to us in new ways so first let's talk
about creating moments we're doing this
with interactive 3d posts on Facebook so
my friend Jen just moved into her new
house and as a housewarming present I
bought her this fancy new mixer the
company that makes it used our 3d
sharing API so before it even arrives I
can send her a 3d preview of the gift on
Facebook it shows up in her newsfeed for
her friends to admire from every angle
but it's more than just a post with one
tap you can bring a 3d object into
Facebook camera using our AR technology
this means you can grab a 3d object
right out of newsfeed and bring it
straight into your world and it's
launching next month
so this means Jen can see how the mixers
gonna look in her new kitchen and I can
see if I want one for myself moving
objects into VR takes this experience to
an even more immersive and meaningful
level so because Jen lives two states
away my post actually created a moment
for us together it reminded us how much
we miss each other so we decided to get
together in VR in Facebook spaces with a
simple 360 photo of her kitchen and that
3d mixer object the virtual Jen can give
me a tour so we're already seeing the
start of an entirely new way to share
with 3d media but what if you don't have
3d modeling software and you want
immersive experiences based on your own
special moments well you only have to
wait a few months this summer we're
rolling out 3d photos you simply take a
picture with your smartphone and upload
it to Facebook as a 3d photo so here are
Jenn's kids baking and making slime
because slimes a real trend right now
you can see how they pop off the screen
it's like a memory is coming alive I
almost feel like I'm in that kitchen
with them because Jen's really captured
the moment so you've seen how you can
create an immersive experiences and you
can capture them but we can go a step
further to help you remember them
looking back at important times in our
lives is already a favorite thing to do
on Facebook but what about going back
and feeling those feelings again earlier
Marc showed you a sneak peek at a demo
that our team is working on but I want
to give you a closer look we all have
these albums of our memories on Facebook
imagine taking these 2d photos and
videos and with the magic of AI
reconstructing a place and a moment
that's important to you so what you're
seeing is
3d environment built with point cloud
reconstruction from flat videos you pop
on a VR headset and you're there again
walking around looking around corners
seeing the places where your memories
happened maybe it's in your childhood
home it's like a facebook album that has
come to life and most magical of all
you'll be able to go into these moments
together with the people you care about
this is the kind of entirely new
experience we can have in the future as
immersive formats evolve this is how we
can get back to moments that matter to
us and the people we care about this is
why we build we believe our vision today
will be the foundation for the tools
that you build with tomorrow and I'm
glad we're on this journey together
because together we'll put people at the
center of how we design technology to
create the experiences that people will
naturally want to share that's what
matters to us at Facebook making
technology social from the start so
let's do this let's keep building
together there's never been a more
important time for it
so that is the end of f/8 day ones
keynote I'm Bridget Carey here with
ayahs and Ben and our scene at New York
studios here did I just everything that
just went down that memories thing man
with the V are like reconstructing the
past it was very black mirror yes the
story of us so essentially this new
thing that's coming taking these 3d well
creating a 3d world where you can walk
around in a room and see where took a
picture with your kid on the couch where
you saw your prom photo from other days
I guess it seems like a really bizarre
concept terrifying but interesting I'm
not sure where to be on this yet because
I just saw it a couple of times and like
that doesn't seem like a great idea any
which way but I'm trying it's your own
memories it's a way to get them to
encourage you to upload your really old
stuff maybe but I mean okay I'm thinking
back what do I have on Facebook that is
really detailed
I guess my college apartment life and
and and that stuff they could maybe
reconstruct I I didn't upload stuff from
when I was five like those old birthday
photos that sounds warm and fuzzy right
you know but then you think about it
what do we have on there and then just
see it like that with all the data dots
it was just you know for me I'm thinking
more like vacations or let's say ones
yeah theme park and took a bunch of
pictures of different rides and I can
put the VR headset back on and walk
around see oh that's where we got ran
over by that fake car this is where we
played this men in black game or
whatever are you really taking a shot of
every ink no no but that's the thing
they're supposed to be able to capture
3d the new ways to write new 3d photos
you can be able to kind of look into it
and what about your friends who also
took a photo at that event can I be
smart enough to like sync up that the
data with more than one person who was
tagged in this is kinda like a photos
sent thing kind of thing I'd imagine
that'd be the future but it also sounds
that's why I'm like it's either great or
terrifying or both I I think the theme
park would be a lot harder to do that's
probably why they're showing in the
demonstrations but they but the cabin
getaway maybe we're like a small if it's
a serious space then it's probably a lot
easier for them to do that I also I I
thought it was kind of cool but also
weird and creepy that they did those
dots where it kind of felt like your
fuzzy memory it sure like like here's
your date
scattered it about almost I don't know
like like what in a time we're think
about all the data they have on us and
then they actually like pixelated that
data in a visual representation was very
interesting bring up the image right now
yeah I'll show you guys what looks like
stuff on my laptop right now like a
Swiss cheese type or like it's an
impressionist painting style you got all
these dots and you can go into these
areas where you can see where this
little girl was playing piano and
hopefully it's a video without audio I
capture a heck of a lot of my kid I'll
do what everything to face but ignore
what I want to but what will this do to
the memories of the future generations
that are that are like maybe
reconstructing it in this way where they
don't like when you're under five let's
say you don't really remember everything
but you watch these videos over and over
again and it starts to create this this
false memory I guess that you think you
remember but really it was Facebook
encouraging you to remember it in a
certain way it's in a perfect memory
that's yeah fear do you want a perfect
memory do you wanna be able to see this
and playing piano or some other things
going on oh yeah I remember that
birthday that's when the cakes they
everything on the fire from bad day from
Facebook's perspective this was probably
a smart way for them to think about how
do we get people to use VR more often
how do we get people to buy the oculus
go because this is because this would be
more interactive and more interesting in
a VR headset as opposed to like a 2d
image on your laptop something like that
can we go into the VR because going into
this I was like okay another VR headset
how's my life better but then we saw a
lot about what they're doing in the
oculus side to promote live events live
entertainment giving you more of that
reason to invest in that $200 headset
mmm-hmm yeah that's what somebody said
on Twitter but the hashtag seen that
live and us are we excited about the
possibility of live concerts in virtual
reality then they had a band Vance
something cuz I'm sure Vance joy to ol
Turner who that is and you could show up
to these virtual concerts you could show
up to in virtual stadium and I was
joking around in between and saying like
I don't want to be around in a virtual
stadium with other people I have an
obstructed view do you have to pay to
get a better seat in a VR stadium just
to watch there is some of this going on
already I mean like Samsung
your VR has been around for a couple
years I know the NBA does a lot in VR
with live games already so to a certain
extent this is Facebook catching up with
some of this stuff I would think and
then the games right the partnership
with Hasbro so we have games like boggle
boggle now and beyond very exactly about
Bobby Deol well I mean I was making
jokes before about how Facebook's into
dating now Facebook has VR when is daddy
gonna come to VR then suddenly here we
are you know you saw these avatars
floating around playing board games and
watching movies together and watching
concerts together and the other games
were was a trivial pursuit of monopoly
you know but you know it's something
look at the relationship tester with uno
one day when they have that and +4 card
and just flip off the headset
I think monopoly is the real
relationship test or not she when
Zuckerberg was talking about the oculus
go starting and $1.99 I was confused
about that because everything I've heard
it's just one model but then Hugo Barra
came up in explain there's a higher
capacity model 64 gigabyte coming at
$249 in the future actually I think
that's coming out now right I'll be
looking at a video of Scott's tiny was
testing it out a little bit along with
their colleagues very curious how large
the content and the games will be for
this like how much of a it's 32
gigabytes not enough for this kind of
application is 64 better I'm just
curious how that's gonna work out
depends how much memories are uploading
into the Facebook machine please help me
remember my my life facebook VR oculus
yeah I'm like with Facebook spaces that
they introduced last year and they were
like just just hang out in virtual
reality it'll be fun I Lexi got to try
it out and she thought it was cool I
have not tried it out so maybe maybe it
is exciting if you actually get to be in
there but I do like that they not only
presented this product but they said
here are the things that you can
actually do with it and the developers
have a lot more opportunities to make
things for this platform you know one
thing that's been on my mind is with
Facebook taking away the data that
developers have access to to better
target us too
for target us to know exactly that oh
you are going to be a mom-to-be and let
me give you a targeted ad because of all
the activity we've gathered on you
whatever it may be you know maybe you
know whatever activities you do they
have less of that now how is Facebook
gonna make money oh there have more
types of interactions on VR more types
of branded games that mixer we saw in
the kitchen you as a company can make a
3d model of a product that someone can
buy and you can gift it and then that
gift can go into the AR camera which can
then create a chat with someone in
facebook spaces there's a lot of layers
there and I'm running out of breath but
but all these are more opportunities are
Facebook to make money from branded
content I think they're losing money in
advertising and it's some of that is
just different data or new data so maybe
they're restricting some of the data
that people have said look we want a
little bit of privacy but it's not like
Facebook is gonna go and introduce VR
and say what we're gonna make this
completely encrypted out of your they're
gonna collect data related to that too
and they're gonna find ways to make
money off of it for sure yeah and even
messenger before the VR talk there was
talk about how in messenger recently
with Nike and shoes more branded
opportunities for companies to come in
and do special things just to connect
with you the customer maybe he's not
shared and so you know privacy creepy
but it is more opportunities to connect
with specific people with you know
opportunities to pay more to Facebook
for that opportunity I've got that Nike
thing loading up on my screen now the
idea that you could see a shoe is just
like floating in the air and I was super
excited I'm talking to Ben about this
off air I'm like great maybe I can try
them on virtually because I've got a
large shoe size and shoes look weird
sometimes they get stretched out you
can't do that with this not yet anyway
no but it's a really good idea you would
like Italy and then you can share that
you've enjoyed your Nike sneakers with
other people on Facebook messengering
doesn't show up as snazzy as this does
and then you create a memory and share
that moment and there's a lot of
remember when I shared this number with
you it's perfectly four years ago you
were in a facebook VR memory for you
happy feet because there's only like
those floating bodies that are like
chest up that's right that's right I did
not like the weird floating bodies but
whatever and I guess everyone wants to
be an animated better version of
themselves
right better than a better than what
Samsung's got oh yeah one other aspect
that we hadn't touched on yet was this
first-person accounts from from floods
and disasters now this is obviously an
area that could have fake news
implications especially during a major
event sometimes fake news starts
flooding in so I thought it was
interesting that they mentioned that and
they reference that we want to we want
to provide people with more information
during you know some of those difficult
times whether it's a flood or a fire or
whatever but I think they're obviously
going to have to be vigilant and
hopefully do a better job than they have
with Facebook videos where like they
introduce their live video service and
and that had you know controversy after
controversy related to that as well I
mean just like like a source or people
to go to hey something's going down I
mean you'll start to think about going
to Facebook to get your information for
it instead of going to Google or Twitter
Twitter especially but you know it's
been it's been seen for a lot of these
services that you really have to vet the
stuff because just because it shows up
immediately it doesn't mean that it's
actually accurate so and then you can
have a watch party about it but you know
there was a lot of that talk to about
different ways to interact while you're
watching something to keep you really
more engaged not just like passively
watching but to actively you know have a
conversation we were saying - isn't that
what you do on Twitter when you're
watching something you go to Twitter to
talk about it and so they're trying to
bridge all that mm-hmm
mister yeah she said that the same like
Facebook is going after snapchat Reddit
and Pinterest because we don't really we
were talking about messenger whatsapp
and Instagram all the changes but I mean
like run away because the video came
back there's a lot of features
especially in Instagram when it comes to
that Explorer feature that seems like it
is similar to Pinterest which is a weird
thing to even go after because I didn't
really think that was something to steal
from they were talking about what kids
making slime and recipes and yeah so you
could be discovering you know and the
different creative ideas that way
speaking of that the 3d images what did
you think of those wait wait oh you mean
like like like the fake like oh here's a
picture of my kid if I stilt
slightly I can see that they have some
depth like a parallax effect on an
iPhone
yes exactly parallax effect I find that
kind of oh okay um I'm like you know
what if I saw a lot of those and I'm
scrolling fast
I don't know I'm prone to motion
sickness parallax effect off I mean it I
think it's good for the photo here in
there but you know obviously I think the
VR stuff is more it's more wowed to me
and from a reporter perspective I guess
it's just macspeech that they're just
constantly trying to barrage you with
memories and feeling it was really real
me like I was really there and maybe I
can anymore and my heart will be
bursting with love more if it because
you have a cheek that was a little you
know cuter to pinch you know mm-hmm then
it's good will they can put that on
their financial documents right goodwill
for Facebook is better I love Facebook
and now they can say their goodwill is
worth more as an asset doesn't
accounting stuff right there it's
exciting I know I just brought
groundless to a halt the Pinterest they
said about reddit right and that was the
of vodiane down bode is official that is
something that is coming so that way
once again letting the people police how
yucky comments get that's I don't I
don't have faith in people it's
interesting like I mentioned Twitter
though but I guess you know those are
those are a lot of main areas to look at
Facebook in general and we've seen this
with snapchat and to a certain extent
Twitter or Facebook will always try to
find what its competitors are doing that
it really likes and it you know you can
use the word steal if you wanted to or
borrows or not what you steal yeah it
just it goes and it takes them and it
uses them for its own benefits because a
lot of the stuff isn't like patentable
you know like a snapchat filter is not
patentable and if people on Facebook
when I use it Mark Zuckerberg zarg ument
as we want to let you do that
mm-hmm yeah it's not keeping you on
longer any other questions we're getting
on Twitter hashtag seen it live yeah I
will keep looking but I'm not seeing a
heck of a lot here maybe if I was you
Facebook and I was connecting better
with the people I'm not it's about
building relationships but this and I
don't have much here well let's see one
thing about the photo things you were
talking about wasn't that coming soon I
was making some notes on my computer
here about things that were coming like
like very very soon it all felt like it
was within weeks or the next month with
the oculus venues the live concert that
that was happening at the end of the
month you interactive 3d posts are gonna
be coming well not next month yeah you
bring objects on Facebook camera with AR
that whole thing what's that you buy a
mixer for somebody this is this is the
night to do it I guess I have to buy a
mixer now and I have to give it to some
wiggles send it to you and we'll see we
actually want to talk virtually about it
as opposed in real life yes
no rather talking in real life is a
terrible idea for sure yeah but they
also did a lot of AR AR was like a big
thrust that was you know are in the
presentation the 3d photos things it's
sometime in the summer that's when
that's coming out the whole memory
system thing is very interesting space I
think we're getting into I mean I know I
say black mirror but it is the
interesting space of just like you know
encouraging you to upload more so that
way you do have those you know four
years ago do you remember doing this
thing you know I got a Facebook reminder
five years ago on this very day I got
Google glass to review that was say five
years ago we're all talking about the
weird privacy implications of having a
camera on your face here we are now five
years later talking about different
kinds of privacy implications and weird
features and putting in other kinds of
tech on your face so how much changes in
five years I don't know but if only I
could reconstruct that memory and
actually live that day yeah that's where
they're going I'm at the Occulus site
right now because it's available for the
oculus goes we have a pre-sale
rheilffordd excuse me and you to see all
these happy happy people in these
headsets I don't know when I put my
headset on I don't know what anybody
else is looking like maybe they're happy
or unhappy but giving me rabbit ears
everyone I'm assuming everyone is
thrilled when you are in VR clearly yes
look at this it's hilarious this you
would bump your head on this I'm hearing
you describe it it's nice really I mean
they try to make it more social and that
like I keep saying about VR it's so
isolated and trying to find a social way
in facebook
to make sure that it is not just you in
a room although they do explain you can
watch things together and you can watch
movies together you can watch sports
together still so singular it's like it
ok you guys I'm not I can't really see
you this let me know oh there we go
it just seems not natural I don't know
how that's gonna work but hey if I could
play boggle with you and always
forgetting it I think it works better
for ya if you want to play boggle with
your you know cousin overseas or
something like that if you're in a room
with a bunch of other people and you're
strapping in a VR headset then yeah
you're taking yourself out of that
conversation by looking at the hardware
for this I think they at least got a lot
of things right for VR that could help
it push more into the mainstream than
maybe some of the other hardware has
been out there before it's not using the
phone so you don't have to like strapped
in the phone that's less for you to do
you just put the thing on and that that
makes it easier you don't have to buy a
really expensive PC so wait and yeah we
were talking before $200 maybe that's
not our price point but maybe it is for
a lot of people just baby steps right
it's baby steps to give you more reasons
alright before we wrap let's take a step
back from where you were before it
started to now would your overall
takeaways and feelings think that
Facebook mitigated some of the bad press
by deducing all kinds of silly features
the dog one of the the hardware being
available right now I think they did a
good show showing off what to expect
from Facebook over time they kept
hitting on privacy they kept explaining
hey look we want to make you safe and
they try to make because have that all
feel good moments and about
relationships and interconnections and
all that stuff they I think they did a
decent job with that yeah I mean I think
from from a reporter perspective
I appreciate that Mark Zuckerberg
started the presentation and spent an
extended time of the presentation
talking about the tough issues and that
to me at least conveyed the fact that he
wasn't tone deaf about how bad things
had been more recently and you know
hopefully he they are gonna address the
stuff and continue to address mm-hmm
I was I was pleasantly surprised that
when they introduced dating on on
Facebook it actually wasn't as creepy as
it could have been at least from the
surface of how much is involved it's not
just you know scanning you to figure out
what kind of person you are because they
could do that they have the data to
match you with someone based on what
their computer thinks instead it's
something that you choose to do and you
can see people in a certain event to go
to so I'm like alright maybe they're
getting the point maybe they're getting
the message about caring a little bit
more about how they're using their data
wisely and then another takeaway was you
know looking at all the different ways
that these developers it was for
developers but how developers can put
their brands and their businesses into
our messenger more and into our stickers
of our whatsapp and Instagram moments I
think we're gonna just be seeing more
advertisements in new ways maybe not the
same ways but they're finding ways to
still make money
all right well definitely I think that's
gonna be it for us over there now be
sure though to stay with CNET all week
long you know we're gonna be coverage
for a couple days gave you an analysis
of our takes on all these experiences
thank you for watching thanks for
venting with us and being part of this
big therapy session
thanks to i-isn't Ben for getting us
through it all and be sure to keep
refreshing seen that all week long for
fa coverage I'm Bridget Carey Amaya's
actor I'm Ben Fox ribbon alright thanks
for watching guys yeah
well how do you sustain a business model
in which users don't pay for your
service senator we run ads if I'm if I'm
mailing emailing within whatsapp is that
every form your advertisers no we don't
see any of the content in whatsapp
that's fully encrypted right the is
there some algorithm it spits out some
information to your ad platform and then
let's say I get a we don't Facebook do
not see the senator I think the answer
to your specific question is if you've
messaged someone about Black Panther and
whatsapp it would not inform their been
reports that Facebook can track and
users internet browsing activity even
after that user has logged off of the
Facebook platform can you confirm
whether or not this is true senator I
want to make sure I get this accurate so
probably better to have my team follow
up but you don't know these I know that
these people use cookies on the Internet
and that you can probably correlate
activity between between sessions we do
that for a number of reasons including
security and including measuring ads to
make sure that the ad experiences are
the most effective which of course
people can opt out of well Facebook
offered to all of its users a blanket
opt-in to share their privacy data with
any third party users
congresswoman yes that's how our
platform works you have to opt in to
sign into any app before you use it
could somebody call you up and say I
want to see John Kennedy's file
absolutely not
could you not not could you not would
you do it could you do in theory you
have the right to put my data a name on
my data and Sharaf somebody I do not
believe we have the right to do that
senator the data is in the systems you
have the ability technically I think
someone could do that but that would be
a massive breach so we would never do
that
