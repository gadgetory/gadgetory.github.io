look at today this is the Yale assure
Bluetooth smart lock and it's a keyless
lock you can see there's no place to put
a key in this thing whatsoever it's just
reliant on that touchpad and on the app
enabled smart it's available for iOS and
Android devices now the way you use this
lock is pretty simple you can just tap
on it to wake that touchpad up and then
punch in one of your pre-programmed
codes it can support several of those
code you can assign one for each person
you can make those codes time-sensitive
so that only let somebody in on a
certain day or at a certain time you can
also use the app as sort of a digital
key you can see that purple key hanging
there for the door if I tap that
activate key button I can then tap the
lock and get in with just one tap or you
can use what's called the twist and go
feature where you rotate your phone 90
degrees to activate the key in the same
way so you rotate your phone and then
you tap the lock to get in now this
wasn't that great of a feature in my
test it didn't work that regularly or
consistently I had to kind of fling my
phone around a lot to get it to work
before it would finally let me in I
found it a lot easier just to tap that
button so probably some more fine-tuning
needed on that a couple other qualms I
had were that you can't actually see the
status of the lock inside the app it
won't tell you if the door is locked or
unlocked so if you're lying in bed at
night you can't remember if you lock the
door you can't just open the app and
check there's also no way to use the app
itself to lock and unlock the door from
the far so if you remember that you left
the door unlocked while you're in bed
and you want to grab your phone and
press a button to lock the door you
can't do that with this lock you can
only unlock it at the door by activating
that key mode and then touching the
touch pad at $200 this is a lock you
might consider if you're into that
keyless design that'll stop a thief from
picking his way in but I'd rather wait
and hold out for other options in the
keyless category the quick-set obsidium
that we saw at CES is coming out this
summer has a much more minimalist design
and probably a better app judging from
other quick set product that i've tested
so i'm gonna wait for that one before
recommending this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
