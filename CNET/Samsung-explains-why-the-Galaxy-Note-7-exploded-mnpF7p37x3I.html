will focus on the negative electrodes
that are in the corner of the cell
closest to the negative tab for the
second part of our discussion attention
will be focused on the positive tab
between the the interface between the
positive tab and the weld and the welds
and the rest of the cell our
investigation into root cause for the
failure of cell of the cells provided by
manufacturer a showed that damage to the
outermost windings of the negative
electrode closest to the negative tab of
the cell was the most likely cause for
the thermal failures through measurement
and observation it was found that the
negative electrodes were damaged because
the design of the cell pouch did not
provide enough room in the CT images on
the right side of this slide there are
arrows that point out the locations of
the pouch the top image is of a cell
from manufacturer a it can be seen that
the curvature of the pouch causes it to
come in contact with the negative
electrodes causing the electrodes to be
bent over in contrast the bottom image
is of a self or manufacturer B showing
that the pouch extends well beyond the
ends of the negative negative electrodes
and provides enough room negative
electrode damage like this is
undesirable because it can put strain on
the separator causing separator failure
and cell faulting or it can cause
negative active material delamination
that can upset the local capacity
balance resulting in plating and
potential self faulting cell faulting is
a well-known route to the types of
thermal failure that were seen in these
cells exponents findings related to the
thermal failures of cells from
manufacturer B showed that manufacturing
defects on the welds of the positive tab
were able to bridge the space between
the positive tab and the neighboring
negative electrode resulting in cell
faulting and in some instances thermal
runaway the weld defects were related to
the height of the features left behind
by the ultrasonic welder used to attach
the positive tab to the positive
electrode current collector normal
swelling and contraction of the
electrodes during charge and discharge
forces the weld defect features into the
opposing negative electrode short
circuit between the weld defect feature
on the positive tab and the copper of
the negative electrode results in
heating of the cell at high states of
charge the cell heating results in
thermal runaway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
