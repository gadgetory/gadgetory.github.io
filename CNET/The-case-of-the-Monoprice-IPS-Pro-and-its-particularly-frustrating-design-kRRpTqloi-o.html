27 inch monitor with a 2560 x 1440
resolution and a five-hundred-dollar
price after spending a few hours with it
looking at movies games and just surfing
the web so far I'm pretty disappointed
first off the monitor has some of the
most frustrating design problems I've
ever seen it includes tilt and swivel
but getting the screen to do either
requires that you hold down the foot
stand while employing your back core and
arms into the mix shouldn't be this hard
to do something as simple as tilting the
screen back also the screen wobbles a
lot even when simply pressing the OSD
buttons the panel is too close to the
neck of the display making it really
difficult to access the connections
especially with no pivot or screen
height options also the power court uses
an annoying dongle design that keeps
coming unplugged whenever I try to
access the connections and with nowhere
to hide your cables well I just hope
you're a fan of permanent eyesores you
probably aren't but you won't really
have a choice here they are SD is
confusing to navigate and doing things
like lowering the red green or blue
should be simple and intuitive but it
just feels incredibly frustrating and
confusing here collections include DVI
displayport VGA and HDMI there's also an
audio port for the built-in speakers
there's an overabundance of green that
was most obvious from watching movies
but was noticeable when looking at games
as well I'll spend some time tweaking
the settings before I write the full
review so far this isn't promising check
out the full review once it's written at
cnet com this is eric franklin and this
has been a first look at the monoprice
IPS glass panel pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
