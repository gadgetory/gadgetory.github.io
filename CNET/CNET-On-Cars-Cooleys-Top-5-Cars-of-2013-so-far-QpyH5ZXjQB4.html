what's your favourite car you've driven
lately
that is a surprisingly tough question
because to me a great car is one that
succeeds at what it's set out to do not
win some industry-wide popularity
contest
I'm Brian Cooley with my top 5 favourite
cars I've driven in the first half of
2013 based on that essential litmus test
number 5 the Mazda 6 the new one let's
give the Miata a rest for a minute and
shine some light on this all-new 6 it
went from 0 to 60 in terms of styling
inside and out
it was once one of the dopiest looking
cars in its class now it's about the
most handsome and possibly most
comfortable the SKYACTIV engine
technology is very smart but a little
hard to explain to consumers in less
than a half an hour and it's not a
standout as a sporting car but I'll tell
you what I think I would drive past a
slew of Toyota and Honda dealers if I
was in the market for a midsize sedan
this guy's worth a look number 4 the BMW
750li were raising the price here a bit
I love the 750 because it's a big car
that gets smaller when you press it at
one moment it's this big pompous opulent
thing that says uh-huh I make more money
in the time it takes you to key this car
then you'll make all day and then it
turns into this quick nimble Road
machine at a moment's notice
and then back again the styling has been
sexier and the price lower but the long
wheelbase 750 is really a car for all
seasons number three the New Beetle
Cabrio I'm a big enough man to admit I
love this new new New Beetle I've lost
track the ragtop no less I was expecting
a disaster active VW EOS but instead I
found a really nice driving car with
real drivable power great audio a
convertible top that makes you laugh at
the weather and the styling the New
Beetle should have had from the
beginning it's a fun car without being
silly VW's cabin tech remains nothing to
write home about but the coming eye
beetle version from
pwhen Apple should change that number to
the Subaru BRZ the BRZ is a simple
proposition it's meant to zip along
twisty roads making a great noise
hanging this little rump out once in a
while and inviting you to use all of its
OOP
which isn't much a 200 horse and 151
foot-pounds of torque but that's what
sports cars are all about being a little
bit less so you connect with the road a
little bit more the cabin of the BRZ has
none of the charm of classic sports cars
and if you're over 30 everyone will
think you're borrowing your kids car
when you drive by but for 25 grand or so
you'll have enough left over to buy a
Mazda 6 as well but my number one
favorite car so far in 2013 is the
head-turning Cadillac ATS Cadillac has
for a while had this inferiority complex
about the Europeans really the Germans
it's a neurosis recent caddies have been
healing but they've never been quite
able to wash off the stink of the Tommy
Bahama set the 80s does it it's the
first really honest original Cadillac in
a long time completing this path of
redemption they started back in 1999
it doesn't just exist as a comparison to
something from Germany that it's almost
as good as QED is one of the most
promising cabin tech platforms out there
two of the three engines they offer on
this car are modern and very cool and
cadillac has finally dialed down that
creased and chromed look to great effect
I can live without the driver's seat
that vibrates these nonsensical warnings
to your butt but in general Cadillac can
stop seeing its shrink to stay on top of
all my new favorite hi-tech cars
