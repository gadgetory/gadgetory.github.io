confused about what fuel to fill your ID
with is the android-powered receiver the
best head unit for your android phone
and what's the holdup on the development
of a certain iOS app we're about to
discuss the answer with all those
questions and more on cnet roadside
assistance this is episode number 47 yes
for the first of march 2012 I'm antuan
goodwin alongside senior editor wayne
cunningham and we got mitchell chang at
the controls so let's just kind of jump
right into it his first question has
actually got me scratching my head a
little bit comes in from Cody he says at
the end of your most recent show there
was a comment made about electrolyzing
and burning hydrogen if some questions
questions about efficiency aside would
such a system allow for the burning of
built up gunk without the need to use
detergent and or other fuel additives if
so would it not be a worthwhile
consideration for divisions more
concerned with greenhouse numbers than
horsepower see the prius 2 volt or
Volkswagen as a side note I have stood
beside modern 200 plus mile gallon cars
weight 200 plus mile per gallon cars
because they would not survive wait I
think he's just saying that the whole
toted mile per gallon cars things most
of the theories they wouldn't work in
his local winner in Canada where things
get very cold any 50 wouldn't know so
they wouldn't be able to up a hill yeah
so he says the biggest concern for some
of these vehicles is the way the driver
is an extra 10 pounds I can change the
efficiency and as we all know yeah I get
fatter every year yeah they even the 40
mile per gallon cars if you load them up
with you know about 45 people you might
because that's it that's almost the
weight of the car right there right or
half the weight of the car anyway it's a
lot of stuff as so last week we talked a
little bit about about one of these
systems where and you find these
mentioned online and some people spam
email you with them saying that you can
add a hydrant electrolyzer to your car
so you fill up a water tank use the
current from the cars generator to
electrolyze the hydrogen funnel that
hydrogen into the fuel system and you'll
get better mileage I don't think the
math
he works there but Cody here is saying
that went this work to clean up the gunk
that gets you builds up in your engine
carbon buildup stuff like that whether
would it were not I don't think it's the
most I don't think it's a it's the it's
really a little complex it's you know
like flooding spies with a I don't know
a shotgun yeah so it was like they're
simpler ways to get rid of the conch is
what you're saying yeah for example I
guess a Shell Oil their shell gasoline
they've got some nitrogen enriched
gasoline that they doubt supposed to
clean up your car better and in fact all
gasolines have detergents in them and I
don't think that seems like an easier
solution than adding this whole
apparatus to your car right it's kind of
funny though because the fedora
technology that you said it's kind of
see in the those last eight pages of
like a car magazine on those like just
pages of pages of dumb ads for things
like weather mats for your car and it's
just like something dumb like an
electric supercharger I remember when I
was a when I was first starting to get
into modifying cars I'd see all these
ads for like electric turbos and it's
just you know the common knowledge was
you stay away from those things because
someone just bought like a bilge pump or
something and they basically bolted up
your car and doesn't do anything would
actually impede the flow of air yeah but
then like you know now we start seeing
that automakers are starting to take
things like that seriously electric
superchargers are possibly a thing that
someone's developing hydrogen
electrolysis is that sort of sort of
same thing for me it's just like oh yeah
sure so you just add this thing to your
car right squirt some water into your
intake and all of a sudden everything's
better you've got you know XP like 10
miles per gallon as a result of this but
I mean there is some science behind it i
think that's interesting well there
certainly is and i would hope that the
engineers the scientists at the car
companies that are looking for every way
of making their cars more efficient have
considered this at least and if they
have you know hopefully they've done the
math and said will this actually work i
mean if it was a silver bullet i would
assume they would implement yeah they do
it I mean who wouldn't want to like be
first to market with that yeah but I
think what's interesting is that the
the the actual science is way more
complicated often than the thing you
find the back eight or magazine Valley
you know this sort of like yeah water
injection system machine the magazine is
just like a fish tank pump and a nozzle
that eres tu no eres Eliza's the water
oh yeah now you've got hydrogen right
because hydrogen's and water two
molecules in there right um but then the
actual science is a lot more complicated
and then probably a little bit beyond my
journalist pine yeah well and as long as
yeah cleaning out your card to you know
not only would you have to add the
system to your card or the carmaker
would have to add the system to the car
you'd also have to along with filling up
the gas fill up your water tank right
frequently to make sure there's enough
hydrogen file into the system the to you
to make the system work so do you really
want to fill up an extra tank short
answer to your question Cody no yes not
yet at the very least they're definitely
easier ways to go about doing it so
let's move on to the next question this
comes in from cash and banting t'en
illinois says hi guys is one to know
your opinion on a topic doesn't focus on
car tech so very much it says do you
think that people should use anything
other than 87 octane fuel in a modern
car my opinion is that a TI 87 octane is
just fine for v6 or smaller engine and
that higher octane zar good for v8 with
the way modern car engines are made this
day and age do you think you get any
better performance or a better miles per
gallon using different grades of octane
i just bought a 2012 v6 dodge challenger
by the way and he also tells us keep the
great car tech coverage first of all i
think your scales a little off yeah
you're basically wrong there and see
assuming the number of cylinders has
anything to do with the octane yeah it's
nothing to do with displacement
everything to do with compression ratios
what happens is the higher octane fuel
has what are called knock additives in
it and basically they keep the fuel from
pre detonating under high compression so
what happens is as you compress anything
gets hotter so if you have an engine
with like a really high like 11 to 1
compression ratio there's a chance that
cheap fuel will actually detonate before
it reaches full compression and that's
when
you run into knock and in a vehicle
without a knock sensor or some sort of
the ability to adjust its timing you run
into issues where you can potentially
damage the engine so like a turbocharged
engine that has like a lot of the crims
a lot of air into the cylinder or modern
day like engines that have really high
compression ratios I can't think of any
off top of the hit but they get up to 11
almost 12 to 1 compression ratios most
cars sit around what 10 or 9 yeah yeah I
don't remember but yeah when you have
cars that have really high compression
ratios that's where the the higher
octane fuel comes into into to play the
thing is a lot of big dumb v8 and don't
really have high compression ratios
because they don't need it they're big
dumb v8 so pouring like they're really
expensive fuel into like a six or seven
year old v8 engine is completely wasting
your money yeah and even though say the
v6 Dodge has that that's got the 3.5
let's ride 3.5 liter v6 is that the kind
of scene 2 story and I nuin yeah then
the new pentastar engine and that's not
a particularly high compression engine
that's a standard compression right my
rule of thumb is that if you open the
the fuel tank and there's a thing that
says use premium gas you use the premium
gas I don't think many automakers will
tell you to use more expensive gas if
you didn't need it the thing is cars are
smart enough that if you put in cheaper
gas it'll figure it out but you'll cost
yourself a little efficiency in doing so
because the system will have to run
inefficiently it'll probably retarded
timing yeah or whatever it has to do to
keep itself from damaging itself on the
cheaper fuel yeah but so I would say
there there's sometimes if you just I
mean you're not going to save more than
like 30 cents on a fill-up by know about
a buck on a fill-up maybe by stepping
down to the cheap fuel but if your car
doesn't require the expensive fuel then
you basically are wasting a buck by
stepping up to the more expensive right
now the kind of cars that general I do
require the higher octane fuel are well
we just talked about a Ferrari in our
previous show which probably has very
high compression so you probably pretty
much one of these racing fuel in that
one
and cars that generally sport car type
of things with their really generating a
lot of horsepower out of smaller
displacement for example or just trying
to get a ton of horsepower out of those
vehicles and you know then you know that
that's generally when you have higher
compression and you want that better
octane fuel I think something like the M
but you know if you look at like you
know the modern Corvette for example I
don't think that's particularly high
compression v8 die don't think the
modern Corvette even s for premium q
yeah yeah I don't think it does either
it's a big v8 yeah they're getting away
a lot of displacement like what 20
liters or something but yeah it's like
it's a big engine but it's like a big
pushrod engine the technology and that's
really old yeah so it's like they're
kind of getting away with like using the
the old-school formula just like Oh
we'll just add more displacement don't
more fuel into it and that'll make it
more powerful yeah as opposed to
shrinking the engine down or adding
turbocharging or basically that I think
the tolerance is on on extremely high
compression engines are kind of are a
bit more precise than you would on like
a big engine with a little compression
so it's more expensive to kind of build
that into cars and so I think automakers
are kind of just starting to come around
to it but even even then a lot of those
engines a lot of those engines still
don't ask for the premium fuel I think
this is a Hundert one of the Hyundai's
has a pretty high compression on on the
veloster turbo doesn't ask for premium
does it ah that was literally is Genesis
right it was just turbo I don't know if
the Genesis turbo s for premium if not
they definitely have two different
ratings for premium and for cheap fuel
to give you the option yeah I think yeah
with Hyundai and keep trying to sell a
lower price car they're probably not
really going to try to make you buy
premium gas cuz that's going to go
against the whole theme of the car but
you look at something like a Porsche
where they're you know 3.8 liters and
they're getting massive you know 400
horsepower out of then certainly you're
going to want to use high octane in that
the Genesis gives two different so it
can run on cheap fuel yeah but then it
can also run on premium and if you're
buying a Porsche then
by the just getting the expensive fuel
is basically another way to show that
you're richer than everyone else at a
gas station go ahead and pick up that
gold pump actually have someone else do
it for you pay someone else to pump for
you are in a Porsche no self service so
I guess that's we've spent enough time
on that question I really hope that into
the answered it what else if we got here
Keith actually wrote us about the eye on
road app that you reviewed recently and
or was it so recently it was late last
year not too long ago wait last year
yeah and so this is keith is complaining
that iron Road that should be there
they're working on it for the iphone
that they only had over the android when
you reviewed it there was a side there's
a sign-up sheet on the on their website
that says like sign up to know when the
iphone version comes out but Keith goes
on a rant saying talking about the the
the iphone version of it says it has
been in development according to the
website for at least several months now
it seems definitely for at least the
last four to six months it can't be that
difficult converting the software code
from android to apple can it if it's not
by all means keith do it you'll get the
iOS version of vion road as soon as we
get our android version of instagram
they're very different like software you
know conversion isn't really what you'd
call easy they're also probably a couple
of things that they're having to deal
with i mean the iphone i always does let
you do multitasking but it's not exactly
the same kind of multitasking as you
would have on the android so doing
something like running this app in the
background is probably proving tricky to
the developers but there are I think
there are other apps that will do a
similar thing if you don't like I on
road I think there's a drive may tap
drive matric i think i'm going to talked
about it before but i think they're full
version has some sort of a recorder
that'll let you like see what's going on
with a vehicle in front of you here we
go is this it and so this is an iphone
app that will I thought running on a JVC
receiver and if drive mate safety cam
yeah this gives you a warning if you're
about to hit
somebody right so if you can't wait for
I on road drive mate safety Kam drive
mate one word safety Kam one word
available in the iTunes Store does the
same thing it watches the road ahead of
you for vehicles it lets you know how
much distance you have between you and
them and it gives you a warning if you
get too close it also has this very
weird looking tron like interface I'm
gonna drop the link in the show notes
right now because it just popped into my
head I've dropped it into the wrong
field now we have a another question now
this is a sweet answer that one this
next question is from Chicago engineer
so he signs himself so I think engineers
are the kind of people that want to know
what car technology he says I have a
2000 for is 300 Lexus and I'd like to
I'd like to be upgrading my stock radio
system i have a droid x and aidan asus
transformer one that I can't live
without and would like my car to be my
third Android device here are the few
apps I would like my stereo to run
pandora google map internet radio apps
dog catcher etc i'm considering the
parrot asteroid or a prey do to pending
a review are there anything else
available aside from these two units
anything upcoming this year anything
like tomtom our garmin that had pandora
like apps well here's the thing for f
radio to first of all it's not powered
by android it just lets you use the the
what is the mirror link sort of
functionality that you can get on an
android device and the asteroid is crap
i've learned that over the last couple
of weeks since i've done that review and
i'm actually thinking about going back
and updating it I've its skill in the
aveo I still had it in there and I've
had to deal with it for a number of
weeks at least any week that I wasn't
reviewing a regular car and if you've
already got a perfectly good smartphone
it doesn't do anything that your phone
doesn't already do all you really need
is a cradle in a bluetooth stereo and
you're fine the screen smaller than the
one on your android device the google
map sucks it doesn't really have any
sort of like streaming apps outside of
the
the one that it has on there but I mean
the ones that are on your phone do
exactly the same thing I would say don't
even bother trying to find an
android-powered car stereo if you love
your droid x and you've got all these
apps that you already really love to use
just use your phone so find yourself a
bluetooth a car stereo that supports
bluetooth a2dp for about 150 bucks save
the x 4 250 bucks you would have spent
on the Pandora and the parrot asteroid
or even on the App radio too if you
don't really need a gigantic screen and
do something else with it yeah i would
suggest as far as this car goes along
with the new head unit that has the
bluetooth a2dp is get a good clip for
the phone something may be mounted on
the dash yeah so you can easily slide
your phone you jump in the car you slide
your phone in that that clip the cradle
and you know you're ready to go yeah so
these because he goes on and he starts
talking about things like because the
the asteroid requires that you you know
plug in a 3g dongle or something that
you know you get like a clear 4g and
leave it in your car you can't tether
the phone i tried it every other ways
though the weather though the connection
this in your phone is useless at that
point so now you're dealing with like a
completely separate data plan you don't
want to deal with any of that just find
yourself a nice single din
bluetooth-enabled car stereo something
and maybe Sony or pioneers lineup alkali
and I don't think a lot of their models
have Bluetooth built into it just yet
but have to double check that but and
then just save the money suction cup
your phone to your dashboard if that's
what you got to do and just you'll be
way happier than you will be struggling
with the the asteroid and I mean I
haven't tested the app radio 2 yet so I
can't really speak on that all right
Matt actually writes us about he says
he's got the recently purchased a 2010
jeep wrangler sahara with the infinity
sound system he's wanting to upgrade to
something that will offer better i phone
connectivity so this must mean the head
unit not so much the the speakers are
anything he's not really interested in
added connectivity with the phone
although it would be nice bonus
more more concerned with playing music
and charging the phone like to keep the
cost under three hundred dollars what do
we can we suggest that will not require
too many modifications 300 bucks the
first thing that pops into my head is
that you don't really care about
anything else charging the phone playing
music you don't particularly care about
you know making phone calls um-hmm where
I go alpine alpha an ITA x 305 it
doesn't have a CD player I don't know if
you have CDs laying around you'd lose
your CD player in that case but then
there's also the Sony tune Trey units
that are also really good again mech
free so you don't have a CD player I
don't know if he needs a CD player well
I'm looking at a photo of the Jeep here
and it's got a standard doubled in the
spot every hundred book price point
means you're not getting a screen so
you're sticking with a single din unit
right so you need a single din and one
of those adapter brackets that gives you
a little pocket or something underneath
yeah it'll be like 50 bucks yeah for the
less than that even I think I've seen
that the market and that's fallen out so
much I think you can get like a car kit
for like what 25 bucks now the wire
harness is like seven you do it yourself
right so sprinkler it can't be that hard
yeah search around Crutchfield there
there's so many options that you could
get to get a good yeah I phone
connectivity I mean that's that's pretty
much standard these days with the
aftermarket head units yeah i mean i
would say find something that if you if
you go in one of the sony units there
any x line that has Bluetooth built into
it you get iphone connectivity you get
bluetooth so you'll be able to make
calls even if you don't want to you
never know like I you make it like a
like a new girlfriend she might like to
talk on the phone all the time and you
just put her on speakerphone and hit
mute tues what I would also suggest to
is get the bluetooth audio streaming
system because again it's not going to
run you more than 300 bucks alright and
what you'll find is what I found is
driving a lot of cars is sure I can hook
my iphone up to a cable in the car and
get all that Connor or the control via
the head unit which is nice but it's
just so much easier after a while you
could just kind of get over it you just
want to jump in the car you got some
music
already you know have your iphone
playing random or whatever and if the
bluetooth streaming is all up bluetooth
audio streaming you jump in and the
music's playing already and you're
listening to all your favorite music
anyway that's already on the phone well
you don't get to like play with the
knobs yeah so you'd have to actually
touch your phone if you decided this
music sucks and I want a completely
different playlist you have to actually
touch your phone but the advantage to
getting to making sure that you have
bluetooth streaming built-in is that you
know next year when the iphone five
comes out and they switch over from the
30-pin dock connector or something it
was like one reared rumor that are going
to dish the 30-pin dock connector we
just switch over bluetooth in just now
you know you're using bluetooth with a
few decide to jump to android or windows
mobile or blackberry yeah you can still
do that anybody who gets into your car
can just pay her up and start listening
so you have an option even though you
don't necessarily need it and I'm pretty
sure when cost you any more than like an
extra 20 bucks on top of one that didn't
have it so quick lightning round here
what brand would you go with Sony Alpine
uh I would probably go for under the 300
buck price point I like the sony i like
their tune tray units mmm and i also
like they're there emmy xbt units but
again it would really depend on whether
you wanted a CD player and not which one
of those you go with yeah i think i've
got the iphone your play music off of it
you don't really want a CD player
anymore nope but it's always nice to
have yeah and you got one more email
that i was kind of more of a
overcorrection than a question it says i
was listening to your latest roadside
assistance and heard you mention a
listener who thought his foreign he
thought he had a sport transmission
reprogrammed he said he checked the Ford
website and saw that it was listed there
or something to that effect and you
theorized that it was a sink upgrade and
he was on the sink my ride website what
he's actually talking about is the Ford
owner section of their website that
lists all of the dealer performed
service to a car based on the car's vin
number linked to an account the owners
can create his 2008 mercury milan is the
same way a choice by the way and anytime
you take it to the dealer they enter the
service info even if it's just an oil
change you can view it online it's like
a mini carfax format that allows you to
manually
enter any service if you go away from
the dealer and he also talks about that
service letting you scheduled
maintenance based on mileage federate
federer you just wanted to make sure
that we weren't confusing that with a
sink my red website right I didn't even
know that with her that's a cool feature
actually and nice to see and this is
something we don't certainly when we're
reviewing cars it's not an issue we look
often have cause to look into or deal
with but yeah I mean and I'm sure other
companies are on to this that because
partly if you have your car registered
with dealer and every service update
they do or upgrade they do goes on to
this website then they can have these
appointments and say like hey just bring
your car in get some pate of some more
money is time for the study found on the
real changes exactly and it is a way the
dealer's used to maintain or you know
keep customers right but I mean it also
i'm sure it helps the resale value of
the car if you laid it's basically the
electronic equivalent of that notebook
my dad told me to keep in the glove
compartment of every car yeah that i've
owned where it's just like if you change
the oil your write it in the book it's
always everything's written in the book
and then when you go to sell the vehicle
you can say like oh yeah i've done all
these things right you have a logbook
right there yeah or the bundle of
receipts every oil change receipt on yes
yeah but there's the electronic version
of that so if you've ever decided to
fill your oh wait mercury milan
sapersteins popping into my head you can
go like oh here's the vin number go and
you can see that it's had every
scheduled you know maintenance and and
an update that it's supposed to have
yeah I like that I like that they
actually are keeping this online keep it
in the cloud sort of thing where yeah
you have all your maintance records up
there great british or other automakers
do it you just yes something that we
ever look at yeah i don't see why they
wouldn't that's it for this week's
emails if you've got a question a
comment or if you just want to tell us
we're awesome you can send us an email
at car tech at cnet com you can also
leave us a voicemail we don't have any
this week but we may have some next time
you can leave that 866 401 see any tea

wanted to check out any links or
whatever or even check out previous
shows over at car tech cnet com you can
also follow the show on
