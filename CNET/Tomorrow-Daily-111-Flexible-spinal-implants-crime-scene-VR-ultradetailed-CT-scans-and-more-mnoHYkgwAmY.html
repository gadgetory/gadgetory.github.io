paralyzed people walk again vr is now
going to help people solve court cases
by getting the jury onto the scene of
the crime ooh and GE has a new CT
scanner that is showing our insides in
crazy good detail this is all pizza and
disdain mm-hmm sera daily
citizen through the internet welcome to
tomorrow daily the best geek talk show
in the known universe I'm your host
Ashley Skeletor amis always punch in the
sky pilgrim at the legend Colin Armas
yeah I'm here I'm excited we get to talk
about PR you got a haircut it fell off
yeah it's just well like every six weeks
your hair just sheds in your new cut
yeah you saw it money but yet it's too
short but it makes it so that it takes
the video a lot less time to load it's
so you're welcome America all over Lanka
wig yeah um we have a lot of really cool
stuff today like stuff that I'm super
duper interested in so let's not waste
any more time let's hit the headlines
okay I'm gonna try really hard not to
butcher this name because it's long and
it's not American so researchers at the
Ecole Polytechnique fédérale de
Lausanne in Switzerland that was pretty
good I feel like I got kind of close
there you did a little much anybody sure
and ok um so here about a year ago they
showed off this system that allowed
totally paralyzed rats to walk again and
so now they have a new flexible version
of that implant that is designed to
integrate with a human patients spinal
cord oh that's fantastic ok so check
this out this is crazy um and so that's
the implant it's totally flexible it's
stretchy it's implanted directly onto
onto the spinal cord so and these are
completely paralyzed rats that were able
to walk again which is insane this is
straight up future tech you guys it uses
electrodes to convey current to the
spinal cord so it tells tells it where
to move there's that there's more to it
than that if you want to see the details
you can jump over to cnet com there's a
whole description of how this works I
don't want to I don't get too deep into
it because I am obviously not a doctor
but it's really really awesome because
because of the fact that it's us
flexible and stretchy it actually there
is a lot less chance of it rejecting
like your body rejecting it and also and
also it last longer because it's not it
can kind of roll the punches it's not
getting you know
abrasive it's not taking a beating like
another implant would so it can kind of
roll with the movement of your spine
which is pretty amazing and they were
saying in these rats that they implanted
these flexible implants in the rats and
it lasted for two months which is a
really long time and they said there
wasn't really any degradation so now
they're saying human trials could start
as soon as June so people could start
walking again so potentially we might
start seeing completely paralyzed people
have the ability while that's okay
pretty amazing yeah that's pretty yeah
just amazing it's I'd be like we use the
word amazing a lot on the show but this
is actually amazing and um there's like
I said there's really good details over
on cnet and then also I have to say this
because I was really impressed with the
comment section of this article over on
cnet a lot of people were kind of
arguing the merits of well if you were
paralyzed would you rather have an
exosuit that that was able to move
around like a robot exosuit those
robotic exosuits that allow you to like
lift more or would you rather just have
the surgery and so they were going back
and forth about well I guess if you have
the implant taking doing something like
taking a shower or washing your face
would be much easier than having a robot
XO okay but they're good having an
exosuit would make other activities much
easier as opposed to just having the
ability to just walk like you'd be able
to do more things so I thought this was
really interesting conversation and I I
was super impressed by the comments I'm
not often impressed by internet comments
this was an occasion where I was and I
have to I had to give the internet
credit for that because it was a very
good conversation internet loves
exosuits yeah they do love exit but they
were also like it was a really
interesting kind of back and forth of
Ali what would you rather do this
exosuit would just kind of be lumbering
no matter if you're like sitting in a
restaurant or less you're a crowd it's
it's huge I'm sure it's cool to be able
like look like lifting your groceries
and things I mean you would probably
need something I think that they would
be very complementary to each other's
due to both so basically you would use
this flexible implant to just walk Go Go
have a meal you know do do things that
normal people do but if you want to do
something more like lift something or
build something then then you would use
an exosuit mm-hmm so I I mean but that's
just humanity humanity could just use
some exosuits I think those people just
want to be normal
yeah yeah super I agree and so I just
dismiss what's yours absolutely
incredible just super super awesome um
but yeah I just thought it was really
fascinating and from there we will move
on in the land of virtual reality story
number two okay story number two is is
great because this is totally that sort
of like wait we're going to use VR in
the future that's not just people
playing video games yeah well this one
they want to use it to help understand
and solve crimes in the courtroom like
it basically what this technology is
doing what they're using these VR
headsets what they want to use them for
is they want a strap a VR headset on to
a juror and put them at the scene of the
crime love that it's great because now
you know the lawyer doesn't have to
explain everything in excruciating
detail some jurors can't necessarily
wrap their head around it because they
they don't admit necessarily cook no
crime one also it would be really
disturbing for some people to see the
the pictures from the scene of the crime
like that's really upsetting to people
well there's a lot of workarounds for
that sort of thing such as you know they
can kind of not show everything
graphically yeah also we don't know who
committed the crime or what so they kind
of every single person that is a person
in this has like no defining features
there's have like a not a blob but
there's human shape yeah like I'd like
the sign on the bathroom I use a pen
there's like a little body and that's
you know yeah I got it but another thing
that they're hoping that this will solve
is like having to explain a bullet
trajectory like where the locations of
where people yeah because like drawing a
picture whatever but virtual reality
really putting in there letting them
walk around the scene the crime I'm
explaining it to them I would imagine
even like we'll cross examination would
also be really helpful if they put on
face off thursdays this what you saw
like what did you see oh I saw this here
I saw this here like that's really
interesting and that is a really good
use calling it the forensic hollow deck
it sounds really fantastic sit cuz
obviously they're gonna have to jump
through a lot of hoops to get this
starting to use as actual act like it's
tough to use things as as evidence in a
in a trial so it's there are gonna be a
lot of lawyers they're gonna be like
well wait wait wait objection Tehran are
one tiny tiny thing to defend their case
it's all like it's it's gonna be really
rough over over it's great sure I'm sure
for whatever crime that I
it that almost puts me in jail they'll
be using them when the precogs come to
get you for some future murder that
you're gonna commit we're gonna use this
and we're gonna we're gonna totally get
you we're gonna get you acquitted don't
don't do a precogs but this is totally a
great a great conversation point yeah
when you're talking about VR you could
talk about games you talk about this
solving crimes medical stuff we talked
earlier p on an we talked in an earlier
episode about how people would react you
remember that one it was like way way
early how people readers yeah the
shooter yeah where was like you you
could so they had a thing where there
was a shooter and he would come into an
art gallery and virtual reality and you
had two choices you could either let him
go to the top floor where he killed like
five people or the bottom floor we
killed one person and also you or
something like that was like you you had
a choice between like how many people he
killed and like only very few people a
lot of people like a couple people had
the elevator like stop Midway and that
was like they're there Oh yankl anybody
know they kinda cheated the system of
the Kobayashi Maru like it's a non
winnable situation but it was really
interesting him sort of a psychological
experiment but things like that like I
think even even there they're doing
things with VR for therapy as well oh
yeah the virtual reality to help people
with mental health issues which i think
is fantastic and maybe somebody can't go
somewhere because their you know their
drugs don't work and they haven't gotten
that that implant yet no and then they
could I was just talking talking on the
radio to somebody about about how
amazing it'll be for somebody to be able
to just pay like six bucks and take a
take a scuba diving tour maybe you're
afraid of open water take a scuba diving
tour of the Great Barrier Reef without
having to ever get in the ocean and like
that kind of stuff is I hate getting wet
the best part of virtual reality for me
so there we go obviously yeah the
footage forensics I check out the
footage it looks it looks a little weird
it doesn't look like you know you're on
see the set of CSI but I I like that
because it's like you said it's it's
it's one of those things where it can
remove a juror emotionally and they
could just look at it and say okay
here's the scene of a crime like this is
what they say happened here's the bullet
trajectories whatever like gun crimes
don't imagine this would be really good
for but ya know I really like this this
tax is pretty awesome okay so another
piece of future tech which is actually
here and
this and is working right now at a
hospital this is crazy I love the human
body I think it's so cool to look at all
these different you know anatomy books
inside oh yeah so GE has this new
revolution CT scanner and they released
was actually last week they released
these animated gifts and they are super
impressive yeah now not only does the
revolution CT scanner have the ability
to capture things we are normally able
to see in CT scans like organs bones
muscles that it can pull vascular flow
organ motion soft tissue and obviously
an incredible detail so here's the thing
about this scanner that makes it so cool
it reduces radiation levels by
eighty-two percent based on compared to
traditional methods so traditional see
chance like way lower radiation it uses
a kind of image image stabilization
technology to correct for patient
movement so one of the things that
people is complain about when they get
CT scans are you literally have to sit
like a hot dog in a tube and like you
can't move yeah breathe you can't do
anything and it's like an hour it's a
long time and so now they're saying
they're able to capture in one second
your entire pelvis and abdominal area
and it has this image stabilization
which makes it really easy for it to
read it's super clear and less radiation
and a lot less radiation so you don't
have to drink your new COO colas less
rads for everyone yeah let's read less
rads for everyone but he don't
apparently this thing's been in trials
for a couple years now and it was at
this hospital in Florida and they liked
it so much that in September of last
year they bought it they were just like
that we'll just keep an aryl just by who
did this hospital in Florida I've been
using it for trials and they liked it so
much they told you you know what just
yeah I'm we don't want you to take it
away we'll just buy it from you like
well just how much like they just asked
how much but it's pretty cool and this
is sort of a really good glimpse and do
you know how we can move forward in
terms of medical technology that
surgeries and stuff like sometimes the
CT scans especially with something like
the heart it's very very difficult to
capture because it's constantly moving
so you can't stop your heart in the
middle of a CT scan just to take a good
look at it so this image stabilization
supposedly will really help with things
like that big on health tech today yeah
kind of big on health tech say but I
realize crime
x yes scale is all about crime so and on
that note we're actually I got to tell
you what the hashtag of the day is
before we go on break the hashtag of the
day is TD holodeck and I know we've
mentioned the holodeck before but here's
this is a different question this is a
this is a life-or-death situation so if
you had to live in a simulation in a
virtual reality simulation for the rest
of your life to live out the rest of
your days in a VR simulation what would
be what would yours be I feel like it'd
be the sims you just live virtual
vertical I'm all I its virtual that's
meta is that super boring it's kind of
yeah it's kind of boring but I feel like
I would like it it's kind of weird I
think I was talking to Logan about this
earlier i think i live in just cause you
know the game just cause to know you
like basically grapple this stuff you're
basically flying around and shooting
right it's like being spider-man okay
but you blow stuff up and yeah good for
your whole life you'd want to live that
your whole life oh yeah I'm always want
I've always wanted a crazy unrealistic
grapple to shoot everywhere why walk or
drive any ages I've always wanted a
crazy and I learned crazy crazy
futuristic grapple some sort of hover
hover vehicle either board or that yeah
or a jetpack those are the things that I
want is that too much to ask it is so
far future kind of is um but maybe an
maybe after we come back from break it
won't be too much to ask we'll be right
back you've got to check out this video
before we go right before we jump in a
break this guy got this drone right for
the holidays or whatever and on his
first trip out it was about to crash
into a lake so check this out
was Mac to the show we are we've
returned still I'm sorry no no
hoverboards no I wonder if that guy who
caught the drone like maybe had a phone
in his pocket he just drove into the
water like what have you ruined his cell
phone he can just put notes on the drone
and send them to people if he wants to
talk about i'm sorry there enough oh
yeah that's gonna be the new carrier
pigeon you guys that's good that's
terrible um so it's Tuesday and we
didn't get to do it last week because
we're at CES it's been it's been a while
in about three weeks yeah um so it is
time for new releases
so january tends to be a pretty light
much in terms of releases but there's
okay cuz it's oscar stuff you know is
movies big movies already came out
there's some good stuff coming out i
mean things that are interesting things
you might want to see good stuff first
up if you have an xbox one evolves open
beta this week that is good that is
pretty good um it isn't no it's an open
beta so it's not the game but if you're
so inclined it looks really really good
they only had one level on the first the
the Alpha right I think so you know if
they have any more on this one uh you
know what I'm not sure I'll have to I I
have an xbox one so I was kind of
thinking I was gonna try to get into it
this weekend we're no match making that
was a huge issue in the a lot of people
complained about that while they were
there was matchmaking but you couldn't
match up with your friends right and
that was around as you had to play with
a bunch of like jerks such a random guy
yeah so hopefully they fix that you can
actually make a cool do you know how
cool it looks so you so also if you're
you know worried about that you can
check out live streams for this now so
yeah watch more of it if it's and now
that it's an open beta you can actually
watch on twitch like people can actually
broadcast it which is pretty cool I I
rock the house as any of this like you
know the four people but I am horrible
at the monster terrible demonic super
duper bad at the mott like I'm sitting
in the corner just like reading a book
I'm like no I'm a Monday yeah so things
like that um and then we also have a
couple movies coming out this week black
hat starring People's Sexiest Man Alive
Chris Hemsworth comes out he's not my
people's sexiest man alive well you know
he's like the minivan majority really
likes him maybe I'm elms they love their
chrysdale of their Thor okay let's just
put it that way I like Thor I mean I'm
I'm into it a little bit I like it I
like it better with a beard yeah he
looks like he'd hug you and you crush
all your bus but anyway black hat is
about a sacrifice worth is yeah hacker
hacker and obviously a great depiction
of what normal hackers look like I mean
clearly I see you guys that look like
this everyday what is he trying to hack
like what's the whole politic it's a
very exciting Michael Mann movie it's
all over the shop I'm sure there's gonna
be many as we're even just seeing in the
trailer lots of different locations lots
of different you know nice lady there's
a nice ladies way to love interest what
is a but what it's I don't know what the
stakes are looks like you know global
cyber crime
crazy i think its nukes is it nukes it's
gotta be noobs it's always new all right
all right and then another on the
opposite end of the spectrum going
analog American we need the poo oh and
not what not Paddington that is coming
up this weekend though American sniper
is coming out this weekend on okay so
here's the thing this trailer is intense
yeah like I my heart was racing when I
was watching it and really obviously
uncomfortable subject matter for a lot
of people but just the intensity of the
trailer like made me extremely nervous I
don't know that I'm gonna go see this in
theaters Rocket Raccoon as a sniper yeah
I look at the truck or I could and he
turned into a human a human boy and grew
up to be a sniper i've heard mixed
reviews on this have you really I have
heard i've heard mixed as well so i'm
not sure that I'm gonna go see this in
theaters but i figured i would let
people know it was coming out this
weekend yeah absolutely case they're
really into this or they want to go see
the stories based on true story if
you're not interested in that why don't
you catch up on some of the golden globe
winners yeah where some of the Oscar
thing can be nominated watch this
weekend you got lots of options Logan
and I are all about whiplash I'm so yeah
Birdman first man to go see a man I
still think that the best hotel is on
HBO right now yeah grand budapest hotel
beauty one best a comedy or musical
motion picture that's wes wes anderson
film the cookie coupe listen I love that
movie so much so whimsical and adorable
and the best really or the actual movie

pretty good stuff if you're interested
you're so inclined involved looks pretty
good check out the twitch oh yeah I'm in
your gang if you're getting in if you
don't get into the beta check out but
it's an xbox one remember its Xbox one
it's on the X bone um it's now time for
your user feedback

your favorite non-traditional show of
2014 was I saw someone said black mirror
but I'm sure you just qualified though
no no so hashtag TV globes uh rod dead
fish said my 2014 fave is absolutely
black mirror whoo but I also really
enjoyed high maintenance on vimeo which
i haven't seen I gotta check that out I
like I like asking these questions cuz I
find out about things that I didn't know
existed you know I mean kill your life
you did okay we're gonna we're gonna
keep going um Danny wrote to us and said
too many cooks too many cooks um yeah
holy it's really like that I think it
counts I think I'm hard listen it laughs
that's our audience for it really is um
ken John and pretty much the rest of the
internet responded house of cards touch
with an exclamation point that was just

really good um I really appreciate it so
many the guy said tomorrow daily it was
kind of adorable oh there's it was it
were my hot heart a little bit it's

scanner how warm my heart was it was
just like well your hearts still warm I
could like a campfire just rub your
hands get get warm by my heart did they
say any other cnet shows or only
tomorrow no only to our daily deal with
it um it's just it wait every other cnet
