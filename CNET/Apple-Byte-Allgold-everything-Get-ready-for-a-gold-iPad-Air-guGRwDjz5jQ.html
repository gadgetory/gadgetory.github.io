welcome to the apple pie for all the
good of bad inside the world of Apple
now since I heard a lot of Apple biters
feelings last week for keeping it real
with a month's worth of bad apples I'm
gonna try to stay away from iphone news
as we because some of you are just too
sensitive so let's talk iPads and the
next product we expect from Apple to be
announced in october according to
bloomberg and other reports the big a is
planning to introduce a gold model to
its ipad lineup for the next gen ipad
air there's no talk about the ipad mini
getting gold just yet but you can't do
this halfway Apple come on all gold
everything I love using that video now
didja times also reports that samsung
will be one of the suppliers for the
next iPad air and the rumored 12.9 inch
iPad pro starting later this year the
displays are expected to feature a
similar IPS technology to the current
iPads as well as anti-glare coating now
the ipad is one of my best travel
buddies and I'm all in for a larger iPad
screen that still fits in my bag alright
a lot of you keep asking me if it's the
right time to get an imac and I keep on
telling you to be a little more patient
especially after this news from nine to
five Mac reports a new line of IMAX with
ultra high-resolution retina displays
are in the late testing stages with
Apple the new IMAX are expected to be
even thinner than the current line that
could possibly even launch alongside OS
10 Yosemite later this fall so yes wait
for it and it's just been under two
years since the mac minis last update
but macrumors is reporting that Apple is
planning to possibly launch the next Mac
Mini alongside new iPads and OS 10 as
well all right Apple showed off the new
Apple watch for its first public
appearance at the Parisian fashion
boutique collette just for a day
customers were allowed to look but not
touch what's the fun in that taiwanese
new source apple daily reports the fruit
company is finalizing the details for
their watch before mass production of
the SmartWatch begins in January of 2015
alright the coop town kids have released
the OS 10 Yosemite gold master candidate
for developers indicating it's just
about ready to go public the fourth
public beta for Yosemite has also been
released for those of you that are part
of that program and fixes for the OS 10
Mavericks mountain lion and lions
shell-shocked bash security flaw have
been fixed as well and Apple is asking
their developers to submit their OS 10
Yosemite apps for approval with the
launch of Yosemite expected in late
October alright this is not iphone news
but in iOS 8 news Apple seated the first
beta for iOS 8.1 to developers not to be
confused with 8.1 that some of you cried
about last week now developer Hamza
stood was able to pull some good nuggets
from it including a screenshot for the
hidden settings for Apple pay so far
only the iphone 6 6 plus and apple watch
will be compatible with Apple pay but
should also found evidence that the next
gen ipad models will include touch ID
support and Apple pay as well and if you
thought people taking pictures with
their iPads look stupid just wait until
people start paying for things at stores
with their iPads so here um let me just
get back here and pay for that all right
and here okay put it okay thank you and
shove that in my back pocket yeah not
cool alright and before we go you Apple
fighters are still asking me where do I
get a lot of my shirts so check out my
favorites at this link from designed by
humans and they're offering you the
Apple biters a fifteen percent off code
for everything including their shirts
hoodies iphone cases and artwork
whatever you want with the code apple
byte 15 off that's good until October
the 11 and yes we are Groot now that's
going to do it for this week's show you
can email me at the apple byte at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong thanks so
much for watching we'll catch you all
next time for another bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
