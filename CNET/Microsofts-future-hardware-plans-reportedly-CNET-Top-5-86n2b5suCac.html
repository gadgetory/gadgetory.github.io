Microsoft Hardware rumors floating
around say what you will about Microsoft
but that company has been making some
pretty interesting hardware in the past
few years take a look at that surface
studio as an example recently a bunch of
reports popped up online that claimed to
know what Microsoft is cooking up let's
get to it at number five our new surface
branded accessories Microsoft already
makes a bunch of accessories that bear
the surface label like keyboards and a
mouse these surface branded devices
definitely show off Microsoft's at
design chops according to Mary Joe Foley
the company may be working on a
headphone mic combo similar to the Jabra
evolve she looked pretty slick if it's a
surface number for new surface devices
according to Mary Joe Foley again the
next surface pro is going to be heavily
redesigned and it won't show up until
mid 2019 this year we'll get a new line
of surface devices they will have
smaller screens and be priced lower
bloomberg says Microsoft is aiming to
get the price to around $400 coming in
at number three is the next Xbox is
coming pretty soon over at throught com
Brad Sam says Microsoft is planning to
release the next Xbox codenamed
Scarlett in the year 2020 what's more is
that Scarlett is actually a family of
devices so expect multiple pieces of
hardware what's not known is whether
Scarlett is a revision to the current
Xbox or a brand new console we've
arrived at number two and it is the new
hololens the next version is expected in
the first quarter of next year the new
hololens is supposed to be lighter
feature improved graphics a better field
of view better battery life and a much
lower price point i've tried on the
hololens and it's pretty great here's
hoping and heads to the consumer space
soon or headset consumers heads
and at number one is Andromeda
apparently Microsoft is working on a
pocketable dual screen mobile device
codenamed Andromeda sort of like intel's
tiger rapid prototype but smaller
microsoft does hold a number of patents
related to fold and mobile devices this
report also comes from Brad Sam's and he
says that Microsoft will introduce the
Andromeda device first then partners
will release similar devices after oh
one more thing Andromeda is targeted for
a 2018 release
just remember that plans can change
remember the courier or the service mini
they never made it to market go check
out all about Microsoft calm and Thora
calm if you want to get super geeky
