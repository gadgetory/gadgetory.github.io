pro a lot like look in the room this
view about as close to the action as you
can get is brought to you by google
glass and San Francisco startup crowd
optic wants to share this vantage point
with fans through their mobile devices
it's partnered with the sacramento kings
which has put google glass in the hands
of players inheriting somebody's view
means that basically you have their POV
right that's right i what happens with
our technologies i look they have google
glass running so say DeMarcus Cousins is
working on his foul shots or stuffing
the ball or whatever and I'm interested
in what he's seeing so I can look at him
and and tap into his recording I press a
button on my google glass and then in my
viewer I'm seeing what he sees the tech
takes fans to places usually off-limits
giving them in a way an all-access pass
we were using it you know during
training camp and going times where you
know you're practicing and doing drills
and thumbs and all this glassy stuff for
people to watch and some heavy stuff to
using that google glass get you some you
need one crowd optic is betting that in
the very near future more people in the
stands will have wearable devices that
would enable its technology to uncover
what it calls nooks and crannies we can
understand what the crowd is focused on
using a principle called triangulation
so we calculate individuals line of
sight and then and then in a on a
dashboard or in the cloud we calculate
where all the lines of sight are where
the overlaps we call those clusters and
then we can track crowd attention and
use that as a basis for things like
sharing information sharing videos
sharing comments and things like that
think of it as your own personal
on-demand Jumbotron so right now we're
getting a closer look almost a tour of
the court sort of seeing eye to eye with
some of the players outfitting NBA
players with a nerdy looking device is
actually a natural fit for the Kings
which is owned by Vivek Ranadive a
successful tech
nor the team has gained a reputation for
embracing tech it's accepting bitcoins
the digital currency and is
experimenting with oculus rift the
ritual headset and drone cams why have
stationary cameras cameras anymore when
we can have a drone operating giving
somebody a unique perspective a new
perspective from any angle imaginable
and that's part of what drones are about
they call me mr google crowd optic has
partnered with other teams including the
san jose earthquakes and stanford
basketball but like any startup treading
new terrain it's facing challenges
connectivity and preserving image
quality are some of the issues shrinky
that Google glass thing but if they
solve those problems crowd optic is
likely to score big with fans in
Sacramento I'm see me das Cena CBS News</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
