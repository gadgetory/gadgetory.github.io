Thursday februari ninth on a snowy day
in New York City and we are bored out of
our minds and we have nothing better to
do so with you today a rudder chain and
Ben Fox Rubin later then we're we're
basically the only ones who trekked in
through the snow there's quite a bit of
snow and wind out there and it's a slow
news day so we figured why not have fun
with a special longer episode of the 359
where I really just gonna sit around
talking about her favorite age movies
yeah why not why not why not absolutely
so if you want to talk about tech just
see us on just doing out yeah yes just
you know you can jump off maybe I'm try
to slip it into the comments we want to
hear about your favorite movies and yeah
we're gonna talk about our favorite days
movies and the remakes that you know
we're not so hot on but I'm actually
really curious to know if there's any
80s movie remake that is good we we had
not thought of any yeah like while we
were doing like pre-show conversation
teen wolf bratty kid but there are
definite arguments to be made but I'm
with you guys I would say the the modern
generation of roca Robocop the robocop
was bad yeah that's what I'm saying
they're all horrible I would argue that
I would assume that the younger
generation I mean crotty kid was was a
hit right was a financial success like I
imagine like I know a new generation of
people watched it like oh that that's
that's the karate kid oh my no it's not
it's a kid from Jersey that's the real
karate kid dang it and also it's this
because you know that all the the
Chinese guys were all villains of the
movie it's in basic it there's the
romaine remake yeah I hadn't watched it
is that the one with will smith's kid in
it yeah yeah Smith and Jackie Chan which
was a redeeming quality of a Jackie Chan
is great he is pretty amazing I would
like to see more of Jackie Chan these
days but nothing really holds up to
Ralph Macchio no you look at that look
at this just watch the footage it is
just what okay so one thing that always
got me about karate kid though is he
wins within a legal move no way wait
what special crane kick is a lot of
final tournament remember they state the
rules
as he enters the arena and they say no
kicks to the face how did he win oh how
did then whoa whoa that just blew my
mind right that completely changes the
perspective and makes him actually the
villain in this absolutely well they
just sound like a Barney from how i met
your mother they do try to treat him
like total crap the whole movie and then
he kicks the guy in the face he had it
coming but it did he japonais as well
that it's a very good point I just
thought that was kind of funny like
really I like a completely massive
oversight I did not yeah or an
intentional why did that well me I want
me to talk about it 30 years yeah I
watched it when I was a kids I'd
completely like went over my head I've
just shared that he kicked the bully in
the face I know it was pretty in gaol uh
Michael Dolan in the chat says fright
night fright night fright night the
vampire movie yeah that's that gave me
nightmares for days i don't i don't
think i ever actually saw that one is i
do and it was trailing it was like
actually a remake of it yeah with a Matt
Dillon right or is it who helped me here
Michael no no no no the remake was with
uh Oh what's his name is gonna be the
whole black guy dude this is gonna fire
who was this guy I'm usually full of
knowledge about crap like this and i'm
still I'm still mating her way to call
me Michael way to go Michael that you
actually stumped Brian he knows
everything so much more about movies
than I ever pretend to yeah I never saw
this one and I love those classic
horrors yeah Colin Farrell call
Farrell's like the villain in the new
remake I can't imagine that that is any
good Oh Anton Yelchin was in it well go
lay down yeah we can't vouch for it
because none of us watched it so for the
time being Michael nicely done alright
well I want to bring up a movie that
they are gonna be remaking which I'm sad
about that was very excited to watch
over and over again on HBO was a big
trouble little china uh that was like
that is a perfect movie there's no point
to remaking it I mean what it had
everything Hank Russell since it's all
right hand it had this guy shooting
lightning out of his hands it was so
cool and they played a weird video game
with like
all little yesterday odd creatures and
the guy that kind of user they had new
user weird finger gestures together get
like they were like neon glowing
warriors that fought each other as they
controlled them what their finger is
doing finger motions when I when I
watched this movie I was like I didn't
know you were allowed to make a movie
this ridiculous like well that was the
thing that couldn't even this this movie
if if there wasn't a remake if this if
they were trying to create movie like
this I don't think would happen now it
is no there's two main risks I mean to
weird by all means it should have been
animated it's basically a cartoon come
to life oh yeah very good point I hadn't
I think that's why I love it so much
right and Kurt Russell was just
absolutely inquiries at peeker Russell
at that point it was really really good
and yeah they could have totally screwed
up the movie with jean-claude Van Damme
or some other guy somebody who else was
like a big 80s star like stallone maybe
Arnold Arnold's aural 90s ladies was
coming he was also a tease yes also a
nice he did a lot of villains stuff in
his early curve I wouldn't work though I
mean whether the charisma that corozal
had a movie he was perfect yeah in that
movie Marcus in the chat says the last
dragon I have no my god last dragon in a
very long time yeah it is a class I love
that movie as a kid I mean it hooked in
perfectly with like my love of rap and
martial arts all the same time a little
bit blaxploitation a little
blaxploitation yes talked about if they
were enough because nothing is sacred
these days if they were to remake it
Wutang has to be on him right yeah I
mean they've done so much with samurai
aesthetic ya genre yep themselves in
their own music and their lifestyle I
could actually get on board if that was
a pitch I have to go back and actually
watch how that could be you that could
be a worthy remake yeah i'd be down i
just love the end we're like like the
weed like they start glowing i guess i
glowing theme was pretty big well in the
80s yeah it's all about neon lights that
was a the pitch of that was a peak of
special effects we're gonna turn the
lights up yes exactly so to try to avoid
being overly esoteric for
folks that have never heard of the Last
Dragon perhaps we should go and
reference some of the best michael j fox
and molly ringwald movie oh yeah because
those were those were the king and queen
of 80s movies I mean back to a future
obviously as I did they never even
connected right Michael J think sex in
Mali we will never share the screen
which is which is that should anybody
help us go six degrees of Kevin Bacon on
these two yeah I don't think they've
actually yeah she done any projects that
would have been the greatest superb and
80s movie of all I think they can still
do it well yeah yeah they're both still
around just call 80s movie he's movie
yes it sounds like one of those terrible
parody movies are you listen for the
scary movie yeah I would still watch it
I would still watch uh that would be
great mugsy says weird science Williams
says breakfast club speaking of molly
ringwald Breakfast Club definitely
Ringwald and weird science no no oh just
thought it was another John Hughes yes
yes definitely so all in the same circle
you did what I mentioned at one point
that was at the molly ringwald movie is
it so sixteen Candles 16 candles with
the incredibly offensive yeah even when
I was watching as a kid and realized
like that's that's not right this would
the wrong with this was really bad dong
oh jeez donga knows oh man and he fell
out of a tree at one point I think it
was suck under a glass table 1 like yeah
I mean it was certainly very funny from
the comedic relief standpoint but do
they really have to amp up like just a
racist territories yeah what was his
line no Yankee my Winkie Oh as I'm
getting my walking papers from my boss
yes Cena oh my God look hr's sets us a
different note now but like that's
what's that's what's interesting I would
guess about these movies is that like
the rest of the movie like perfectly
normal whatever break you know just
casual this is a weird ejection of
racism yeah you know like not a problem
like let's just have this like really
over the top asian character so if they
ever did actually remake this movie no
dong or like here
Oh raise it like that dog no dong what
else is on your topless guys uh you know
what a tease just say just a treasure
trove of so many awesome movies like
whatever leaves I thought up Beverly
Hills Cop best hands down from dnc
really that what you think diehard isn't
a nineteen eighty right on the nose yeah
I write fast times at ridgemont high
that's a great die hard I mean that is a
great movie the indiana jones indiana
jones and the raiders lost ark record of
my success Little House on the Prairie
you can buy success by the way it's like
the quintessential like 80s it's the
greatest look into what 80s culture was
like right with every shoulder pads
everyone was like aspiring to be
climbing the corporate ladder being a
suit versus being a mailman you know
just I don't know I love them it was the
bonfire of the vanities of 80s movies it
really like quintessentially described
on a roll over I don't know that was
which was a movie yeah that was kind of
a genre NAT self-made he's like the
bootstraps film between that Glengarry
Glen Ross um Wall Street ray movie um
what was the movie where the kid was
like riding the lawnmower and then like
one more man no no no it was a kid it
was like also excellent but i think that
was 90 it was yeah and also a terrible i
think that setback for a reality bike
I'm talking about that was a leap weird
no like oh this is VR forget it I don't
want any of that oh mama man was amazing
Riley what was it what was the move with
the kid it was a kid it was a kid who
was a mowing mowing a lawn and then like
slowly like worked his way up the social
ladder to like date the pretty girl in
high school help us chat we're lost oh
no I felt like an 80s moving can't buy
me love can't buy me love yeah it was
probably it thank you to Mugsy 191 night
job but that's a one-way like also
somewhat offensive that he didn't he buy
basically paid the most popular girl in
school to date him is that what happened
and that way that's the premise of the
movie the premise of the movies and
female can't buy me love oh my god they
had a falling love anyway that's right
right man that is prostitution Lana
82 movies in retrospect boundaries there
have you watched ghostbusters and just
watch how often they're smoking
cigarettes right it's kind of a weird
thing now right to watch they yeah go
back watch that people don't smoke
cigarettes nearly as much but you know
it's unfair for us 30 years later to
apply to many know of our judgments on
no I love all these movies Ghostbusters
hands down one of my favorite films of
all time yeah ariad that absolutely i
watch that way too young most of the
joke sword right over my head but it was
all me in action it was actually the
first scene was kind of freaky to me oh
it was a librarian thing I was terrified
I I couldn't in looking back I'm
surprised my parents even let me watch
but then you know you get to the Stay
Puft Marshmallow Man you like Oh
everything's cool right and uncle that
so sue me like favorite movie car above
the Batmobile a bill of Knight Rider the
ecto-1 wow I love her one and I loved
o1a in the return ghostbusters 2 which
holder Jeff Bakalar night Jeff Bakalar
and I have conversations about this on
the frequent Ghostbusters to severely
underrated sequel it was the exact same
script rehashed woohoo but in the realm
of like this equal sucks ghostbusters 2
did not was that cause I was Thunder one
will with the there was there was like
the bad goop and yeah it was evil sly
yeah yeah sludge actually I enjoyed it I
i also like that moving as incredible as
the the core cast is for Ghostbusters
and full disclosure I got to meet Ernie
Hudson and he's an incredible human
being nice I got to pose with him in
front of ecto-1 at comic-con a few years
ago yes very nice best 30 bucks I ever
spent forgot to pay the man I had to pay
for this comic all you to pay for
everything there yeah take my hand
that's 15 bucks gee my favorite
characters are the supporting ones from
peter macnicol in ghostbusters 2 and as
Janusz yes yeah Johnny where you from
the upper west side but nothing no he
was so convincing I honestly thought
that's how he spoke like later on when
he I saw him another role yeah like wait
his accent totally changed what happened
was accident right thing is from like
Boston or something yeah I don't
remember but nothing nothing like
nothing Trump's Rick Moranis is Luis
Tully English
there's one and that was one of my best
Halloween costumes I went as vince
clortho keymaster of gozer volleyball
children I Lord of the Cebu Leah Wow why
nice and back a few years ago maybe not
as fresh in my memory I used to get so
completely blackout drunk that I could
recite every line of his from the movies
that's what you do when you get drunk
that's pretty proud for some reason I'm
gonna pass out throw uppy quote goes I
default is to Rick Moranis hahaha and
occasionally Michael J Fox impressive
Michael Dolan props Bobby bound
soundtrack that ghostbusters two one of
the best of all times so as amazing as
Ray Parker was Ray Parker jr. that Bobby
Brown soundtrack are long with Run DMC I
love that like Jack Swing yep yeah
awesome sound rude anybody watch the
remake of this though Yeah right I
haven't watched it I watched it ouch for
it was it wasn't a good remake uh not
really it was not terrible I didn't go
and wanted to hate it I had nothing
against the fact that ooh like was an
all-female cast actually like allowed to
work I thought the movie was a little
uninspired I mean it really did come
rehash the pup lot of the first ones
wasn't anything new yeah it's just like
similar effects um yeah just sort of I
mean that's a really difficult or it
really is but don't use the cast cash no
i don't but it's like a generation move
oh absolutely like I was like you were
like all right I like it and it wasn't
you know oh yeah yes I saw the caster
they're all funny women yeah and I love
the work that they've done in past just
that's I think that's why is doubly
disappointing given the amount of talent
there didn't work more call-outs from
the chat the a-team even though did that
ever get to be a feature film in the 80s
and that is just the series and they
made that they made them like hardcore
reboot we're not really but remake movie
uh revenge the nerds that was high yeah
say teen wolf yet I i we did not say she
wolf oh sure room as a terminator Oh
teen wolf seawolf by the way which was
filmed in South Pasadena my hometown was
an excellent movie yes this was
basically like parents expected places
the Fae yeah this is this is what it was
like first I still kind of cringe when I
saw I see when you pull down here I was
like ah yeah that hurts
why don't you do that but I mean who
else could do this I know they've got
that series on mtv right now yeah but
I've never watched Michael J Fox
embodies this film totally he was the
Prince of the 80s oh yeah you got it out
it's not like yes Prince absolutely this
was this is I feel is my hometown this
is sometimes what I feel is lacking in
movies these days is that there's so
much of an emphasis on special effect i
have JJ don't exactly how it looks yeah
that that like you you don't get this
like kitschy or campy or like small town
for you there aren't as many risk being
taken yeah I mean and there was a point
in time when it was just okay to have
some fun yep we didn't have to have that
was the 80s yeah like that was the mess
it didn't need to be a franchise it
didn't even it didn't have a look a
point to it badly yeah well it didn't
need to make our Hobbs of money no there
wasn't like a real pitch to her or if
you heard the pitch it was ridiculous
yeah you like no this is insane we're
not gonna do this but yeah mateys they
were like like look like Alice Buster's
but Ghostbusters have been made today at
one maybe Nate I mean if it was vegas it
was brand new it was like there was no
legacy behind it someone just came in
like hey we want to make a movie about
four dudes firing proton packs at ghosts
they would have made it like a serious
spin-off of like a paranormal activity
type oh yes yeah right it would have
been would have been our it would have
been funny it would've been reading oh
yeah remember those clusters itself
started as a very different concept dan
Aykroyd and held Ramos originally
scripted it and worked with Ivan Reitman
who kind of like helped them dial it
back into this modern-day setting it was
originally supposed to be about time
travelers really really and there was an
outer space element and it was truly
bizarre and of course I was written on
bore I'm glad that cut out yes well I
was written for John Belushi so
you put that element into the recipe
he's like all right well they could pull
that off yeah yeah but then they decided
to make it more of like a contemporary
exterminator agency and I personally
feel that that was a better route to
take absolutely well not only that but
like if you're going to do an 80s time
travel movie you're not really going to
be back to the future I would think true
I realize that all three Indiana Jones
movies were into 80s Last Crusade was 89
yeah they did a remake like that that
was also terrible that was a really bad
that wasn't a remake oh it was a
continuation as a sequel it was a sieve
terrible mistake speaking of back to the
future again our prints of the 80s mr. J
Fox Mardan and now look at look at the
the legacy that's come out of that
that's not even truly a back to the
future ash agency no no no Rick and
Morty which is just a quick hi and love
went to the job interesting I hadn't
thought of that well I don't watch later
ly that I don't want I don't yeah I
don't watch the show you should give it
a shot it's incredibly smart and I don't
watch TV anymore yeah now with a kid
yeah uh watch a lot of care bears
hahahaha they're bears and Sophie terms
of the cultural mouse and life cultural
cultural touchstone that it is so there
are the nike shoes they're the
self-lacing shoes there's the fact that
everyone celebrated the anniversary or
not the adverse to the point in back
feature to when they travel in the
future which grinders not an 80s movie
but still Pepsi now Pepsi now right and
look at all this stuff that it's now
like the products themselves are legacy
kind of a bizarre concept yeah and seen
a little bit apparently heavily Libyan
terraces so that's still pretty they're
still yeah relative they were dead on
with a lot of stuff hey really really
knew their stuff those uh those writers
mugsy shouts out Charlie Sheen and no
man's land and Michael Douglas as gordon
gekko in wall street lights Gordon
Gekkos amazing that wasn't one of the
best icons of character of the 80s hmm I
I never thought I'd like that movie as
much as I did consider going to Jack
about actual stock trading you don't
need to know it's such a great character
development driven film that I was
floored by it just needed other motives
greed man yeah agree they didn't they
didn't over complicate it
Larry is good well the other wall street
or the other investing movie trading
places oh you're gonna call that
interesting oh my god is the last last
half hour I mean yeah that is kind of
weird like plot me the business degree
to understand the conclusion of the
climax of that movie right shorting
frozen concentrate orangish a
lightweight how does this work if you
bet against the stock going upward like
it was actually pretty complicated end
to the movie right for another goofy
movie too I mean yes I don't give it
enough credit very little about
investing but you really actually had to
know your your business when he wanted
to understand the ending that movie we
want to make sure to call out a few
people are calling us in the chat for
this one of the most essential 80s
movies and my mantra ferris bueller's
day off which is what we're doing right
now oh yes I made it happen any time I
got very meta I mean I was not a cool
kid in high school I didn't skip school
and do cool stuff I skipped school and
pretended I was Ferris Bueller by
watching the movie over and over again
well that that's pretty much the same
thing that's about as cool as I got ya I
never I never wore a suit when I ditched
class I'll say that yes I never stole
car one of the best like really kind of
pioneered like the post-credit scene
with the yeah your right knee in the bus
right right and then the post post
credits we might go get out what are you
still doing here which des overstep pool
did a nice little love come on mosh yeah
that was incredible yeah super
appropriate let my camera and go yeah I
love that movie hello much oh well well
we've got time I Conan oh yeah oh man
the Barbarian which brian what's best in
life to crush your enemies haha oh we
are such geeks um speaking of failed
remix now didn't know it was Aquaman
Aquaman hands in the room it that's
right aqua chaser moma yeah actually
pretty good casting just come a terrible
terrible movie again very generic and
bland yeah that's what we're seeing with
these remakes I think they're trying to
be you know honest to the remake like
they're trying to keep with
what we saw back in the 80s people just
want nostalgia I suppose but like maybe
they're not changing them around too
much yeah the same thing with Hollywood
like they're not taking enough risk
there's that there's that balance right
you want to give them what they want I
mean you make that argument for star
wars the force awakens was basically was
basically the original movie which I
enjoyed while I was watching a but when
you think back you're like well they
really didn't do that much to change
blondie you know the main characters a
woman now instead of a man she comes
from a desert planet and you know and
they base I just heard right yeah
watches her mentor got that star as far
as I'm concerned most of these remakes
are related in title alone they
completely missed the the spirit and the
theme yes um it's almost sort of a
soulless remake I've seen a lot of these
soulless remix which is sort of like
going through the process yeah because
they're literally out of ideas and they
said this was a success once it'll
probably do it again right and then they
kind of make money off it and then it
will never go away one of the few
one-off movies there really aren't a lot
of like big-budget one-offs these days
again because Hollywood doesn't like
taking risks the way that they used to I
remember I watched inception and I was
like oh yeah wow this is really
incredible and there was no intention in
that movie to create a second door right
there's no franchise yeah and I that I
think that script had been sitting
around for a really long time and the
reason it got made was because
Christopher Nolan wrote it really don't
we had and we basically have the cachet
to say hey I'm gonna make the movie
right but other than arthouse flakes
which obviously are much much lower
budget I don't move with the Quinn
Tarantino he makes a lot of kind of
outside movies and the studio's give him
only way i would probably say inception
well i was going to say inception was
probably higher budget but kill bill was
probably a pretty big budget movie so
i'll be wanting yeah and blood alone
until we spent ten million dollars on
blood Mugsy says trading places with
Jamie Lee Curtis at her best he also
says a Clint Eastwood sudden impact do
you feel lucky oh yeah wasn't that 70's
though am i off I'm not sure that's like
the internets yes oh here's a dark horse
colors Sean Penn and Robert Duvall
Wow I'm not seen that one Mugsy Phyllis
in have you seen that I i feel like i
have but i was too young to really
appreciate it same Khamsin is yeah yeah
yeah i remember i vaguely remember this
a couple of scenes from that movie
sudden impact was nineteen eighty-three
sound okay right on up yes good call out
I was not a big Clint Eastwood fan
Beckham when I was a kid I just I just
not my vibe like those he was all Dirty
Harry movies were just not my thing he
predated me a little bit yeah but I'm
here Michael actor I've also liked his
newer stuff a lot more yeah gran torino
I thought was really good there were a
kettle that I saw Michael Dolan breaks
some old as we've been largely talking
about more or less kind of campy
eighties movies and he brings up
Shawshank Redemption was an 80s movie no
that was like 89 it could've been think
it was 89 no way I've been 18 are we
that old yeah geez we really are which
by the way was was arguably one of the
best movies puri that's why my favorite
movies it is you're asleep being
arguably best movies of all time it's
basically basically any time it's on
cable I have to sit down watch it yeah
it's unavoidable and it's always
enjoyable no it's timeless 94 94 well I
felt like it was earlier than that too
well we definitely ruin the show it's
alright sorry guys it is still great
thanks anyway Nolan you know what the
shawshank redemption is so good that I
transcends I'm going to say is still one
of the best 80s it was an honorary 80's
90's and 2000's in person I wouldn't
even call it it's it it really like it
does another it's somewhat timeless yeah
and i think that like the campy Verve is
really what made those 80s movies a tsb
i sees you know and like that's i can t
see more or intense if we're gonna swing
towards horror because that's when
horror really started the kind of take
off I mean there's a lot of different
arguments I am NOT a historian of horror
films but each decade does kind of have
its own flavor and the 80s is when they
started to get evil like super evil yeah
they would get dark starting starting
right beforehand with the Exorcist Oh
crazy the exercise late 70s the thing
was the thing in the south the thing was
an 80s no thing was in the 80s and that
is still one of my favorite horror films
of all time that was a really I
leave that was also Kurt Russell and I
will be able to rustle too I loved the
thing yeah this this absolutely
traumatized me as a child and those
special effects still hold up to today I
actually watch this for the first time a
couple years ago and was really
impressed with the movie I thought it
was I mean that's a yeah yeah yeah and
I'll make the argument that in 2011
where they didn't quite remake this it
holds up the the thing from 2011 which
isn't technically a prequel although it
did kind of rehash a lot of the same
beats I thought that was just a really
damn good well so there you go like
generations answer to the question of a
remake that's kind of quasi worth even
though it wasn't really a remake really
wasn't a remake but you think you could
kind of like put a lot of the pages side
by side and you can make the argument
like this is kinda same I mean you could
mean but the thing that gets me about it
is no spoilers the ending of the thing
2011 is the perfect queue up to label it
as the prequel to leading up to the
original cool I will Lodge that I do
recommend it if you can get past the
over usage of CGI and pretend like it's
the classic practical effects right you
can get by on it but you have to pretend
a little bit guys I have to get going
soon yeah let's have other thing what do
do as much as I'd like to keep talking
about it we could do this all day
literally um yeah let's that's a good
place to wrap things up minion last
questions we want to want to get any
last recommendations Hoosiers who's
yours yeah I'm another movie I haven't
seen really no great bell but this is
really a last man I'm getting I'm
getting a whole list of movies member
who's dr. Hoosiers Rudy Rudy I was not
as hot on Rudy from Goonies yeah Bri
Sean Astin is that Notre Dame football
player yep no no was that from the 80s
though it might have been girly noises
Oh if we're gonna transcend we've
already broken the genre yeah it's true
just tying tying the notes together here
at the end let's Joey's was basically
also the 90s the chariots wait here as
old as us yes they all pleaded to wildly
bed and chariots of fire all right and
child's play which they're doing again
are they really hard when everyone
no idea I mean look at all the rest of
them from that and the when they kept
the stretching out the Jason series mmm
they are at their teeth in space yeah
Jason actor at that point it completely
transcends camp yeah I think that's the
problem is like how much do people
really want to see something that can't
be remade people just like to see the
same characters on ya on screen over
they're not they're not gonna be can't
be there all like the gritty reboot
