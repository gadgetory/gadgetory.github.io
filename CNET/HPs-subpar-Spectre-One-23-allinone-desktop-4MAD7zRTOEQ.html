today we're gonna take a look at the HP
Spectre 123 so this is HP's new high-end
Windows 8 all-in-one it has a few
interesting features but overall it's
kind of a bust actually it's a little
disappointing so you can see it's got a
nice glass design up here it's edge to
edge of course you also have a Cheers of
input devices here there's a keyboard a
mouse and a touchpad all are included
with the system
what does not have as a touchscreen that
sets the system apart from pretty much
every other high-end Windows 8 on one
and the combination of the Mouse and
touchpad are designed to offset the
absent touchscreen but it really doesn't
work as well as you want it to you're
probably best just going with a mouse a
keyboard entirely and getting rid of the
touchpad even then it will feel like a
limited windows 8 experience now the
core of this PC is fairly decent this is
the step-up model it cost about sixteen
hundred bucks this actually makes it
pretty expensive but it does come with a
core i7 CPU ten gigs of RAM and a one
terabyte hard drive it also comes with
an entry-level NVIDIA GeForce GT 610
graphics chip but that's really not
enough to make this a competent gaming
PC and even newer titles on lower end
settings won't play very well so on sort
of unique feature of the system is it
has a Near Field Communication receiver
aka NFC now NFC is kind of an early
technology and it doesn't really work as
well as we'd like it to the idea is that
you're supposed to be out to transfer
data between say a smart phone in the
system just by tapping it on the spot
you may have seen that in the Samsung
Galaxy s3 commercial but the problem
with the system is that it doesn't
recognize input from those other devices
so we've swiped a samsung galaxy we've
site to Nokia Lumia 920 and neither
device is recognized by the system
that's why the HP is not done a very
good job of sort of introducing you to
the NFC tag experience there's no
documentation or anything really
apparent about what those tags are
included with the system and you have to
download two apps from HP in order to
make them work why they're not included
in the system out of the box is sort of
a mystery now you can see that HP has
made some effort to make the design of
the system stand out a little bit
there's a nice sort of curving back
support here in the monitor and inside
that you actually find the motherboard
you can take the whole back panel off
and get to the memory and the hard drive
if you're enterprising enthusiast you
can maybe even dig a little deeper but
for most people that appreciate the fact
you can easily swap out memory and hard
drive so that's cool on the side and the
rear the base you can also find the
ports for
spc there's a couple of USB 3 ports HDMI
input as well as some audio ports though
there's no optical drive we're just not
uncommon among hiring pcs these days
actually and of course you can always
add one now the core i7 chip gives the
system some nice performance but the
lack of a touchscreen and the fact that
it's monitors small for its price kind
of hurt the system from a value
standpoint HP also includes some
features that we're not entirely sure we
want like the NFC receiver as well as
the touch pad so if you're in the market
for a higher-end Windows 8 on one I
would probably skip the system so I'm
rich Brown this is the HP spectre 123</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
