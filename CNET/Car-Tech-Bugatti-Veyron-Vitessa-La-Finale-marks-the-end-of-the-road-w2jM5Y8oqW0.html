the Geneva Motor Show where I'm standing
next to a piece of history this is the
final Bugatti Veyron that will ever be
built this is called la finale
appropriately the Bugatti Veyron has
been in production for almost 10 years
now and in that time just 450 will be
built this is the 450th it's based on
the grand sport so it's got the
removable hardtop and under the rear
deck lid on 1184 horsepower engine that
will push this up to over 250 miles per
hour it's got a custom cream leather
interior and blood red exterior that's
clear enough that you can still see the
weave of the carbon fiber underneath
beautiful bodywork a beautiful car that
hasn't really changed much in terms of
looks in the past 10 years but certainly
has inspired a lot of people to go even
faster and bring more horsepower to the
supercar game now if you are thinking of
how much does this supercar cost it
doesn't really matter because this is
the only one of these that will be
produced there's already been purchased
so that's it no more Veyrons if you were
waiting and hoping to get one it's too
late now who knows what the guys got
next but we now know what they had and
it's gone it's very sad but this is it
the final bugatti veyron la finale</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
