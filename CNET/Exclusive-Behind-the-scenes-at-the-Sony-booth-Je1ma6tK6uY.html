show floor see us 2012 now we'd like to
give you a little behind-the-scenes
sneak peek of an actual booth in action
so our good friends at Sony we're here
to help us out also you got to dig this
new mic flag it's kind of sexy okay so
let's go into the booth right now we're
gonna start here with Sony you see
always kind of a standard affair here at
CES 2012 boxes covered with blankets who
knows what's in there right all right
now we're gonna keep on walking through
here and Sony's always been really
impressive a variety of cameras
television sets blu-ray players they
pretty much have everything under the
Sun so over here they're showing off
some of their experience
digital media players where their
everything is still being set up as we
speak so we know this isn't the final
product but we're gonna see but again
everyone behind us is working there's
interviews happening all around okay
also look see I can walk backwards and
avoid things while I'm doing that this
is more of Sony's kind of really showing
off their music unlimited service and
some of the devices tablets that are
integrated it again Sony's always really
tried to pitch like this lifestyle of
their devices being connected with each
other so they continue to push that
forward we're gonna walk this way and
we're gonna have head over more to the
gaming we know that gaming is a big deal
with Sony the PS Vita is out
internationally but it's not here in the
United States it'll be coming out
sometime in about February of 2012 so
what we have here is a huge array of the
PS Vita I think it's a hot product but
really the question is in the mobile
gaming space are people willing to buy
another 200 $300 device in addition to
their phone and their laptops
specifically for gaming so far the
response over in Japan has been really
lukewarm with sales so we'll see if that
changes once they hit to the US shores
now we're gonna keep on walking through
here Sony's also known for a lot of
their gaming so what we have here if
you're here at CES you get a lot of like
demos that you'll never be able to get
anywhere else this game is one of their
new ones Starhawk you're gonna be able
to get that one to play it for free here
on the show floor also twisted metal is
another super hot title this is where
cars like destroy each other you'll be
able to check those out in the booth I
think that's honestly one of the
highlights for me other than the cool
tech is just kind of playing some of the
new games that are at least six months
to a year away now
as we transition over here right look we
see the ladders being stacked up we see
the little forklifts everyone is still
this is the central hall really more
towards the end of the central everyone
is still saying up but this is my
favorite section of the Sony booth this
is the future technology booth so
whenever you see the word future you
want to come in and show you what
they've got so over here on my right
side this is a demo you won't be able to
really see it at home but this is the 3d
glass list television set now over at
Sony and other companies we're seeing a
lot of demos like this the unique part
of this demo specifically as most of
them are been displaying them with
cameras that track your eyes there are
no real cameras here in these demos and
one of the things that sticks out is
when you walk side to side you can
almost see the 3d image change on a
plane there's like this just subtle move
that tells you that you're looking at it
from a different plane the viewing angle
is pretty impressive so you know we're
gonna be seeing a lot more glassless 3d
televisions down the line and we're
gonna cut over here you'll see really
quickly one more glasses 3d TV this is a
46 inch er they're getting bigger and
better but from here it looks it looks
really impressive to me you got a little
seafood a little crab going on over
there and a lot of Nemo's so this is one
of the things here at CES you're always
gonna see some of this firsthand I think
that from seeing a lot of these 3d
glasses demos already the technology is
getting more and more impressive
specifically when you talk about being
able to move different angles on the TV
set and being able to deal with that and
you know still having a pretty nice
quality image now over here we're gonna
we're gonna come over here this way and
we have more demos from Sony with their
3d glasses we've seen this for a while
so there's nothing new and fresher this
is really more of their future
technology but what we really wanted to
show you them will kind of do it from a
distance and we won't walk up to it too
close is over here on this side over
here on this side yeah we have here
Sony's demo of the crystal LED TV that's
wide all right so if you look over here
on my shoulder this is kind of their new
technology that they're showcasing this
is way ahead of the curve the difference
in what makes this TV set unique with
the crystal LED TV display is that
there's a back light an LED for all
colors red green and blue which really
makes it super unique there's a
comparison it's it'll be might be a
little hard
which one looks more vibrant clearer and
sharper but on the left side you'll see
not only is the image able to be
reproduced a lot quicker the colors pop
out of the screen and you know we
everyone's talking about Oh LED TVs
everyone's talking about 4k televisions
but really this is the type of
technology that hopefully will be more
affordable and bring it forward so I
have the crystal LED display well worth
looking at I was talking to one of the
guys who works actually in Sony's 4k
booth and he says the theoretical
resolution of this TV set is 6 K so
6,000 lines of resolution which will
make it even a more clear picture I just
really impressive so let's go over here
this way real quick one of the things
that suni is also touting because they
are not only a consumer electronics
company but a media brand they're
showcasing off kind of the pipeline or
the production line of a 4k camera we
have over there that's the Sinha Alta
f65 camera specifically geared for 4k
content and then across the board
obviously Sony's gonna pimp you know how
we have the mixing the receivers the
editing software and the platform to
really bring 4k forward we saw how Sony
puts blu-ray really hard in the end
result is that you're really gonna need
to see 4k reach the consumer in the home
so let's just come over here really
quickly and check this guy out this is
their sony home theater 4k projector now
if you want to know the retail price on
this bad boy could you take a guess
somewhere around 25 but that's not 2500
that's $25,000 for a 4k projector the
internal code name for it and Center
information scoop was called the
Valkyrie so you know it's some hot stuff
all right let's just go over here really
finally one last peek over to Sony's
booth they have a lot of amazing stuff
but up here this is the 4k home theater
now we can't go inside I must reiterate
that I I like peeked through those
Kern's and I was shoved out but they're
showing a demo on a 200 inch screen of
4k content not in 3d that it does
support 3d but it's 4k content like a
scene from some of their movies this is
this is amazing stuff so I would say
definitely come out to the Sony 4k booth
just check out some of the cool toys
they have we're just going to kind of
take one more look just at the overall
floor to give you a bigger sense of what
happened in the central hall over here
behind me Polaroid we know that last
year Lady gaga made her debut promoting
the Polaroid Brant brand we're starting
to see more celebrities come out here
kind of associating with companies
whether they're brand names from the
past or smaller names we may not
recognize Justin Bieber is here with
potentially a Bieber bot yeah you'll
find out more about that later
but again this is just the entire setup
here at CES 2012 we're still one day
away before we finish up with the final
product on the floor but just really
give you an overall sense of how massive
this undertaking is and just all the
boxes people cables wires and lights and
television sets that it takes to put
together CES so there you have it
another kind of insider look on the CES
floor we'll be back with more live
coverage so just stick with us and we'll
show your continuing shots and more
coverage from press conferences and
everything else you can find out here on
the chill floor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
