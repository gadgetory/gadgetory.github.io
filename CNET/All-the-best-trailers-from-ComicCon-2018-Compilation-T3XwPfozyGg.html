the mass extinction we feared has
already begun and we are the cause we
are the infection
but like all living organisms the earth
unleashed a fever to fight this
infection its original and rightful
rulers the Titans for thousands of years
these creatures have remained in hiding
around the world and unless all the
Titans are found our planet will perish
and so will we
they are the only guarantee that life
will carry on
you are on your goddamn minds I am sorry
but this is the only way
long live the king
in the vast emptiness of the universe we
have found a fullness of cultural
diversity and when a first contact
unfolds the cosmos becomes a living
breathing organism and we become a way
for the universe to know itself wow that
was pretty good thanks I plagiarized it
like nine different things I'm receiving
a distress signal

contact with that star system negative

worse once control I don't even know
what they yell at you I'm not so bad

drink away that's hope
I'm so proud of you I'm elf Oh remember
the trick to not getting swept over the
waterfall is swimming upstream got it
you can do anything if you believe in
yourself
it's amazing to meet you it is simply
extraordinary
maybe this will all make sense if I
explain Who I am my name is dr. Ellie
staple and I'm a psychiatrist my work
concerns and a particular type of
delusion of grandeur it's a growing
field I specialize in those individuals
who believe they are superheroes good
for you
the three of you have convinced
yourselves you have extraordinary gifts
like something out of a comic book David
Dunn the only person to survive that
trainwreck all those years ago what do

have superpowers

my name is Patricia I have no question
there are two dozen identities I'm Mary
Reynolds senior we almost got to broke
that live in that body with you it'd be
it's common any minute now for you yeah
but what I am questioning is your belief
that you are something more than human
being and yet
it is true my bones break easily and
I've had 94 breaks in my life but you
have an extraordinary thank you
this is not a cartoon this is the real
world
no way and yet some of us still don't
die with bullets
some of us can still bend steel I've
been waiting for world to see that we
exist may I meet the Beast I hope for
your sake that he likes you that sounds
like the bad guys taming on a lot of
people are going to die

hypocrite

away from another institution away from
another cage it was last time I felt
like I belonged anywhere what are you
waiting for
mrs. Christ sorry it's kind of a private
moment Marcus you satisfied with your
life

people like your school will you be
surrounded by your peers Master the
deadly arts

solver
