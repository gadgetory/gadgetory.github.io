are releasing the first ever eye
tracking VR headsets you could buy and
take home why use eye tracking well it
can do several things by tracking your
pupil motions fove can know where you're
looking and know to only focus on making
the graphics look great in that zone
also being able to focus and hone in on
certain objects much like your eye does
which means you can actually control or
shoot little things like these little
drones in the sky there are six infrared
emitters per eye that form a ring one
infrared camera in each eye that's how
it tracks what you're doing foam
supports steamvr but it doesn't work
with all glasses wearers including me
it was a tight fit on my head but it's
not designed for the average consumer it
could be used for people like marketers
to look around and check out what things
are more interesting in the store or
doctors to notice where you're looking
and how your eyes are moving to
potentially diagnose diseases fove
admits that this is really for
developers and those who want to explore
what to do with it foam is available now
and it's a sign of VR to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
