going to take a look at the Acer Aspire
7600 u so this is a 27 inch touchscreen
Windows 8 all-in-one from Acer cost 1899
and it certainly has the appearance of a
high-end slick looking PC you can see
here it has the familiar edge to edge
glass and a nice big display this is a
27-inch screen that's 1920 by 1080
resolution it's a touch screen and it's
also pretty responsive doesn't have some
of the drag you get on other touchscreen
designs and in general we're pretty
happy with the way there's reacts to our
input at least in terms of our input on
the screen now there's actually a
gesture recognition feature that comes
with this PC and it doesn't work that
well it's not that responsive so the
gestures are kind of confusing and in
general it's probably best left
forgotten so although the system has
some pretty great looks and actually has
some interesting features overall it's
pretty overpriced so one of the big
downfalls of the system is its
resolution
now Dell has a system that's XPS one 27
it's also 27 inch touchscreen all-in-one
that it's kind of a spoiler among the
new Windows 8 PCs that system has a 2560
by 1440 screen resolution for roughly
the same price and it really makes these
19 by 10 screens look kind of inferior
now another problem with this system is
its core features it has a mobile grade
Core i5 CPU that's really not that fast
particularly for its price otherwise
it's pretty well equipped but again not
enough to justify its high-end price tag
it has eight gigs of RAM a terabyte hard
drive although the hard drive is slower
it's a 5400 rpm model you get 7200 rpm
in most other pcs it also has a geforce
GT 640 m graphics chip now that chip
does give this PC decent gaming
capability but you can certainly find
more on other pcs in the same price so
this is not to say the system doesn't
have some positives there's some USB 3
ports on the side here which is great SD
card input couple analog audio jacks
nothing too surprising there but you
look on the back you'll see a nice clean
design as well as a series of ports that
really give the system some nice
multimedia flexibility there's a couple
more USB ports on the back as well as an
Ethernet input there's also two HDMI
inputs as well as an HDMI output that
lets you connect all kinds of external
devices to this PC to use as a secondary
display and with HDMI out you can
actually connect another monitor the
system
expand your display space that really
makes it pretty flexible now you might
also be drawn to its design you can see
it has a pretty clean line front here
this transparent chin if you will it's
not maybe for everybody but it's
certainly not terrible the one downside
is these three branding stickers here no
other windows 8 all in ones have gotten
rid of those and moving them to other
places that are not quite so obvious now
along with other big screen touch on
ones there is sort of the temptation and
want to use this system without walking
up to it and sitting down in front of it
to use a keyboard and mouse so to
facilitate that acer has made a pretty
decent stand on the back here so it's a
glossy plastic design that you can see
it has the power cable going right into
the bottom here that's kind of
interesting but not really that
functionally important but what's nice
about the stand is how easily adjustable
it is now you definitely need some
desktop clearance in order to really use
it but you can see it drops down and
comes back up with very little hassle so
you might have heard that acer is trying
to revamp its images sort of a
bargain-basement PC vendor and this
system is pretty good evidence that it's
starting to pay attention to design and
really make a nice looking computer but
while it might hit some of the right
aesthetic notes overall the system
doesn't have enough value to justify its
price so I'm rich Brown this is the Acer
Aspire 7600 you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
