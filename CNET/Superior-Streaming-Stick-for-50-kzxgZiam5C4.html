and smaller over the years and now they
finally will bit all the way down to the
Roku streaming stick this is actually
the second streaming stick that Roku's
made but the new model is a huge leap
forward now that it worked with any TV
that has an HDMI port and it's half the
price at just fifty dollars hey I'm
Matthew miskovic for cnet and the
streaming stick is Roku's answered to
Google's $35 chromecast it has the same
compact form factor with essentially all
the hardware of a full-sized Roku box
packed into a device that's not much
bigger than a USB flash drive the
plastic casing sports roku's signature
purple color which won't be on display
since it's designed to live behind your
TV in a spare hdmi port the back of the
TV placement would leave the stick
almost entirely concealed except it
needs power which it can get from a USB
port on your TV or by connecting to the
included power adapter there's not much
else to the device save for a micro USB
port a small indicator light and a tiny
button you can use to reset the stick if
it freezes up in terms of internal
hardware it has dual band Wi-Fi support
as well as full 1080p output now while
the chromecast relies on your smartphone
or tablet for all its navigation the
streaming stick includes an actual
remote it's essentially the same remote
you'd get with Roku's other budget
streaming boxes although it works with
Wi-Fi direct so it can communicate with
the stick when it's hidden behind your
TV Roku also lets you control the stick
using its mobile app and the streaming
stick supports some casting
functionality similar to the chromecast
for netflix and youtube so with the
streaming stick do you get to choose
which kind of control scheme you prefer
the streaming stick is also packed with
apps there are over 1,200 apps on Roku's
platform and while many of these are
filler there's also a lot of great
content including netflix amazon instant
HBO Go Hulu Plus Pandora MLB TV amazon
cloud player voodoo and Showtime any
time even better the streaming stick has
cross-platform search so you can search
for a movie or TV show
and we'll show you all the services that
offer that content and how much it costs
now in this version of the streaming
stick first came out we liked almost
everything about it except for the fact
that some apps like Netflix and YouTube
took over 30 seconds to load since then
roku's made big improvements to the
netflix app slowed speed getting it down
to just five seconds so while there are
still some apps to take a while to boot
up it feels like a much smaller issue
now that Netflix works quickly and when
you look at the total package the Roku
streaming stick is definitely worth the
extra fifteen dollars over the
chromecast with its huge library of apps
the included remote and cross-platform
search the Roku 3 is still the better
overall streamer since it's faster and
it includes the cool remote with a
built-in headphone jack but it also
costs twice as much so when it comes to
overall value it's tough to beat the
fifty-dollar Roku streaming stick i'm
matthew miskovic from cnet and this is
the Roku streaming stick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
