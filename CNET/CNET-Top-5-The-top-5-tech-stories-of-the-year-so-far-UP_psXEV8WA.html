we're pretty much halfway done with this
year really so let's take a look at the
five biggest tech stories so far at
number 5 consolidation is the game I'm
lumping together this trend as one story
verizon is trying to buy an AOL for 4.4
billion dollars 18t is trying to acquire
directv 4 48.5 billion dollars then
there's that report that t-mobile and
dish might get together Comcast tried to
buy Time Warner Cable but that fell
apart for charters showed up and try to
gobble up time warner cable and bright
house networks these are the folks who
control the communication lines in the
US so keep an eye out on what feels
actually go through and which one is
done at number 4 the u.s. embracing net
neutrality this year the United States
rule to regulate the Internet as utility
and then issue new rules to join Chilean
other countries to preserve netra
chirality what does that mean as cnet's
own Maggie Riordan boiled it down the
new rules make sure no broadband
provider can block lawful content nor
can it throttle specific applications or
services third a broadband provider
can't be paid to prioritize content no
fast lanes on the internet in other
words the internet should continue to
work the way it already does bits or
bits and are all treated the same at
number three is the Apple watch release
in April Apple released the Apple watch
at a starting price around three hundred
fifty dollars SmartWatch was kind of a
hard sell if the device that has limited
functionality away from a paired iPhone
Apple hasn't released any official sales
numbers but analyst at kononenko
estimated that total Apple watch
pre-orders worldwide reached about 1
million units during the first weekend
of availability at number two the free
windows 10 upgrade why is this a big
story Microsoft Windows 10 is an
aggressive move to get people to upgrade
from windows 7 machines and above the
company has been a victim of its own
success at times because some people
refuse to upgrade why switch from
windows 7 to use the semi alien Windows
8 Windows 10 takes care of a lot of
complaints people had about windows 8
and at a price of free for the first
year we might actually see a big wave of
adoption to Windows 10 what's released
on july twenty ninth
and the biggest tech news story of the
year so far is television over the
Internet becoming a reality 2015 was the
year when people looking to ditch the
traditional cable or satellite packages
got some options first up with sling TV
from dish network that brought a bundle
of networks of people over the Internet
at a base price of twenty dollars in
March we got PlayStation view Sony's
fifty dollar per month television of the
Internet offering HBO finally got in the
game offering up an online version of at
a channel that required no cable
subscription the television industry
doesn't like change but the fact that
all of this happened is huge who knows
what'll happen in the future maybe
Google by Tesla or Apple will purchase
you yeah you okay that's probably
unlikely anyway for more top five like
