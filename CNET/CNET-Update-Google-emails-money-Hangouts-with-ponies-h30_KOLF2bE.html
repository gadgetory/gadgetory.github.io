out with ponies I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update you can now
send someone money on gmail google has
added new ways to use Google Wallet to
make payments online such as attaching a
payment in the same way you'd attach a
photo the feature is rolling out slowly
but when you get it you'll see a dollar
sign icon at the bottom near the
attachment icons you can also send money
to people who are not using Gmail
service fees do apply if you're sending
money using a Google Wallet linked
credit or debit card but it is free if
your bank account is linked to google
wallet or if you're using a wallet
prepaid account if you're getting
worried about security Google Wallet
will cover you for unauthorized payments
and Google's also make getting easy for
app developers to incorporate wallet as
a way to make quick payments inside of
an Android app merchants can also tie
google wallet into loyalty cards or
other reward programs and that's not the
only change to gmail google added quick
action buttons which let you RSVP to an
event invite without even opening the
email invite and the next day you could
see another quick action button to rate
the place that you went to it's also
scanning your email for flight
information so when you get a flight
confirmation email all the data will
just display on the top of the screen
it's rolling out now over the next few
weeks and more quick action buttons
could be added in the future among the
many Google announcements this week is a
new app worth checking out it's called
hangouts it's google's new standalone
messaging app and it's for android and
iphone basically it gives you a way to
connect with your friends no matter if
they're on their desktop using Google+
or on a mobile device it can be a
private one-on-one chat or a group
hangout and users can send photos and
connect to video chats messaging apps
are very popular right now so Google is
trying to get into space by making it
easy to communicate no matter what
screen you have near you and what's
interesting is that if you read the
message on one device it'll know to get
rid of the Hangout invite waiting for
you on the other device but perhaps the
most important feature in hangouts is
the ability to send ponies to your
bronies if you're using hangouts in
Google+ on your desktop in
chrome be sure to type / ponies or for
more magical friendship goodness type in
/ pony stream you know with all this
google news it's only fair to give a
shot out to microsoft's bing this week
my fellow Trekkies should go to bing and
search for the phrase beam me up and
you'll be transported to a world where
no google user has gone before and bing
translate can now help you brush up on
your Klingon before you see the new
movie that's your tech news update you
can find more details at cnet com /
