Veronica Belmont and I Mario nu√±ez and
we're here at crave thank you for having
me back again of course you're a natural
no thanks so what is crave all about
again crave is the video podcast where
we talk about all the wild wacky weird
stuff that they write about on the crave
cnet com blog okay well speaking of
crazy wacky silly kind of gadgets I saw
there's an apple fanboy out of st. Louis
I know nothing about apple fanboys oh
yeah neither what he created an entire
bar out of old apple monitors and gold
computers it's just furniture out of
apple stuff that is awesome it must have
taken him forever to accumulate all that
different retro a year I think there was
over 30 machines in there man I would
love to have all that stuff so what kind
of drink would you drink at an apple bar
uh maybe an appletini but anyhow so I
went out of town for the weekend I went
up to Napa right and I have two caps at
home on the cat lady and I realized it
would be wonderful to have a webcam to
hang out and watch their every move and
now there's a company out of France
called meccano that made a robot named
Spike and so this is of course for our
robot watch welcome to robot long
I missed robot watch I know that's
before your time you'll learn so anyway
this robot is really great so he's on
wheels so he rides around and he has a
Skype phone built into him nice i'm not
entirely sure what the skype phone does
i don't know if you can call him and
make suggestions i'm where to go watch
your cats or whatever it is that you're
guarding at home but he's a nice little
spy but he'll take care of the house for
you while you're away and you can
monitor all your household activities
that sounds really cool you love those
robots I notice okay well so another
thing I found which I think our producer
Sarah would love cuz she rides her bike
to work every day I'm so am i but is a
bike that actually charges your cell
phone yeah so he's like an awful lot of
it seems like a lot of work and my phone
will probably never be charged if I had
to do that yeah I rode my bike to work a
couple times and the combination of the
traffic and the noises and the sweaty
and the grossest I was over at real fast
my phone will not charge I would prefer
to drive and you know what i would like
to drive what would you like to drive
the ecto-1 Ghostbusters card it's
actually going up on auction so you can
buy it for a hundred and fifty thousand
dollars that's where the autumn starts I
think so if you've got the extra cash if
you want a little piece of 80's movie
history go and get yourself that very
car no speaking of extra cash if you
have a lot of extra cash to spend theirs
is the Gucci holder for the blackberry
phone which you must have I'm so sick of
all these designer phone gadgets mi it's
just it's too much it really is I'm just
not that into it i'd rather have a phone
that does my calls and my things and
maybe my email I don't need it to cost
how much does this one cost it doesn't
say but it it's got to be either way
it's a waste of money right and so
finally to end this crave episode I give
you cat in scuba suit it began when
hawkeyes owner gene Alba decided to find
a way to combine his two passions
his cat and scuba diving so he said
about designing and constructing a
one-of-a-kind feline sized oxygen tank
harness and breathing apparatus it was
the challenge that was quite difficult
to put this gear together but I tried to
be able to scoop it up once finished it
was time to test it out amazingly
Hawkeye took to her new underwater world
without fear in fact Jean claims his kid
he actually relaxes when she dives
easily staying under for nearly an hour
okay well i like my cat so I wouldn't do
that to them cruel but um it is pretty
funny that's all we have for this week

photos or videos or anything else that
you've seen out there on the internets
