report the show about the tech news that
everyone is talking about this week the
smallest phone you'll never use the
PlayStation networks rocky re-launch and
everybody hates AT&amp;amp;T again no this is
not a rerun first up it's the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
new HP veer and I'll tell you one thing
about this phone it is small and at a
time when other phones are getting
bigger and bigger and bigger maybe
that's a good thing unless it's so small
that you can't really use it I actually
think that HP made the beer too small
because the beer is so small HP couldn't
fit in a headphone jack or a micro USB
port so instead they put in this
magnetic connector on the side but I
mean come on there's got to be a market
for a phone that's as small as four
quarters laid out in a square in fact I
know there is women with long
fingernails who can't use touchscreen
phones and want to stash their phones in
their pockets not a purse when they ride
their bikes basically our producer Sarah
except that she hates AT&amp;amp;T and she
refuses to buy it I guess you can kind
of see why HP lowered its earnings
guidance earlier this week keep trying
guys and now for the news Sony
relaunched the PlayStation Network this
week to the delight of gamers who
despite having their identities ripped
off simply cannot wait to get right back
online and play call of duty black ops
Sony offered customers a month of free
PSN service an apology for the almost
month-long outage interestingly Japan
won't allow PSN to come back online
there because it says sony hasn't met
its stringent security requirements but
it's good enough for America wow thanks
sony and sure enough by the middle of
the week there were reports of yet
another security vulnerability that
knocked the PSN password reset system
offline sony says there was no hack just
an exploit that was immediately patched
but let's just say that the benefit of
the doubt supplies are low around here
right now ATT customer satisfaction is
on the decline according to the American
Customer Satisfaction Index because some
jokes just write themselves
the annual survey found that 18 tooth
customer satisfaction went down four
percent over the last year to 66 out of
100 interestingly tmobile score also
went down four percent to 70 out of 100
now analysts say it's normal for
consumer satisfaction scores to go down
after a big merger but not so much
before so kind of fun to imagine what
might happen to consumer satisfaction if
that merger does go through considering
people want that to happen about as much
as they'd like to have a rabid badger
for a pet by the way 18 tease response
to this survey was to say in essence
people may hate us but they're not
leaving our turn is still super low so
wait once you've locked them into
contracts it will cost them hundreds of
dollars to break then you can fool
yourself into thinking that they're
actually not that mad at you yeah good
luck with that one guys in other news
this week I would like to thank cameron
and tyler winklevoss for providing me
with a steady stream of news I can't
believe the why nervous boys as you
recall were denied their grudge match
against facebook for the third time last
month with the judge saying they would
have to live with the 65 million dollar
settlement from Facebook and also that
the litigation just needs to stop the
whiner bosses claim of course that CEO
Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea in
creating facebook but despite three
federal appeals courts telling them they
have no case the mockery of millions and
the fact that their settlement is now
worth about a hundred million dollars
the whiner boss's plan to take this case
all the way to the US Supreme Court I
mean why not the Supreme Court has
nothing better to do than indulge a
couple of rich white boys who had that
one good idea that one time and
apparently haven't ever had a good one
since okay how about some news that
doesn't make me mad it's time to see
what's clogging the tubes from the make
blog this is the most fun you will have
watching balls swing back and forth
don't you feel calmer it's so Zen you
have to watch the whole video to see the
patterns repeat it's amazing I'll see
you guys at maker faire and that's the
buzz report for this week everyone I'm
Molly Wood and thank you for watching
that's all Sparkman not surprisingly if
there's a ball joke in the script it
came from strife alright thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
