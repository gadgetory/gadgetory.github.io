the big tech surprises of the year I'm
Dan Ackerman and this is the Microsoft
Surface book now as opposed to the
Microsoft Surface pro that system is
basically a full-time tablet with a
clip-on keyboard cover that makes it a
part-time laptop the surface book on the
other hand is a full-time clamshell
laptop with a detachable screen that
makes it a part-time tablet so how do I
know that it's supposed to be a
full-time laptop and part time tablet
partially it's because they take the
battery and they cut it into two pieces
75% of the battery capacity is built in
here into the keyboard base while 25% of
the capacity may be about three hours
worth is behind the display here along
with the CPU and a lot of the other
components so they want you to use it
most of the time like a traditional
premium you know high-end laptop and
then if you want to you can pop the
screen off if you want to share
something or you want to go read a book
for a while or just kind of walk around
with it and then you plug it back in
there's even a higher end configuration
that includes a new custom GPU from
Nvidia that sits right here in the base
along with most of the battery so when
you have it plugged in you can use that
graphics card for video editing or some
light gaming and then when you just take
the tablet screen off the graphics card
get left behind because you don't really
need it when you're walking around with
just the tablet there are a lot of
similarities between the surface book
and the surface pro they both have three
by two aspect ratio touchscreens that
actually match it up with a piece of a4
paper so if you're working on you know
let's say design for something that's
gonna be printed eventually that makes a
lot of sense they both include this
excellent stylist Microsoft calls it a
pen and it attaches magnetically to the
side right here works with a whole bunch
of different drawing and sketching and
note-taking apps including of course
OneNote from Microsoft and they both use
Intel's new 6th generation of core I
series processors a Core i5 and core i7
processors after years of saying the
surface pro series is the tablet that
can replace your laptop Microsoft now
says they've gone and built what they
call the ultimate laptop it's certainly
very nicely done if I were building the
ultimate laptop it wouldn't have this
strange unsightly gap in the middle when
you have it closed in in clamshell form
and also wouldn't weigh close to three
and a half pounds it's a little hefty
for kind of just picking up and casually
carrying around
the house that's it with all these
features built-in the touchscreen the
stylus the new Intel processors this guy
starts at $14.99 but if you want to
trade up to the graphics card that's
gonna be several hundred dollars more
I'm Dan Akron and that is the Microsoft
