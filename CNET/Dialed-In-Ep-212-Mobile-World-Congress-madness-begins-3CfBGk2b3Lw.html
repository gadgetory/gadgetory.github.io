dialed in today is Monday the 27th of
februari and we are going to talk about
all the new mobile world congress news
that is coming out of the show basically
Mobile World Congress has arrived in
full force the premier European tech
show for all things mobile phone related
Mobile World Congress is getting bigger
and wilder than ever so you know
basically yesterday we had a ton of
phones that hit as well as some tablets
too we're talking folks from Samsung LG
HTC Sony even lesser known companies
like Huawei had some pretty bold
statements yesterday and today so we're
going to talk about all those things
today we're joined by the awesome Lynn
law hey Lynn hey glad you can join us
and we have a special treat for you guys
out there listen to the show for a while
it's bonnie cha the the illustrious
Bonnie cha joined us so you know give it
give it a hand for her and we're going
to be chatting about all the new stuff
that came out of Mobile World Congress
so if you guys don't know I'm sure you
do but Mobile World Congress is the
major show that happens in Barcelona in
Spain and basically you know all these
phone makers it used to be a lot of just
purely European launches and global
announcements but now kind of like sets
the stage of what is gonna happen for
the rest of the year including the US so
it's become a really big show I think as
far as mobile news yeah it's crazy
because I mean you know from what i can
tell i mean wasn't there like some first
of all be good into all the details
really quick but in a minute but I mean
this I'm not this the first time that
happened but we had two devices from HTC
that were announced that were they
announced actual US carriers yeah
which is crazy it is because usually you
know in the years passed that I've gone
they you know announce these phones but
they never have any us specific details
they're always like oh well now's that
later it's always kind of like global
royal Europe or Asia but it's good to
see that they're addressing the u.s.
audience now I know it's it's pretty
wild and then you know of course last
week we talked about how Verizon had a
presence it last year shown is supposed
to have a presence at this year's show
and that's pretty amazing so we've got
you know basically like you know what is
it the American invasion of Barcelona
yeah so but it's pretty cool and just to
jump into the news really quick you can
check out a recap of day one I call the
day one I wrote a really recap really
quick recap of this but it's technically
it's really day zero but there's a first
day that we had folks there and it seems
like the first day for everyone just
because so many press conferences happen
yeah we had first we had huawei and they
made some really crazy boast saying that
they had the fastest smartphone in the
world right which is I mean hello that's
yeah if for like you know for a minute
or two you know i mean it's it's uh you
guys don't know it's the ascend d quad
which is doesn't exactly roll off the
tongue but it's basically a smartphone
that is running a quad-core chip that
Huawei actually designs themselves yeah
I found that interesting that they went
with the chip that they made themselves
instead of using you know an nvidia chip
or polymer you know right exactly
exactly so I mean it's it's it's
interesting how they would you know come
on stage and start talking about you
know how this phone is you know the best
yeah and in the fastest and all of that
stuff especially when they're coming out
with a with a phone that that's running
a processor that's no one ever tested
before hey but hey you know what I'll
take it I'll take all the quad core news
that we can get you know yeah it's like
always really kind of stepping up their
game because they've been known more for
kind of lower end funds right
you know like entry-level stuff but
though though they did at was it just
the other day at CES they showing off
some global phones had ya had ice cream
sandwich I was like one of the first
ones actually I saw personally that had
ice cream sandwich running Android 4.2
that's pretty interesting and then on
top of that we had you know LG coming
out with their LG 4x HD which is
actually going to be a quad-core device
and running Tegra 3 Nvidia's Tegra 3
chip so and they're there they're
definitely bringing their game as well
to this show yeah and one thing I wanted
to bring up Roger had the story but it
sounds like LG and Google are in talks
of possibly doing a nexus phone which is
oh yes interesting um you know some
people thought maybe with the google
motorola murderer that you know motorola
would be like kind of the you know go to
manufacturing for their nexus devices
but i guess you know maybe this is
google way of saying hey we're still
committed to other manufacturers to and
yeah i know that's that and actually i'm
sure that would that would make LG very
happy and samsung very upset which would
Prime ya mean more happy definitely i'll
deal is quick to say that nothing's been
like set in stone or anything but
they're definitely in talk so we'll see
what happens we'll see who makes the
next Nexus phone yeah and you know um
now Lynn I know that you kind of had a
chance to check out some of these these
phones at least from not really in
person in Barcelona but just just from
you know checking out the news I mean do
you think of the vu there's also the
Optimus Vu which is the Galaxy Note
competitor I mean that's an interesting
device there too and they announced that
at the show as well yeah I mean I think
we were expecting anyways we call it vu
or view I think Jessica likes for you
but um me and bro oh yeah I I I like the
way that sounds personally I don't know
any way that way yes but yeah we're
excited about it because it's kind of
you know knocking on gala
cenotes territory with the screen size
and and we knew that it was going to be
announced and they did announce it so
it's a 5-inch screen and it's kind of
like a tablet tablet phone kind of thing
and it's going to be fast we believe so
um at well it's not quad core but will
be a dual core processor so we're kind
of looking forward to that I'm looking
forward to that are you are you looking
forward to the stylus though I mean
that's that's the question why was gonna
ask you do you guys think that's gonna
become the next trend like bigger phones
with stylus is thi lai lai lai yeah I
think it would just kind of been a weird
thing if galaxy note was the only one
that came out right listen no one else
did anything yeah so then now that the
LG is going to release their Optimus
foods kind of like well maybe now if it
if the people don't like it they're
going to manufacture it anyways until
maybe people really don't buy any them
from all the manufacturers yeah but you
know it's funny because you wonder can
you really talk about this last week but
can you really see yourself using a
stylus that often I mean I tried to its
ok but and sometimes it's kind of fun
but I still just rather use my fingers
if they're accurate and keyboard yeah
yeah yeah it's like you know I don't
want to drop anything I already drop
stuff who knows maybe I'll affair yeah
it might it might in you know there was
also some other news to which I'm kind
of you know jumping around here and off
of the the chart but Roger also wrote
about how Samsung mentioned to him that
they weren't too happy with their tab
and tablet sales and they hope to
actually you know make some make up some
ground with the note and to me that's
sort of funny because i think the note
is like you know a device that won't
sell as well as a tablet you know but I
fish me the thing with Samsung tablets
is they have so many different models
you know and then you like sighs
different what was the last one they did
the oh right they also announced the
show the tab too right yeah
yeah and I just I think that's kind of
confusing to the conversion right well
it's the difference and you know the
ones i think the 7-inch and now that
yeah and i think they need to kind of
like narrow down there or just focus
more and come out with less models but
you know really distinct and really good
models instead of releasing it we have a
dozen tablet that you can choose from
and actually that's that's sort of the
approach that seems that LG is taking
you know by consolidating their line and
just focusing on a few phones now and
and and i guess they're kind of taking a
page out of apple's book and other folks
you know trying to just you know make
something more easier for consumers to
find and think about and just grab in
the store you know yeah so I mean and
also actually HTC did launch a few
phones as well actually three phones
like we mentioned before basically they
want the one that launched the One X and
watches this whole line called the one
called one right which is sort of
confusing because you've got one out of
many many and one yeah yes three into
one you know so I don't know but um
basically we have the One X which is
which issues the second kind of funny
because it is a quad-core device but
that's only the European model it's so
disappointing that the USB dual core
correct yes yeah and so they announced
that the dual core version is going to
be out on AT&amp;amp;T you know in the spring I
believe so I mean that's that's a real
bummer because you know we wanted to see
the first u.s. quad core smartphone
right I mean there isn't one right right
now I was gonna wear any of the other
quad cores announced for us or just
global right now I think they were all
global yeah yeah cuz I'm it's really
okay you've got the LG optimus and
that's the alt that the LG 4x HD you
remember um and then you have it's
really it's really the HT HTC One X
which is do it which is quad-core global
um and then you've got that huge claim
from Huawei which is the ascend d quad
so you know but all these are global
devices so I don't know what's going on
maybe the carriage didn't want to you
know grab something that was you know
that would just like kind of drop like a
big boulder into their money pond as it
were financial stream their whole plan
you know because I'm sure they have a
lot of devices they'd like to sell first
before someone you know they start
telling us something that's so powerful
yeah so but yeah so I mean we so
speaking of HTC we've got we've got the
the 1x which is quad-core we also have
the let's see the 1s which is a device
that it looks sort of like a what would
you say like a it seems like basically
let me just go back to the actual thing
that we were checking out but basically
like there are three different devices
like the one the one x has a big like
4.5 inch screen whereas the other 1i
44.7 I'm just this is off the top my
head and then sorry go ahead yeah than
the one ex I mean the 1s has a 4.3 inch
screen right yep and then I think the 1v
think it's the same it's 3.7 inches 3.7
exactly so so like you have you know at
the bottom and actually it's kinda
interesting because the 1v was announced
for tmobile that will actually have a
tmobile availability no no no I'm sorry
the 1s was one v doesn't have any
announced carrier yet but the one the 1v
the smallest one harkens back to the the
old legend yeah I remember that and and
also that even the hero the European
hero a bunch of years ago that actually
had a unibody metal design with you know
this chin yeah which a lot of people
hated so you know some people like to
because was interesting but but anyway
so that's the 1 V and then the one s is
more of like a like a nexus one to me
yeah
or even you know I was even gonna say
like like a sensation yeah something
like that HTC sensation because it has a
kind of rounded look and then it also
has the will of good news is that all
three phones are running ice cream
sandwich which is great so and all they
all have the new version of fence as
well yes yes yeah they will have I think
it's what is it four point oh I think it
is yeah so well funny thing is uh HTC
did talk to cnet and kind of describe
what the new version the new version of
sense will be like and they said that
the whole idea is to you know since
they've got ice cream sandwich there
they wanted to make sense sort of act
underneath the scene scenes so won't you
know get all unless paraphrasing won't
get up in your face and and you know
kind of hit you with all these fancy
graphics or whatever but they're trying
to still provide the same functionality
that sense offers you know for like
social media integration and all that so
that sounds pretty cool I definitely
want to check it out in person hopefully
so I know we have folks in Barcelona now
that are at the show and definitely
check out you know cnet.com for our
mobile world congress coverage because
we have lots of hands-on videos and
photos of these devices 2 and the 1 i'm
really curious about is actually the
Galaxy Beam oh yeah yeah the Samsung
Galaxy yeah when when I heard about that
that was I was really excited yeah and
it's interesting that there Samsung's
kind of not not even going for the
business that they're going for like
younger people who would use a projector
shoot to show off their photos and video
right I don't know if I'm sold on that
yet though yeah I'm not sure how I think
there may be a neat party trick yeah but
then after while you're like oh I don't
really need this money at this protector
yeah I mean I'm sure to adds a lot of
wheat and a lot of like that takes a lot
of battery life yea though I mean I
would like to personally if I had
something like that I mean okay yeah
sure I would use it to play movies like
at night or someone yeah maybe but I
would definitely want to put some sort
of planetarium on my
that's what i would do immediately
though developers out there planetary
map man oh my god nightlight it's so
great so great so that's what I want to
see but I think we're right now we're
gonna take a little break we'll be right
back and talk more about mobile or
congressman we have seen an expect to
see so stay tuned
hey everyone welcome back to the cnet
dialed in podcast we are talking all
things mobile or Congress today the show
officially kicked off today today is
Monday februari 27 2012 and we're just
getting a low-down of all the news that
rolled out rolled out yesterday from
mole Congress and in this morning as
well so stay tuned we're going to chat
about what is happening first off I mean
another thing that we wanted to mention
and I want to mention was that the Sony
that Sony had a press conference and
they announced the Xperia P and the
expiry you devices which they use the
same design as the Xperia S which kind
of blew everyone away at CES because it
had such a pretty kick butt design very
different it looks like an obelisk from
you know 20 million years in the future
that's an exact date everyone so but
yeah I mean it's like it has this little
thin area on the bottom that is
transparent that lights up like a little
crystal for notifications and all that I
mean it's just a gorgeous phone the one
thing is that these devices are kind of
disappointed though because they're not
dual-core not quad core and they're not
they're not I did not even ice cream
sandwich so at least in that yeah pretty
sure yeah yeah that's the case so at
least for now so that was a shocker so
hopefully you know they'll uh they'll
fix that up and you know maybe maybe
maybe you know this is the thing of
course you don't know how how much we
really do need quad-core really rain you
know I know we all like to chat about it
yeah yeah quad cores less of an issue to
me but the fact that it's running
Gingerbread was an issue was kind of
cool about the Xperia P though is that
it could shoot 3d panoramas I read and I
thought that was kind of interesting I
haven't really heard that one before but
it has a 8 megapixel
Cameron could shoot 2d and 3d panoramas
and I thought that was kind of nifty
well the funny thing is um actually the
back a few months ago I checked out the
sony x sony ericsson xperia arc s that's
a less alone um and that phone actually
did have that capability to it has the
capability to create 3d panoramas
basically I think it takes the that it
only has one lens on the camera one
camera and it stitches basically images
from the from one lens into another
picture takes with the same lens to kind
of create this virtual 3d effect so I'm
not sure how many who actually going to
use that but it you know it's
interesting you know if you want to have
pictures of your house in 3d you know
yeah I mean I away maybe all the time
yeah you know so I mean it's a cool it's
an interesting it's something that sets
it apart as well and it also they
connect to the Sony well first of all
these are the Sony the first phones are
the two other phones that have been
announced that are on only the sony
brand not the sony x sony ericsson brand
so that's that's significant and also
they connect to you know so he talks
about how they connected a sony
entertainment network so you can you
know rent movies and music and all that
kind of stuff so we'll see how that goes
but so yeah and then right after that
there's the huawei also made another
claim besides saying that they had the
world's fastest smartphone they came out
and said they have the first-ever
quad-core 10 inch tablet now I just want
to put out there folks I wrote a quick
post on this and I realize oh my gosh
how can I be saying this because the you
know the Zeus what is it the transformer
prime right yeah yeah that is
technically the first quad-core tablet
that's 10 inch 10.1 inch
1 inches should say um so I don't know
what they're talking about really really
i mean where does like how huawei up you
know out there guys listening how can
you call this a 10 the first quad-core
10 inch tablet when they already have
one from a sous so what's this one is
the first 10.1 inch tablet and this is
the first 10 inch tablet they just
didn't right oh my god but i'll let i
let the i'm sure the lawyers you know a
lot of lawyers are going to make a lot
of money back and forth but I so we'll
see how long that lasts and you know
people got really upset at me for saying
that for just titling up the post what I
title it as I was just honestly I was
just checking out what Huawei said in
their own press release so and it's all
over the web site so okay but fair
enough I here which saying maybe it's
not you know they're definitely trying
to play a game here so uh and then soul
in you're talking about you know you saw
the or at least wrote about the new
nokia phones as well that were announced
this morning yeah I saw it well I was I
saw it streamed it was I was announced
at 1130pm through one a.m. pacific time
so well that was a great way to spend
the night but is but it was really
interesting they announced um i think
for new phones it's a lot of its three
the 203 203 and 302 which is kind of
their lower and phones in the Asha
family but the most interesting one is
their new Lumia model it's the Lumia 610
and they made some announcements about
the Lumia 900 that's been already out
the 900s got to go global with with a
Roger wireless in Canada oh yeah Rogers
yeah and some news about going to China
which we kind of expected but the the
new Lumia 610 is their kind of lower not
lower end but it's just for a younger
audience they say it will be running
Windows Phone tango and it has a five
minute mango you mean mango oh no tangos
the upcoming update oh really yeah
crap that's weak to do this just
happened yeah this morning yeah oh my
gosh and I go we'll have a 5 megapixel
camera 3.2 inch display and before the
subsidy it will be two hundred fifty
four dollars but over here in the United
States I don't know how much it will
cost because we do have subsidy prices
so and it's going to be um they talked
about how it's going to be really
integrated with xbox live users so I
don't have an xbox account so that
wasn't that didn't really matter to me
but I know people who have and I think
that they'd probably be excited about
this phone if they have an xbox account
that sounds pretty good though I'm sold
you know dealing and grappling with the
idea that this thing is called tango
there is a mango can you possibly make
it more confusing I think it's just
ending a no that's their thing right oh
yeah that's kind of oh yeah so there's a
mango so what's the next one gonna be uh
bingo bongo something like that
something like that what has to be a
fruit though or some kind of well tank
was unfair all right anyway uh lets
smartphone names are just becoming so
over the top um and then Lynn you you
were talking about the the also the ad
okay oh aight 808 PureView um there was
a teaser a couple of days ago where it
was just kind of like Nokia released
this kind of video about people in the
snow and I mentioned something pure was
going to come and I mentioned it the
word pier like three times and then
finally found out it's this new model
called 808 PureView and it has a 41
megapixel camera that is ridiculous a
gratuitous 41 degrees ever which is
gonna cost like a five hundred thousand
dollars um 605 um I know these numbers
are really weird but it's cuz it's in
euros and when they say dude señores it
was like a kind of flat right but it was
um it wasn't even everman 605 it's
coming out in May and yeah and they talk
about how the playback for the audio is
really great cd-quality audio playback
it has dolby headphone technology and
just a lot of for the camera lovers I
would think that this is what the phones
for
now I wonder it now it's a world of ice
though right it's not it hasn't they
haven't seen any carrier no they didn't
mention anything guys yeah but it's 605
euros so yeah you have that in your near
bank there and they're talking about
like how you could take pictures and
blow it up and it'll be really clear and
and if you want to make a poster out of
something then this is kind of the phone
for you to do it and we thought I
thought that was kind of interesting
just because it's nice to have a high
resolution camera but I had never taken
a picture and thought I should make a
billboard out of this phone yeah I think
Josh Goldman actually made a good point
in a tweet earlier this morning and it's
not necessarily about the 41 megapixels
about high resolution photos but rather
about digital zooming things like that
so you know it doesn't lose quality when
you yeah and I think we've seen like
with caramel phones it's not it doesn't
just because it has a higher pixel
megapixel camera doesn't always mean
you're gonna get the best picture
quality and you know exactly I would
think after like 12 megapixels yeah like
the time for too late okay yeah so yeah
I mean you know definitely you know
camera phones are you know cameras on
phones or phones being used as cameras
is a huge trend so you know definitely
want to keep an eye on that because HTC
with their new phones also said that
their cameras are there phones have
awesome cameras so it's definitely a
trend that you know people want to take
lots of pictures with their with their
phone aspose of their camera and let's
you know let's just move on out actually
really quick because we're running out
of time but let's talk about a really
quick i'll just mention one review that
I wrote for you guys out there we
haven't been writing many reviews this
week just because of mobile or Congress
but I took a look at the job support
bluetooth headset it's not I wasn't that
impressed with it to be honest maybe
just because my ears are too too small
but I couldn't fit in my ears and if you
know had a very uncomfortable fit but
you know it's waterproof it's rugged but
it's a little pricey yet $99 bluetooth
headset that's stereo so you can connect
to your phone and have you know make
calls that kind of thing you can
definitely check out the review online
cnet com and that's pretty much the show
except we're going to just you know if I
think we can take a look really quick at
one read your email I don't know if you
guys will be able to help me with this
but Brian slit who sent us an email
basically asking you know what kind of
unlock device could he get on verizon
that does LTE to me I don't know I mean
I feel his pain because I know that
everybody wants some LTE love there but
unlock devices are typically gsm I
haven't really I mean we talked about
people trying to use unlocked cdma
devices from other carriers that might
work but I haven't heard of anyone
actually doing that and it's also not
exactly the most legal thing to do so
and there might just boot you off the
network so i can you hook it up so i
don't think there's a way to do it but I
don't know Bonnie and you probably
haven't heard of anybody mean is he is
he like committed to staying like that
he wants us to want to stay yeah I want
Stan verizon that's why so gavotte it
gets tricky ya feelin wait device ism
yeah I mean LTE technically because I
mean AT&amp;amp;T is using LTE know right so and
there but they have a kind of a hybrid
network though yeah yeah so there's no I
mean yeah it doesn't look like the
Chancellor to good my feeling is you
know trying since your contractors up
maybe should check out some other
carriers see what other LTE options
available I know that the Galaxy Note
delivered some really blazing 4G LTE
speeds on AT&amp;amp;T in my view so I'm you
know it looks like their network is
pretty nice so you want to maybe shop
around take a look at what other phones
available and ATT is gonna be having a
lot of new phones being announced within
the next few months to so definitely
check that out so there you have it
folks you have just listened to us for a
full half hour so hopefully you had a
