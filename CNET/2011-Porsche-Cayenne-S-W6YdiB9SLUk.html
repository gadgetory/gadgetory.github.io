lighter this thing's actually starting
to look like a Porsche let's jump in the
2011 Cayenne S and check the tach
easy to spot the second-generation
Cayenne doesn't come off like such a
blunderbuss anymore
much more curvaceous has eyes like a
Carrera a cabin from a Panamera a
shorter nose to tail distance and fuel
economy you won't have to hide your head
over now inside the new Cayenne you
could also be inside the new Panamera
they've carried over that cabin design
with this wide deep very button laden
center console and stack is a lot going
on here we have the PDC C which is the
full-on in-car electronics package that
includes a navigation system it's got a
very nice-looking map these days Porsche
has come a long way in that and compared
to some other poor shows especially some
recent 911s they've really moved the
screen up and tilted it towards you it's
a touchscreen as you can see it's not
like any other interface in the car biz
you've got this guy here to unroll some
sort of mini icon widget buttons no one
else really does that when you touch the
screen it pulls up a few more things
like magnification and direction you've
also got a knob to handle zoom here this
is kind of a one-off in the auto
business let's go to our audio now
sources on that guy include am/fm
satellite radio discs we have a single
disc slot right here and we've also got
auxilary which in this case can include
bluetooth streaming as well as a
standard aux and a USB over here and we
have a Bose audio rig that's optional as
is the nearly $6,000 Burmaster surround
system we can tell you it sounds good
but not the most stunning we've heard
once we've off the center stack lots of
what's devoted to the console our
comfort controls and sissy grab bars as
well there here on the door and the
console
you've got cooled seats heated seats all
manner of ventilation controls here and
here is our 8-speed Tiptronic shifter a
manual gate on this side your usual PR
nd in the middle and paddles that are
very disappointingly mounted on the
wheel instead of on the stalk where they
should be over here are your drive
controls a sport mode here takes over
all
the vehicle sort of behaviors or you can
independently adjust your suspension for
comfort normal or sport which includes
lowering the chassis you've also got a
manual chassis lowering control here and
you've got a terrain control over on
this side nice Porsche cluster here in
front I like the one that's just to the
right of the tachometer that is this
sort of multifunction round video screen
you can check tire pressure look at
vehicle stats on mileage and range look
at your audio system what you're looking
at currently there's navigation texts
for your next direction here's a subset
of the map there are my phone status
indications now for a near hundred
thousand dollar car as equipped from a
very esteemed engineering company this
Cayenne is kind of full of small not so
small ergonomic gaffes
the worst one has to be the two
cupholders here nicely placed
beautifully stable and well engineered
too well engineered these little prongs
that hold your cup together are designed
by the devil because they're too stiff
and they're too grippy you do like this
they won't let go and then all of a
sudden that other frustrations include
the unlock button the master for the car
is over here on the console there isn't
one on the doors this overhead console
here has lots of Legends printed on
these buttons and there's lots of them
but they're so flat facing you got to do
this and look way underneath there
that's fun while you're driving
now the engine bay of our cayenne ass
holds a wonder of a motor a 4.8 liter v8
with just about everything cool about
gas engines going on within it direct
injection quad cam or valves per
cylinder all manner of variable valve
timing throughout it you've also got dry
sump lubrication so instead of the usual
crankcase hanging down under the engine
there's a reservoir offshore and all the
lubrication is pumped in under pressure
this is about as good as they get the
numbers are also nice 400 horsepower 369
foot-pounds of torque
it feels good across the rev range aside
from where the transmission gets in the
way and 1622 mpg 400 horsepower is
considerable but power was just not the
main memo I got from this car handling
was nothing this big or tall or heavy
has the right to feel this much like a
car and a nimble one at that
and not only does it stick but it does
so without feeling like it just
performed a miracle when it does and
that's the real matter I blame the
8-speed Tiptronic automatic for the
power delivery being not much like a
sports car there's just too much
thinking and gear shuffling going on
when you stab it need to get some power
right now and you can go into sport mode
which helps a lot but then there's too
much talk nurse and too much busyness in
the rpms I just never found a good happy
medium between taught and comfortable
everyday driving
okay let's price this big boy this new
generation 2011 cayenne ass basis at
about sixty four seven then it's like
going to one of those fancy restaurants
or even the potatoes are all a cart
let's start with PCM which gives you
hard drive nav DVD playback USB for iPod
and thumb drives it's kind of a key
thing but 3,600 bucks XM is still 750 on
top of that rear seat entertainment is
about three grand just buy a couple
iPads and save two thousand a rear park
camera and park sensor package is a
stunning eighteen hundred dollars no
wonder we just had the sensors even the
factory can't afford ceramic brakes are
an absurdity on an on turbo at eighty
two hundred dollars instead spend just a
little more on a combination of rear
torque vectoring active suspension air
shocks and active anti-roll to double
down on what this vehicle does best I
did a quick tally and could easily put
together close to 40 grand in tech and
interior options alone before doing all
the bespoke stuff on the inside and the
outside that isn't tech so it wouldn't
be hard to spend more on options than
the $64,000 base price of our Cayenne s
and there's just something wrong about
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
