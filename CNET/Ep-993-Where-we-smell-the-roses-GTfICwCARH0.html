feel like it's almost a disservice to
your significant other if you decide to
take him out to like a nice restaurant
in New York City today well the idea
that you have already pre-planned a
reservation that you could take it yeah
but you're never gonna get good service

on the menu right see it's funny cuz to
hear you guys complain about this I know
that you hate it but I still know you're
doing something right like you're not
just not doing anything to really know
I'm sure I'm dead I mean she's going to
have an angry wife no man you come on
I've been with this lady for like nine
years dude what does that mean because
time is past doesn't mean that you have
to be any less from first off it's a
nonsense holiday
so here we go oh my god favors yeah but
at least you know I don't spend money
ridiculously on you you had a wedding

Wilson what about you reaffirm I believe
in love tell me what you're doing uh
well like I said earlier I wasn't going
to take my lady out but I will later

the I guess fortunate / misfortune it
depends on how you look at it her
birthday was also last night right uh so
double-header that's it really hurts the
bucket book but yeah tonight I'm gonna
you know do a little low-key dinner cool
yeah what exactly what is longer dinner
that's cool then I wish I could cook you
know baguette bag a big macs that's what
is it yeah you just bring in my castle
and you're all set exactly exactly just
uh though that stuff in the microwave
and get to go yeah speaking of which
Wilson if you wanted to propose to your
girlfriend tonight you could do that at
pizza hut for ten thousand dollars I
know you have this kind of money lying
around but you gotta pay money to
propose it pizza should continue its a
party package deal so for Valentine's
Day this year Pizza Hut is hosting this
special check this out if you spend ten
thousand and ten dollars you'll get a
limo service to the actual pizza hut for
your engagement party a ruby engagement
ring whoa Ruby yeah Ruby why is it not a
diamond well come on it's ten thousand
dollars yeah do 10 grands a lot of girls
to get a lot of pizza and breadsticks
with it with offset the honest route ok
so then there's nine ninety eight
hundred dollars laughs it isn't you know
no beer a big bouquet of flowers a
personal fireworks display that can't be
cheap come on personal it's gonna be
like one popper right yeah
some dick with a sparkler right exactly
a professional photographer that'll show
up and commemorates the worst day of
your life a professional videographer
that'll do the same but in motion yeah
and last a ten-dollar dinner box that
contains one medium topping personal pan
pizza five bread sticks with marinara
sauce and ten cinnamon sticks with sweet
icing top of the box seconds Ian whoever
you propose to tonight with this ten
thousand dollar pizza hut a deal says no
yeah because you proposed her pizza
about a little bit yeah this is
upsetting it's the no it's just like a
marketing thing but if anyone does this
what do you think jail just it should
just go straight to deport it means I go
welcome to an Englishman squad car
picture do a lot with ten thousand
dollars yeah right by a really great
engagement right and you gotta somebody
reposed her yeah I mean it's amazing and
that ten thousand dollars to spend on
pizza hut I would imagine you would have
more money to go do something a little
more special heck even like lighting up
the Empire State building's a little bit
less cheesy nobody cheater it will
literally be cheaper probably probably
what the freak man rich stuff it's not
it's just how no one I'm sorry I'm just
not gonna talk about I don't want don't
do you guys are biased cuz you don't
like pizza that's your problem pizza
sucks yeah it doesn't chat room is
saying uh you know a good thing is after
she says no you've got all this pizza
you could eat yeah I in a corner okay
yeah maybe you can choke on it so I'm
sorry I did you take you simply put but
I mean I think these like viral
marketing gags are getting so ridiculous
yeah like they don't even make any sense
like this this makes zero sense um
you're that guy Ted with the golden
voice yeah I think it was a homeless for
sure of course I think you can actually
hire him to leave a personal greeting on
your girlfriend's voicemail for
Valentine's Day and I think that might
be a viral marketing for Kraft macaroni
and cheese it's like their new social
media campaign hunger okay so you can
actually I forget how much it costs but
oh I'm sorry no you can
all you have to do is leave a Twitter on
their account with a hashtag voice of
love and they're gonna select a hundred
tweets and if you win then he'll leave a
personal greeting on your great yeah it
went some random guy calling up my
league of random anymore he's like got
the voice nothing like combating hunger
with a homeless man right six-month-old
news to no one cares about Ted Williams
anymore that's true I want to talk about
something gonna switch gears a little
bit some that's been grinding my gears
racket to racket and I gotta talk about
my buddy Cory yesterday we were chatting
about this and he feels the way he feels
the exact opposite way about Apple like
beth wilson does right so Wilson loves
apple to node I admire them you love
them yes you are I don't own any more
applications than anybody in this room
yes you do no he does know I don't I
regardless what is your friend have to
say so the big story that has been
making headlines over the weekend and
lately is the whole thing with apple and
the in the Samsung Galaxy Nexus are what
it they will that you'll know what is
with so Apple is basically trying to
motion for a preliminary injunction
against the device which would mean it
wouldn't get sold in stores anymore is
that what that means uh yeah that's
generally what Apple okay preliminary
injunction does based off a few in my
opinion dicey sort of patent claims okay
including which is the worst of all I
think touchscreen entry of text and
slide to unlock okay so those are two
things that are almost like I hate to
use this phrase but like god-given
smartphone rights why are they god-given
though because once there's a it's like
patting a touchscreen it's like trying
to patent capacitive touch and if you
invented the technology but it's not an
invention that's not an invention how do
you were mean what's your definition of
eventual that's the thing my and and the
way I'm trying to fight this is saying
well it's just a misinterpretation of
that like they should have gotten a pen
on something like that yeah the slide to
unlock pattern is legitimate than you
think that most android phones have
but that's lied to a lot I mean that I
don't think Apple actually patented they
did with HD job one it's the one thing
they have the numbers start and they did
a number / sort of like permutations on
that right like you know would Steve
Jobs the caïds touchscreen how do you
keep it from I don't care it's blitz
it's crap it's BS you should not be able
to patent certain things 1 like 1 like
my issue with patents in general no need
to watch what they're complaining about
ok so the Galaxy Nexus is not an iphone
it's nowhere near it's not an iphone but
what if it includes patented technology
if that's a bit i mean i just--that's
what's going on what they're trying to
do with this sort of stuff and I'm sorry
but you you you just for to me you
cannot get around certain sort of basic
things like tech touch touch text entry
you're gonna put a patent on that yeah
like how do you okay so when you're just
for example like say entering text on
the iphone right so the obvious thing to
do is ok if the but if your finger lens
on the button right you like the t
button you enter an atty what happens if
you're slightly off but then you type in
you know something close to h and
something close to e that algorithm in
and of itself you don't think is an
innovation I'm not saying it is but I'm
not saying it's not but I think anybody
can also come up with something similar
yeah but don't they didn't do it don't
forget that there was also a time when
people didn't input text via touch right
there was your like Palm Pilots for sure
that use group the food graffiti system
Vernon Apple came along and parenting
okay just because a lot of other company
what is it that technically I mean it
wasn't invented by one no I'm you but
what's your point there and then you
know on the flipside right like
Motorola's doing the same thing to apple
right like they they have a preliminary
injunction or they won one right they
stop that too this is not that and then
Google's trying to buy them yeah no I'm
trying to like not even sure what
argument well there's like just saying
if along you're gonna take a cell phone
off the market because of a slide to
unlock I just think it's water they
remove the feature do what do you like
what i can replace it with a million
other ways it's but I just it's it's a
different concept to me like slides on
lock is dragging
thing this one is like it alright so
that we see what we see on the iphone
right I haven't seen the patent
application but if I if I had thought of
this I would imagine oh well there are
probably other patterns that you could
also implement while I patent those two
if apple owns a patent on that say like
these slides unlock in a custom shape
right they want to go against that too
and they do do that okay they can draw
like the limit but if apple and sipping
on that and they invented in someone
actually came up with innovation they
spent money did the research crap it's
crap sorry it's crap it's nonsense I
like it's like trying to copy write a
sentence I i think that the it's it's it
kind of bollocks to a lot but you
understand where I'm coming I understand
from a consumer point but you but also I
think it's sort of like the cost of
entry because right now all the numbers
everybody looking forward over the next
let's just say like five to ten years
what happens in the next one to two
years in terms of who gains the market
dominance who owns the patents behind
these kind of things is going to
establish a huge computing monopoly or
at least a hue like oh and a huge
portion of the the market in perpetuity
right because of things like locked
ecosystems and you know like the fact
that programs can't be easily i guess
like transported to one platform the
other whoever wins right now is stands
to make billions sure and I mean I
understand that that you know you want
to cut the problem off at the root I get
yet but I think you gotta pick your
battles and back that in the fact that
there's some they're winning in one way
in some ways the losing others and
that's just how the industry place I
understand what I happen but I know
those right window right I think there's
a lot of Miss education about I think
the people who are deciding these
patents I'm sorry but there's no doubt
what patent system is broke so then so
then as I honestly we should throw stuff
coupling at the window but I think it
should really be examined and I think
they should bring in experts to really
arm you know sort of indifferently
examine the the the situation I don't
think some you know Supreme Court Judge
really has a concept of what's going on
a Christmas these days
that like okay so you know the typical
process is your granted a patent you
know obviously like the the patent
office received thousands of sure
millions if not and it's not just Apple
it's not just that I just don't like the
fact that I'm trying to take off my
phone your phone your phone ticket it's
crazy to me that anyone could confuse
that with an iphone I mean I know that's
right that's a different issue very
basic way to look at it but at the end
of the day when it boils down to these
trivial sort of you know things I mean
let's really pick our battles and I'm
sick of Apple just throw money at crap
and being like oh maybe we'll get away
with that well another thing that
happened yes I guess that there's a good
reason why they can throw money at crap
they actually hit five hundred dollars a
share and there the and they're going
well so expensive yeah uh then that most
though they're the world's large
corporation right we know that so really
over what I'm mobile that's the thing
that's crazy like yeah yeah by apple
gadgets but I know for a fact I spend
more in gas every year yeah so that's
just kind of crazy too it is crazy what
say what say you I mean what surprised
about that I just understand why you
have nothing to add you have an iPhone
yeah but I know nothing about patents to
speak intelligently about it this
conversation you know much about the
crazy so we might attempt to speak on it
would all sing are not lawyers but we
can talk about it right I think that it
the bad thing about this is that
hopefully it doesn't get to a point
where it clamps down on innovation and
competition right if that's the only way
that they is though by a by doing an
injunction against the Nexus you are are
defeating competition and to me that's
not cool because it can come down
everyone wins at some point you know I
guess they all have to come into a room
and say like hey we're not going to do
this kind of sheisty stuff yeah cuz it
how do you back down when the other
company that you're suing is doing the
exact same thing to you understandable
yeah but let's be honest next thing you
know they're gonna work copywriting a
white phone lurgan right we're gonna do
is asian we move on order all right what
do you want to talk about next that's
what I wanted
surely we also talked about this story
this is cool so yesterday Scott Stein
and a few members of the cnet TV team
went to the Toy Fair I was in New York
yeah yeah that's you were you not in
there you didn't get to go to know where
I was busy doing hmm I wanted to go
because this year they announce
something pretty cool last year do you
member they came out with the marty
mcfly sneakers now you like collaborated
with Michael J Fox on those this year
mattel is releasing the hoverboard from
Back to the Future this is like the
original pink cover bored with all the
decals on top and those three things on
the bottom yeah uh clearly a hoverboard
technology has now come down to the
consumer level yet to it no I'm actually
a hoverboard so what the hell am i
buying this fool is a piece of plastic
barbie you talk about it and right
what's that is it the same design as the
barbie one for the movie it's basically
the same one without that stick on top
it's a razor scooter essentially without
the wheels um I want to kill somebody
well I yeah was like a limited edition
thing it's not gonna be that much money
it's for collectors um yeah they've
released things like the jacket in the
mr. fusion said which is cool that's
Lecter's and I can identify with that
I'll be the first to minute got a bunch
of crap toys you know from video games I
got a big daddy I was like on the level
of the star wars lightsaber sure okay I
thought this was like hey kids get your
new hoverboards right there well they
haven't actually talked about the price
yet um right now the all their bragging
about is it's one to one replica appeal
what wouldn't it be good now if they're
gonna make this like a collector sort of
toy right wouldn't it be cool to just
use a couple magnets and create the
illusion of hovering what do you mean
you know I'll be like if they were just
to do two polar opposite magnets in like
a little box they can make this thing
look like it's hover and then you could
put magnets on the floor wherever ya
when I put it or just keep it in a
closed environment where you just have
like Oh check it out here's where keep
my hoverboard right box right right it
only works in the box but it's hovering
you know like that's not mind blowing I
mean those things clearly going to be
overpriced anyway right throw a couple
magnets in there he was the Barbie
version too right I thought they
would bring out the bar that's the I'd
like nostalgia of the film Yeah right
otherwise you have a essentially a
skateboard right without the wheels on
it right it's silly yeah it's a little
silly well how much would you pay for
something I'd pay 30 bucks for it I
would rather her nags fresh max I saw
someone wearing those shoes in McCarran
Airport coming oh yes really I did I
don't never seen anyone with a nerd no
it was just some dude who clearly
honorary them yeah it is good they look
ridiculous it looked like there before
don't even line up they don't know they
do do they well he didn't have it lit up
but you could press a button on the side
and the decal but there's not pair of
aces cuz i blogged about it on the
members and they're not Power laces you
can't they don't just like conform to
your shoe get away 4 2015 4 that I guess
you think hoverboard technology will be
out in I have a suspicion engine is
super dangerous yeah and I'm all for it
the pit bull yeah I got a pit bull now
we'll take a break more 404 after this I
wonder if they'll work on water this is
the 404 mr f'ers the show where we all
sing songs
you
this is southbury from Jay and you're
listening to the 404 where you too is
the tyler perry of bands damn straight I
think so I don't know that analogy works
you two for me but ya know it's a
terrible day I lied yeah it totally
works i scrapped the people who can't
stop buying it I mean it's like you need
further explanation or well I having
never seen like that mini Tyler Perry
movies begin with I don't know if there
actually any good well you know what
yesterday we were talking about songs
that make its crying we got a lot of
voicemails about that topic today's
Valentine's Day I want to ask you guys
have you ever made a Valentine's Day
playlist no like a mixtape oh I I know
how to give idea to positive i did know
like middle school but it's been so long
i couldn't tell you what was on besides
like boys the minnow for what do you
should you're shaking your head ever say
i never done any danger nowhere near
anything like that nothing romantic in
his life yeah that's not true man Elliot
one minute man that's all I don't sex
week I don't uh I I don't find these
things exciting what wait like
romanticism can we you know know what do
you mean it should be for me though what
are you talking about talking about like
romance yeah yeah stuff like that well
I'm sure Stacy does things for you all
day make you lunch every day that's
incredibly know first off that's that's
a don't either here nor there I think
that's really you think that's key like
but no I you know I don't I'm a romantic
scrap is just not how God it feels like
fake to me do you know anyway your black
heart finally oh no still waiting for
that nut district not dude I I admitted
the other day that there I have a motion
yeah and that there are things that make
me cry cry tell madam machine that I
don't cry but like I could i get to the
point where like oh I should probably
enter the realm of maybe crying there
but it's like half a tear drops down
yeah
you know I you know I have cried before
it has a fair enough it's right when you
found out that Adele's not be making
music for another five years really yeah
she announced yesterday that she's
taking a break for five years five years
because that polyp in her throat her
gets her doctors were mentioning that it
could happen again at any moment so
during a show if she's singing too hard
her throat could explode they were
saying I don't understand that on 60
minutes when they interviewed her they
realize she was like yeah I'm fine for
now but it could happen again anymore
she's stopping for five-year deal it's
like I feel like she really hasn't even
been she hasn't blown up for five months
like to take five years off five years
seems like a while yeah I'm not Adele
five-year break singer plans to focus on
relationship right a happy record this
is ? I don't like the question yeah yeah
yeah I she's gonna be sitting in
freighter yeah I mean okay i can i can
understand medical reasons but even then
five years interview the doctor news
like she's fine I don't get it maybe she
can't sing 365 days a year yeah can she
needs take a break but five years no
one's gonna remember ya know five years
is like an eternity although you know I
guess what's the nice thing is that I
guess she has the option now she could
never have to work for the rest of her
life cuz considering the popularity of a
record right I mean she's so like 15
million kinds I'm like that's
mind-blowing to me take that Katy Perry
you guys even don't deserve to be in the
same room together the sad thing is i'm
pretty sure Katy Perry's probably sold
that many if not more not off a talent
play that well enough it's a different
kind of taylor never got a talent that
we all seek alright what else is going
on today guys mmm nothin no um alright
let's talk about Pinterest um since we
were speaking about females earlier
wilson you put the store in the rundown
that apparently an overwhelming amount
of users on pinterest are females
females ninety-seven percent i don't
know any other website has that gone
okay so there have been a lot of let's
just say like other social networks sort
of exploding over the last couple months
or weeks path was in the news recently
for like a sort of address book hiccup
um but you know i use path all time I
really I like it a lot I feel like
it's what facebook timeline should have
been pinterest you know kind of takes
the sharing and so social discovery
element of Facebook it makes it even
better right but I haven't gotten into
it mostly because when I go to the site
and I you know I've signed up for it
it's almost all chick stuff right now
the study kind of goes improves the
reason flex mining the seven percent is
just so overwhelming I think it's
because well a big majority of it is
product based right and even on the
about page for Pinterest it says people
use their pin boards to plan their
weddings decorate their homes and
organize her favorite recipes Oh saying
that those are female specific oh you
can say that it's a little bits way to
that in that area yeah of course there's
like a Pinterest for guys where it's
like video games against other websites
that you don't necessarily share with
your significant other that kind of
thing of I mound the mailing of interest
what's up oh man you guys are gonna like
this it's called snatch Lee and uh match
dot Lee snowed yeah yeah exactly snatch
Dahlia yeah it is and basically it's the
adult version of Pinterest so if you're
not familiar with the format I can't
spin my head on pinterest this is Kim
Kardashian that's okay um but you can
basically browse through items on
pinterest and them to your board below
to remember them for later yes naturally
it's kind of the same thing except that
you have a board where you can see
you're gonna pick my way you can choose
all your favorite scenes from various
streaming websites okay yeah basically
create like a playlist jock jams Josh
now that's what Justine calls porn so um
if I have to explain your well yeah
that's how it works fine and yeah so in
their instructions they say int in your
snatch lee porn bored you can snatch
whatever videos you want in your not a
special mostly horn boards there you go
i'm down with a dude that's the male
equivalent get it ready haha i bet you
it's not 97% female man male no probably
not everyone loves that 5050 yeah
no but seriously though have you guys
you shopping websites like Pinterest no
I've ever even been to pinterest I know
I literally nothing that there's been a
lot of buzz about it but I checked it
out cuz we should be in the know here at
seen I didn't write it was interesting
to me because it's almost all I guess
chick related things that's true I'm
really into this website supply they
spell it with a V instead of the youths
osv ppl why and they have a good amount
of male and female products here they're
like cool loading shoes and housewares
and whatnot same idea you can click on
images like a image baseboard and then
pin them to your favorites below nice
pretty cool that is cool yeah good way
to shop yeah I want to talk about videos
on the internet and how lucrative they
can be Justin does a great job of
finding videos on our show but then
there are the classics the ones that
have been viewed like 420 million times
yeah okay we're talking about that
charlie bit my finger video which i
don't think is funny at all I mean line
people with that that was abuts the two
kids and one kid is brothers and one kid
sticks to finger any other kids mouth
and they're British and he goes charlie
bit my finger it's just like all right
that's borderline comical I don't know
but half a billion times later almost
yeah it's insanely lucrative right
because of the revenue share yeah this
is crazy so that video came back into
that came out in two thousand seven five
years later this 50 seconds 56 second
clip it's been viewed 417 million times
well which makes it the most successful
non-commercial video on YouTube that's
ever ever yeah they've made more than a
hundred fifty thousand dollars in the
past five years just through YouTube's
rev share I'm not even sure what kind of
business model they use do you know how
much money you get per click I it
depends on the I guess there's a lot of
factors in it but it could be a high
pretty high CPM relatively speaking i
actually that sounds like a almost live
loan number one hundred fifty thousand
four hundred million i guess view yeah
it does seem you know I mean considering
what we do nobody wants the right I was
like
it's I think it's also because they
share the revenue with a company that
represents them online called viral
spiral and this is kind of like a new
wave of uh marketing viral marketing and
yeah the antithesis of what a viral
video is exactly it should be natural
and organic but it's not it's handled by
viral spiral that's a company that also
handles the baby panda sneezing video
remember that and then the babbling twin
babies quieter in the kitchen yeah yeah
they handle both of those videos as well
does A&amp;amp;R for them yeah it sounds
ridiculous but what kind of
representation do you need if you just
click yes I'd like you to die like to
share revenue with you to buy online
form although like if you if you
negotiate in person if you have a
contact with YouTube you'd stand to make
more money yeah so that's probably the
reason why they did it but like I I'm
just trying to imagine like the guy who
came up with this business Hey Ya let's
reach out to everybody who did the bunny
badger video all this let's exploit
these innocent me okay it makes sense
because once you put a video online it's
really easy for that to spread and
people make memes out of it sometimes
hurtful so I think this company protects
against exploitation if they want to
branch out into merchandise they can do
that they'll handle that apparently this
charlie bit my finger kid has a TV show
in the works they're working on a pilot
you can buy TV show t-shirts and mugs
yeah they're working on like a CD full
of songs made by these two kids am I the
only I see I didn't know they can sing
yes your babies it blows my mind how
does that happen yeah I mean this is all
probably the ideas came that came out of
a viral spire right so mostly a bad
thing yeah they're all horrible horrible
apparently they also remove hateful
YouTube comments from their page which
probably happy that's all pain that's
gonna be a full-time job you exactly
like why are you making so much money
off of it we have a separate intern that
removes all those from our blog only 24
hour a day job the never-ending job yeah
we'll take one last break calls from the
public when we get back more for for
right after this

stone cold bastard wouldn't cry at that
uh the one of the final scenes in the
movie click you know Adam Sandler in the
future dying on that a moment like an
idiot but the one thing that my wife has
actually been making fun of me is
there's a documentary called the other F
word uh actually really cool you know
documentary about all these punks
musicians I loved when I was in high
school in college and now they're all my
age with kids themselves and how it's
changed them in blah blah blah well
there's just working in the trailer of
this movie we're free said something
about his kids and I start crying
literally tears streaming down my face
crying look it up you'll probably find
it it's hilarious but at the same time
quite sad become a father you'll cried
everything it's funny because I sigh

word trillion fleeces something very
touching about his kids yeah and nothing
like seeing a guy say like knuckle

not at all not at all Mexico shut up
worker this is rich from Cleveland just
calling you guys are talking about sad
songs want to hear what people thought
was on the set of songs I don't know
about particular song in general but the
saddest admirable time has to be BEC
sea-change album fed from being like an
amazing sounding album and also sets of
the most heart-wrenching sometime in
terms of sad movies that make me cry I
have to go with life aquatic that last
scene in the helicopter uh it just
always gets me every time yeah that's
even they like focus in on their eyes
noses death in that scene yeah yeah it's
pretty sad lost cause is a really sad
album it's all about when you know that
you need to break up when words to say
it lost cause one of the saddest eyes I
think you played or you pull it up on
karaoke one time and one of the parties
are we're at it just like killed
everything I was just like one of these
banks just come on really we're all I
haven't fun
everybody's good ears yeah all right
ruin my birthday the blue myristic
voicemails continue guys in san diego
for Joe do that on my morning commute
and I actually kind of rainy and I'll
let's talk about sad music is really
really brush down before a little work
though not if the things good my song
he's been talkative right back okay that
won't get fella back mr. brightside
killers that's really that's like a okay
that song I don't even think it's about
a sad sad ants the killers I mean
there's nothing said about the killers
maybe he's he started crying what it
started playing that was just and uh
yeah yeah decent song did I it's okay i
just really makes you cry regardless
you're driving sir don't get too bummed
out while driving and crying and driving
the same do you got a weapon in your
hand next call hey guys evan in north
carolina i just listed to the show
you're talking about things that make
you cry and this being a tech blog show
I could not believe you did not mention
the iron giant hmm nothing made me cry
like a baby when I saw that movie and
don't you tell me that you did not watch
it and she had a little tier for a
little Hogarth the animated boy you win
that Iron Giant flew away to save the
day hope I didn't ruin anything but my
goodness gracious diving talking about
things that make you cry Iron Giant yes
you uh you cry at that oh yeah Carly and
all those old animated movies make me
cry like Land Before Time um little uh
little foot was ya little foot
spreadshirt he's an incredible director
yeah sort of like manages to pull those
like those moments out I mean it's a
cartoon so you're I'm always surprised
or generally like impressed when
somebody can make me a moat like that
well I think it's the same that same
sort of psychology works with like pets
right because they're not people mmm
those r GG drawings these are things but
they have faces and they're cute and
they look almost human yeah and as a kid
you identify with that
right I remember crying in the original
Alvin in the Chipmunks movie oh you're a
big loser well all of those movies have
to do with separation from your parents
said like I'm sure there's a concept
that no kids wants to think about of
course dealing with that alone brings
tears to my eyes Mexico what's up guys
this is st. louis from josh i wanted to
china everybody sharing their feelings
yesterday and talking about crying
during movies def briefs would obviously
mentioned that he was tearing them
during sports movies with situations
that he could relate to now admit I also
cried during Wally but nothing gets me
going more than that last scene in the
movie Rudy knowing everyone tuned for
and give them a few mental gets me every
time yeah that's understandable because
you could see like Sean Austin does such
a good job standoff it is such a good
job at you know conveying like okay this
is my only time I'm ever gonna be on
this field and he like really just and
he gets that sack or tackle wherever it
is but it's all like the it's jon
favreau to the whole he spends a whole
film essentially building up the right
to that 122nd moment where the team's
time to shine and all of notre dame goes
red that's a great scene I out of
curiosity is has a video game ever made
you cry it's a great question with
entertainment going that way like you
know like we we've we've got the action
dramas in in video games yeah like snake
and uh uh don't you know Metal Gear
Solid games like one more lap I think
one game got me teary-eyed but I don't
remember which it was it might have been
heavy rain okay I was just when you say
Mario no there's nothing to cry I cried
from frustration about not be mailed
that's a different sort baby what am I
in four year old girl if you're crying
at video games in general there is a
certain amount of cinematic prowess that
games have been able to achieve over the
last decade yeah heavy rain is an
emotional game I'm not sure if I don't
know if it was that or something else
but there-there's it'll get there yeah
it'll get there have you ever cried at
the end of a video game cuz you're so
happy to I finished it like a fuzzy mmm
no or maybe like you get that
you get that like stomach emotional sort
of like rice is great I never chose
what's my counter for you know working I
think pre uh you know memory card days
they were probably a couple of moments
when I was probably like 10 or 11 oh
we're like a console accidentally get
turned off something that we're probably
yeah I probably cried yeah yeah
something NES just like suddenly turning
off yeah the power flickered something
else reminded me unrelated to of what
songs or movies or games I remember when
I don't forget what WrestleMania was I
was a little kid you look at you thought
someone Andre the Giant and Hulk Hogan
and there was a scene I'm sure they
fought a million times but there was a
part where like Andre was really beating
up on Hogan and it looked like all was
lost and I was just like oh I mean do
I'm like five adorable something about
holding going down yeah I can hear oh
just like and this big ugly you know
creature hurting up just like this
threatening Hulk Hogan saying it got
some right yeah I want to get to as many
as we can only have a few minutes left
let's just one day fall for this is
Atlanta from fallon just watch monday
show about songs that make you cry and I
have to say I agree with dress that
collective soul song gets me since the
first time I heard it new blood the show
I think it's a combination of the video
to the video super said as well yeah uh
here's a throwback it what's up guys
this is Chicago from a shot I will
likely show about you guys crying and
everything and I was just thinking about
this movie my girl Bernice and he died
but uh dese Tings ya know crazy my wife
just saw it the addicting she was saying
how sad it was I just remember this one
bit I just think myself where's oh
you can see you that it's so sad you
guys are beasting can't have kids dying
in movies that's a rule
one next call hey guys throw some
joosten on in regards to your what makes
you cry question I have to admit that
more than really any movie or a
particular song I cry and cry when a
character on a movie or shell sings and
dances I don't know why it's just
emotionally overwhelming me somebody
sings it's lovely and Buddy dances all
so lovely and happy you put it together
it's like I just can't be into it I
can't watch glee at all like I you know
I cry agree for different reasons but
it's still an actual television show but
interesting though I it weird it's it's
strange i think i think it's contextual
yeah um finally let's finish up with
adele there for champagne i'm calling in
regards to the music that makes you cry
talk about a dell her new song set fire
to the rain literally has brought a tear
to my eye there's no meaning behind it i
don't relate to it at all what it is
just her voice alone is enough to twerk
the emotions inside me so it's a bit of
thomas maybe cheer up a little bit it's
amazing i don't know what it is about
her but she's got this like instant cry
mechanic going on in her vocal cords
that appoggiatura man it is a pocket or
that's the jeweler you guys ever cry
while eating that's gotta be the
weirdest happen no crying well why
what--what's or a situation i think of
many people have eaten because they were
crying yeah but yeah exactly like crying
and eating at the same time like into a
year into a gallon of bed journaling and
ingesting at the same time that's
actually that never happens before no
there's a there's a website crying while
eating dog like videos of people just
doing that during break up super set
