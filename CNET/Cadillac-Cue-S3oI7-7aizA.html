sick of Ford and Lincoln getting all the
headlines for sync and MyFord Touch so
now they've got an answer cue the
Cadillac user experience that refers to
a couple of screens in this car the most
interesting one is here in the center
stack and I'm happy to report and no
longer pulls that toaster a thing like
Cadillac used to do because there was no
point in it going up and down now it's
baked right here and this is very cool
stuff you've got a lot of things
happening that are borrowed from smart
phone and PC technology along the bottom
here for example you can pin those to
use Windows 7 language to have any kind
of a shortcut to almost any function in
the head unit it could be a radio
station on one button a shortcut to a
nav function on the next at HVAC control
on the next up here on the top this is
very much like your smartphone you can
drag and drop your home screen icons
there and decide I don't want to have
navigation there I want to edit that or
I want to change Pandora out and make it
some other thing a shortcut to my
contacts notice you've got a Pandora app
here but you won't be able to put just
any old app echoed up on this screen
Cadillacs gonna curate these and approve
them into the system notice that as I'm
moving my hand back and forth I'm
getting proximity sensing take your hand
away you get a simplified screen put
your hand back up there and things you
need in the moment as it realizes you're
about to go for a command become visible
that's a nice way to keep things clean
until you need it and that allows them
to D content along the buttons down here
below the LCD you've got relatively few
by today's standards of what our
physical buttons but even these are
capacitive touch as is this screen over
here in front of the driver is an all
LCD instrument panel as well this is
something we only saw before on unbeliev
jag and Land Rover about 12 inches kind
of a rectangular shape and it's got four
modes as well from very simple to high
content to give you all manner of
information about the vehicle and the
media settings and it also leverages or
helps the center stack so not everything
has to be wedged into here you can have
this thing help out with media help out
with navigation distribute the
information interface across two screens
we've also got haptic feedback in this
guy let's say I want to go to the odd
settings and I'm gonna go to my audio
menu and I start to run my finger across
these choices I can keep my eyes
somewhat on the road because I'm getting
a little bump bump bump bump thing
haptic feedback really game controller
technology in there and a little more on
the electromechanical side check this up
if I go down here and put my finger
underneath this lid it pops open because
we're looking at a necklace system here
no optical drive
that's so 2010 instead you pick up a
little sneaky bin right here there's the
USB drive back there as well for loading
up your iPod or your thumb drive and
again all of this is capacitive touch
now this is not prototype stuff this is
near production basically I'm in a demo
unit here but this is coming out on the
new Cadillac XTS which is their new 5
Series II class competitor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
