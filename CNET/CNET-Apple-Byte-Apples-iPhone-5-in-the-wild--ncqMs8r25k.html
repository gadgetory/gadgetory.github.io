welcome to the apt bite it's all the
good stuff all the bad stuff and
everything inside the world of Apple
plus our captain america case giveaway
winners it's all here now I don't know
about you guys but I'm getting a little
sick of all these made-up rumors and
release dates for the iphone 5 so we'll
give you something a little more
substantial to chew on this week the boy
genius report released photos of a
possible iphone 5 clone from China and
we know this isn't the actual next-gen
iphone but it does resemble an iphone 4
with smooth out edges the new iphone is
currently being built and parts leaked
out from the factories our common thing
like this iphone 5 proximity light
sensor flex cable so this should be
based on elements of the actual design
now we wouldn't show you these pictures
if we didn't have a connecting story and
a picture of the potential iphone 5 that
was taken by a 9to5 mac reader over the
weekend on caltrain which is one of
Northern California's transit systems
was released now the reader was tech
savvy enough to identify it as a
different I device that he's never seen
before it doesn't look like the 3gs it
doesn't look like the four but it does
look a lot like the earlier pictures we
showed you now this picture here sure
looks a lot like Bigfoot and check this
one out that's the Loch Ness monster
throw them in with the iphone Caltrans
photo all real now new rumors have
speculated the iPhone 5 is coming
anywhere from September now even to
October for other countries sohu com
says the launch will also include a
simplified iphone 4 which we've heard
before but my gut says September for the
US I'm sticking with it now on iTunes
news appadvice reports the big a will be
announcing a full-fledged re downloading
and streaming service called iTunes
replay in the next few weeks it's an
extension of what Apple is already doing
with music and the iCloud service but it
will now include TV shows and movies now
a recent software update to the 2nd gen
apple TV allows users to stream their
previously purchased TV shows directly
from the box so now you can both rent
and purchase shows from itunes and if
you haven't checked your iOS devices
lately you now have access to download
previous
just TV shows in the iTunes App to
multiple devices as well now the report
says content that's eligible will have a
little arrow on it and some content will
only be available to download five times
it's a nice addition that prevents me
from having to bring my computer and
sync to it when I'm on the road to
rewatch some older show so I like it now
Apple's iCloud beta was also recently
released for developers it will replace
mobile me as their new syncing and
storage service for both iOS 5 and Mac
OS 10 Lions the iCloud comes with five
gigs of storage for free and they also
released a breakdown for how much it
costs for additional storage but one
piece of the puzzle that they aren't
talking about in the public that much is
that the idisk that's used for your
personal storage will go away completely
so purchasing more storage space for
iCloud is to store contacts calendars
and I work files but all those personal
files with folders you've created on
your idisk will go away so you want to
start backing them up to service like
Dropbox or you send it instead and this
is just a heads up for the Apple biters
because this is stuff that you guys
should know all right let's check out
some quick bytes skype for the ipad is
free it's officially here and optimized
from the ipad after a premature release
it works over both 3g and Wi-Fi allows
for two-way video calling and you can
use skype credits to call landlines and
mobile phones directly now more content
coming to the iPad times and corporate
magazines will be bringing all 21 of its
magazines by the end of the year
including titles that are currently
unavailable like Entertainment Weekly
and personal favorites of mine like
essence and in style now for those of
you looking to accomplish one of life's
most elusive goals you might have done
it already the iphone is king of the
skies and go go wireless says that
iphones make up nearly two-thirds of the
devices on its in-flight Wi-Fi service
that's 10,000 feet in the sky now ipod
touches make up twenty percent and
android devices are at twelve percent so
be happy that's right tell all your
friends you're all part of the mile high
club with an iphone alright let's get to
our winners from the captain america
shield case giveaway for the iphone 4
