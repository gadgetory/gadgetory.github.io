headphones in the world now with iPhone
7 and 7 plus we're moving to connecting
them over lightning well why over
lightning well first you may not
remember I certainly do
but from the start we designed lightning
to be a great digital audio connector
among all the other things that does it
provides a digital audio stream provides
power to your headphones or speakers it
provides content music control right
within its digital connection so we're
taking the headphones an iPhone 7 and 7
plus 2 lightning and we're including
them in a box with each device now we
know there are people in the world who
do have some analog old connected
devices out there so we've also made
this it's an adapter Lightning 2 mini
foe no audio adapter I'm going to
include that in the box with every
iPhone 7 and 7 plus as well so our team
at Apple has worked so hard to create
something new that delivers on the
opportunity of how good a wireless
experience can be and they've worked
hard to deal with the challenges that
have been left there and no one has
taken on so that is why today we are so
excited to show you a new product from
Apple called Apple earpods
how do you set them up you simply put a
pair of ear pods near your iPhone and
open the case the user interface pops up
and says connect and you tap connect
and that's it there's no step - there's
nothing else to do you simply connect
and at one step also connects you with
your Apple watch so you're automatically
set up for both your iPhone and your
Apple watch you can start listening and
as you have playback on either device
the air pods automatically switch to
whatever device you're using in fact we
also use iCloud to propagate that set up
across your iPads and your Mac's as well
so one step set up across all your
devices it's that easy there are
incredible audio experience and listen
to beautiful music and stereo or
you want to use one just to talk to Siri
or make a phone call it automatically
routes the audio across whatever you
choose to do there's no buttons there's
no switching there's no pairing there's
no unparent those things are of the past
and it all started with a brand new chip
w1 chip Apple's first wireless chip and
there's so much technology packed into
each air pod there's the chip there's
dual accelerometers optical sensors
beamforming microphones antennas
batteries it is a technical tour de
force in this Manute little air pod they
deliver great battery life five hours
each and there's a battery and charger
built into its case so you can recharge
directly from the battery in the case
for up to 24 hours of listening and then
plug in lightning what you want to
charge the case in the air pods together
at once and they're so small you want to
carry them around with you everywhere
here they are alongside our wired ear
pods they really are small and
comfortable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
