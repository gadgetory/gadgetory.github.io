checking out the motorola moto e now
this budget smartphone isn't too
exciting in a world filled with phablet
and speedy flagship phones from Samsung
and LG but it doesn't really need to be
at 150 bucks went out to email and about
120 for a 3g model it's cheap but
delivers in all the right ways so you
can get a pretty great phone for folks
in a tight budget the Moto e is an
unassuming little device it's a little
on the chunky side but comfortable to
hold its display as a 960 x 540 pixel
resolution that's well disappointing
especially with all the 1080p and higher
phone to see every day but it gets the
job done on the 4.5 inch screen text is
sharp and easy to read photos look good
too colors are accurate and don't look
faded or washed out as you might expect
from a budget phone the rest of the body
is plain but functional just a round
white shell but the plastic band around
the border pops off really easily and
you can pick up extra color pacster
motorola for twenty bucks the SIM card
and micro SD slots live under that
plastic strip but the batteries are
removable things get a little more
interesting inside there's a quad-core
1.2 gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor and one gig of ram not stellar
but the phone is nice and zipping will
get you through web browsing video
streaming and gaming with the minimum of
fuss it's also running Android lollipop
and best of all motorola hasn't bugged
the phone down with lots of extra apps
or a custom skin just pure Android well
nearly pure Android I say nearly because
there are a few Motorola gestures built
right in here's my favorite twist your
wrist twice and no matter what you're
doing the phone will open up the 5
megapixel camera and be ready to start
shooting it's a pretty deliberate action
so you won't have to worry too much
about triggering it accidentally twist
your wrist twice again while the camera
is open and it will switch to the front
facing camera I'm sure some folks you'll
appreciate that the cameras aren't
exactly stellar and my shots on the rear
camera tend to look a little washed out
but details were otherwise clear and
that's the Moto e it isn't flashy there
are no screens on the side and it
doesn't bend or flex but it's cheap and
visit a pain to use and that's important
too many inexpensive phone sacrifice
just about everything to hit that low
price point and Motorola has shown us
then you can get decent hardware without
spending all that much you're going to
want to read the full review for all
thought on cnet com I'm it Ralph thanks
