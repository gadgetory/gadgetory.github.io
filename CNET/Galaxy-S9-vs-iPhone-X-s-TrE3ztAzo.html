have arrived and they're taking on the
iPhone 10 here's how Samsung's two new
flagships stack up to apples shining
star both phones are class on glass with
a metal frame but you have more color
options to choose from with the s9 and
they still have a headphone jack the
regular s9 and the iPhone 10 have the
same 5.8 inch screen while the s9 plus
has a larger 6.2 inch screen with the
curved screens on the s9 s make the
bezels look slimmer on the sides while
the iPhone tens are slimmer top to
bottom but you get that notch in the way
the s nines also have greater resolution
and pixel density then the super retina
HD display on the iPhone 10 both phones
lack a home button on the front but the
s9 still has a fingerprint scanner to
unlock this time below the camera the
iPhone 10 uses face ID to unlock while
the s9 has what Samsung calls
intelligent scan a combination of the
facial recognition feature on the front
camera and the iris scanner but since
it's not a depth sensing camera it may
not be as secure the s 9 has a single
main shooter while the s 9 plus has a
dual then setup similar to that of the
iPhone 10 with a 12 megapixel wide-angle
and 12 megapixel telephoto lens for
better zoom and DSLR style portraits
what's unique about the s 9 is that the
main lens has a variable aperture which
changes from F 1 point 5 2 F to point 4
depending on the lighting it also lets
you select it manually from the pro mode
and it offers super slow motion and 960
frames per second the aperture on the
iPhone 10 is fixed for both lenses and
the maximum slow-mo rate is 240 frames
per second the s 9 has an 8 megapixel
front camera compared to the 7 megapixel
depth sensing camera on the iPhone 10
which lets you take portrait mode
selfies both have AR capabilities the s
9 has even created its own version of
the iPhone tenzin emojis which let you
control the facial features of emojis
your face bs9 however also lets you
create your own avatar to control but
the tracking is still not as great
compared to that of the iPhone 10 but
the camera on the s9 also offers an
extra artificial intelligence feature
with mixed division you can translate
text in real-time and get information
about a landmark just by pointing the
camera the motors on both these phones
are beasts but it's hard to compare the
s9 are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon
845 running Android or EO versus the a11
Bionic chip on the iPhone 10 with iOS 11
both phones have wireless charging but
the s 9s have bigger batteries and they
offer three tiers of on-board storage
depending on the market with up to 400
gigs of expandable storage while the
iPhone 10 only has the 64 gigabyte and
256 gigabyte option but these are just
the specs so we'll have to see how these
to battle it out in the real world in
the coming month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
