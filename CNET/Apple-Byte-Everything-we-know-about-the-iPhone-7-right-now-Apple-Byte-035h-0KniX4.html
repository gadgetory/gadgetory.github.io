to the Apple by we know about apple's
upcoming event this monday marks the
21st and we're expecting the 9.7 inch
ipad pro the iphone SE and new Apple
watch bands there's always room for
surprises even if I don't expect any but
you can watch our live coverage on cnet
our pre-show starts at nine a.m. pacific
time and the keynote will start at ten
am but a lot of you have asked for this
so guess what this week we're going to
get you up to speed on everything we
know about the iphone 7 right now all
right the new iphone 7 is expected to be
announced around its normal fall time
frame usually in September we expect a
next-generation a 10 processor in the
new iPhone and the base model might ship
with two gigs of RAM while the 7 + could
include three gigs of RAM design-wise
this is where we'll see some changes
macrumors first reported that they will
stay relatively the same as the 6 and 6s
but with a slightly slimmer design by
about a millimeter the two biggest
physical changes are rumored to be the
removal of the horizontal and tena lines
that you see on the back that would
allow for a cleaner look to the back
side of the phone the other one the rear
camera will now be flush with the back
surface thanks to a thinner 12 megapixel
camera module so no more wobble or
camera nipple we've also heard a lot of
chatter about a dual lens camera system
and digit times reported that Apple may
be planning to release two different
versions of the iphone 7 plus one with a
single lens camera like the current
iphones and another pro version with a
dual lens camera system Apple is already
reportedly testing out different duelin
systems right now now a patent
application submitted by Apple in
January gives us insight into the
proposed dual camera system consisting
of one standard wide-angle lens like the
one found in current iphones and a
second telephoto lens capable of
capturing zoomed in photos and video the
idea is really that both lenses could be
used at the same time while capturing
video a still picture or even slow
motion video the user would be able to
select one lens or the other to use and
pick the image of their choice now a
dual lens camera system could also offer
an improvement in image quality and it's
even possible it could be used for depth
map
or for taking 3d scans of real world
items again we don't know how much of
this if any will see in the iphone 7 but
breaking up the core iphone line into a
77 plus and the 7 pro would be a
surprise I'll write the biggest point of
contention with the new iphone without a
doubt is the removal of the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack that has been
a staple on pretty much every device
that plays audio since the 1960s the
body of the iphone 7 is expected to be a
millimeter thinner and that jives with
this on leaks images show a purported
case for the iphone 7 with a single
Lightning port connection at the bottom
with two spaces for stereo speakers on
the iphone for the first time but no
headphone jack whatsoever all signs
point to it going away with the iphone 7
but if you can't plug in your headphones
and charge your phone at the same time
it could open the door to wireless
charging so we will see now what could
be one of apple's earbud solutions then
it's a no-brainer they'll have some sort
of lightning the standard audio adapter
but 9to5 mac reports the big a is also
working on new earbuds that are
completely wireless they would be
similar to the motorola hint or the
Bragi wireless earbuds and include a
carrying case that also charges the
headphones Apple has even registered the
trademark earpods already which is
probably what they'll end up calling
them now Apple has recently granted a
patent for a hybrid headphone design
that has the ability to use a corded
solution but the headphones can also
magnetically detach and be used as a
wireless option these diagrams in the
patent show the earbuds connected by a
court or a version where the earbuds
themselves just pop off the system would
be able to detect when they are
connected and then switch over to a
wireless audio connection when they're
detached so there you go everything we
know about the iphone 7 right now based
on reports and rumors with changes to
the design a potential dual lens camera
no headphone jack and a wireless earbud
plus you can use this video to sound
like a smart person to your friends and
strangers because it works for me now if
you have a feature you really hope the
iphone 7 brings in it could be anything
like you could tell me you wish it could
feed your pet turtle tweet me a brian
Tong or email us at the apple bite at
cnet com and we will feature some of
your crazy wacky ideas from the apple
byte nation thanks so much for watching
catch you all next time for another bite
of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
