Frankfurt Auto Show where BMW has
unveiled the latest generation of its x1
small SUV now if you remember the
previous generation looked a lot like a
station wagon but here they've raised
the roof by over 2 inches so now it
looks like a real SUV that higher
roofline in the x1 means more space in
the passenger cabin and a higher writing
position for both the front and rear
seat passengers there are also a lot of
new high-tech features you can get
including LED headlights and driver
assistance features such as adaptive
cruise control lane departure warning
and a traffic jam assist feature there's
also the latest version of BMWs iDrive
system so that includes a data
connection for some built-in apps in the
dashboard plus plenty of apps you can
get through your smartphone there's an
available all-wheel drive system plus a
new suspension the BMW says gives better
handling to this car than the previous
generation but there's another small
German SUV here at Frankfurt that Kris
pockets gonna tell you about
we're here at the Volkswagen stand with
the new Tiguan we've been waiting for
this car for a really long time the old
one was great to drive but it was a
little long in the tooth it didn't have
the infotainment it didn't have the
active safety features this one does
this new model rides on an all-new
architecture it's Volkswagens MQB
platform that's going to be used in
pretty much everything that it builds
from now on and it features a longer
wheelbase it's wider and it's longer
inside so that it has more cargo space
and more space for people inside it's
got a brand new infotainment system a
much needed upgrade that features
Android auto and apple carplay better
quality screen it's got a whole host of
safety features just like the BMW x1
it's got things like Lane keep assist
and it's got smart city braking it's got
adaptive cruise control so this has all
of the features of that BMW yet it
should be a lot less expensive x1 and
the books are compete 1 which one do you
take I mean the BMW is the ultimate
driving machine it is or at least it was
now this is a front-wheel drive vehicle
oh you caught me on that yeah you can
get available all-wheel drive but the
same is true with the Tiguan and the
last generation x1 was a real driver's
car because it was rear wheel drive it
behaved like a little bit of a 3-series
now both of these cars have driver
assistance systems a lot of the same
package like adaptive cruise control and
things like that so they're similar in
that way that they are they have new
infotainment systems they have a lot of
advanced safety features in fact the
Tiguan even has an airbag under the hood
for pedestrians now I got to say I like
the infotainment system better in the
BMW it's got the new I drive system
which has a lot of connectivity a lot of
app connectivity and so that works
really well I Drive is great and I no
arguments there I think it's a better
system yeah now I don't know what engine
we're gonna get in the x1 in the US for
Europe they announced seven engines both
gasoline and diesel but we'll probably
get a 2-liter turbocharged engine in the
US don't you hate it how Europe always
gets the whole range of engines the same
is true for the Tiguan they're gonna be
eight different engines here in the in
Europe and in the US if we're lucky
we'll get the 2-liter what do you mean
if we're lucky well here's the thing
we're not actually sure whether or not
we're going to get this particular
Tiguan we
get a us-specific Tiguan that's a little
larger a little cheaper and maybe a
little bit more in tune with American
driving styles well on that note today I
think we got to give it to the BMW x1
because we know we'll get this car in
the u.s. yeah
maybe by default but the x1 takes it all
right I'm Wayne Cunningham and I'm Chris
Powell here at the Frankfurt Auto Show
