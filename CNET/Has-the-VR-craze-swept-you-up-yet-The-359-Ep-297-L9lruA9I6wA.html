October 11th it's time for the 359
podcast my name is BBG welcome everybody
back sorry we spaced out on you
yesterday well as per usual technical
difficulty pens fault
it's always been small that's right but
it's episode 297 yeah holy cow and today
we got there
Roger Chang and Scott Steiner hello
morning guys hey glad to be here so
we've got a great show for you we're
gonna be talking about virtual reality
and who better to talk about VR than
Scott Stein our resident VR expert and
loup-garou Google goop goggle man Google
Google man
obviously today this lair this morning
lair today oculus will hold or Facebook
will hold its oculus connect event
Zuckerberg it's gonna be on stage we
know hopefully he'll address his little
little faux pas snafu sure laughs ooh um
whoopsie-daisy
as well see Daisy and hopefully give us
some more information about where the
old world is going cuz it's you know
it's been kind of like it's sputtered a
bit it feels very stagnated but it's
still there still there it's still there
and the technology keeps changing kind
of so as always if you have you have any
questions leave it in the comment
section I know you have questions for
Scott leave them in the comments section
Brian will get to them and we will
answer them in three minutes 59 seconds
from 3:00 to welcome to the 3:15 I'm
Roger Chang I'm here with special guest
Scott Stein I are you doing pretty good
I would envy our but speaking of which
we are talking about virtual reality and
Facebook's oculus connect event which is
later on today we want to give you a
quick preview of what what you expect
Scott being our resident VR expert what
are you hoping to see from connect today
well first of all Mark Zuckerberg is
just coming off the heels of this moment
where he showed himself in Puerto Rico
virtually is a cartoon avatar that was
very bad optics but it also brings up
the point of where VR is at now which is
which is feels like limbo you know VR
has not sold a lot of hardware at all
and a year later we're talking more
about AR on phones than we're talking
about VR
now Facebook has has taken over most of
what oculus represents after acquiring
it yeah and there's been a lot of
changes internally so I think that means
that in the end it started on PCs but
it's inevitably moving much more towards
mobile and I think we're gonna hear a
lot about that at oculus connect the
continuing mission there and also how
you get people to use this because right
now people are trying a are a lot of
people still don't have VR yeah and and
if they have they feel like they kind of
done it already right and the big
impediment to your point about going to
mobile is you have to buy these
expensive PC rigs to run these headsets
oculus still requires a PC and and I
think you're right I think they want to
get to mobile they want to get to as as
many people as possible at this point
it's not about I feel like at this point
of VR it's not about making money on
hardware or anything like that it's just
getting people to actually use this
stuff right and the bigger picture here
which all these companies are pursuing
Google Facebook Apple's getting into
this a bit you're look at Microsoft
you're looking at really the longer
picture of shared worlds you know and
whether that's a RvR mixed reality the
blending of that it might be kind of
post Hardware maybe that sounds like it
like a duck but it is where these things
are going what does that mean in the
meantime though do you have to buy these
rigs to hook into and how do you advance
it because all these companies are
looking at a future that is kind of well
beyond that but you're still stuck in
the present of a lot of little bridges
and a lot of different things right
he'll disappoint if for a lot of these
customers like does that mean that they
just they end up paying to be guinea
pigs for this grand future that isn't
here yet I stuck with hardware that you
know is will soon become legacy
equipment right and then you have you
know Google is still sticking around
with that with daydream VR Samsung's got
your VR which is in partnership with
oculus those are low priced and often
come with your gear maybe Facebook talks
more about how they're building stuff or
developing new tech beyond that again
using your phone and and socially what
does that mean well it's like you know
who else you're doing this with that's
what Zuckerberg was trying in some ways
to demonstrate in that video really not
well at all yeah I mean that was that
really terrible that was really
cringe-worthy it to his defense mark
being in the headset actually
experiencing in first-person he probably
doesn't see the optics of it you know
right you don't see yourself you don't
know you don't know your tune right and
and and and there are tremendous powers
of empathy if you can't get somewhere
but it shouldn't be a substitute for you
actually getting there and that's the
difference between you know in activism
and distance there's a lot of things
there but that is a question go see
these Facebook does want to get more
political and social with VR Facebook's
already super political than a lot of
stuff going on with Facebook right now
with with Russia and with a lot of other
things so yes that is a big overarching
question is as oculus is Facebook how
does that get represented and what could
you get in the future is it still the
same hardware I also want to see I mean
they talked about it a lot last year you
know as oculus or VR as a communications
tool we haven't gotten a lot of that you
know these cartoon avatars that they're
not really out there yet so I want to
see I want some more of that frankly
just how do we interact in this VR role
because it is a very isolated experience
it's interesting so those first
demonstrates the spaces are fascinating
but it is kind of like a weird ready
player one mess we're like you know you
have these cartoon avatars in your
floating video and how does that all
intersect I think they're gonna explore
that a lot more that seems to be a
really key focus of where oculus is
going next you know we'll hear about it
all right we that's we've got a ton more
to unpack we'll try to do more the QA
but for now I'm Roger Chang I'm Scott
Stein thanks for listening well you guys
can really crammed in a lot in four
minutes there's a huge amount of effort
to address some of the stuff yes
definitely that was very very
cringe-worthy hey guys this disaster
zones kind of depressing you want to
teleport back to back oh yeah well
anyone defend it but I see got you need
to make a microphone oh yeah thanks I so
like I mean again - he's probably not
seeing this in real time so I can see
and he was trying to talk about the
efforts that Facebook had put in to help
the you know assistance residents of
Puerto Rico that their own relief
efforts but yeah the way it was done it
just wasn't executed well as you said
the optics of it was it's the optics so
so I've had experience with the VR going
way back and so it reminds me of him
he'll talk about it and there's a lot of
blowback there's a lot of discussions
and people are getting really upset
about the idea of you know VR and when
when empathy is brought up and and
getting angry because again the the
optics with with Mark Zuckerberg and
relating to people is always a lot of
jokes about robotic and you know not
relating to human beings and so that
certainly doesn't help that image of
that but you know one of my first
experiences with with VR was watching
the documentary has now become like the
poster child for this but documentary
clouds over Sidra which was awareness
you know of Syrian conflict and and it
was very emotionally overpowering I
started a couple years ago I mean it was
when VR was really in its infancy was
before oculus rift was available and
that was something that made me realize
that you can cry in VR made you maybe
more aware of the space weren't there
correct me if I'm wrong number of
experiences Hugh and Joan actually tried
out the Tribeca Film Festival that yes
like elicited the same kind of emotional
impact right yeah I know there are
really powerful experiences there was
one there's one set at the you know it
was a show a project set in a
concentration camp where the survivor
actually guides you through and and
talks about it and if that sounds like a
you know it's not it's not contrived
it's um it feels real and and and unreal
and that sort of the challenge with VR
it feels like you're in a living museum
exhibit there's great care about how you
enter and how you exit that and actually
a lot of those exhibits are not ones you
can try at home they're designed to be
in a public space because they don't
want they want to take care of how you
perceive it because it's a very it's
very delicate and as I guess the best
way to put it and that's something that
you think about when you bring about oh
you can bring up Porto Rico you do this
like you have to think about how you
approach these topics and these emotions
when you use hardware like right you
making sure you have the proper gravitas
for some of these yeah more heavier
topics i I did no serve on a side
tangent that
I've been seeing more VR arcades so
speak pop up around the city even you're
in Long Island where I live I was they
they've been around a long time well no
these are using the craze but these are
a little bit newer because they're
they're basically all new running on
like HTC vive czar oculus wrist you have
been using stuff you can't get like star
VR like other like types of prototype
right right I feel like I've noticed
them popping up in more locations around
just us but again that's the
conversation we're having right now is
it not are they still just toys is VR
just gonna be the gaming thing so I
think there's like two thing that's a
really good question that's a good
question I think it's a matter of
renting versus buying for a while but
it's also running I find that there's of
those workaround balls there's the VR
Akkad's yeah at the same time and I
don't know if it's the same thing or
different you have a continuous growth
of escape rooms you have immersive
experiences that are like kind of quasi
escape room quasi something else the
void is one that it kind of blends that
that's one there they did a Ghostbusters
experience so that was a and they're
gonna be developing other experience as
a Star Wars based one I wanted to go to
that Ghostbusters thing well they're
gonna right is it gone Ghostbusters is
done it's contrived but the idea is that
you you you start blending in a lot of
these companies are saying we're not
just about VR we're about other things
there was one I saw at Samsung where
this company is trying to develop one in
Chelsea Market that's gonna blend AR VR
and immersive but I think that there is
a question of how much is this a band a
door or a bridge to future tech and I
also think that well going back to like
clouds over Sidra I keep thinking about
if you're gonna have empathy if you're
gonna bring in the real world it's best
to do it I don't know I my feeling is
it's best to do it for places that you
can't access yep and to be able to
understand and so in that sense Puerto
Rico is not a bad idea because the
average person is not going to be able
to travel there right now right so you
could get an understanding but Mark
Zuckerberg as a person could do a lot
and go places so you know there's a
matter of like is he us or is he
representing him and so
it's a very complicated question I think
it's got a lot of power but I think when
you see it like that it really creates a
sense of distance and there is a
distancing effect like and in the end if
I'm watching a political conflict in VR
should I even feel like I have the right
to say that I understand it right right
I feel that no way I shouldn't because
that is really a primary purpose of that
VR experience it's meant to give you a
taste I guess the same idea of
documentary work where you're like you
know you or you meant to experience you
know if you if you have a document about
show a based uh you know there's a line
between understanding and saying that
you know they know what's going on it's
it's very fine line but I think it
enters into that so why don't we get to
some questions right let's do just that
so right up first Danny Green our boy
Danny Green hey daddy
I think VR will have a great future in
the medical field it can provide a safe
environment for doctors to Train
definitely I don't think anyone's gonna
oh yeah totally I mean actually I think
frankly AR is more has more practical
use because I've talked to a couple of
doctors who use smart glasses with with
images that are overlaid Oh under
glasses that they can sort of use as
reference when they're performing a
surgery like that for me seems like a
more immediate practical benefit than
like VR training so it's interesting I
kind of feel like it could go both ways
because I agree with you but listen I'm
starting my I don't know my
brother-in-law who is an
anesthesiologist and it kind of feel
like he doesn't well he's already a
trained doctor so he feels like in the
end he's not gonna relate to it right
but I I wonder if when it comes to AR
pop-up information would be good but the
lag might be something that from an from
a practical standpoint of training might
not be quite there VR at least can be
very lag free and could give you a sense
of yeah immediacy of the doctors that
I've talked to usually they have like an
x-ray it's not changing it's it's a
reference but it's a reference point
exact like a pop-up like AR as a
diagnostic basically you know the map
when you're playing a video game yeah
it's the map that shows you which way to
go and like with heads-up display that's
that's exactly what's wrong classes are
Oh Scott that's a title of your next
podcast life with heads-up display
that's good you like that let's just
make that happen what he said I get 10%
what's uh what's nice question 10%
my bags I guess so the next question is
really you're striking a lot of chords
with this VRA our discussion well James
favored early on in the chat ask a RvR
which one is better and there's a lot of
subjectivity to that I want to just kind
of build on this because there's a lot
of relevant relative comments before we
go into any specific responses so
imagine sake says VR will always be a
niche product consumers would rather use
AR it's more practical all things Austin
says I believe AR holds much more value
than VR but I don't hate it
and then James favored requests 359 and
VR never never oh well we tried that we
did we did 359 and 360 that was
miserable that was 360 videos pain
should we do in his Facebook spaces no
no no okay everyone so anyways I'm soon
done AR vs. VR no that's a I was
actually thinking about this a lot and
and and coming off the heels of apples
AR kit I'm used they are core for Google
yet but I look forward to doing it I
played around with a lot of apps I've
been posting things on Twitter stuff and
you know at first glance a so AR is
interesting the future for it is wide
open in the moment it looks pretty
impressive terms of like a quick demo of
what you can do but AR has got a lot
more holes and a lot more bugginess from
my experience the real world is messy
and things have glitches all the time
that's why I think AR kit these phones
are doing it you're not putting it on
your head because if you did the
glitchyness would drive you insane oh
yeah you probably goes sick yeah you get
sick you know it would just all be
broken for you so that needs to be the
training wheels for it so there's a long
curve there and I think the apps I
actually spend less time in the AR apps
because they often feel like one-off
little novelties VR I got to go back and
give it a lot of credit I don't spend
more than an hour in VR I still feel
like I can't it just gets you a giant
screen in your face I feel like I've got
like a 15 to 20 minute limit before my
start to get time yeah an hour is like
after a while dude yeah get up to an
hour but afterwards I really feel like
I've been on like a weird journey and at
my eyes need detox which is not good but
the thing about VR and I go back and I
think about last year's launches I got
to give a lot of credit to all the
companies for the most part that they
launched with pretty solid VR libraries
and everything worked
worked and was ready to go it didn't
feel like a beta it felt all set and
still the libraries the problem is they
don't have triple-a games to me that
beat well you can do outside of VR and
that's why you don't go back in but I do
just give a lot of credit that the
general content of VR is more polished
and evolved and what's an AR and the
conversation being had in the chat right
now is about what other triple-a titles
they could see besides Resident Evil 7
and the wish list started coming down
the line which is for ports are
generally bad because there is they
don't it doesn't map right it's kind of
like the same thing happened when you
move to 3d games after 2d platformer
games it's like you have to reinvent the
idea of what it means to make a game in
VR actually you actually have to make it
with the express purpose right being I
just put it in there the epitome of that
example that went extraordinarily right
was Metroid when they went to Metroid
Prime in 3d yeah and somebody suggested
Metroid VR and yes a thousand times yes
incredible well at one point well
Nintendo enter VR cuz I feel like it's
bound to happen I'm gonna just go ahead
and say that they have a history with
main there they are kind of the
peripheral Virtual Boy was that VR VR I
don't even speak those words in there
but it's a Nintendo's DS or something
like that they had the 3ds so buckle up
for this one you know the other request
was or wishlist item for video games in
VR was dark souls 6 sick person what's
that behind me oh I died again yeah
they're just be the image of the words
you died burned into the VR goggles come
on I can't that's such a bad idea
alright let's knock out a couple more
questions and comments before call today
Josh boy des last year I messed around
with Google cardboard and I thought it
was just okay
is it worth switching to daydream Scott
yes
yeah it's cardboard is like basically
the it's the poor man freebie version
just check it out this is kind of a VR
looks like it's super low res it's not
the real experience laggy and
click on things easily daydream if
you've got the phone that supports it
get daydream I mean it's worth the 82
$100 or whatever it costs for that
headset a lot of apps are free you can
play around with them though I mean the
controller is great it's a huge
difference both that and the gear VR
which are very similar in their little
controllers it's like a little magic
wand you can point and yeah try it not
being said I still think it's got its
limits but there's a big leap forward
yeah in what it feels like and the new
version of daydream which I haven't used
is supposed to feel more comfortable
it's supposed to look a little less
squished optically and is meant to
actually not cause your phone to
overheat as much it's got a heatsink
built-in oh so that's interesting I
don't know how that yeah because that's
that was even with the original daydream
I mean all these things gear VR my
phones would overheat like that yeah it
was a real issue Samsung I thought gear
VR to be a better piece of hardware for
VR and dangering up to this point but
I'm curious about the new version of
daydream and I think Google's making
really introduced drives and integrating
Android I think it helps that the newer
versions are running on or using phones
that run on the new 35 oh yeah
Snapdragon platform like that that helps
so much yeah because it was taxing the
older processor and really just drained
the battery like that so well they were
trying to try to create a common ground
for that and that's kind of what you
need to do and that's what Apple's doing
now with with a our kit is they've have
the advantage of trying to build common
platform for chips and that's that's
what you already have with pcs so as far
as compatibility goes Josh boy de also
asks is the LG g5 daydream compatible no
no g5 for sure is not daydream
compatible effect the old g6
it might be make she knows I've taught
my have G section Google has a list
online there's about like a 15 phones
that work if you want the most VR
compatible phone samsung galaxy s 8 and
s8 plus work on both gear VR and
daydream
they only cross VR because Samsung is
the only one that does gear VR that's
really cool but then you need to have
two different headsets however you could
because there are about a hundred just
pick the one you want at that point you
have one y at least you get the option
but there are
some unique experiences on both if you
were like a mobile VR fanatic it
wouldn't financially destroy you to do
that but I really wouldn't suggest you
get two different headsets - right not
really worth it well I mean for mine to
be fair I have both and they both
collect us it right now all of my
collectors my PlayStation VR clicks test
I bought one last year I was
tremendously excited and I can't find
myself I I only dust it off and bringing
out one like a guest comes over hey
check out this cool VR thing and then
they're like oh cool put it back in the
closet I just yeah I stopped all right
let's let's help somebody out with the
the final question of the day Caesar in
the chat has been very curious about the
VR craze hasn't had a chance to
experience it says he's been all-in
since lawnmower man Wow
so let's love it I love the enthusiasm
let's talk about some 102,000 I used to
read that possibly dabbled in and
cardboard and daydream what's a good
introductory system to get involved in
with oculus rift vibe or PlayStation VR
what do you think is the best foot first
foot in the door of the VR world I don't
think I don't think any of those were
the good foot first foot I would say one
of the mobile wants like a dream you
know it would put those behind us Oh
more heavy duty full-fledged yeah
alright okay so assuming you have a PC
that is VR ready check your graphics and
make sure you've got that because
otherwise you're gonna kind of invest
into that but all these are running that
similar platform obviously what was your
what Scott what was your first was it
when you were starting to dabble what
was when you really went oh that was
neat so I think oculus rift is still
it's very debatable but I think oculus
rift is a great one because what the
price drop is good I like their software
library
I've liked oculus a software library for
a while there's a lot of really solid
titles I think the layout for if you
come in for the first time the hub the
dashboard the way it all feels and
curates feels like a game console the
thing about vive is that's a little more
under the hoodie feeling with the way
connects with Steam there's a ton of
titles out there it's fun that it links
into a lot of steam stuff there's a lot
of like early access stuff on Steam is a
little less clear auntie programs
there's also things on Steam that are
that are meant for different VR
platforms or just cool
it's spread it's a cross but it gets a
little more confusing is a little less
it's a look feels a less curated because
a lot less curated and does anything
crowdsource would be and vibe you can
wander around it better you can still do
it with with the the the rift sensors
you can do it better with vibe but you
can do a fine job with it with rift and
I just like the controller is better too
I think rifts controllers the touch ones
are great PlayStation VR is great if
you're rid of a PlayStation 4 but it's
you know it's it's your your mileage
will be limited surprise I don't know
what the future is there with their
Hardware over time yeah at least peace
Caesars that there's a more upward slope
just just let me say my first and only
real hands-on experience with VR was
with the psvr and I made the huge huge
huge huge huge huge huge mistake
of playing the Batman virtual reality
game not critically anti Batman here but
the first thing I did was a level called
origin story
use your imagination knowing the history
of what the origin story level of Batman
VR would be very traumatic yeah that's
my two cents yeah I mean personally I
like the vibe just because of the
emotional freedom of motion feel like
it's a little bit better than the riff
but I don't know you've got more
experience with software the titles so
if you have the space yeah I want to
create I don't have the space for a live
system because it's it does require
pretty much an entire room but if you're
sitting down and you also want to get up
and move a bit rift is the best of both
worlds and I think that you're gonna be
happier with rift software library just
because they have a lot more they've
been investing more in unique content
and there are some great games in the
back catalogue or really good games so I
do like where I do like rift still
gotcha
alright that's a great place to wrap it
up yeah Roger bring us home alright if
