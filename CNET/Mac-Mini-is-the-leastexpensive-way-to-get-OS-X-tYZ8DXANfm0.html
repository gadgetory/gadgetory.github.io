deserves I'm Dan Ackerman and this is
Apple's updated Mac Mini now we call
small desktop computers like this small
form-factor desktops people used to hook
them up to like their TVs as media
center pcs really before you had
streaming devices like Roku's and small
boxes like that that handled a lot of
that internet streaming otherwise people
use them to kind of hide out of the way
if you don't want a big visible computer
they're the only way to get a OS 10 Mac
system without a monitor attached like
you have with a MacBook or an iMac is to
either get Apple's most expensive
computer the $3,000 Mac Pro or to get
its least expensive computer the Mac
Mini which starts at $500 now the the
late 2014 update to the Mac Mini which
we've tested and benchmarked here is the
first update of this system in a couple
years they kept the body exactly the
same on the outside as a unibody
aluminum construction inside they
updated it to fourth generation Intel
Core I series processors otherwise known
as the Haswell generation or really
generation past that now and only 2015
we'll see if we ever get an update to
those here but you still get your choice
of Core i5 or Core i7 processors dual
core the previous generation you could
get all the way up to a quad core Core
i7 so oddly these are less powerful
potentially than the ones from a couple
years ago were but if you're just using
it for casual media streaming or just to
have it's a home desktop that should
make a huge difference some people are
very upset however that the RAM is now
soldered in you cannot open up the
bottom of the system and put in more RAM
yourself you have to order it when you
order the system and obviously direct
from Apple those upgrades can get
expensive this base model here the $500
one dual core Core i5 four gigs of RAM
500 gig hard drive fairly basic specs
for $500 you can't expect a heck of a
lot more it's actually almost the same
components especially CPU is as you'd
find in the 13-inch MacBook Air or the
least expensive 21 inch iMac so a good
way to look at it is you're getting that
level of performance for about half the
price there are some other competitors
now who are getting back into this mini
desktop market where people haven't done
in last couple of years I especially
like this HP Pavilion mini right here
that's actually it's it's got a smaller
footprint than the Mac Mini but it's
actually thicker this guy you can you
can configure up to a core i3 CPU so not
as powerful but you can get a one
terabyte hard drive in there so for
around the same price this configuration
worked at that 479 and this is $4.99 you
can either get the core i5 and the 500
gigabyte hard drive or the core i3 and
the terabyte hard drive
I found performance was actually pretty
close between these two in terms of
running applications also includes a
keyboard and mouse for your $500 here on
the Mac Mini you have to actually bring
your own keyboard announce that
obviously display I'm Dan Ackerman and
that is Apple's updated Mac Mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
