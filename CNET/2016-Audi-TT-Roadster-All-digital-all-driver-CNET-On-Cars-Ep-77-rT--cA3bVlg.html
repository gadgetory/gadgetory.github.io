making diesels clean no really
and why black boxes don't need to be
required in cars it's time to check the
tech
we see cars differently you love them on
the road and under the hood but also
check the tech and are known for telling
it like it is ugly is included at no
extra cost the good the bad the bottom
line this is CNET on cars
welcome to see net on cars to show all
about high-tech cars and modern driving
i'm brian coulis when you may have
noticed out ease not stingy about
pushing some of its best tech into its
more affordable and smaller cars and the
third-generation TT is no exception
drivetrain has dramatically improved
styling as you can see is quite
different virtual cockpit is getting a
lot of buzz around the industry and it
comes in roadster and coupe forms of
which we got the former so let's get it
on the road and check the tach
the Audi TT once referred to a bit
smirking Li as this little ladybug of a
thing among sports car purists not
anymore this third generation gets an
awful lot of things right and puts an
edge on the product technologically on
the road into the eye
howdy was kind of sneaky with this one
back in January of 2014 we got an early
look at what would be the style of the
new TT but it was in a concept mini
electric station wagon the front clip
though arrived almost unchanged on this
new car and I gotta say it's the
handsomest TT yet in three generations
and unlike a lot of complete generation
updates this one's dimensions don't
meaningfully change anywhere length
width height even weight all about the
same as the outgoing car we have a
roadster with the cloth tough there's
also a coupe that has some little tiny
back seats in there our car instead
where the back seats would go is where
the top does go that coupe by the way
can also be had as a hotter performance
TTS the roadster doesn't come that way
your first reaction when you get on the
new TT is where did everything go
it looks like we're back in the 60s it's
a blank - with some vents that's because
the star of the show is the virtual
cockpit over there in front of the
driver that's a 12 point three inch
virtual all LCD instrument panel the
gauges are virtual and they can either
be full front and center like you see or
with a click of a button they move
backstage you can go full map for
example pretty impressive driving all
this is a quad-core NVIDIA GPU and
they've added a couple of new
interesting buttons on the wheel
those get you into sub menus and one of
the first thing your passengers are
gonna say is wait a minute where's my
ability to control stuff you actually
can see that screen pretty well from
here but it's far from optimal this is
clearly not a car where the passenger is
supposed to be fussing with stuff but
instead hanging on for dear life
and of course you've got your MMI
controls down here excellent voice
command touchpad on top of the knob this
is all pretty standard Audi stuff as is
the 4G LTE connection that powers all
this including an excellent online
search and the ability to go
photorealistic on the maps at certain
elevation levels the other interesting
part of cabin craft Audi is done here is
to get read your traditional bank of
HVAC controls and instead embed
everything in the knobs on the vents
five vents five knobs the outer ones
control your seat climate and heating
and the center ones handle temperature
and fan and air flow direction it's
super clear fast to use nice system and
blessedly Audi's dump the MDI the
proprietary multi device interface and
now uses good old USB 16 TT is powered
by a 2 liter inline-4 turbocharged and
direct injected of course 220 horse
that's up nine from last year 258
pound-feet of torque that's the same as
last year one choice of a gearbox in the
US a six-speed dual-clutch automated
manual no six-speed manual available
here and all-wheel drive Quattro of
course zero to sixty happens in 5.6
seconds slightly quicker if you get the
coop faster still if you get the coupe
TTS
our car weighs about 3400 pounds
including that ragtop mechanism does
about 26 average 30 on the highway
under way three words in this new titi
light bright and tight that's what it
feels like in terms of powertrain in
terms of openness and in terms of
perceived weight on the ground one of
that light perception is from power that
comes on but almost no turbo lag I
really have to salute them for doing a
really good job on that
especially when it's a - later for that
it's sitting under that turbo so then
I'll have to fall back on but the power
comes on very effortless and when it
does come on it flows in order the
fastest dual clutch gearbox is out there
now we've experienced this gearbox
before and it is a good one but what's
so great about it are the lightning-fast
shifts when you press it and the
extremely good table manners when you
don't we've seen how you drive select
before this I believe the first time
when it can also affect the logic of the
Quattro all-wheel drive system for
example in dynamic mode which is sport
mode it can tell the Quattro system to
behave with a bias towards the rear
wheels by default one of my favorite
engineering accomplishments you can't
see and that is this sort of invisible
tub that I'm sitting in formed by the
windshield the header and this power
wind buffer behind me when that's up and
everything else is up around me but tops
all the way down you've got a very
isolated beautifully climate-controlled
scenario inside of here oh it's
augmented by these little neck heaters
back here on these optional sports seats
they blow warm air over your deck bottom
line is you're gonna love all evenings
on the road top down in this car
the top goes up and down quickly about
ten seconds either direction and trunk
space doesn't vary it remains small ish
no matter where the top is but at least
you know what to expect we're gonna
start about 46 for for a TT Roadster by
the time I had some tech those nice neck
heating seats and a surprisingly
affordable BNL audio option I'm
somewhere in the low 52 range the cabin
tech is hard to beat on this car though
your passenger may say otherwise the
ride handling and the power and the
delivery and the whole light bright
tight way it drives are outstanding I
love the looks now there's not much to
dislike about the new TT find our full
road test review on that 16 PT with the
drop top at cars see Netcom well
sometimes it seems like almost nothing
will scare a teen out of distracted
driving
except dying that does it and yet as
soon as they tell you that they turn
right around and pick up their phone
while they're behind the wheel we've got
some new insights into that dichotomy
for the smarter driver we've seen that
on cars returns
you
you
the intersection of driving and
experience and obsession with mobile
tech is a dangerous place to be that's
exactly where you'll find many teen
drivers raise your writing that you've
ever been distracted in your car
everybody write a brand new State Farm
Commission survey of one-thousand
drivers aged 16 to 19 found they both
fully understand the dangers of
distracted driving and do it texting is
number one in the world of cognitive
dissonance 95% of teens say yes it
distracts them from driving and 44%
still do it anyway watching videos
behind the wheel came in number one in
terms of how distracting teens
acknowledged it was that's good but a
substantial 15 percent said they still
do it talking with a passenger was of
course almost universal and 49 percent
of teens recognize that that too is a
form of distraction red lights are seen
as a sanctuary by our teen drivers
though the law doesn't typically
distinguish that from any other part of
driving and that statistic is no comfort
if you're the one behind a teen texting
madly at that fresh green light agents
this teen panel reported deterrence to
distracted driving come in two main form
number one not wanting to crash and
about half that many by the way said
they know someone who did have an
accident while driving distracted and
number two not wanting to get busted by
the way only six percent said having a
safe driving contract with their parents
was a deterrent
teens may not be envisioning a world
where they put the phone down as much as
one where they don't need to the vast
majority believe that crash avoidance
tech will prevent crashes by distracted
drivers
it pays to double check your teenage
drivers connection between what they
know and what they do welcome back to

home at the Mount Tam Motor Club just
north of the Golden Gate Bridge
what is VW gonna do for these four
hundred and thirty thousand cars
well this VW emissions cheat scandal has
a lot of people asking if Diesel's ever
really can be clean without all kinds of
complicated expensive gear like urea
injection systems that add complexity
and cost to the cars VW said they were
doing it without that expensive
complicated gear see how clean it is of
course they were lying so now we're
gonna do a car tech 101 to explain the
current state of the art and the
potential future state of the art of
cleaning up diesel for agents derided as
slow and more noticeably filthy
automotive diesel engines went in for a
big makeover over the last couple of
decades common rail injection is a form
of fuel injection that can spritz diesel
into the cylinders at very high psi and
very precisely controlled bursts that
kind of control of the amount of fuel
and how often it sprays into the
cylinder combined with turbo charging
revolutionize both the power output and
co2 emissions coming out of diesel
engines starting in the late 90s around
2006 ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel became
the norm in the UK Europe and us it
reduced the dirty sulphur content in
diesel fuel from 500 parts per million
to 15 taking that out reduces the energy
content in a gallon of fuel slightly but
primarily sets the stage for a key pair
of cleaning technologies to kick in
selective catalytic reduction puts a
special catalytic converter in a diesel
cars exhaust system inside that can is
sprayed a mist of urea fluid that
combines with heat and the special metal
surfaces in the catalytic converter for
a reaction that scrubs diesel emissions
way down in several key areas
the downside of scr is that you have to
add this expensive plumbing to the car's
underside and refill the card supply of
urea fluid from time to time typically
at ten to fifteen thousand mile
intervals some dealers will do it for
you as a courtesy during routine service
or you can do it yourself with a bottle
of the stuff from Amazon or an auto
parts store it's like adding washer
fluid but it's one more thing to fiddle
with the TV movie from fool's luck right
about now we should have smelled
something fishy VW is meeting stringent
new US diesel emission standards from
2009 on without scr on most of its
diesels which seemed like a trick no
other car maker could pull off as we now
know they weren't pulling it off either
these events are deeply troubling
retrofitting one of these bulky complex
scr exhaust systems and urea tank to the
affected TDI VW s and Audi s out there
is one way VW may have to address the
current cars that are on the road and
violating emissions standards
but what if diesel exhaust can be
cleaned up before it's even exhaust
that's what they're working on at the
Oak Ridge National Labs where they're
developing diesel engine tech that
injects fuel into the cylinder early in
the combustion cycle something which
almost defies the definition of a diesel
that along with a new breed of sensors
to manage the fuel timing precisely
based on nuanced real-time measurement
of cylinder pressure could be a big
breakthrough the diesel engine is by its
nature a dirty beast but it's fuel
flexibility lovely torque and high MPG
keep it an important player in
combustion auto engines even if keeping
it there requires a constant stream of
new cleaning tech
in a moment your email why you don't
find a CVT in a Lamborghini but a black
box in almost every car when CNET on
cars continues
the 570s might be MacLaren's new
entry-level model but it could be the
most important car from walking's finest
ever
the 570s is the first car in McLaren
sports
attention has gone in to make this a
real car you can use everyday buy more

welcome back to see net on cars I'm
Brian Cooley the part of the show where
I take some of your emails this first
ones coming in from Andrew B who says
here we are almost over with the year
2015 when are we going to see black
boxes black box data recorders required
in all vehicles this is an interesting
question Andrew now I've got a black box
right here as you can see it is a box
it's not black this particular one is
out of a late model Toyota that's
basically an ABS computer many sensors
feed into these connectors here and
there's a computer processor or two on
the motherboard what makes us a black
box though is that it records a snapshot
of your driving behavior and keeps that
at all times it's a running snapshot if
you will of probably about 30 seconds on
this one it could be longer could be
shorter and that's data that a lot of
folks find is that are very useful if
they're investigating a crash or very
unnerving if they're the one whose crash
is being investigated interestingly they
are not required in the u.s. nothing in
the federal code says that a car has to
have a data recorder that said because
of all these advanced systems that these
cars use today virtually all the cars
sold in the US do have one in there
because without that memory that ability
to look back a little bit on what's been
happening with the car a lot of systems
like ABS and stability control just
can't operate so they're there for
another reason the other thing about
black box is to know is that they are
regulated to some degree by US code that
they have to gather a certain number of
data points I believe it's 15 right now
and structure that data in a certain way
many cars will harvest far more data
points than that but the feds only have
a say about a small number of them and
how they're stored in the car so if your
car has one the law does say something
about what it has to hold check your own
state laws to find out who has access to
the data in your cars black box
especially in the event of an accident
okay our next question comes in from
zion mr long-time CNET on cars viewer
he's emailed in before this time he says
is it true the turning on the air
conditioning while driving at high rpm
could cause some of the air-conditioning
equipment or plumbing to rupture I hear
this one a lot not as much as I used to
but people still ask me if I turn it on
while I'm at high speed and that whole
system has to son
be engaged like that is that going to
blow or break something in the AC system
in my experience I think it's just a
myth
people have been snapping their AC on
from the off position on the freeway by
the millions
probably daily for decades and I don't
really know that I'm aware of a lot of
AC failures that happen in that moment
typically AC tends to degrade badly
hoses go bad and tend to leak out the
refrigerant compressor clutches will go
compressor internals will wear out but I
think this one's a myth maybe there's an
AC technician out there in the audience
let me know if I'm missing some nuance
here shoot me an email at on cars at
cnet.com okay our last email in this
show comes in from William V who says
could you explain briefly the technology
behind CVT continuously variable
transmissions and why they're not used
for more performance cars he says one
would think the ability of a CVT to
maintain an ideal engine power band at
all times would make it a perfect
gearbox for sports performance and
racing equipment it absolutely would
seem that way William and I'm with you
on that being able to keep an engine in
that rpm sweet spot is one of the Holy
Grails of performance but there's a
problem
cvts don't have really strong positive
engagement because they are not made up
of cogs and teeth to a traditional
transmission is or really hard locking
clutches and torque converters they're
kind of a constant slipping mechanism as
a result they don't handle really high
power all that well that's not where
they have found their main role though
they do maintain the sweet spot in
engines but mostly to seek economy not
to seek maximum power and torque output
a CVT as you probably know is made up of
a bunch of pulleys and belts a variable
pulley metal steel belt that is able to
slide between these varying pulley
flanges all the time that's the nature
of it's slightly slippery technology we
did a whole episode on transmissions
back in May of 2013 it was episode 18
that explains this really well I'll put
a link in the show notes so you have to
go hunting for it the show notes for
this episode the over at see net on cars
calm another issue around CVTs in
performance cars is that they don't
sound the same a car with a CVT tends to
constantly be in about the same
rev range more or less doesn't run all
the way down and all the way up the way
a geared transmission can or could and
therefore it's not going to be very
satisfying in the performance driver who
likes the sound of running through the
gears in a real transmission thanks for
watching hope you enjoyed this episode
and you know how we built this show it's
around your comments questions and
interest you get those to me via on cars
at cnet.com I read every one answer as
many as I can I'll see you next time we
check the tech
