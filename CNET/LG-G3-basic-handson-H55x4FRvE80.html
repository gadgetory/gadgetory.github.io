having a very very quick look at the new
LG g3 well this is the quick circle case
you can see which chef does that with a
clock is kind of interesting there's a
five hour half inch display on this
thing which is a large in the samsung
galaxy s4 and it's also got a higher
resolution than the s4 at 2560 x 1440
now on the back we've got a 13 megapixel
camera and that's you that's got
something called a laser focus uses a
laser to focus now that improves the
speed at which the camera can focus and
apparently much better in low light
tapping the screen to focus the picture
or tapping the screen to focus also
takes the picture i should say now on
the back o is also a rear key which is
the volume and the and the power there
inside there's a is a Snapdragon 801
chip running at 2.5 gigahertz there's a
microSD card slot which it was not the
last one it's running android 4.4 point2
KitKat a couple of software tweaks that
we've got that this is a Korean version
might be a bit hard to show you but
there's a something called smart
keyboard which changes the keys to
something you choose you can kind of
customize it where you can a lot of
third-party keyboards and something
called smart notice which is LG's
intriguing sounding versions Google now
you can give you a natural language
notification so take an umbrella today
it's raining later okay we can have a
much better video for you coming up on
seeing it later this is a very quick
look at the LG g3 i'm jason jenkins</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
