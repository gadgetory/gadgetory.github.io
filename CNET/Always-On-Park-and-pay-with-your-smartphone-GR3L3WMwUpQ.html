I don't know it just beats at me but it
doesn't do anything
there has got to be a better way oh wait
there totally is I don't think anyone's
gonna argue with me here parking is an
area that is ripe for innovation whether
it's how we pay for it or how we find it
we're making it easier for people to get
to those merchants so the city benefits
because they can increase their revenue
they can reduce congestion third of cars
that are moving in large cities are no
longer in transit now they're doing that
blind circle saying where do i park so
we can alleviate that second step and
alleviate as much as 20 minutes in a
dream but we make it really easy to get
to that law firm that flower shop or
that you know restaurant silicon
valley-based street line is one of the
companies rethinking the parking
experience they're building text so
drivers can more easily find parking by
showing what spaces are open or occupied
so there's this active data for an area
yes so we can also get a bird's-eye view
of how many cars are parked so right now
we know right to n down to individual
spaces what spaces are full and not less
than two one or zero it's red it's such
a dynamic environment there's probably
not going to be that space is not gonna
be left if it's there right but on the
other hand green 4 plus there's enough
spaces that even if you're a minute or
two away you can find the parking spaces
to create these data rich maps engineers
have designed wireless sensors which
they embed into the ground in parking
spaces and so now this is the hardware
this is a sensor here's the sensor so
the sensor is a wireless 2.4 gigahertz
little mesh networked wonder right and
the system is put into the pavement so a
car pulls in to a spot with a sensor
mm-hmm and then over here we see the car
as a matter of fact right here our
system senses it within about 10 seconds
takes up to the internet and then back
down to reports within about a minute
I'm just fascinated by all of the
changes that could potentially come from
this data like it just gets more
powerful by the minute it seems
the data that's gathered gets wrapped up
into a neat little mobile app so you can
get voice guided direction to open
parking spaces now this I had to try I'm
gonna go on a hunt for a parking spot
here in downtown San Mateo so there's
only 17 so I better get in here why
parking nearby let's go find some like I
does alone my parking spot I guess okay
you'll be sorry it's only 17 parked
within the whole town operation find
parking this is officially the most
stressful part of the day this doesn't
feel like the safest thing ever
oh I see now the line connects to where
there's parking ok so let's see what
happens if I turn right turn right onto
east 3rd that's us
let's see if this will just guide us in
300 feet
150 feet I don't see any spots better be
a spot right here look at that right
where the red dot is
look at that well done not bad I wish I
was built into the app so i didn't have
to like kind of come out into parking
but yeah boom found it you can start to
imagine the possibilities when sensors
are everywhere and this kind of data is
always available so what does the future
look like when every parking space has a
sensor potentially every device has some
kind of interface for finding parking
right well that's a good point this is a
start but a mobile app is a start but
where you really want to push that data
is to where the consumers are where are
they they're in their cars they're using
nav systems so we provide that data on
an API interface or some sort of data
feed to those car manufacturers they can
put that in integrate it with real-time
traffic integrated with navigation
integrated with other services and bring
it all together now parking isn't
totally caveman like it used to be for
example I have a whole collection of
apps that let me park anywhere no
quarters necessary so I'm just gonna put
a little time on the meter let's just do
15 minutes because looks to you for less
nine minutes I'm just gonna go grab a
cup of coffee
start parking oh I got so distracted by
Twitter that I forgot that my parking
had deactivated so just go right on back
and had another session I think I need
like I don't know just 10 more minutes
in the Sun
ok now I'm good
