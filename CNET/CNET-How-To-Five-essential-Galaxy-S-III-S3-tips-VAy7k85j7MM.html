might have noticed that with all the Ice
Cream Sandwich options plus the features
that samsung added there are a lot of
settings to choose from today I've
narrowed it down to five essential
features you should check out as you get
started with your new phone
first off let's tidy up the app drawer
all those weird apps like chat on an
AT&amp;amp;T Navigator can't be deleted but you
can't hide them with this trick go to
your app drawer and find the app you
want to hide tap and hold it and drag it
over app info tap disable and the app
will be hidden from the app drawer you
can get quick access to your favorite
apps and widgets by adding them to your
lockscreen go to settings security and
lock screen options if that option is
grayed out it means you have to disable
your screen lock
that means no pattern no pin and
basically no security but if you are
willing to give that up
go ahead and turn it off then head to
the lock screen options to pick and
choose the different items you want to
display when your phone is locked to
change the app shortcuts tap this option
down here and choose the apps now when
your phone is locked drag one of these
shortcuts and the app will lunge
there's a little personal assistant
built into the s3 called s voice and
lets you use voice commands to do things
like get directions and check the
weather to get the full of stuff
commands double tap the home button to
launch s voice and say this what can I
say all the possible commands will show
up right here one of the most practical
built-in features is this data usage
tool here in the settings it lets you
set limits on your data usage and
hopefully avoid any overage charges to
use it check this box here then set your
billing cycle if you don't know it call
your service provider to find out now
drag the red bar to define your monthly
data limit and use the orange bar to
pick the point when your phone warns you
about your usage with this setting
turned on your data connection will be
to stay
old once you've hit your limit so try to
avoid that by connecting to Wi-Fi
whenever possible and come back here at
any time to see how close you are to
reaching your limit here's a cool little
feature buried in the interface the s3
lets you make your own custom vibration
patterns for incoming alerts head to
Settings sounds and tap device vibration
then go to the bottom and select create
now think about what you want the
pattern to be then tap the circle to
record it the length of your tap
corresponds with the vibration so hold
for long notes and tap for quick pulses
when you're done hit save and set your
new vibe as a default alert all right
those are just a few tips to help you
get started with your Samsung Galaxy s3
for even more ideas head on over to how
to see Netcom for a CNET I'm Sharon
