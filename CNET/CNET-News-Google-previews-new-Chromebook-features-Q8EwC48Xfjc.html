our laptop our journey here began with
Chromebooks we're seeing tremendous
momentum here we started the journey
with one reference device the cr-48
which we launched about three years ago
year later with Samsung and Asus we
launched two devices in two countries
fast forward to today we have a toe yems
making 15 devices but many more on the
way in 28 countries users really love
the fundamental insight behind
Chromebooks speed simplicity and
security all 10 of the top 10 highest
rated laptops today in Amazon are all
Chromebooks we have seen tremendous
traction in education as well just this
year alone the number of Chromebooks
sold to K through 12 schools in the
United States has grown by 6x and we are
investing a lot more in this area so let
me talk about how we are evolving the
Chromebook experience as I said earlier
uses almost always have a smartphone
with them including when they are using
a Chromebook
so we want to increasingly connect these
experiences together so that they have a
seamless experience across their devices
let's take a look at what we can do Dave
can is gonna help me through with some
demos Dave talked earlier about how with
the elderly's you can unlock your phone
knowing that it is with you based on
what we are doing with the API snell
well if we can unlock your phone we can
also unlock your Chromebook so every
time you approach your Chromebook and
your phone is with you we will
automatically unlock your Chromebook and
sign you into your favorite applications
and services so it works seamlessly
we have already added Google Mountain
notifications so the same Google now
cards which you see on your phone you
see them on your Chromebook and we are
adding a few more things let's say you
get an incoming phone call you will
start seeing those incoming call
notifications on your Chromebook if you
get a text message you would see those
text messages on your Chromebook as well
and I recently had this experience my
phone was in my pocket and running out
of battery and my Chromebook popped up a
notification and said your phone is
running out of your battery simple
delightful experiences to connect your
phone and your Chromebook as we started
working on this one of the things that
struck us is wouldn't it be nice if you
could get some of your favorite Android
applications which you love on your
phone on your Chromebook so this is a
difficult challenge technically so we've
been working on this project for a while
our goal is to bring your favorite
Android applications in a thoughtful
manner to Chromebooks we want this to be
intuitive for users these applications
were built for Android for the phone so
we want them to work when there is a
mouse keyboard and touch events etc for
developers we want this to work with as
little modifications as possible so we
are in early days and we're gonna show
you a preview today and kan is going to
help me with it
so ken is gonna pull this tablet up and
what you're seeing honest tablet is
Evernote this is one of one of his
favorite applications and I think he's
planning a birthday party there let's
switch over to the Chromebook and the
same Android application is now
available in the launcher on your
Chromebook so you can click that and you
get the exact same application and
because you're on a Chromebook you can
start making changes to it you can go to
the web copy paste everything just works
we have ported that Android application
to run with a new Chromebook let's give
you one more example
we'll pull a canonical application an
application you see on your phone like
wine we now have that application
running on your Chromebook pixel as well
and is going to browse through the World
Cup Channel and you can see how the
experience feels native and intuitive on
on a Chromebook and because the app has
access to some of the underlying device
api's you just access to the camera API
can can actually take a clip of himself
just like a wine user and post it
straight on this building the final
application we want to show to you is
Flipboard
it's a beautiful immersive experience
and the Android version of the app now
comes alive on Chromebooks and you can
see how beautiful and immersive this
experiences we are very very excited
about bringing important favorite
Android applications for users straight
on their Chromebooks so that they can
get an even more connected experience
and we are working on bringing our
experiences across both Android and
chrome together so that it works in a
delightful way for our users
