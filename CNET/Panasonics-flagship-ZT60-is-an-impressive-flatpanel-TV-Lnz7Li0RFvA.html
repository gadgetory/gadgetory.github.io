we're here at CES 2013 or the Panasonic
stand and we're taking a look at the
company's flagship plasma TVs
there's the ZT 60 series televisions so
let's have a look at what's new so
Panasonic's incredibly keen on the
picture quality of this TV it says that
you're going to be really really
impressed with it it's got a a studio
master panel which is Panasonic's
thinnest panel yet apparently so a
really really slim gas layer and that's
going to improve picture quality of
course it's no use pretending that
plasma is the really exciting display
technology of CES 2013 not when we've
got so many exciting 4k and I led
Telly's available but Panasonic is still
banging on the old plasma drum and this
television it does look good to me
that's my first impression is it it
looks it looks very clear looks very
sharp but will it be the best for the
money because it's likely to be very
expensive
there's 3d built in of course it's going
to be active shutter technology which
means the glasses are going to be a bit
more expensive and they're going to be
battery-powered as well elsewhere you
get all the Panasonic's smart TV
services so perhaps a little bit of web
browsing perhaps and also interestingly
you can use a smartphone app to
calibrate this TV so you don't have to
fiddle around with the remote panasonic
has really really impressed us with its
plasma TVs in the past
last year's televisions were extremely
good so to be honest hopes are high that
this one can measure up pricing
unfortunately is completely TBA there's
no word on that though as I mentioned
before it's likely to be very very
expensive because this really is the
flagship this highest end TV you can get
from this company if you've got a small
house or limited wall space don't even
consider these televisions because they
only come in jumbo sizes this one I'm
looking at right here is the 60 inch
model and up there that's 65 inch and
those are the two sizes available as we
release date we don't have exact timing
but sometime between April and May is
what Panasonic's have told me that means
that we don't have very long to wait to
find out exactly how good this
television is I'm the Westway for C net
here at CES 2013 and this is Panasonic's
ZT 60 series television</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
