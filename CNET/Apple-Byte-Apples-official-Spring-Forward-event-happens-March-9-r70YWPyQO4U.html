the apple pie for everything you want to
know good and bad inside the world of
Apple let's get to the show Annapolis
sent out its official invite for its
next event on marks ninth in San
Francisco at ten a.m. pacific there's
still a lot more we don't know about the
Apple watch that's expected to release
in April but the spring forward event
could also see the launch of the 12 inch
retina macbook air or refreshes of the
macbook air line and possibly some news
about their beats music service will
find out soon but if you look closely at
the invite I think they might be
releasing something with colorful leaves
Tim Cook is on a global tour right now
making stops in Germany and Israel and
according to French website I Jen cook
told an employee at the berlin apple
store that he wears his Apple watch all
the time even in the shower now remember
when he said this it's a new innovative
intimate way to communicate directly
from your wrist yeah he wasn't kidding
now Apple has already claimed the s1
chip inside the watch is completely
encapsulated in resin to protect it from
the elements so look for shower proof to
be added as one of the key bullet points
sometime soon cook also still said he
charges the Apple watch every night now
a lot of people are still obsessed with
how expensive the watch might be and if
Apple is smart they shouldn't reveal
anything until the absolute last moment
now that has becomes such a big deal
Jared fireballs John Gruber recently
asked his Apple contacts if the five
thousand dollar mark was too high they
all responded with a confident no so now
he's flirting with the idea of a
ten-thousand-dollar watch and if you add
on a specific Band or bracelet he says
it could hit even 20 grand all this for
a first gen watch that will last about a
year and a half before the next gen and
if there's any watch Cooper toodles to
be paying attention to it's the newest
pebble time watch with a color e-ink
screen and a battery that will last
roughly seven days now they just put it
up on Kickstarter and it will
you tell for 199 and in case you're
wondering in two days it's already past
the nine million dollar mark at the time
of this shoot I'll write in Apple pay
news if everything goes to plan our
European Apple biters will be able to
use this service this year after visa
announced its payment terminals will
support apple pays tokenization system
by mid-april there are still a lot of
steps that need to happen apple doesn't
really seem to be in a hurry and during
cook's tour he said the company's goal
is to have it running by the end of the
year in better news Apple is planned to
launch Apple pay for my friends north of
the border in canada as soon as March
alright apple recently released the
latest OS 10 10-point 10.3 pre-release
and the newest beta for iOS 8.3 this
week OS 10 gets an update to the Photos
app while the iOS beta gets a new
version for the apple TV OS as well but
the biggest update is the addition of
new emojis see Apple delivered on their
promise and is finally bringing racially
diverse character sets which lets you
pick from various skin tones on several
different characters finally a darker
skinned Chinese guy can be represented
by emojis and I personally thank you for
that now 32 new country flags are also
part of it and Apple has changed the
watch emoji to duh the Apple watch the
phone is now an iphone 6 and the
computer is an imac now also people were
wondering what's up with the default
super bright yellow faces asian people
aren't actually that yellow but it
actually has to do with the standards
created by the Unicode consortium for
how different characters appear on
different platforms ultimately it's up
to the specific platform to choose the
picture so that default Lego yellow
color is the same as a default yellow
for a smiley so people you don't have to
get all crazy about it but we finally
have diverse emojis everything is
I
all right in the quick bites bloomberg
reports that apple is aiming to start
their electric car production sometime
in 2020 and pushing employees to have it
ready to compete with similar cars by
Tesla and GM coming out in 2017 again
Apple could delay or completely kill
this project but if they need any
motivation the best quote this week
comes from mercedes-benz chairman dieter
zetsche Jenna he says if there were a
rumor that Mercedes or Daimler plans to
start building smartphones then they
being Apple would not be sleepless at
night and the same applies to me you
know what we will check back and see how
he feels in five years and this friday
the movie profe is featuring Will Smith
and Margot Robbie will be one of the
first Hollywood films edited entirely
using final cut pro x the director said
FCPX save them time by automatically
organizing their footage while edits
were done on location with a macbook pro
now the entire project involves 61 days
of shooting 145 hours of footage 11
months of editing with 117 scenes being
edited at full resolution alright that's
gonna do it for this week I'll be out of
town next week but if you guys and gals
are on your best behavior I'll pump out
a show for you next time you can always
email us at the apple by de cnet com or
tweet me at brian Tong thanks so much
for watching it will catch you all next
time for another bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
