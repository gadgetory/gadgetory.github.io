Ricoh GR choose a standout if all you
want is great photos for about $700 or
600 pounds and as long as you're willing
to work a little for them I'm Laurie
green and for CNET and this is the Ricoh
GR to an enthusiast compact with a fixed
28 millimeter F 2.8 lens and a
relatively big aps-c size sensor it
mainly just adds Wi-Fi for remote
shooting and file transfer with phones
and tablets because the rest of it is
old though it feels a little dated with
slow autofocus and low light and
mediocre video and movie options this
camera is all about the photos with its
default settings high contrast JPEGs
under certain circumstances come out a
little flat and there's a lot of
blurring from noise reduction by ISO
6400 but there's also a lot you can do
with the Raw's and a ton of settings in
the camera for tweaking the JPEGs
I wouldn't paid a racing stripe on it
but it's fast enough for most Street and
landscape photography which are its
primary uses and for shooting some types
of action and there's a lot to like it's
a good size and weight with a decent
rubberized grip that makes it easy to
shoot single-handed and once you've
configured it to your taste it's quite
streamlined to use I don't really like
the feel of the manual focusing but it
does have a full press snap mode that
automatically focuses at a
user-specified distance when you press
the shutter button on the other hand the
camera is surprisingly complicated given
that it doesn't have a huge feature set
plus if you've got vision issues you may
have a problem with the tiny print in
the menus as for the Wi-Fi it has a
somewhat bare-bones wireless transfer
app which is supplemented by a seriously
full-featured tethered shooting web
application called Rico gr remote that
can control almost every setting in the
camera it's a nice camera for
inconspicuous and quick Street shooting
or is a travel camera for the landscape
fan but if you're looking for something
that's equally adept at video or offers
the shooting angle flexibility the
removable LCD or a viewfinder provides
this may not be the camera for you
for more detail beyond just the
highlights pop over to CNET to read the
