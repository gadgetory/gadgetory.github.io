one of the coolest new features of the
next generation of game consoles both
the xbox one and the PlayStation 4 can
log you in through facial recognition
the xbox does it through the Kinect
camera that comes included with the
system and for the PlayStation before
you need the PlayStation camera that's a
sixty-dollar add-on but I think it's
well worth it let's take a look at how
it works on both of these consoles I'm
going to start off with a straight face
recognition you're going to sit in front
of the camera and the playstation 4
knows who I am now I'm going to step off
camera let me forget about me I'm going
to come back without my eyeglasses on
I'm still me great I'm going to step off
camera again this time we're going to
come back wearing a hat up and
playstation 4 does not know who i am but
if i take the hat off nah I'm me again
fant it now we're going to try to log
into the xbox sit down in front of it
and there's me okay great now we're
going to step off camera and I'm going
to come back having taken off my glasses
and now i'm just an anonymous guest I'm
gonna leave one more time and this time
I'm going to come back wearing my hat
and he gets it took a second but it's
all who I was we tested the xbox one
kinect and the playstation camera
regular face glasses on and off hat on
left I have one more test for you I'll
be right back and I'm back okay first
let's try the kinect okay there i am it
sees me now we're going to go over to
the playstation 4 and again no problem
there i am so while hats and eyeglasses
may fool these game consoles no beard no
problem i'm dan ackerman and that is our
xbox one vs playstation 4 facial
recognition shootout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
