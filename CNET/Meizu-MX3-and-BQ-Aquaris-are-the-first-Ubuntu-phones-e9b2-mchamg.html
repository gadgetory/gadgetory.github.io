two phones to bring a gun to to you the
meizu mx3 and the BQ aquaris Ubuntu is
best known for providing you with an
alternative to windows on your pc but
the British company behind the software
is branching out into phones and tablets
too and this little pair with the first
phones with a buncha one you can
actually buy so are both existing
Android phones that will be outfitted
with new ubuntu software amazing mx3 is
currently on sale in china and other
parts of the world and it's a 5.1 inch
phone with a samsung eight core chip
inside the curve glossy design actually
kind of reminds me of a samsung galaxy
phone my favorite of the ubuntu 2 is the
spanish made 4.5 inch quad-core BQ
aquaris just take a look at the
understated design of this minimalist
slab of smartphone style so those are
the phones but what about the software
ubuntu is based around home screens
called scopes which can be as simple as
a screen collecting all your music or
your photos or they can be customized
and themes you can have a scope for the
world cup for example showing you the
latest news about the beautiful game or
your phone carrier or network can
display a dedicated scope showing your
bill and your account information i like
a bum soo it's a slick and elegant
system that's based around swiping your
finger in from the edges of the screen
so i've been from the left for an app
launcher to quickly fire up your
favorite apps so i've been from the
right and you get a multitasking
carousel so you can browse through the
apps you currently have running once
you're in an app swipe up from the
bottom for a submenu and at any time
pull down from the top of the screen to
your notifications recent messages and
the important information you need to
know about your phone like the battery
level or signal strength so it's early
days for a bun too and a lots riding on
which networks and manufacturers get on
board we'll be keeping a close eye on
the Ubuntu to to see if it can mount a
real challenge to Android I'm Richard
