code on the web but let's hope you don't
see it I'm Bridget Carey this is your
scene that update if the government
censors a website you may come across a
new type of error code when you visit
the blocked page now we've all seen the
404 file not found error and of course
there are number codes for many other
problems for example 408 is a request
timeout in 403 is a forbidden page where
access is denied and now a new code was
just approved by the internet
Engineering steering group error 451
it's a code for when a website is
censored so you know it's a legal reason
and not the fault of a technical glitch
the code was submitted by Tim Bray he's
a co-author of XML specification and he
picked 451 as a nod to the Ray Bradbury
novel Fahrenheit 451 it's a story of a
society that outlaws and burns all books
which sensors ideas now there is a
hiccup to this concept some governments
can also block the use of a 451 code to
hide the reason that a sites not working
but if a country doesn't block it you'll
know the difference between a legal
takedown request and a site just not
allowing access or not working the web
has changed quite a bit since it first
launched if you want to get nostalgic
the first page on the World Wide Web
went up 25 years ago British computer
scientist Tim berners-lee published the
first webpage on December twentieth
nineteen ninety when he was a researcher
at the european organization for nuclear
research known as cern you can still see
the first page today the point was to
make it easy to search and share
electronic documents and it was first
used by defense and academic groups
these 3 w's here were the first logo
created for the worldwide web project
with dog colors and washing machines now
on the web just think how much the
internet is going to change in another
25 years well for those of you just
scrolling with boredom through facebook
today on your phone the social network
will now tell you what events are going
on near you and you'll get notifications
if your friends are going in the iOS app
go to events
in the more window and you can find
events for today tomorrow this week or
the weekend even next week it also
suggests things that it thinks you'll
like now I don't know why it thinks I
want to go to the no-pants subway ride
but thanks for thinking so highly of me
facebook clearly I need to change how
much I share in the new year that's it
for the SEC news update and there's
always more cnet com from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
