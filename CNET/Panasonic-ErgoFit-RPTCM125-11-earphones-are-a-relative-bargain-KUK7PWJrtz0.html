what the top-selling headphone on Amazon
is it's this Panasonic in your model the
Ergo fit our pH je1 20 which you can
pick up for around seven dollars sounds
surprisingly good for that measly price
and I gave it high marks in my review I
did have one minor gripe about it
however it doesn't feature an integrated
microphone for making cell phone calls
as a lot of earphones do these days
which is why I had high hopes for
Panasonic's peugeot fit RPT cm 125 the
step-up model we're focusing on today
and it sells online for a little bit
more at 11 to 13 dollars depending on
what color you pick and it has a one
button integrated remote / microphone
for making cell phone calls they're
comfortable and they stayed in my ears
well but it's worth mentioning that the
housings are slightly smaller on this
model than the cheaper hje
120 both models are listed as having
nine millimeter drivers I wouldn't speak
too highly of the cord construction and
the wires leading up to each ear but are
pretty thin and have a tendency to
tangle easily but if you're reasonably
careful with these guys they should hold
up okay and even if they do break or you
lose them it's not the biggest deal in
the world because they don't cost much I
was really hoping these earphones would
have the same sound as the hje 120 s
however they don't the base is a little
more hyped and they just don't have the
same clarity they still sound good for
the money but not as good as the hae 120
s on the plus side I made a few calls
with the integrated microphone and while
the call quality wasn't fantastic it was
decent enough bottom line if you want
better sound go for the cheaper hje 120
s they're a real bargain
this TCM 125 is also a good value just
not quite as good I'm David Conroy
