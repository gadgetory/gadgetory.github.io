announcement but that company was gonna
make luxury cars
well now the new ones laughing anymore
let's try the second generation Genesis
as it comes along to finish the job and
well finished it is unless you eat a lot
of carrots you might never know this is
a Hyundai it barely says so anywhere and
where it does in very small type it
communicates Genesis in these winged
badges that could have been a trite from
Bentley now look at the overall
proportions you've got a long hood a
short deck and kind of a coupe like
almost fastback roofline all of this
communicates more youth than we expect
from so-called nice luxury cars another
thing to look at here is the lack of
gaudy jewelry in the past the Korean
carmakers have been very given to going
kind of over Lardon when they want to
communicate luxury this one's got
European restraint structurally notice
this the car is almost the exact same
length nose-to-tail as the outgoing
first gen car but they've pushed the
wheels out three inches the wheelbase
between the axles that's a big stretch
in automotive terms it gives the car
shorter front and rear overhangs that
look sporty ER it also should give it
more directional stability and a nicer
ride
the first thing I noticed inside this
Genesis is how handsome it is that
restraint I talked about on the exterior
carries over inside it's got a lot of
Kia DNA he has always been more of your
your sort of dwell magazine Herman
Miller no look and I knew was always a
little bit fuddy-duddy not anymore the
sole concession might be this clock but
even that's been modernized nicely
directly in front of me is a bit of a
surprise
traditional gauges with dials a lot of
cars in the premium category have gone
to all video here it doesn't bother me
though because I've got a very useful
very clear LCD helper panel in front now
the main LCD is of course this guy this
is an upgraded head unit by the way
there are two levels of navigation head
unit this larger one is a 720p high-def
9.2 inch LCD it is a touchscreen but I
almost hate to touch it it does show
fingerprints very readily instead you've
got the Hyundai controller that is along
the lines of what many other car makers
have navigation is a good system we've
seen this basically before in Hyundai's
I like the fact that it's well rendered
it's very clean when you do hit one of
these menus four things happen right
away fast touch response now your media
controls are all up here a quick look
basically everything you need is in
there AM and FM with HD radio satellite
radio is well done this is a full
implementation of satellite radio which
includes pause and restart so it will
buffer your show if you need to pause it
for a moment also you can set up a
favourites sort of a hunt list so if you
want to be alert at any time Rod Stewart
is playing on any satellite radio
channel and tune to it you can enter
things like that you can get your
Genesis with built-in sound hound that
app you may have used on your phone to
figure out what song you're hearing but
oddly it's only available on the bass
head unit in this car not our upgraded
one now let's go to blue link blue link
used to be Hyundai's basically version
of OnStar a lot of find your car crash
notification stuff it's getting more
interesting though you now can search
for destinations live on the air via
Google do an internet search and then
say take me there that's a trick that
pretty much the Germans had to
themselves until recently you've got
sent a car of course from your Google
navigation and then the usual
Diagnostics and such you've got Siri
eyes free support in this car as well so
if you want to use this voice button to
actually call up Siri on your iOS device
that will work
and finally I want to show you the hut
on this car the head-up display is very
ambitious it's well done it'll show me
blind spot Lane Departure navigation
speed all kinds of information but it
doesn't do it all that well I find it's
often kind of crooked the way it's
mounted there seems to be some kind of a
wobble in the laminate of the windshield
so as I move my head around the whole
thing kind of shakes like jello they're
halfway there oh by the way this vehicle
supports Google glass for some basic
functions like being able to find your
car send a Pio eye from glass to your
car be able to handle things like status
checks of whether it's locked or
unlocked it's the first car maker we
know if to do that on the market all
genis is the right phrase have a single
transmission choice 8-speed automatic
through a very classic PRN D gate a
shiftable side over here paddles on the
wheel there's one little Buried button
right here when you press this you can
go between an eco mode a sport mode a
normal mode and you can also get into a
snow mode with this vehicle rear cam is
standard on this car
unlike some expensive German cars I
could mention and it has two views
you've got your standard view like so
with trajectory prediction and a top
view that lets you look straight down
and really get that last inch figured
out it's good quality not the best step
seen now up in the engine bay you can't
laugh at Hyundai anymore they aren't the
maker a bunch little imbalanced fours
the way they were back in the 90s this
is a beautiful v8 it's their tau series
it's a 5 liter with direct injection of
course continuously variable valve
timing as any modern engine has today
four valves per cylinder dual overhead
cam all the basic tricks are here but no
turbochargers no superchargers you don't
need that when you've got this kind of
displacement here's the proof 420 horse
383 pound-feet of torque that's pretty
good even though the car does weigh over
4,500 pounds it's a pretty big vehicle
yet 60 comes up in around 5.2 seconds
the down setting is only gonna get 15 23
mpg and part of the issue there is
Hyundai has yet to introduce anything
like hybrid ization auto start-stop even
brake force regeneration this car
basically lets its momentum go
now the first thing you're going to
figure out about the Genesis sedan is
that this ain't no BMW the handling is
no slouch but this is more tuned toward
comfort for isolation of engine sounds
when you want a lot of power you more or
less get it in sport of course it's even
more magnified turn on that active
lane-keeping technology and I dare you
to overpack or fix it gets involved as
soon as I start to drift toward that
line and it's really aggressive as well
as being very smart and nuanced in
addition to that active Lane correction
it's also got some steering guidance
where it'll find the curve in the road
slight curve we're talking about and
guide you along and keep you in the lane
you can also get this car to stop all
the way down to zero from up to 50 miles
an hour that's part of its pre collision
technology adaptive cruise control of
course that's almost required on the car
in this class but its standard on this
car not in all its competitors you've
got cross traffic alert you've got blind
spot technology you don't have any
parking assist on this car though which
is interesting much as it leaves out
things like start/stop and brake
regeneration it's got some odd holes in
its technology line up in some if I were
on the market for a large imported
luxury sedan right now
this is absolutely on the short list
period okay let's price our Genesis
sedan 5 oh the v8s about fifty to five
with destination there's really only one
box to tick off to take it fully CNET
style and that's to add the ultimate
package which cost thirty to fifty that
brings an adaptive suspension the
head-up display that I'm about premium
navigation which we have 17 speaker
lexicon audio and a power trunk opener
and closer now here's where I'd like to
price out the all-wheel drive upgrade
but like with that sound town
integration you've got to go down scale
to get it but these six can have
all-wheel-drive the v8 cannot now here's
the question I've got you could do this
car for little under fifty six thousand
but you have to also consider the v6 it
has excellent power on paper even though
I've not driven it personally four
hundred pounds less most of that comes
off the nose and that might make for the
perfect
balance it's not unlike the early Lexus
SC s where the smart money went for the
six not the eight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
