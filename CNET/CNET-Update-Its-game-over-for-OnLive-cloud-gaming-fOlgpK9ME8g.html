to change the video game industry I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your C net
update the ambitious video games startup
company OnLive is shutting down and
selling its patents to Sony when OnLive
launched in 2010 it offered people a
chance to play video games without
owning an expensive console the games
were run off powerful servers somewhere
else and streamed to the player it's
similar to how Netflix streams movies
but OnLive struggled it went bankrupt
and even relaunched its online service
you could rent or buy games or spend $10
a month to access a library of games for
TVs PC smartphones and tablets research
shows that not many people are paying
for cloud gaming right now but Sony
which bought the patents for OnLive
launched its own streaming service in
January called PlayStation now it costs
twice as much as OnLive $20 a month
in other news Microsoft is giving
Android and iOS users a new way to keep
track of documents it's a scanning app
called office lens if you've ever used a
scanning app you know it can be helpful
for keeping track of receipts business
cards and whiteboard notes you just
point your phone's camera to the notes
to save and capture the text office lens
was a hit on Windows Phone but now
Microsoft is sharing the love with
Android and Apple and all versions are
free when you take a photo of a document
you can save it to Microsoft's OneNote
app and that's also free some images can
be converted to PDFs Word and PowerPoint
documents and business cards can be
saved as a VCF file to put in your
address book and it's a milestone now
for Microsoft as the company turns 40
Bill Gates was 19 years old when he
started it in Albuquerque New Mexico on
April 4 1975 Microsoft has made quite a
few changes recently focusing more on
its strengths and software and services
and the company can still surprise us
like it did in January when it revealed
its hololens augmented reality
technology and there's another tech
birthday to celebrate the iPad is now 5
years old back in 2010 it was hard to
predict just how quickly the iPad and
tablet space would take off but Apple
sold fourteen point eight million iPads
in its first year it was the fastest
selling product in Apple's history the
market exploded with a flood of
competitors including Amazon's Kindle
Fire
now shipments of the iPad and the tablet
market as a whole have slowed down
people don't upgrade to a new tablet as
often as they would buy a phone Apple
recently made a deal with IBM to work
together on business applications for
iPads in the workplace so perhaps
there's something in the works to give
the iPad a new sales surge and it's
rumored that Apple is working on a
larger sized iPad pro that's your tech
