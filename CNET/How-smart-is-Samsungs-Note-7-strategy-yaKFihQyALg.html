yeah latest note they skipped 6 and went
straight on to rule 6 out completely
yeah that's right we didn't want 6 at
all it's a pretty fancy phone a 12
megapixel camera enormous screen it's
got the s-pen this one's waterproof it's
got an iris scanner so you can unlock
your phone using your eyes if that's
something you want to do we definitely
agreed that it's a cool phone it's got
everything edge screen as well yes
that's right yet - can't forget that
it's good it's got its got everything
it's got all the bells and whistles
everything that if I see USB see
everything the phone can do is in the
note 7 your question is what does it
mean for Samsung what is the larger
what's the bigger picture stuff with the
note 7 well I mean your thoughts right
yeah like you say I have two admits the
first time that a phone has come along
that's made me go oh that's got
everything and I think it's really cool
the the Samsung is actually doing well
now they've had their first kind of
growth for I think two years and yeah
strongest earnings in two years fueled
by sales of the s7 and the s7 edge and
this is basically the s7 edge only with
some cool new stuff in it so it looks
looks pretty good for Samsung I mean
that is encouraging if I had a worry
about the note 7 it would be the price
because if you look at what rival phone
makers like why away or even like tiny
tiny companies like oneplus have been
doing they've been making sort of
equivalently powerful phones but for a
fraction of the price way way cheaper
mmm but I would say the design probably
gives a bit of an edge no pun intended
as well over over things from far away
and oneplus at least for now
so yeah the price I'm concerned about
the price is a little too expensive but
then as you say Samsung has had a lot of
success with its flagship phones
it hasn't sort of done this race to the
bottom thing kind of chasing out you
know the lower end Mobile's yeah and I
read that the the s7 edge was the most
popular Android phone in the first half
of the year the note 7 it does
everything the edge does and it's only
slightly bigger and you think half they
killed the edge
they've edged out the arrows edged out
the edge yeah they've blunted the edge I
mean what does that
think they'll get rid of the edge line I
know I wouldn't have thought so I mean
it has to be said actually at that kind
of scale there even though it is only I
think it's five point seven versus five
point five inches but even at that kind
of even that's relatively small gap will
actually make a difference when it's the
line of your throughs that you've got to
be thinking about so yeah it can make a
difference but yeah I mean they're
obviously still going to be both a very
popular phones maybe the like you say
the price is going to be the deciding
factor you know we really like the s7 s7
edge is fun the the sort of curved
screen stuff it's a little gimmicky burn
it's it's kind of cool and you know it
does make the phones look and feel a
little bit different to everything else
out there
yeah I serve I feel with that like the
with that we weren't sure about the
s-pen to start with with the notes and
there are a couple of years where it was
like where you can write on it that's
great but now on the on the the new note
7 there's a few features with the s-pen
like you can write a memo and you can
pin it to the you know you can write put
them on pretty much everything you can
you can including underwater including
on the earth so it kind of feels like
that the s-pen is coming into its own so
maybe the edge screen when they've you
know after a couple of years maybe
that's going to come into its own with
like the way you actually use it in the
how it works yeah we might we might see
that evolve as well so it seems like the
note which always worked to me
represented the sort of weird like
experimental branch of Samsung phones is
now sort of being brought into the fold
part of one of the proper family so I
think we're both pretty positive would
be interesting it does anyway we are
we've got loads more on the note 7 on
CNET and we want to know what you guys
think as well so do get in touch and let
us know great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
