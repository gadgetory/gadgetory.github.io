yeah latest note they skip six and went
straight on to room 6 out completely oh
that's right we didn't want six at all
it's a pretty fancy phone a 12 megapixel
camera enormous screen it's got the S
Pen this one's waterproof it's got an
iris scanner so you can unlock your
phone using your eyes that's something
you want to do we're definitely agreed
that it's a cool phone it's got
everything edge screen as well as yes
that's right yet to can't forget that's
good it's got it's got everything it's
got all the bells and whistles
everything that if I see us bc
everything that I can do is in the note
7 yeah question is what does it mean for
samsung what is the larger what's the
bigger picture stuff with the note 7
well I me know your thoughts rich yeah
like you say i have to admit the first
time that a phone has come along that's
made me go oh that's got everything and
i think it's really cool the the samsung
is actually doing well now they've had
their first kind of growth for I think
two years and yeah strongest earnings in
two years fueled by sales of the s7 and
the s7 edge and this is basically the s7
edge only with some cool new stuff in it
so it looks looks pretty good for
samsung I mean that is encouraging if I
had to worry about the note 7 it would
be the price because if you look at what
rival phone makers like Huawei or even
like tiny tiny companies like 1 plus
have been doing they've been making sort
of equivalently powerful phones but for
a fraction of the price way way cheaper
hmm but I would say the design probably
gives a bit of an edge no pun intended
as well over over things from my way and
one plus at least for now so yeah the
price I'm concerned about the price as a
little too expensive but then as you say
Samsung has had a lot of success with
its flagship phones it hasn't sort of
done this race to the bottom thing kind
of chasing out the you know the lower
end mobiles yeah and i read that the the
s7 edge was the most popular Android
phone in the first half of the year the
note 7 it does everything the edge does
and it's only slightly bigger and you
think half they killed the edge they've
edged out the arrow edged out the edge
yeah they've blunted the edge I mean
what does that
think they'll get rid of the edge line I
know I wouldn't have thought so I mean
it has to be said actually that kind of
scale that even though it is only I
think it's 5.7 versus 5.5 inches but
even at that kind of even that's
relatively small gap will actually make
a difference when it's the line of your
trews that you've gotta be thinking
about so yeah it can make a difference
but yeah I mean they're obviously still
going to be both a very popular phones
maybe the like you say the price is
going to be the deciding factor you know
we really like the s7 s7 edge is fun the
the sort of curved screen stuff it's a
little gimmicky burn it it's kind of
cool and you know it does make the
phones look and feel a little bit
different to everything else is out
there yeah I serve I feel with that like
the with that we weren't sure about the
s-pen to start with with the notes and
there are a couple of years where it is
like where you can write on it that's
great but now on the on the the new note
7 there's a few features with the S Pen
like you can write a memo and you can
pin it to the you know you can write
pretty on pretty much everything you can
you can including underwater including
underwater so it kind of feels like that
the S pen's coming into its own so maybe
the edge screen when they've you know
after a couple of years maybe that's
going to come into its own with like the
way you actually use it in the how it
works yeah we might we might see that
evolve as well so it seems like the note
which always work to me represented the
sort of weird like experimental branch
of Samsung phones is now sort of being
brought into the fold path of one of the
proper family so they were both pretty
positive would be interesting if it does
anyway we are we've got loads more on
the note 7 on cnet and we want to know
what you guys think as well so do you
get in touch and let us know right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
