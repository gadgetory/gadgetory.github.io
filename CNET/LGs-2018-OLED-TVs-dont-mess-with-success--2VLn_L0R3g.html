at CES 2018 with LG and we're looking at
their new OLED lineup this is the w8
behind me it's their highest and OLED
organic light-emitting diode television
for 2018 we've really liked these TVs in
the past they provide excellent picture
quality the best we've ever tested the
w8 is one of the coolest looking TVs
we've actually introduced last year this
really thin wallpaper form factors look
at it from the side it just blends right
into the wall the sound bar here at the
bottom but the TV itself is just
consists of this panel that kind of just
sits on the wall very flush very cool
design LG also has an e8 display which
has a redesign stand this year there's a
thicker chunk at the bottom that's
transparent a really nice slick display
again very thin but not quite as thin as
the wallpaper changes this year the LG
has made or not drastic the companies
went ahead mainly on the Smart TV side
and added Google assistant into its
normal Smart TV system so you can pick
up the remote and ask for things on
Google assistant for example search
shows ask for actors another thing you
can do with Google assistant is use it
for to control smart home appliances LG
actually has its think IQ series of
smart home technology vacuum cleaners
washer dryers that sort of thing that
you can control using the TV's built-in
smart assistant system so that's the big
addition LG has also made some tweaks to
picture quality this year that are a
little bit less they still have the same
black levels the same brightness and the
same color as last year but this year
they did add a different video
processing it's called the Alpha 9
processor LG says it introduced
artifacts like noise and banding get the
picture a little bit better looking
although already it was really superb so
I'm curious to see in the lab how much
better that processing actually looks
that's a quick look at LG's 2018 OLED TV
lineup and here with the w 8 and e 8
there's other TVs in the series that
cost a little bit less we'll get full
pricing availability later this year
