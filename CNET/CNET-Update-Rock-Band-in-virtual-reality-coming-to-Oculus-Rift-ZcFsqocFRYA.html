virtual reality I'm Bridget Carey this
is your cnet update when rock band first
came out in 2007 the idea was that you
could feel like you're rock stars your
smash buttons on plastic instruments but
if you really want to feel like you're
rocking out on stage soon you could play
in virtual reality rock band the game
will be playable on the oculus rift
headset by March of next year the
announcement was made at the game awards
show Thursday by palmer luckey he's the
co-founder of oculus VR and he teased on
Twitter that he had a big announcement
to make at the show but fans were hoping
for something bigger like a price or
release date on when they can actually
buy an oculus rift because people don't
even know how much this headset is going
to cost although some insiders are
estimating that VR headsets could be as
much as a new console maybe around three
hundred and fifty dollars we also don't
know the price or exact release dates of
other high-end virtual reality headsets
that are getting buzz like HTC vive and
Sony's PlayStation VR right now
companies are just teasing a few games
because well we'll need to see some good
games to want to spend the money on this
stuff and content is a big factor in
getting VR to grow google just released
an app for android to help people make
some very basic 360 degree photos that
can be viewed in VR with Google
cardboard that's a super cheap VR
headset that uses your phone the new
cardboard camera app helps you stitch
together panoramic still photos with a
3d look and it records audio so you can
get the feeling that you're standing
still in one moment in time there are no
images above and below you and 360
photos aren't exactly true virtual
reality experiences but it is one way
Google is trying to get people to build
content at least in baby steps problem
is you can't share photos you'll have to
lend someone your phone and a cardboard
viewer to see it but if you don't need
your photos and video to be in a third
dimension you may be interested in the
news on GoPro because the action cam
maker slashed the price of the
cube-shaped hero4 session camera to half
of what it cost when it went on sale
just five months ago
originally was four hundred dollars that
it went down to three hundred in
September and now it's two hundred
dollars apparently the cube was a tough
sell at its original price when the
hero4 silver model had many more
features and better quality for the same
price makes you feel bad for anyone that
paid four hundred dollars when it first
came out that's it for this technique is
update and there's more at cnet com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
