you look at it and it recognizes you
nothing has ever been simpler more
natural and effortless we call this face
ID to make face ID possible took some of
the most advanced technology we have
ever created and much of it is packed
right up here into this tiny little area
at the top of the display we call this
the true depth camera system and it is
made up of incredible state-of-the-art
technology there's an infrared camera a
flood illuminator the front side camera
and a dot projector and that's not all
there's also the proximity sensor the
ambient light sensor the speaker
microphone all packed into this true
depth camera system area it is amazing
and here's how it works every time you
glance at your iPhone 10 it detects your
face with the flood a new illuminator
even in the dark the IR camera takes an
IR image the dot projector projects out
over 30,000 invisible IR dots we use the
IR image in the dot pattern and we push
them through neural networks to create a
mathematical model of your face and then
we check that mathematical model against
the one that we've stored that you set
up earlier to see if to match and unlock
your phone and this all happens in real
time it all happens invisibly you don't
see these things going off it's
incredible it just all works it all
happens when you set up face ID you just
follow the on-screen instructions and it
tells you how to move your head around
in the camera so fess ID can recognize
your face and that's it you do that once
when you set it up and face ID learns
your face even if you change your
hairstyle you decide to put on glasses
you're wearing a hat so you do it up
anyway you do it
base ID learns your face it learns who
you are and it adapts to you as your
face changes over time let's say you
start to grow a beard it works in day it
works at night
and the data for touch ID has been 1 in
50,000 meaning that the chance that a
random person could use their
fingerprint to unlock your iPhone has
been about 1 in 50,000 and it's been
great so what are the similar statistics
for face ID one in a million</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
