with CNN and I'm standing us to
Samsung's at UNF 6300 this is sort of a
mid-range TV and Samsung's extensive LED
TV lineup for 2013 this is a 55 inch
version this TV is available from sizes
32 all the way up to 60 inches so it's a
pretty extensive series the 6300 one of
the least expensive Samsung TVs to offer
its full smart TV sweet we're going to
get to that a little bit but it's also
one of the least expensive with this
relatively sleek edge lit LED styling so
Samsung's TV is really thin and you look
at it from the side that's what that
edge lit design gives you it's also
really thin around the edge of the
screen so you don't have very much to
the cabinet at all except for the
picture there's also Samsung's trademark
spider stand here it allows a swivel and
it's colored quite a bit lighter than
this TV itself all told one of the nicer
looking TVs in this price range aside
from the design the real selling point
of the 6300 is its feature set starting
with Smart TV this has my favorite smart
TV sweet of 2013 among all the
manufacturers samsung ranges it's smart
TV in a series of five different pages
the first one called on TV actually sort
of tries to replace your cable box so
this TV has a little ir dongle that can
shoot commands to your cable box and
integrate the program listings subject
to your locality so you can type in
exactly where you live and you get
customized listings depending on your
cable or satellite provider it works
relatively well in fact it works a
little bit better than on some of the
higher-end models that's because Samsung
6300 includes a standard remote control
that has all the buttons that I like to
use for DVR including transport you also
get the dedicated button to call up the
guide from your cable box as well as the
cable boxes menus so pretty good system
overall the rest of the smart TV suite
is very well designed it's nice and
simple this year Samsung has more apps
than pretty much anybody else including
exclusive on HBO GO of course there's
also plenty of standard on-demand
sources including netflix amazon and
pretty much everything else the 6300
also offers plenty of ways to adjust the
picture there's a full DJ Durkin troll
so you can dial in just the right amount
of smoothness which in my opinion should
be zero there's also excellent control
of color and pretty much every other
picture parameter connectivity is very
good with four
HDMI ports three USB and an analog input
overall the picture quality 6 300 is
pretty good although it's not among the
best tvs at its price point its main
weakness is the inability to display a
nice deep shade of black so you know
some of the other LED TVs out there it's
level of black is a little bit lighter
than those other so you get less cut pop
and contrast especially in the early
dark scenes on the flip side we
appreciated most of the other aspects of
the samsung's picture including
excellent color accuracy the set also
has relatively good uniformity so there
aren't any bright spots on our review
sample video processing is among the
best we've seen at any price point this
TV holds up well in a brightly lit room
overall the Samsung 6300 represents a
pretty good value especially if you'd
like it's smart TV perks I'm David Katz
