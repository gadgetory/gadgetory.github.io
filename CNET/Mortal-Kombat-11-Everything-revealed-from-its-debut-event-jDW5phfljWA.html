no match for skill the wait is over we
just got our very first hands-on look at
Mortal Kombat a--let's at an event
developer NetherRealm held for fans and
media alike the studio showcased some of
the new systems characters and gameplay
mechanics coming to this year's highly
anticipated fighting game one of the
newest things that we're offering this
time is the ability for character
customization and MKX we introduced the
concept of character variations but
those were kind of set in stone now
we're handing all that control back to
the player and they're able to make
their specific variations exactly how
they want
Mortal Kombat 11 combines the character
customization of its predecessor that
the gear system found in other realms
prior title and justice two players can
pick between character variations or
create their own for a personally
tailored experience so the gear that you
get throughout the game and stuff like
that it's a cosmetic only piece so the
gear like the mask that scorpion wears
or the spear of the store those are
cosmetic only piece and then other loot
that drops through the game is called
augments and through those augments you
can SWAT those into each piece of gear
to give yourself different static
bandages we were able to see a total of
seven characters that include Scorpion
and sub-zero along with a mix of
familiar mortal combat fighters and
newcomers mk9 scarlet is back as his fan
favorite Baraka Raiden's now a bit more
surly going by dark Raiden and new
character Gareth controls both time and
sand in combat and in a surprise
announcement WWE and a former UFC star
Ronda Rousey is providing the voice for
Sonya Blade poisoning a character has
been really different and really
interesting and fun because I don't have
to think about how I look and only about
how I sound Sonya Blade calling in air
support
as for the gameplay itself series
mastermind edy boom showed off several
significant changes to Mortal Kombat 11s
fighting systems instead of a single
meter allowing players to enhance their
moves
there are now two meters one for
offensive and one for defensive
maneuvers a new comeback mechanic has
been added to the game with players
getting what NetherRealm calls a fatal
blow once they are down to 30% health it
does significant damage but it can also
grant your opponent their own fatal blow
in the process nether realm also
presented a story prologue from Mortal
Kombat 11 with boom promising a bunch of
time-travel hijinks with characters
meeting their younger selves master
manipulators getting mad at ratings
blocks and of course cinematics filled
with war
and yes
Mortal Kombat 11 story is a canon
continuation of previous games in the
franchise
blood is a mask trust me I'm not your
type
well this is a continuation of our 26
years story arc and we're really excited
to kind of show the next installment of
where the story ends meaning really
encouraged me to check it out because I
wish I could share more about the story
but it's really exciting where it's
headed
Mortal Kombat 11 will hit stores April
23rd with a beta launching March 28th
for those who pre-order the game will be
available on ps4 Xbox one PC and the
switch though we haven't seen the switch
version in action
oops
yet again will your gang you've chosen
the wrong destiny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
