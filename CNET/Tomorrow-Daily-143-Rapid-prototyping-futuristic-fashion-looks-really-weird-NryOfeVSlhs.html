micro thrusters for satellites we all
know we can play netflix on our Xbox and
ps4 s and all that but now you can play
netflix on your Nintendo Entertainment
System the NES old-school and rapid
prototyping is a new way we might see
future fashion created you're gonna look
sexy
tomorrow Daley
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily bestie talks
on their own universe where science
facts and science fiction there it is
crash into each other load bring it back
easy all right all the best things iPod
I'm your host Ashley scared Ramiz always
kill anonymous I'm your kill animus yes
that is true well yeah that's I think
that's ultimately you said that dude a
and it really sums it up yeah it does it
what is it what is it again we're
science really the kids in science fact
we're sign specializing in fact but it
also just seems like I feel like someone
has said that before like many times
like this is like sort of a phrase
people like to use maybe we would like
more science fiction and science fact oh
I got it I got it are you ready
we're science fiction in science fun
collide can we use that no fine science
fun all right you know what then uh
we're just you know I don't want to talk
to you let's hit the headlines
I feel worried science okay crying all
right yeah what do you got just want to
be positive Cael okay so one of the
challenges of satellite smaller
satellites up in space is that you
cannot really control them in terms of
like they have no propulsion you can't
tell them to change the certain
direction anything like that and in the
vacuum of space I mean obviously just
they just kind of float there so if you
have anything especially using like
maybe a camera or a sensor you really
kind of need it to do what you needed to
do and move in specific direction so
this MIT alum and her name is Natalia
Brickner
she's an aeronautics and Astronautics
alumnus from MIT so she's very smart
like about eight times smarter than both
of us combined she started a company
called accion systems and they have
developed a device called max one and
it's a tiny what they're calling an
electrospray propulsion system here's
how it works so this is actually inside
a vacuum like their they've attached
these proposals these propulsion sort of
bases to a CubeSat which we'll get to
that so but that's what you're seeing on
the screen right now so how it works is
there's a reservoir tank that has liquid
salt propellant in it and then there are
these chips and the chips are actually
the size of a penny they're tiny okay
and they have 500 pointed tips
underneath like on the underside of them
that soaks up the liquid salt propellant
and then there are on top of the base
there's a bunch of little tiny holes so
when it soaks up that liquid salt
propellant then the end they run an
electrical current through it they have
a whole bunch of charged ions happening
and what happens then the charged ions
rocket out of the teeny tiny little
holes on each of these little chips and
propels whatever device is attached to
in the opposite direction all right
little tank propulsion devices yeah
exactly
Micro it's like micro propulsion their
little thrusters tiny thrusters all
right okay so um so brick
this this woman she's saying that the
thrust on these things are they had
eight of them attached there was enough
to move the device around a sheet of
paper here on earth oh but here's the
crazy thing so that's not a lot here but
in space a little bit of propulsion goes
a really long way right so you get the
ball rolling right so they test it out
in a vacuum which is this and they were
able to produce a hundred micro Newton's
of force per square meter and that might
not sound like a whole lot to people
like us who have no idea what we would
be doing in aeronautics whatsoever
yeah but the great thing is is according
to the report and this is a quote it's
enough to stabilize a CubeSat launch
from the ISS and to compensate for
atmospheric drag so it's enough to get
stuff done perfect and that's the
important in a very small package yes
okay cool
they're gonna start making them in July
and then they're gonna ship them to
people by the end of 2015
are they really expensive I mean I mean
I don't assume you'd know that yeah
they're really small so that might
actually keep the cost down did you just
poop a phone I'm so excited
Paul yeah no that's cool that it's
really cool and so yeah I think this is
really neat and I really like that this
alumnus like got out of college was like
you know what I'm making a difference
here here it is here's what I'm gonna do
I'm starting a company small change
leaves the big thing exactly exactly
right so um so you were talking about
yes it okay so this is this is a fun
article this little article zombie a fun
one so basically we all know that we can
watch netflix on practically any of the
newer consoles pretty much yeah you can
watch it on you the original Nintendo
Entertainment System oh boy NES this is
called darkness now every year Netflix
has like a hackathon where everybody
comes on these unique ways to interact
with Netflix and whatnot what you're
looking at is a extremely pared down
version of Netflix it is a 8-bit version
of netflix so the images look terrible
you're scrolling through just text but
this was made by Netflix employees a guy
at Sierra know Alex Wolff and Karina
motion the whole name
yeah so as you can see there's they're
showing house of cards they're scrolling
through that and they're about to play
this house of cards I can't wait to see
how it is Wow we go bad house of cards
you can barely make it out what a drunk
nice 56k right yeah 256 K now basically
what this is is it's not a mod for the
NES okay so they didn't like no it's a
modded out cartridge that they put in
yeah so so basically on the cartridge
you can't make it at home yeah it's all
good no I'm sorry guys wait a second
it's not working hold on and they tapped
on it a little bit and then they blew of
the cartridge and then they put then
they kind of like very gently press down
and then they're like okay it's working
don't move anybody
Oh for the hero so you watch terrible
Netflix game genie or at Netflix so this
is this is obviously pretty cool it's
all free obviously just pretty awesome
I'll larf you know anymore but it's it's
it's really it's really fun to see that
pared down version to kind of get a
perspective of it's fine that's going no
do they make other cool things yes I was
about to say that I so they did come out
with some other stuff including an app
called say what in which you can you can
pause the video a part of the video and
then I'll show you what they said oh I
like that
hold on my favorite one is the last one
okay they have an animated glow showing
real-time playback activity around the
globe so what people are watching around
the globe and then lastly a tool dual
pane protection that that you can put on
a specific series so your significant
other can't get ahead of you on a series
and watch it without you
oh that clever if you're watching house
of cards you know like oh there's no way
I'm gonna let my girlfriend watch
anymore like get ahead cheat on another
if you're just series cheating you're
binge cheating you can't do that so
that's pretty you have to put in like -
pew we had a pin and then your she would
get a pin and then it's like to do it
you it's like nuclear codes
yeah one and two all right I got it
so that's perfect but that brings us to
our hashtag of the day which is TD rig
do you want to know what's the craziest
streaming video hack you can think of oh
man there's some good one okay well I
want you to go ahead and TV Rick what do
you got I think streaming video hack
like I would love I would love a
streaming video hack where you could
like
this is I like I really want this so bad
where you can like pause a scene and
like tap on people's clothes in a show
and then on the side it would tell you
exactly where you can buy it and how
much you buy it right there that's
actually really like I want that there's
there's websites that do this where it's
like you know what like how do I find
that on TV or whatever it is where it's
like and they work really hard and they
put together these really awesome like
roundup so like here's all the things
you can buy like in stores that
characters more on this show or whatever
but like I want to do it in real time
while I'm watching TV so maybe it's a
second screen experience maybe it's like
I'm watching Netflix on my television I
have my iPad or my phone or whatever and
then like during the scene I can
literally press pause and then my iPad
shows the scene and it's like what are
you interested in and you tap on
whatever it is whether it's clothes and
some kind of gadget like whatever and
then it tells you like this is what it
is here's how much it cost it would you
like to buy it but I want that that's
pretty great that's what I want
actually I wouldn't mind I wouldn't mind
some like reaction type stuff like have
you ever seen any of those Japanese
shows where they where they have people
like reacting and they're like oh sure
and pictures yeah I love that I would
love some of those and you could pick
like whether it be like a celebrity
that's watching his own content his or
her own content or like my friends and
it like was light like a live feed of my
friends like a record like if I watch
unbreakable kimmy schmitt and I'm
watching it I laugh then somebody it
records it and sometimes actually I love
this for like like Game of Thrones where
like you can actually check directors
commentary you can choose reaction
commentary so it's like internet
reaction and you just pick it and then
basically anybody who has that like
option enabled what it would be
recording your reactions to shows and
then it would you would see the
picture-in-picture change like based on
people's like craziest reactions so it's
like during certain scenes you just see
people like screaming and crying this
sounds like the coolest and the most
annoying feature ever people gonna be
like I don't like the record smooth
while I'm doing it fun don't really
don't instant don't make this Netflix
thank you though yeah hack
but don't actually show teeny rig what
what the craziest streaming video hack
you can think of so those in our idea
yeah
twitter twitter at us or put it in the
youtube comments and we'll we'll check
that out alright you'll be then you'll
be tomorrow daily famous TV famous get
you now you can try and drop your name
and like out a TGI Fridays straight and
fries curly curly string maybe yeah and
maybe an accidental curly um so I gotta
tell you about this rapid prototyping
it's really cool the pictures are like
insane I love fashion super into this
yeah super new fashion it's Fashion Week
right now we just saw Zoolander walk the
runway is a Fashion Week at Valentino's
runway show in Fashion Week in Paris so
this is from an Italian manufacturer and
they actually make Footwear molds and
other tools that you would use to like
create clothes and stuff so it's they're
they're not actually a like a fashion
house okay
so they're more of like a tools
prototyping kind of molds place yeah so
they've come up with what they're
calling rapid prototyping and they have
they're saying they have the ability to
offer a line of items with realistic
prototypes that are built in hours as
opposed to like weeks to develop like
prototypes of stuff oh okay so there
were six items in this line collection
that they have I don't think I'll be
wearing that it so they had a bustier
which is what you're seeing right now
which is kind of crazy they also had a
about to my birthday party
they had three pairs of shoes a bracelet
and a handbag okay so these were all
concept it like they were all a concept
within an hour right and then hours
hours so it's like basically these were
all designed prototypes and 3d printed
within like a very short period of time
compared to what you would normally and
like these shoes are so cool can you
imagine once this is available to you
and you're like I gotta go to data
whatever and you can download blueprints
and you're like I need some shoes I like
those shoes I'm not gonna order on
Amazon I'm gonna make them or you go
like me I love those but maybe I want
them in a different color and then they
just print out like whatever color you
want so and this would work with your
Netflix thing you could be like I like
look at that
Margot Robbie's wearing that is
incredible print me out that shoe right
now yes so these are some of the shoes
okay so most of these are a little
fashion apart but I love these Oxford's
with like these crazy
it's like 3d printed so these are all so
this is an existing shoe right there but
then they've added 3d printed on to this
so what they were saying is and this is
what I thought was the most interesting
part about this is they're able to make
these in one single print using mixed
materials so both rigid and soft
material especially with the shoes so
it's not just like hard plastic like
we've seen like hard plastic bangles or
you know like that top that we were
looking at like it's it's hard material
so that there's structure but then it's
also soft so that you can wear it
against your skin and if you turn it's
not gonna like be like a Kate like
you're wearing a cage yeah exactly
exactly like that everybody at the party
so usually you would have pieced
together hard and soft materials after
making them you put them together
manually this not the case they're able
to sort of use both so whether they made
shoes they made purses they made three
pairs of shoes a bracelet a handbag and
that bustier okay so there was a six
item line of clothing just to be able to
show like here's what we can do it's
called rapid prototyping we're able to
like let's say you come to us and say I
want to make this and it's got this and
this and I want to see what the
prototype looks like like right now and
then you can make those quick changes on
the fly and reprint a new one so it's
not gonna take like weeks to get go back
and forth between designer and
manufacturer like all these different
things there's such a huge process and
like making these clothes and I'm the
shoes and things like that so so they're
gonna make this they're just it's I
think they're hoping that fashion houses
will pick up on this and sort of maybe
try it out I think they should make a
consumer version I would like a
consumers I wait I just I'm waiting for
the day where I can walk into a store
because I'm really tall I'm I'm a little
6 feet tall you guys and for me when I
go shopping it's like nothing ever fits
me right I never feel like anything fits
me right and I go in and it's like I
might find a t-shirt but it's too short
like it's just too short because I have
a long torso or like my jeans are too
long because it's like I buy them in
long cuz I'm tall but they're way too
long so it's like I always have problems
with this and I would love to be able to
walk into a store and be like I love
this dress just adjust it by this much
in this much and then just 3d print it
for me I'll be
back in a couple hours and to pick it up
and I'm done I'm all-in
I'm all-in I like that whole share
system do you remember like in clueless
when cher had that little thing well
they had we saw that it at CES we saw
something really similar to that there
was a guy I loved this like older
gentleman he's probably in his 50s and
he was like wearing like dresses and
like part cute little like lady parkas
because that's what they had there it
was so funny and he was just enjoying
sexy yeah he was just enjoying himself
he's having a great time so anyway we
are gonna take a quick break we will be
right back with another round of into it
because it's the end of the week and
then of course we have your user
feedback your TV first feedback your
first person sports feedback that we got
a couple days ago because I messed
things up and then of course we have our
phone talker for the day so don't click
away it's tomorrow daily also watch this
welcome back to the show it's Thursday
and as always we like to tell you on
Thursdays
what we're really into this week and
hopefully you'll find it just as
interesting and obsessive as we do so
this is into it are you starting do you
want to go first or do you want me to go
first
oh I'll go you want to go first oh all
right all right so um this morning the
Austen geek the often warship Nathan
Fillion and Alan Tudyk yeah uh of
Firefly Fame launched an IndieGoGo this
morning oh really
for a web series that they would like to
make called conman okay okay let me just
run the story of the show by you and see
if it sounds a little familiar
okay so alan tudyk scare achter is a man
who was on a very popular yet
short-lived science-fiction series on
television that was abruptly canceled
too soon
and he now spends his time at
conventions like signing autographs and
doing booth stuff you know and and then
one of the guys from the show Nathan
Fillion 'he's character has become a
huge star a huge star after this science
fiction show and and so the story is
that it's they talk about like the old
show they were on and all this stuff so
they're doing this IndieGoGo to like
produce this series apparently it's
gonna be very funny that's what they say
they're saying it's gonna be very funny
but that story sounds super familiar
right yeah like I feel like I've almost
I feel like maybe we've heard it
somewhere before but I just I can't I
can't put my finger on it or maybe it's
exactly Firefly yeah I think I think I
love that well I mean if you're they're
not getting we're not getting Firefly
we're just not getting Firefly back but
she did say this is the easiest way to
get us bolt back into a spaceship
together that was their word yeah
they're really playing and are they're
really hitting our heartstrings here but
so part of this video is alan tudyk
going and saying i wrote this script to
people like Seth Green Felicia Day James
Gunn yeah they all wrote on the same
circuit they all run the same circles
so he's going around saying I wrote this
trip all blah so these people have all I
guess committed to like appearing in the
show which is very funny oh this will
definitely get funded it's doing very
well they want they're hoping for I
think they were saying like four hundred
and seventy-five thousand
they'll get that a good run of episodes
and and I just I find this adorable yeah
and when they said because a lot of the
criticism this morning on it was oh well
you guys are big stars why don't you go
like thunder yourself like you go to any
studio and get it funded and they said
you know uh maybe we have trust issues
but sci-fi series on a network we maybe
feel a little weird about that now like
so it was kind of so meta I've never
like this pull it out of your pocket
like you guys are so rich whatever make
it well that's not fair if you don't
want the show you have a problem with
them kind of money that way don't fund
it yeah but a lot of people are funding
it like people are going crazy about
this right now but I I just want to say
I just they're right in kudos you I do
too I do too
I charge Talent it exciting I do too
there's a lot of really good character -
yeah he's and he's such a nice guy like
I've met him a couple of times that like
conferences and something he's so nice
like I've never remember in a time where
I'm like oh that guy was like less nice
than I thought he would be like he's
always more nice and so he deserves it
like this is a cool series I think it's
funny
they said I love the tag line it was
like con man and then it's like because
convention man didn't sound as exciting
or something like that I got I just love
it I like I like what they're doing and
I I'm a big fan of you know their work
and everything and I love Firefly and
they're doing the right what you know
thing because they all know about
conventions right they know that life it
is a cookie cookie world it is so yeah I
guess if I guess if you're interested
you want to see what it's about that I
guess you can go check out the yeah if
you just look up if you to IndieGoGo
it's like we have to did you give any
money yeah I'm gonna give oh I don't
know how much I can give them because I
just bought the pancake bot I just back
the pancake bot but I could kick him a
couple bucks okay
so can't really do it more about
pancakes and you do a button it's a
filly of it I want to be able to enjoy
it let the record show let the record
show that I bought I'm gonna make
delicious beautiful pancakes
the shape of alan tudyk face so that i
can eat it while i whilst i watch con
man you're welcome
sweet world continue you become what see
what are you into this week eating
celebrity faces of course no I do this
thing we're all find it's it's it's very
rare there's a lot of good subreddits
out there talk about subreddits but
every now and then i'll find the one
where i'll just fall into a complete and
complete love with it and then for a
week just I can't stop interacting with
it this week it's commercial cuts
commercial cuts is basically people take
commercials ok any second commercials
that are just like whatever is selling
an ad and they'll somehow edit it to
make it actually a joke so they recut
them they'll recut them for humor
purposes ok I've got one for you we have
an example right there's a lot of them
and but we had to be very selective
here's what about somebody's are dark
that yeah they always take a turn so
here we go here's this one hey we made
your own lunch
yeah I'm so proud of you
the bus is here gotta go mom okay honey
have a great day look in your bag made
you something it's more than just that
great peanut taste choosing Jeff is a
simple way to show someone how much you
care
but anyway if you have that same sort of
sick sense of humor as I do there's a
lot of really good ones on there there's
one that I'm obsessed with called the
book which is a Toyota Corolla one
Howard gets really surreal it's really
weird but salesmen showing these to us
like all day today and there you have to
have a dark sense of humor about them
like most of them are extremely dark
they all take like really weird morbid
turns most of them but yeah
right up my alley because I'm a weirdo
so they're I love them
yeah hopefully you enjoy those but yeah
that's that's what I'm into commercial
guts stuff so they go well from what
we're into to what you're into it's time
for your user feedback all right so we
asked you guys where you just I don't
anyway we asked you guys I don't even
want to know what you're doing over
there we asked you guys two days ago to
use that Shakti D first to tell us what
first-person like what would you want to
see broadcast and first-person like
what's the thing you want to watch right
you said surgeries like a surgery like a
weirdo um
so Tyler wrote to us and said TD first
conventions like CES where they have
hands-on experiences and maybe
gymnastics I like that that was the that
was the side that's a really good way of
but like the experiencing everything
experiencing like a convention you can't
go to or something like that be cool
okay
Neil wrote in and said mix it with
oculus and go spelunking or deep-sea
diving I have a massive fear of the
unknown this would help beat it I see
and that's a good idea where it's like
if you have a phobia
maybe you overcome like Heights or you
would use it with the oculus yeah and
somebody maybe skydive so it's like
first-person look we have like some
GoPro stuff like that so but um but I
don't think it would make me any less
afraid of spiders to be spiders like
you're this big living in a huge nest of
spine I would be like oh yeah now I get
it they're all night
they're all super cool okay that one's
name is Jan okay Ali wrote to us and
said samurai fights like Coach like the
samurai fights it's pretty good I like
that I like that word
and we're also this apparently we're
taking a time machine yeah we also go
back in we also go back in time because
Justin Roden said medieval jousting or
sword fighting right so also with that
oh the Black Plague I'd love to see that
in first person but you know wouldn't
experience a to just be streaming oh
that's okay crucifixion of Jesus Christ
all these terrible things that way to
bring the room down kill wasn't me
listen to bring the room back up Frank
wrote in to us and said I want NASA to
put a 4k camera on their astronauts
while they're doing the spacewalk and on
an eagle while flying yeah I like those
inspirational like a 4k camera on the
spacewalk like that would be really fun
to be able to put on an oculus and like
it's like if you could put in a camera
and like their helmet like a helmet cam
and you could actually live watch them
do their spacewalks like really slowly
you'd be like moving really slow I might
ask the shirt on for the exact reason
all right and then of course we have our
very last piece of user feedback we are
delirious which is our phone tire for
the day
I think I think the thing is that our
NASA like walk in was really boring it
is we're like can you imagine if you're
skipping around in the video and you got
right to that point you're like I'm
gonna die boredom but are they doing
better go back to what done with the
side of this
alright guys our phone Tiger for the day
today is Sarah hot and he took this
picture with his iPhone 6 and he said
this is Sarah hot from Istanbul love
watching your show from my Apple TV
every evening this year we had lots of
snow in here so I got to ski a lot
here's a few photos that I took with my
iPhone 6 each from different mountains
hope you like it for one of the phone
tog refer of the day the iPhone 6 still
has the best camera it's pretty good I I
think that would be really bright and it
also has the the flirt sorry I'm about
to bite I'm about to buy a new phone
we've been talking about phone cameras
Oh
Samsung gets close but the the one thing
that I did I don't like about Samsung
cameras is it gets really they kind of
like slightly over saturate it through
the the camera software yeah so it's
like when you take a picture it's not it
doesn't look as real some people like
that though some people like it just
slightly above like a little
oversaturated so that you have that
richness and they don't have to edit it
they feel like oh ok it doesn't need to
be edited right I get that like I
totally understand the appeal to that
and like I know a lot of people who love
their Galaxy phones because of that
because they're like oh the pictures
look so rich and vibrant I don't have to
do anything to them
but for me it's like I prefer these sort
of real very close to realistic tones
yeah and then that way if I want to up
the saturation I can I'm like an app so
but if not what sir had great that's a
photo yeah totally love it I like the
light on the end I don't - yeah he said
it a few and I this one was my favorite
so um I think it ripped do you think he
ripped down that mountain do you think
he like shredded yeah I definitely think
he was skiing or snowboarding I think he
was skiing but I want to say can I say
what I think would make that picture
just like just slightly better than no
okay does anyone remember ski free for
Microsoft oh no the little monster guy
oh that would be perfect let's just add
him right in there cuz I feel like that
it's just it's just off of purpose it's
so close to perfect but ski free monster
