social networking presence on your
Android phone then you might want
Facebook home for Android I'm Jessica
doll court for cnet this is your first
look now facebook home is not an
operating system it is an app that skins
your home screens you can download it
through google play for several phones
or it might come pre-loaded on your
phone as with this HTC first right here
facebook calls the photos and status
updates that you see march across your
screen cover feed and from these screens
you can like picture or status and you
can comment as well images auto scroll
on their own you can advance them
manually as well and you can adjust the
image quality and refresh rate in the
settings there are other ways you can
navigate around as well if you tap your
own profile picture you can launch the
messenger open your app tray or return
to the last app that you had open since
facebook home does sit on top of android
you're able to access every other bit of
Android as well for example if you want
to open your apps you can either tap the
home screen button or you can swipe up
from the bottom what you see is an app
launcher there are shortcuts to all the
apps that you want you can drag and drop
apps on or off if you want to remove
them you can have as many app launcher
pages as you want to see a full list of
apps you swipe over to the left and
you've got a vertical list right there
from the launcher you can update your
facebook status check into a location
and upload photos through a specific
Facebook uploader tool chat heads is the
same as your facebook Messenger but you
can chat through Facebook or through SMS
with your contacts circular icons of
your friends profile pictures pop up
when they chat with you and from there
you'll be able to drag them all over the
screen and interact with them to close
it you simply swipe the chat head away
if you have multiple chat heads open you
can stack them up to conserve space and
expand them out and you can close them
one at a time or as a stack facebook
home takes over your lock screen by
default so that when you wake up the
phone home is the first thing you see
however you can change this in the
settings and you can have your regular
lock screen as well facebook home is
also really easy to turn off and turn
back on again if you change your mind
and you want us
found it for a little bit although there
are no ads on Facebook home right now
CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that is the
plan for the future to start monetizing
the feature I personally wouldn't use
Facebook home on my regular Android
phone but there are some things that I
like about it I really like chat heads
for example and I wish that Android
which is take that implementation and
that we can see it on all phones it's
really useful handy and clever I also
think would be really nice to be able to
update your status and take photos
directly from cover feed on facebook
code so that's something I hope they'll
implement in the future facebook home is
obviously for people who love facebook
you want to interact with their friends
the second they turn on their phone it's
free to download and use however so if
you think you might like it you won't
lose anything by trying it out I'm
