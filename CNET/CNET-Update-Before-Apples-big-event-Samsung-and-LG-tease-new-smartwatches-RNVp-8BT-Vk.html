Apple is rumored to have one everyone
loses their minds I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update in less than
two weeks on September 9th apple is
having an event where it will likely
reveal the iphone 6 apple made it
official with a cryptic invite that said
wish we could say more uh-huh well it's
also possible that Apple could use that
event to reveal something that you wear
on your wrist perhaps an iWatch this has
other tech companies in complete panic
because in what seems like desperation
Samsung and LG have announced new smart
watches even though each just released a
SmartWatch in July maybe if they throw
more models at us something will stick
to our wrists since September of last
year's Samsung has given birth to the
Galaxy gear the gear to the gear 2 neo
the gear fit and the gear live but its
newest pride and joy is the gear s2
Samsung's credit the gear s is the first
SmartWatch that is not an accessory it
doesn't depend on a smartphone to work
because it has its own sim card with a
3g wireless connection that means it
needs a data plan it has a 2 inch curved
screen a front button and a changeable
band it's not running Android it's
Samsung's own operating system called
Tizen and it's packed with sensors
including a gps pulse reader and UV
monitor so in case you're worried about
getting too much Sun this thing will
warn you to stay indoors to play more
candy crush LG didn't want to feel left
out of the SmartWatch mania so it's also
doing an early tease for its new LG G
watch are the R stands for round this
will run Android wear and it features a
stainless steel frame with little
watched notches that are etched in there
is also a changeable leather band it
will have a heart rate monitor but
unlike the gear s it needs to have a
Bluetooth connection with an android
phone to do anything price and
availability for both of these watches
have not been revealed yet because the
companies just want to get this news out
before everyone starts talking about
Apple will get an up-close view of these
watches at the IFA tech conference next
week and we'll also get to check out
Samsung's
new high-tech necklace headphone hybrid
it's called the gear circle the
bluetooth headphones can be worn as a
necklace when you're not listening to
anything and there's another new type of
tech to be unveiled next week from Dyson
the company released this teaser video
hinting that they have created a robot
vacuum cleaner where you can see dysons
take on the Roomba on Thursday September
fourth and of course that's the same day
we get to learn about another SmartWatch
the Moto 360 that's your tech news
