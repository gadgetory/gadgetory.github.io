and is now arriving in the hands of
consumers this is our box that we
ordered over here and this is what
you'll be getting if you ordered one so
let's see what's in the box and this is
what you want to check out tells me that
it's the Galaxy s8 in orchid grey
nothing too fancy about the box kind of
similar to what we've seen in other
models open on this side so that you can
take the first look this is not the s8
plus this is the regular has a little
bit of a lilac tint to it
which I like we're going to put this
aside and see what else is inside the
box sim card set that aside as well
instruction manual and the SD card and
SIM card tool on the bottom charger no
inductive puck obviously that will have
to be bought separately microUSB to USB
C adapter traditional USB to USB C
adapters it's for transferring your data
from other devices and then we have a
charging cable and the AKG headphones
that were all the rage because these are
actually hundred-dollar headphones that
Samsung is gifting you as part of your
very expensive purchase volume rocker
over here and in earbuds over here and
keep moving with the phone a little bit
smaller than I expected particularly for
the bigger screen now orchid gray with
that
pant pant of purple and then the nearly
bezel-less display on the galaxy s 8
that's about it that's what comes in the
box your phone your charger your
adapters your fancy new headphones and
your SD extraction tool that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
