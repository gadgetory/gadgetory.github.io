connect corded headphones our
smartphones are packed with technologies

fighting for space within that same

to the iPhone 7 as well as two rear
cameras on the 7 plus the lenses give 2

the shallow depth of field effect found
on digital SLR cameras it automatically
jumps to using the telephoto lens and
automatically you see the depth effect
you are seeing that blur in the
background it is being generated in real
time as you're looking at your screen
the Apple watch series 2 looks similar
to the previous version but it's now
resistant to depths of up to 50 meters
and has a built-in GPS it is faster it
is brighter it is water resistant so you
can swim with it it's got built-in GPS
and it's got all of the power of watch

recent quarters with many wondering how
Apple can reverse the trend Apple's

upgrade and gets people going to the
stores the new iPhone comes at an
opportune time for the tech giant rival
