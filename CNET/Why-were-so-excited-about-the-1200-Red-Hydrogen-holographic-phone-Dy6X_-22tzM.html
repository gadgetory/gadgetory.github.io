holographic phone the one that's gonna
cost 1200 to 1600 dollars I'm Sean
Hollister with CNET and I'm here with my
colleague Patrick Holland fellow a
camera and phone lover to talk about and
give you an idea of what's going on here
we think it's going to be something
special partially because it's a crazy
phone likes we've never seen before at a
really high price and partially because
it's a modular phone and modular phones
with interchangeable parts or an idea we
haven't seen work out very well yet so
uh first off we want to talk about who
the heck red is because you may have
heard of this phone but you probably
don't know who red is as a company
Patrick you want to tell us a little bit
about red you've got some background
with them I understand yeah and actually
says red is a camera maker mostly they
make cinema cameras to make the films
and movies I think they were founded in
like the mid 2000s 2007 I believe was
the first actual release of a camera and
what was neat about it was a meant to be
a modular system that shot at the time
4k video which was at that time a very
big deal and because of that a lot of
filmmakers would use this and it quickly
got adopted into Hollywood like with
Peter Jack's this was part of the big
transition to digital they're all about
film and red was one of the companies
that comes along and says hey let's do
this digital and they made these crazy
tank like big black behemoth cameras
with all these modular parts so they had
kind of a head start on this whole
modular thing yeah the box of it almost
look like a grenade case or something it
was like this big and metal and durable
and because of that it was able to
capture these beautiful images that
would compete with the likes of at the
time film and you know since then we've
seen them be used on Marvel films The
Hobbit and stuff like that and TV shows
almost anything digital is filmed on reg
Natalie all of these big-budget
TV shows you see on Netflix for instance
house of cards daredevil and bunch of
these Marvel series they're all filmed
on these red cameras even though if
you've never seen one of these cameras
you've probably seen what's come out of
and it's beautiful like david fincher
it's like one of the biggest people on
that the hints the house of cards hi and
stuff like that now that just to be
clear there are other amazing digital
cinema cameras like the RT Alexa and
stuff like that had that come out cents
but red was kind of the first and it's
actually because the quality via the
quality of the not only the image out of
it but also the quality of actual camera
product it's big its bulky it's meant to
be used as meant to be used on location
and the studio's it can be adapted to be
running gun where you're putting it on a
shoulder kind of like a news camera
style and then they could also be
adapted to have these amazing cinema
lenses on it with displays and monitors
out to directors we were talking before
the the podcast here that you could
actually tie two of these together like
Peter Jackson did to shoot in 3d which
he did on The Hobbit Peter Jackson used
these for The Hobbit series uh what
you're you're not here to talk about to
hear about cameras necessarily you're
here to hear about a crazy new phone and
this is called the red hydrogen it's a
phone that's going to be made out of
titanium or aluminum alloy and it'll
cost as much as sixteen hundred dollars
that's just the the pre-order price for
this phone I don't know if we got to a
picture that we can throw up on screen
it this thing here this is the only
picture they gave you in order to make a
purchasing decision they kind had this
little teaser announcement they said hey
you know we've got a phone it's gonna be
this much it's gonna be made out of
these metals and it's gonna have a crazy
screen that likes it what you'd never
seen before
wouldn't you like to buy it here go
ahead and buy it right now and that was
all we had to go on until we started
digging into some patent filings until
we started looking a little bit deeper
into what the company had said and the
weird thing about red is for red lovers
that was enough for many of them because
this is a company that does this all the
time they they say they're gonna do
something really crazy with a product
and a lot of people don't believe them
you're like okay how the heck are you
gonna build this crazy camera sensor out
of nowhere and stick it in a body and
sell it to us in this modular package
but they've done it time and again so
when this phone came out a lot of the
red lovers were like okay I'm gonna go
for that the rest of us are back here
scratching our heads thinking well you
know what's this company on about
they've never made a phone what are they
doing here and what the heck is a
holographic just
black as I say like so yeah they are not
an electronics company so to speak like
you wouldn't think of them like a
Samsung or an Apple where they're
creating lots of different consumer
products in fact you might argue that
the red cameras on a consumer product so
to have something like that high-end
that specific say we're gonna make a
phone you're like that's crazy but
that's also why it's appealing is
because it just seems so out there and
there's been a lot of hype because of
that where if this thing you know is the
holographic thing like Star Wars like
Princess Leia thing or is it more like a
Nintendo 3ds style what exactly is that
there's a lot of questions about that
there's questions about the modularity
and that promo photo you could probably
see there's a bunch of like brass or
gold pins at the bottom yeah we're kind
of hint at something that you could
attach on to which we'll talk about it
so I dug into a lot of this a lot of
these questions for a CNET's story all
about this modular phone about this
holographic phone the first thing I
found out which is super interesting is
this technology this for view
holographic video that they want to
display this phone actually isn't
something crazy or new it's something
that scientists and researchers are
trying to do for a long time basically
it's kind of like stereo 3d where screen
gives you two different views it's kind
of like a glasses free version of that
where you don't need you know it's
special cinema glasses or anything to
see that there's a technology in the
screen to direct some of the light to
one eye that's different from what goes
to the other eye so you get kind of a 3d
view but instead of two views they've
got four views in here something called
multi scopic 3d so you don't just don't
need to stay in one place and see like
oh this images pops out of the screen a
little bit you can actually look around
to the left to the right and see around
an object this is not magic this is not
something that red invented this is
something researchers have been trying
to build for a while and they just
didn't have the screen technology
necessary to show this off um in a
device that people would actually want
to buy so maybe this is one of those but
that's not all that this price is about
this crazy price is also about what we
found in the patent filings it's going
to be a phone where you have
interchangeable lenses and I'm not
talking about a tiny little you know a
tiny little phone lens
on the back of your phone like I've got
on this side the Samsung here anything
like that I'm talking about big honking
camera lenses hooking up to these this
kind of bayonet mount that you have
traditionally in DSLR we found a patent
for a miniature version of that that
could fit on a phone and then when a
certain youtube star
marques Brownlee got to look at the
phone today a little bit earlier this
week actually he posted a via this
morning he we saw that that's I'm think
they're actually integrating into the
phone they're going to have actual
camera lenses you can hook onto this
thing yeah basically kind of it turns it
at see the module is kind of it looks
like it does two things where it gives
you a sensor you remember like the the
actual sensor inside a cell phone camera
is very small so that's a sensor but it
also adds that like that circular area
is gonna add the place where you could
put on a different lens mount so I can
interchange lens match which it's a
whole nother crazy this is where Patrick
and I Patrick and I started getting
super exciting so we're super into
photography both of us and we've both
talked about this in the past that
phones they just don't physically have
what you need to take amazing amazing
photos that you get with a DSLR sure
they take great photos now don't get me
wrong you can get amazing photos on a
phone but certain things you can't do
you can't do aperture control where you
get different depths of field and allow
different amounts of lights into the
sensor based on mechanical blades
there's no room for those mechanical
blades in a phone right now
there's no room for a big zoom lens
other phones have had to get around that
like the iPhone 7 plus by having two
cameras on the phone one that's kind of
already zoomed in and one that's not and
then they kind of interpolate the
distance between them to kind of give
you what looks like a zoom but isn't
really and you can't zoom very far with
those so all of a sudden you add actual
lenses onto a phone we're in a whole
different ballgame well and I think it's
something that should be said is I don't
think this particular phones trying to
appeal to the exact person that an
iPhone or some of these other dual
camera phones I have with like that
telephone photo zoom or is I don't think
it's even trying to compete with
something like like the moto products
that you could add on like the
Hasselblad like
camera package or and whatever the 3d
cameras yeah moto Z phones we've seen
the motor Z was one of the modular
phones that said hey we're going to let
you add all kinds of accessories to the
back of the phone they just snap right
in they magnetically snap on they've got
little what they call a pogo pins or
copper connectors spring-loaded copper
connectors that just snap onto the back
of the phone and immediately make that
electrical contact and then we've got us
another phone like that called essential
the the founder of android i nate guy
named Andy Rubin founded android he did
the sidekick before that has a company
called essential where they're going to
clip on modular proton products to you
can see on the screen in a sec there's a
360-degree camera Patrick's talking
about that can click on to the back of
the phone the same way yeah this is
something where traditionally you're not
gonna want to carry something with that
big and bulbous in your pocket you're
not gonna want to carry a giant camera
lens in your pocket like a DSLR but once
are you talking about a modular phone
where this is something option where you
can snap it on when you need it you can
take it off when you don't all of a
sudden there's room for those kinds of
products to exist that's I mean that's
what I think at least well I think for
me as someone who does video and cinema
I can't tell me people who love to use
like their smartphones especially some
ones that could shoot 4k or you'd get an
app that allows you to record high
bitrate on your smart phone and that's
pretty cool but you're still limited to
the actual optics and sensor the phones
there and now you're able to attach
something on as someone who has to use
some Reds too I'm hoping it's not with
the allen wrench screws like you have to
do on the camera because that would be
insane but who knows maybe that's the
thing - well that's we did see in
patents they will there is a patent
diagram I found which actually shows the
allen wrench screws going into several
components of this phone and that maybe
also if that is the case it all jokes
aside that also kind of tells you where
it's aimed for - I think if I'm able to
trim a you know a nice camera a nice
high-end phone into a cinema camera I'm
competing with something like the
Blackmagic pocket Cinema Camera I'm
competing with image quality and
controls I can get on some maybe two or
three thousand dollar cinema cameras
that I'm not gonna get on a phone even
if I add on like the motor Z's
Hasselblad camera this is
gotta compete the other thing to think
about is this isn't necessarily for an
audience who buys a phone and then
expects to had all kinds of modular
camera accessories to it it's also for
camera people who want to add modular
phone pieces onto it because every
couple of years we get faster processors
in our phones we get faster Wi-Fi and 3G
and Bluetooth and all these components
that you only find itself on screens
touch screens the touchscreen on my
phone is so much more advanced than the
touchscreen on my camera here I've got a
Canon t4i which was one of the first
Canon cameras to add a articulating
touch screen on the back this thing is
nowhere near the resolution nowhere near
the touch everything about this touch
screen is inferior to the one of my new
galaxy it's almost more of an
afterthought and what's interesting too
I think going back to the red the
hydrogen one as well is the fact that
the cameras themselves the other thing
besides shooting really great image
quality of the red camera was that you
can after a couple years
hey there's new processors there's and
they call it a brain module I can pay to
have my camera upgraded to the newest
yeah processor and that I this is with
red cinnamon red cinnamon can't been
doing this for years and years now and
the reason I bring that up is I'm
wondering also if that's going to be a
case where if I buy this 1200 1600 on
our phone if there's would be modules
that are able to upgrade stuff like that
image therefore the cinema and it looks
like there might be we found some patent
images you'll see them on screen in a
second where we saw them pieced together
multiple giant pieces of phone so you'd
have your one phone piece with like
these these special ridges on it so you
can grip it well and then you stick
these other pieces on there and one of
them could be a battery attachment and
one of them can be inputs and outputs
you can hook it up to a monitor and one
of them can be a stabilization model you
can have module where you can have image
stabilization for the entire unit and
then the one on the end
is an actual entire camera sensor and
lens assembly so you can stick those
interchangeable lenses on there so not
just the lenses are interchangeable the
camera sensor could be as well so in a
year or two maybe you put an 8k sensor
on there instead of a 4k sensor whatever
it is on a smart phone on us I mean
there's no smart phones that ship with
seven
20 HD video so they'll be able to shoot
8k video on a smartphone is insane
another thing with red is their images
on the cameras are RAW images so when
you take a photo like with your Canon
there you can either get JPEGs which
most phones shoot in a JPEG where the
camera or the phone is processing that
image for you or you can get a raw image
where it allows you to control some of
the settings after the fact more in
depth so when the red cameras came out
and were able to shoot raw video and
you're able to like get your colors back
and those like highlights if they're
blown out a lot of cool post-processing
I'm gonna do with it makes me wonder
like what I'm gonna be able to do with
that hydrogen-1 and also the name
hydrogen-1 I don't know if you're
familiar and all joking aside the there
was a chipset for the red camera called
the helium and I'm wondering if this is
like at all like something tied to that
or that chips gonna be in that module
that we saw or that in that add-on for
all we know they take the same sensor
from the cinema cameras and they put it
in the phone in the future that would be
insane I don't know I mean this is
mind-blowing now as my dad or brother
gonna buy this thing definitely not
that's that's the question so I think I
think that because red has such a
history with modular cameras and because
their audience is small enough and they
don't need to like go out of their way
to blow away the everyday consumer they
can afford to be successful with a niche
modular phone product but where a lot of
other companies have just given up
like for instance I went to see the the
project our guys the Google project ara
guys a while back and they were trying
to build this modular phone for
everybody and they were talking about oh
it could be only you know three hundred
dollars for the frame and then you could
add on these extra components and you
can change out your processor every year
and then they had to pull back their
ambitions a little bit and they said
well you know people kind of want to
have the best of everything that goes
into a phone every couple years we'll
just make it a few additional modules
like a like a camera like a you know
it's special while you could have a a
pollution alert if you live somewhere
where there's a lot of pollution a
little sensor in there that monitors the
carbon monoxide levels or something like
that just a limited module thinks and
even that was too much for them they
they got folks in there they had of
executives there said no we need to
build a mass-market product and they
shuttered the whole project and now a
bunch of those
project ara folks they're working for
Facebook now possibly on a phone they're
a bunch of hires there around modularity
so maybe Facebook is doing something
there but we've seen some of these
high-profile failures around modularity
Google LG moto even moto who's building
a whole line of moto Z phones around
this but their moto mods initiative they
don't seem to have a lot of stuff going
on there is this the company that can
make it work on a miniature scale on a
niche scale and then could they take
that expertise and go a little further
is there room in the market for a phone
that's this expensive for everyday
consumers honestly I think there is I
mean I think those failures of those
other phones is it was like kind of
modularity for modularity sake like it
feels like hey yeah we made this road
and there could be this kind of car that
goes down or the kind of truck but we
haven't figured out exactly who's gonna
use the road there's no cars on the road
yet there's no cars where I think what
Rhett saying is hey we're gonna make
this path and it's gonna specifically be
for something similar that we've already
done in our camera line which is a
modular approach different albeit but at
least in the same vein in the patents I
looked at Reds patents for the modular
phone they the patent is like
three-quarters their original patents
for modular cameras showing that they've
had such a history here but like but yet
this this high-end this question of high
price for a phone is gonna come up not
just once this year because there's also
the Galaxy Note 8 coming up there is the
iPhone the latest iPhone it looks like
there's going to be a high-end iPhone
that might cost $1200 compared to the
normal iPhones where you get in there
for like 650 on the ground this one
could be a thousand eleven hundred $1200
for an iPhone so this question of is
there room for a high-end phone I think
we're gonna get it asked several more
times this here where I think red has an
interesting advantage where I think
modularity actually has an interesting
advantage is that people can buy the
parts they want they can kind of make
this investment in the future because
they're gonna add additional parts down
the road and they can and it can open up
parts that just wouldn't be available in
a phone previously previously you
to justify a really mass-market phone
you have to have kind of a
one-size-fits-all part your camera your
modem your processor and that's to go in
millions hundreds of millions of phones
in order to be a legitimate business
which is why Nvidia companies like
Nvidia dropped out of the mobile chip
game they said hey we can't get our
Tegra processors and phones we don't
have the the economies of scale that a
company like Qualcomm does to get it
there we don't have the deals in place
that Qualcomm does so we just can't make
it at all because we can't get the deals
with phone manufacturers but if you had
a modular processor nvidia could sell it
on its website and but it could sell it
like a graphics card like the excel
graphics cards right now anybody could
buy that thing and stick it into their
phone they don't need to have all these
middlemen in the way I don't need to
have all these Oh am building the smart
phones in order to build that processor
that same goes for camera companies they
want to build a cam a new camera goes on
this doesn't need to be red building the
lenses that go on this camera or the
sensors or the or the adapters that
could be another company could be
another company building those modules
so I mean I think if you have the
smartphone market as a whole I do think
there is room on the high end and
whether it's something very specific and
modular like this hydrogen one is
seeming to be or something like a
high-end iPhone or a high-end Samsung
phone I think there's definitely room
for that stuff and I also think on the
bottom of the market which we cover a
lot too with budget phones the lower end
is getting so much better that it's kind
of you know you're raising all ships by
raising rising beside raises all ships
yeah by having that bottom and have such
premium feature sets on some of these
budget phones I think that also lifts it
and also it allows people going wow what
else can I get so you have tiers of
things like you do whenever right
there's a spectrum obviously it was very
much you want a new phone you're gonna
pay $650 for a good one or you're gonna
pay less for a crappy one and now it's
you can pay $200 for a good phone you
can pay 70 in some cases for a good
enough phone and then your 650 is a
better phone and your 850 is an even
better phone and maybe there's room in
that market for a $1200 $1300 $1600
phone for those who see the use cases
for cinema and photography yeah and I
think you know come back to like you've
brought that the Apple rumors
like that yeah I mean currently this in
the phones they have you have the seven
and then seven plus and there are big
differences not only the size of the
phone but in the functionality of what
it can do and you are paying a premium
to have that functionality right
and I think it's in the interesting like
kind of you dip in the tone of water for
Apple like well man if we if we did
something better with us of some way or
what if we did these things I've already
said you want a better camera pay a
little bit more you get our bigger phone
with a better camera doesn't necessarily
need to be the bigger phone maybe it's
just better and better camera that is
one of the top things readers asked for
us they say absolutely alone is the best
camera and we look at Samsung - I mean
there's maybe they're gonna be this
other note phone coming out and that
usually is a their premium their
top-of-the-line thing it's usually a lot
more expensive so I think for red to
compete it does something very specific
kind of thinking about like almost like
a sandbox and they're gonna have this
little corner over there that no one
really occupies and I think if they're
able to pull this off we I'm gonna go
back to that holographic screen for a
second yes I think that's the other
question here we talked a lot about the
camera side the modularity the price but
I think that screen is curious cuz they
able to actually pull that technology
off on a phone that could be really
impressive and that does put them at a
little of their own corner of the
sandbox where I don't know anyone else
is doing something but what nobody
understands including the read existing
read customers is how they're going to
shoot that content how they're going to
film for view content I mean there's
ways to do it right now
but like so sounds like a way to do so
it sounds like there could possibly even
be a need for a camera or something the
captured content like that and I'm not
trying to be a smartass here but I do
think that you can see that anything
thanks I try but I do think that there
is a possibility that you know this
opens up you know a new wave of
capturing things whether it's for that
specific kind of content I don't know
how a RvR would work on if you recorded
off such a device or if you'd have a
special modular module for something
like that yeah or how it's gonna play
with stuff like Android or Google tango
I mean there's so many so many questions
this on the great it hasn't gone off the
ground yet Google tango has this all
these sensors these dual cameras in this
time of flight sensor all these crazy
things they put together so you can
see you can like kind of measure the
real world around you and turn it all
into augmented reality they haven't been
able to sell a lot of phony
manufacturers on that but what if that
was a modular product you just stick on
the back of this phone yeah all of a
sudden you've got a place for that to go
a place where a platform where people
can try the latest and greatest
technologies for smart phones so here's
the thing here's here's though here's
the rub the the thing that my colleague
Scott Stein brought up earlier and in
one of our meetings he was saying but
red you know and in these other
companies do you really want to get
locked into their ecosystem because
there aren't any standards for
modularity right now if you buy this red
phone or if you buy that red modular
camera or whatever it is do you have to
only buy red products to attach to them
do you have to only buy red approved
modular products to attach them do you
want to get locked into that Eco so I
keep my mind goes immediately to Apple
and think of something like the
Lightning connector right where that was
supposed to be some of that was good
maybe possibly widely adapted but is not
only proprietary but to have products
plug into that that is made by a third
party to have to go through a basically
a certification process part of me
thinks to launch this successfully I
think it's okay for red in a way to have
a be proprietary because that's been
their success on the camera side yeah I
mean they do lock you into their solid
state drive cartridges their battery
adapters all this other kind of stuff
you can use third-party batteries with a
red camera we have to buy Reds adapter
to put the battery and that gets into
the other part so I mean there are
things where it yeah it would be great
to have a standard for modularity and I
mean there's kind of two big names that
could leave that which would be Google
or Apple in the sense that I would think
of it at the tie and also the
functionality of the operating system
and so whether that is like hey we have
it's gonna be these twelve pins and you
can have certain phone to have that and
it interconnects with all these
different products that have been
certified by Google or whoever that
board would be and that would be cool
but I just don't know if there's a
demand for that kind of you know is it
gonna be like a USB kind of thing where
yeah all these companies are working
together on a standard to evolve it over
the years to I mean Scott was saying
maybe it could even be Wireless maybe
that's the kind of standard we need is
something where they don't have to have
all these little copper contacts in
between them they can use 60 gigahertz
these are something else that's
short-range and very fast in the
wireless realm to transfer the power to
transfer the data to do all that kind of
stuff the one advantage to proprietary
right now is it's got a heck of a lot of
bandwidth possible you can do you can do
whatever you want through your own
custom backbone in a modular system
compared to you to get these specific
limitations for USB for Thunderbolt for
lightning for all these other different
port schemes that are out there right
now but on the flip side if you want
something like a batter in your phone
you can buy a USB battery today and plug
it into just about any phone with a
micro USB port and it works you can even
add an adapter a little adapter for
lightning whereas if you buy a red
battery panic for a red phone or a
Motorola MOTO Z mod for the Moto phone
it's gonna be obsolete if you ever have
to get rid of that phone yeah absolutely
and I mean the thing that I also
consider - you're talking about like be
able to transfer that content if you're
shooting 4k 6k I don't know even 8k I
don't know who knows what the things
gonna shoot and I'm shooting at a high
bitrate a really a big fat file that's
gonna I need a lot of information I need
some is good to be fast to that and
wireless is definitely not there even on
a high end to transfer that amount of
data I know
wrong I need I need a connection that's
hard like a hardware connection that's
gonna transfer that data quickly but I
do think Scott's right I think over time
that's gonna be the way it works and
isn't that a central phone kind of isn't
how work they talk about wireless USB
isn't that what that is essential is
using a wireless transfer protocol from
what I understand those copper contacts
are there for power and to sync the
thing but not necessarily for the data
transfer the data is supposed to be
wireless there so that's something to
look forward to maybe I wanna I want to
leave this on one last interesting note
about this film one other unique thing
about this phone that we haven't seen
before and that read has several patents
on multiple one patent and two patent
applications in process the ridges on
the side of this phone this phone has
big metal ridges on each end if you want
to put the we'll have those on screen in
a second with a nice blown-up image of
those ridges it is scalloped to such a
degree and it's got these tiny little
ridges in there too to help you grip
this
thing and Patrick had an interesting
observation about where those ridges
might have come from - yeah I mean
obviously we're seeing someone's hand
hold it and you could see where your
fingers might fit when you held those
especially have bigger hands like me I
could see that being a very comfortable
thing but also again coming back to the
nerd cinema guy a lot of like prime
lenses especially if you're using you
know have I golden icons or point Lander
lenses a lot of those lenses the focus
ring on them has scalloped edges
sometimes which when I first saw that
it's like oh it looks like the side of a
lens and your reaction was like really
and then I shot you all these like
pictures of lenses yeah yeah that makes
sense
my lens here only has just the basic
ridges on it doesn't have the big
scalloped ones like you'll see on some
some of these Voigtlander and older
older older primes special yeah mostly
primes but I think what's neat about
that is there's a nod to not only that
the way when you look at that phone if
you were to show a picture of a red
camera next this the box even in the
brain of it next to that phone you could
definitely see everything from like the
little like red jewel in the middle I'm
a logo too like it looks like a heatsink
I don't know if that's practical or
distorted design I thought I heard in
his video that there might be carbon
fiber on the body which is kind of crazy
- for - left like the white like the
Wi-Fi and like seculars so yes I was
using all some of the same design cues
and materials that you've got an
all-metal phone you need to have some
kind of antenna break somewhere for the
wireless signals to get out exactly and
also I know we don't think we always a
big question not only on a smartphone
camera but durability you know like if
this thing is main had a titanium and
carbon fiber I'm gonna feel pretty good
about if it drops or or I don't know how
the screen would yeah I'm not aware
people who are listening titanium is
crazy strong you know like an REI or
something they'll sometimes sell cups
made of titanium for backpackers and
other instruments made for backpackers
because backpackers need to have very
very light backpacks I need to take as
little weight with them as possible so
they can carry you know days and days
worth of food and clothing and things
like that they are so strong go go ahead
and try to bend one of those yeah one of
those parts of the space shuttle was
made out of titanium - yeah it's like
a light it's one of the lightest metals
that has that rigidity and strength that
you need to fly people to space right
that technology if I have space shuttle
technology in my hand shooting a video
I'd feel really good about that yeah
sounds great
I say space shuttle I should say uh yeah
I mean aluminum alloy I came from you
know a lot of a lot of aircrafts use
aluminum alloys I can throw aluminum
under the bus we could do that and we've
put velcro on it and drink some Tang and
we're like all NASA NASA we're gonna do
our NASA set of a documentary with our
red hydrogen one camera and the modular
8k whatever it's gonna be
yes I will gladly accept an offer from
red ass because I would do that to
Harvey I totally do the heartbeat
alright thanks so much for chatting me
about this yeah it's super exciting I'm
super excited we can't wait to get our
hands on one one actually is ready to go
alright guys well thanks for watching
and you can check out our full article
about the hydrogen including those
patent drawings and see Netcom
