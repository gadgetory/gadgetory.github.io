answer to Amazon's Alexa speakers is
missing some prominent features that you
will find on the Amazon echo echo dot or
Amazon tab but one thing you get with
Google home you won't get with Alexa
speakers for now at least is the ability
to throw content to your television
using your voice this of course is done
using chromecast and works with both
video and audio content here's how to
set it up first you will need to
download the Google home app on your
Android or iOS device and go through the
setup process for Google home which is
pretty painless if you haven't already
go through the same setup process for
your chromecast using the Google home
app make sure to give it a unique name
like TV or livingroom you want to be
able to clearly tell Google home which
device to stream content to then hit the
hamburger button to expand the sidebar
menu and select music choose between
Google Play Music YouTube music Spotify
or Pandora and log into your account to
set it as the default music service then
all you need to do is tell Google home
of what you want to play for now you
have to keep video requests fairly
simple and straightforward you can say
things like ok Google Play recommended
videos in the living room alright
playing recommended YouTube videos on TV
or you can have simple search queries
like cat videos give the YouTube app a
second to launch and load the video and
it will begin playing on the designated
TV currently video only works for
playing YouTube videos but support for
Netflix and other third-party streaming
apps will be coming in the future to
stream music to your TV using Google
home just say hey Google Play the
Lumineers on the TV if you're signed in
to another service but don't have it set
as the default just ask to play the
music through it instead for example ok
Google Play the Lumineers on Spotify on
the TV alright the Lumineers from
Spotify playing on TV in the future you
will be able to throw much more content
to your TV using Google home such as
pictures stored in your Google Photos
account or podcasts which you can
currently listen to but only through
Google home itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
