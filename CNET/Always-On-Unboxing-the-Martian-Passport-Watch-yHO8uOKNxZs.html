unboxing the Martian passport watch it's
a Bluetooth voice controlled watch that
apparently screens your phone calls and
your messages it's all part of this
whole SmartWatch craze and each one of
these is gonna have its brief moment in
the Sun until and if Apple announces one
so let's give it its moment get out of
the box
it comes in black gray or white I went
with the slightly more girly white
because I can't okay oh look at that I
guess it's about as attractive as it can
be considering that it's a SmartWatch
it's not bad though compared to like the
I'm watch not bad we have our USB
charging cable here and that is
basically it because it's a watch I mean
as really big watches go it's actually
not you know I mean I wear a really big
watch it's a little more square but what
I like about it is that it doesn't look
like some kind of dumb gadget it looks
like kind of a fancy white watch except
for the giant m-my here alright so let's
see if we can figure out to turn this
thing on it basically has a little
one-line screen here and I guess that's
where you get your info but I am already
flummoxed by power power I'm gonna hold
this down for a minute for power no
power
USB not power I'm gonna have to look at
the directions quick-connect guide blah
blah I turn your watch on tap both
buttons simultaneously aha oh these two
it's dead while I tried to figure out
how to turn it on I guess I'll go
through the specs the Martian passport
watch has an analog watch face and a
one-line oh le d-- display at the bottom
with a multicolor LED notification light
there's a microphone and a speaker and
old-fashioned physical buttons on the
sides the top button initiates bluetooth
pairing and answers or ends calls or
starts voice activated services the
passport has a stainless steel case and
clasp with an anti scratch glass crystal
face and a grey plastic resin plate on
the back it has Bluetooth 4.0 and a
micro USB port a connects with Siri or
Android voice the Martian works with
Android phones that support voice
command the iPad 2 and later iPod Touch
4th generation and later and the iPhone
3GS for later on Android there's a
Martian alerts app that does a few more
tricks than on iOS it can adjust a
vibration strength patch in
notifications from almost any
notification ready app on your phone and
even push local time and weather
information so it comes up on the o LED
screen with the push of a button
the Martian doesn't operate very far
from your smartphone according to our
sina editors it can only work about 10
feet away
other features include a magnetometer
and a three axis accelerometer the watch
comes in three different designs with
both black and white and various
wristbands in silicon and leather
Martian makes two other models the
circular victory and the candy color to
g2g the victory and the passport costs
$299
while the G to G costs 249 I will say
first impressions straight out of the
box it's a lot prettier than I thought
it was gonna be and that is already a
victory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
