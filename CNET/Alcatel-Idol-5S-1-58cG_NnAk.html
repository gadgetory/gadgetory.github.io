smartphones is settled Alcatel comes
along with the idol 5s it's design and
build belies its budget price in the US
the idol 5s sells for two hundred and
eighty dollars but it looks downright
fancy with its glass front and back it
feels like a spelt iPhone 4 and that's a
good the idol 5s runs Android nougat
which includes Google assistant in use
the 5s was very capable of everyday
tasks messaging social media and even
playing games like Super Mario run
modern combat 5 and incredible monster
hero there's a fingerprint reader on the
back which works well and has a couple
of nifty tricks you can set specific
fingers to trigger a shortcut for
example I can unlock the phone and go
right into messages all in one motion I
can also use the fingerprint reader to
swipe through photos left and right
sadly there's no NFC which means no
Android pay but the idol 5s does have
amazing built-in speakers better than
most phones and it has a 12 megapixel
rear camera which takes nice photos and
shoots good 1080p video there's no 4k no
optical image stabilization and that's
true of most budget phones but the idol
5s does have digital image stabilization
for video which yields good results so
is the idol 5s one of the best budget
phones you can buy well there's two
problems the first is the battery in our
looped video battery test it only lasts
at 7 hours and 48 minutes that's one of
the shortest times for any phone we've
tested this year I should say in real
world use it got through most days just
fine but there were some days where I
was searching for my charger by the
afternoon
and problem number two the moto G 5 plus
it is equally spec to the idol 5s but
it's battery lasted 13 hours and 22
minutes in our test
look I really like the Alcatel idol 5s
but the battery is a compromise you'll
need to consider if you can get past
charging it more frequently it is
otherwise a wonderful phone for the
price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
