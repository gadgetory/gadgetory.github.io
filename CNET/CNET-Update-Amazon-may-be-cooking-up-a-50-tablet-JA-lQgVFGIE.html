super low price tablet I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update as we're
bombarded with reports about all the new
gadgets apple will release in the fall
it looks like Amazon could have a new
tablet out in time for the holidays the
wall street journal reports that amazon
is working on releasing a fifty-dollar
tablet with a 6-inch screen and that's
the lure in the more budget-conscious
shoppers that makes it half the price of
amazon's current cheapest 6 inch HD fire
tablet which you see here the journal
reports we could also see amazon release
a few other tablet models as well the
market for tablets isn't very hot right
now most people who own one keep it for
a long time in don't upgrade the global
tablet market declines seven percent
from this time of year ago that's
according to an IDC report and shipments
for apples iPads have declined
twenty-six percent from two years ago
meanwhile Amazon is also pushing deeper
into its delivery service with
restaurant meal deliveries in Seattle it
announced a partnership with a handful
of eateries to deliver food to your door
in one hour or less with the Prime now
app you can only get the restaurant food
delivery if you're a prime member which
costs a hundred dollars a year and it's
part of the membership perks the apps
seamless and grubhub are leaders in the
space but Amazon isn't the only one
cooking up some new competition in July
Groupon also began a restaurant delivery
and take out service called Groupon to
go that's in Chicago and uber the car
service also has a lunch delivery
service for a few cities in other mobile
news verizon is launching a new free
mobile video streaming service it's
called go 90 and it's making a big
marketing push to millennials to try it
out it's free and it's supported by
advertisements it will play a mixture of
traditional live TV programming and
on-demand shows along with some shorter
clips similar to the types of clips
you'll find on youtube you'll get
content from MTV Comedy Central
Nickelodeon and the NFL is also a
Content partner this go 90 service isn't
just for verizon subscribers its offered
to everyone but it can only be
on phones and tablets so you can't watch
on a Roku an Apple TV or even a laptop
verizon also announced that it's going
to begin testing crazy fast 5g wireless
speeds within the next year yeah 5g and
maybe it'll be deployed commercially in
2017 industry experts say we wouldn't
see a new wireless speed roll out until
the year 2020 so this will make verizon
the world's first carrier to test 5g
which could be 30 to 50 times faster
than our current 4G network maybe even
higher speeds than what Google Fiber
offers you can download a whole movie in
15 seconds that's it for this tech news
update but be sure to head to cnet.com
