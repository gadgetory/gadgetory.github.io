double I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your scene at update for months you've
heard the rumors and seeing the leaked
photos but now finally HTC has
officially unveiled its new
top-of-the-line smartphone it's called
the HTC One m8 like its predecessor it
has a sleek all-metal design that makes
it feel like a high quality device this
one comes in a brushed metal silver or
gold finish and the model is just a
little larger with a five-inch screen
and if you care about weight it is a tad
heavier than the samsung galaxy s5 the
m8 sports a pair of stereo speakers
called boom sound and they're pretty
powerful for phone certainly better than
last year's model
inside you get plenty of top-notch
hardware with a Qualcomm processor that
can offer 25 percent faster graphics
than other recent Android phones
it runs Google's latest version of
Android known by the nickname KitKat and
HTC layers on its own interface on top
of it called
Sense and that adds some color themes
and widgets like the blinkfeed news
aggregator the good thing about the m8
is now you can turn off blinkfeed if it
annoys you many Android phones try to
stand out from the herd with different
tricks and gimmicks and with this phone
it's the two back side cameras that let
you edit the focus of a photo after
you've taken it because the photo takes
in stores two photos at once it's smart
enough to let you change the focus to
the foreground or to the background
after the photo has been taken the only
thing is that HTC's camera is 4
megapixels well it calls them
ultrapixels it's less resolution and the
cameras you find on other smartphones
but you may not notice the megapixel
difference if all you do is upload
photos to social media
in other news Google is hoping to give
its glass headset a bit more style with
the help of Oakley and Ray band the
parent company behind these well-known
brands has partnered with Google to
create stylish frames that attach to the
wearable computer and camera it doesn't
mean you'll see glass on your favorite
oak
right now they're still working on some
designs it's all really just a big tease
to say hey we'll have something cool
when it's released to the public and it
won't just be for nerds the Spotify
music service has a plan to expand
quickly in the u.s. it's now offering
college students memberships at half the
cost
normally Spotify prime costs $10 a month
to let you listen on a mobile device but
college students in the u.s. can get a
subscription for five bucks a month
that's your tech news update head to
cnet.com for more details on these
stories and a full review of the HTC One
m8 from our studios in New York I'm
