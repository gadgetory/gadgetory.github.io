space and Google shifts gears with
storage I'm Bridget Carey this is your
scene at update google has unveiled he
will drive a service for storing your
files online and sharing them between
various computers and devices every
Google user gets five gigs of storage
for free and it's integrated with Google
Docs so you can save any file or
document into the cloud and it will be
alongside your google doc files if you
need to expand that storage 25 gigs
costs about 250 a month and 100 gigs
costs five bucks a month google is
giving more free storage than other
services like Dropbox which caps that
free at two gigs and Google makes it
cheaper than the other guys to just
quickly add more storage the Lumia 900
is Nokia's last big chance for success
in the US and it's having a hard time
keeping their color models in stock if
you want this 4G Windows Phone out ya
might have to settle for black the Scion
and white are out of stock at AT&amp;amp;T at
Amazon why is unavailable and Scion is
backordered Best Buy also has white
unavailable so is this a sign that there
is a hot demand for this phone or maybe
Nokia just didn't produce enough units
when it launched or a combo of the two
if this is a sign of popularity the
nokia has got a fighting chance to
thrive in this apple and android
dominated market also don't forget there
was a software problem with the very
first Nokia units Nokia gave a hundred
dollar credit to customers making the
phone free so maybe free has something
to do with hot demand in other news
