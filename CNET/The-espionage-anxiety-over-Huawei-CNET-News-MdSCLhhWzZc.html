scoop and here with me is senior writer
Jay green who has been looking into the
controversy surrounding Huawei which
makes telecom gear and the controversy
has been whether or not they could be
trusted to work with American companies
because there's been accusations that
their gear could be used as spy
equipment for the Chinese government now
you've gone to their headquarters in
China I gotta know what has been the
vibe when they're faced with these
accusations how are they dealing with
that yeah you know they face these
accusations for a while from the US
government from the Australian
government and there's something of
exhaustion that they have with this
they're they're kind of flummoxed by
they don't quite know what more to say
they deny the accusations absolutely but
they persist and so I think the folks at
yway are a little mystified as to what
more they can do well what have they
been doing well you know it's a good
question right they've been responding
to questions Congress here has certainly
ask the questions they visited Huawei
and and the folks of whywe have said
that they've answered them to the
questions to the best of their ability
and what does the government's well so
the government says some sources there
have said to me that while way isn't
really as forthcoming is as maybe they
ought to be
they haven't convinced folks in Congress
that they aren't working on behalf of
the Chinese government and that's a fear
for for Congress is there a cultural
barrier yeah I think that's actually a
really big issue for the folks in
Congress and folks at Huawei Huawei has
proven to be not very good at addressing
these issues and I think a lot of that
stems from the fact that it's a Chinese
company born in a Chinese culture led by
Chinese leaders and they've never really
had to deal with an aggressive press
asking these questions or a government
that quite publicly takes them to task
it's just not part of that culture
today's wars are being fought online
it's cyber warfare there's been reports
that a lot of hacking and cyber
espionage has
from China so what does this company
have to do for our government to be like
sure come on work with us we'll trust
you
and that's really the rub right it's
really hard for any company any
individual for that matter to prove that
they're not a spy right it's almost
impossible and and yet that's what
Huawei is tasked with now to be fair as
you say there are a lot of reports
coming out the government has released
reports showing that much of the cyber
attacks are coming from China and so
their reasons it should be concerned it
will be hard for a while way ever to
convince the folks in Congress that it's
not a tool of the Chinese government
thanks Jay for seeing it I'm Bridget
