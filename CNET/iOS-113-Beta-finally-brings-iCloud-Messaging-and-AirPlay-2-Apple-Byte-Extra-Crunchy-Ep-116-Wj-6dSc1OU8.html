CNET podcast livestream my name is
Steven Beecham and you're watching the
Apple byte extra crunchy podcast with
your host mr. Brian Tong bro
see how rusty we are super rustic was
like Apple white extra crunchy just get
to it hold buy extra crunchy podcast
there you go
hey what up everybody welcome to the
show we've been gone for about a month
break we had holiday break we had CES
you know how we do it this is Apple byte
extra crunchy we keep it extra money
this is our complimentary piece to the
actual video show that comes out weekly
where you can really jump in and dive
into this this is episode 116 courtesy
of your hosts in the house beach Yan
song howdy howdy man it's been a while
it's been like over a month we're
getting back on the bike so forgive us
if we got some technical difficulties
all right you know the drill how do you
how are you a part of this show
you just have to dial in 1-866 2 6 3 8
you guys are really the heartbeat of
this show that keeps us rolling and also
gives us so much to talk about so
remember leave your name where you're
from and what you want to talk about
1-866 2 6 3 8 yeah jewel all right let's
get to the show and jump right in
look there's a lot of meaty news this
week I love it because during this kind
of holiday lull from January to February
you sometimes don't really get much news
but we got a whole bunch dropped on us
specifically from Apple we'll talk about
the home pod in a bit but the latest
news has to do with iOS 11.3 Apple
released their own kind of press release
form previewing what we can expect to
see in the new iOS 11.3 and beech I kind
of talked about this in the show but
it's always disappointing to me when you
launch this new iOS and what's what do
you think is the first thing that they
feature I'm looking at it I think the
point 8 feature I'm just as disappointed
as you and emojis its iOS 11.3 bra and
an emojis is like the headliner are we
are we really is that where we're at now
I have not seen one person in my like
friends circle or
line-like use these in a real-life
situation for fun you know what I mean I
think it's always been like oh we're
testing it out like it's see that video
or something we're testing out I've
never seen anyone use them well if you
have nephews and your brother has an
iPhone 10 you're gonna get plenty of
them you're gonna get plenty of so let's
just kind of dive in into some of the
highlights of what we're gonna expect to
see in iOS 11.3 I think there's some
interesting pieces to this puzzle
the coolest part for me is obviously
well actually not coolest when they
first announced us on the press release
they made no mention of iCloud messaging
or airplay - and why does that always
been like a Bugaboo for me they
announced those two features back in
June at WWDC we have yet to even see
them in this press release when they
first let it out there was no mention of
iCloud messaging that allows you to sync
your messages on all Apple devices so if
I delete it on my phone it deletes from
my iPad you know I know why a lot of you
need that picture I think I know I think
I think you know we know why I need that
I turned it off because I didn't like it
if someone was texting me on my phone
then my iPad maybe my kids might be at
home they'll see my iPad
you don't want no D pic I get it you
just want to make sure when you delete
it you delete them okay so what we have
here is those two features iCloud
messaging and airplay - are in the beta
that they actually just released we'll
talk about the other features but Apple
has made this available to developers in
their beta 11.3 as well as the public
beta that everyone can actually sign up
for again at your own risk because these
are betas it's most likely going to
affect the performance of your phone but
if you want to try those out
iCloud messaging is on that so is
airplay - now some people are kind of
like a little confused or curious about
what airplay - really does well right
now in the beta this it has nothing to
do with a home pod right now what
happens is in the beta you can use the
airplay - and what does that mean I can
play a song from my phone and then
direct it to multiple devices at home
but really it's only available to work
with Apple TV's running the beta as well
so if you have multiple Apple TVs and a
single phone you can
play the song in different rooms that's
it that's what that's it right now I
guess again that's it right now it's
it's supposed to be obviously expanded
to the home pod when that's ready to
roll we'll talk about in a second but at
least these are features that have taken
8 months for us to really even see in
the beta that were key kind of tentpole
features that they teased out in June so
I'll still give them flak for it because
it's been so long but let's talk about
the other stuff and emojis get ready you
got four new ant emojis oh my god you
get like a skull a bear a lion just like
a line yeah and there's like if you
scroll down a little more there's like a
dragon there's like a little bit dragon
yeah you can just like play that video
right it's kind of cool yeah unleash the
dragon yeah we also have a Ark it 1.5
what makes that different right now air
KITT really can see flat tables or
horizontal surfaces air KITT 1.5
improves that to support vertical things
like walls or doors and it can place
objects in them the previous air KITT
wasn't able to do that so you Donna Slee
get some weirds spatial looking things
where objects might be like almost
floating on a wall instead of actually
detecting it this is gonna be
interesting because right this is taken
to the next level
Apple's big on a are so that's gonna be
a cool thing the health app is allowing
you now to get all your medical records
from service providers directly into
that that's gonna be kind of very
helpful as Apple continues to push
forward with using really the
combination of the iPhone and this Apple
watch another feature called business
chat is coming this allows businesses
right now it's gonna be limited to apps
like Lowe's or Wells Fargo you'll be
able to chat directly with someone using
the messages app as the vehicle that's
cool to do to get support oh dude you
know many times I called Lowe's and
can't get someone on the phone this is
this gonna fix my problem because I've
been trying to get them on the phone I
can't it's impossible so yeah answer the
phone man but now we know how much right
chat support is like huge it's
everywhere now it's huge
yeah because live chat customer service
is dying across the board so we need
something where we can get like right in
their face and be like hey the other
thing really the biggest thing about iOS
11.3 that they buried away later in
- this press release is that now they
are making this power management feature
available for us that will allow us to
see the health of our battery we all
know about the whole battery issue that
happened literally right before our
break we're Apple admitted to throttling
the performance of phones if you're you
know after a certain amount of time
without starting with iOS 11 point 2 was
it I believe 11 point 2 you know we've
been gone for a while so forgive me it's
iPhone 6s - yeah effects iPhone 6s and
above yeah so it'll show the healthier
battery it'll also recommend you when
you need to get your battery swapped out
when it's condition is poor but also
users if they don't want their phone to
be throttled they're going to give you
the option now to turn off that better
performance throttling feature so you'll
have control over whether it's in place
or not that's a good thing it's a good
thing you know what I think although it
took time and I will still say it was a
horrible thing for them to hide it and
I'm glad it came out and I'm glad it's
surface and Apple had to own up to it
the things that we talked about what did
they need to do offer a battery service
replacement program they they couldn't
put all the fees of it on us because it
was something that they were doing
behind our backs and then three give us
the option to turn an offer on in
software
some people might may find that they'd
rather keep the feature on quite
honestly but just give us these options
now that we know what they're actually
doing and you still may or may not be
happy about it I know there's people
that either threatened or outright said
I'm just not gonna get an Apple iPhone
anymore and that's on Apple and that's
that's what they did you know they did
come out really quick though when that
story broke like within a day or two I
feel like they addressed it and and then
made the battery replacement $27.00
29:29 buddies to do it is it still it
still is it gonna remain that or is that
just for a certain time it's for able
yeah it's it's basically the models have
to fall within a certain range that's
right it can't be they're not gonna do
this $29 battery plan like five years
from now yeah yeah so it's gonna be
applicable to specific models that fall
fall within this time range I gotta jump
on that I'm a successor well again I
almost I'm almost guaranteed not only do
you have to jump on that but there-there
was even before Apple announces plan and
before they were exposed
if you punched in the serial number of
your phone
to an Apple care website it would
actually tell you if you're if you
qualified for a straight-up battery
replacement without paying a fee oh wow
because they were having some of these
issues before they admitted they were
like screwing with our phones hmm
so um you know that that will always be
there other things that are kind of
happening around with iOS 11.3 we talked
about cloud messaging and emojis health
records uh it's expected to come out
sometime this spring we don't know
exactly when but Apple has said uh iOS
11.3 available to spring all right are
you I'm normally I'm normally amped up
about new op operating systems but the
last month and a half with Apple
releasing eleven to eleven point one to
eleven point one point one to one point
one to all that apprehensive I'm not
really that excited but and they even
wrote in even in the document developer
documentation just because they put
iCloud messaging in this beta it doesn't
mean it's still gonna be ready to roll
they said they're using it for testing
purposes right now okay so it still
could be longer for that I I would like
Ike loud messaging syncing if you know
what I mean all right yeah the other big
story that dropped this week Apple
officially announced the release date
for the home pod which will be February
the ninth the big thing if you're
listening this podcast live or right now
within the next ten hours I guess no
seven hours six hours you will be able
to pre-order the home pod for a lovely
retail price of three hundred and forty
nine US dollars 319 pounds or 499
Australian dollars around midnight are
pretty much midnight Friday which is
January the 26th which is really about
six seven hours from now you'll be able
to preorder the home pod in either its
space gray or white
they released in their press release an
official announcement some details about
the home pod if you've seen the video
podcast you'll know how I feel about it
so I don't want to continue to beat a
dead horse with some of the points that
I made there but I will say here the
there's some letdowns obviously just
right out of this major lunch now
Apple had touted this as the best
sounding smart speaker on the market and
I don't doubt at least when you compare
it to the Google home and the Amazon
echo and even the Sonos one that it
arguably before we even see it at least
has better sound than the standard
Google home and the Amazon echo I'm not
sure about the am the Google home max
but really when you stack up everything
that's going on with here even after
these delays I thought they were
delaying this to fine tune it and in the
press release they announced out of the
gates the home pod will have no
multi-user support that is HUGE because
the echo and the Google home have that
which allows it to basically detect the
voice of different people and then know
like what their contacts or or month or
to-do lists or like that's a big deal in
the home assistant also we know Siri is
still inferior to those other voice
assistants we know echo kills it
Google assistant kills it there's the
smart home compatibility when we're
talking about third-party devices is not
gonna be nearly as extensive as what
Amazon has Google even has more than
them out of the gates and then you know
if you use the echo you love there's
some always kind of some fun little
skills those third-party apps that you
have potato and love hops you know
there's a I mean the kids will love this
one I'm not trying to drive parents
crazy but there's a fart app the Amazon
echo and you can ask you can ask the
echo like you say Alexa did you fart
you know what is it you can ask like
different questions of did someone fart
what it was it I think it's called you
fart actually oh wow you don't look for
that skill I used it your kids are crazy
anyways those third-party apps there's
nothing available for that with the home
pod as well and so when you start
stacking this up even the home pod
itself only natively plays Apple music
there is no yeah third-party services
built that it talks to directly to just
the home pod so what is it really at
least right now on launch have going for
it the fact that it'll might and
probably you know I'm gonna say most
likely will be the best sounding smart
speaker
but this it's not this it's not smart
it's not that smart let's see that's a
huge bummer because my kids they talked
to Alexa all the time they know what
songs they like to hear and it doesn't
sound great but you know plug it into a
stereo you're fine but um yeah that's
what they're going on just the sound
quality then I think they're losing I
think the biggest miss here that I
should have got to first is that not
only is it not gonna support multi users
there will be on launch no multi room
support and what does that mean for you
if you wanted to put two home pods in
different rooms you won't be able to do
that and they won't be able to talk to
your phone and play you know different
songs or the same song but the biggest
part about that Apple promoted that you
could buy two home pods to create stereo
sound yeah that will not even be
supported on launch that's a bummer
Google home acts supports that on launch
yeah I don't think Alexa echo did not
got multi room like later maybe like a
year later and and also like with with
the echo platform they've been there for
three years Google home has been there
for like two ish two and a half Fisher
so I I don't know exactly I know you
know we know it's been a while yeah so
this is your entry this is I don't this
is your entry into it at 3:49 I'm not
saying they have to have a cheap
sounding smart speaker I know the point
of is they're trying to say we want to
have the best sounding smart speaker but
is that really a big enough
differentiator for the general
mainstream audience to care like during
the holiday season I can't tell I can't
remember the numbers but we're talking
about in the tens of millions I think
around forty to fifty I don't want to
say out because I'm not sure exactly but
over the Black Friday holiday season the
number one selling stuff alongside with
like air pods what we're smart speakers
yes they were deeply discounted they
knew that Apple dropped the ball they
didn't get theirs out in the holiday
season and so you're talking about $30
$30 us echo minis and Google home minis
just you can't compete with that and
even the Sonos won just today they're
like hey normally our Sonos one player
with Alexa built-in is $1.99 a pop we'll
sell two of them to you that have multi
rooms stereos control for 349 for the
price of one Apple home on that's
they did that today to grind they did
that today so there's competition out
there and this is what you're coming
with like it's just disappointing to me
in the last two years - we just got back
from CES the last two years like you
can't throw a rock without hitting
something that's Alexa enabled inside
inside that place you know it's true and
you know we'll have some phone calls and
we'll answer some other questions about
just the home pod platform there is one
thing I do want to point out is that
peer-to-peer airplay streaming still
exists and what does that mean that at
least allows you to use an app like
Spotify or Pandora and play directly
from your iPhone to your home pod but it
is different when if you don't want to
go in here and then press the icon to
send it over send it over to your home
pod you know we'd like to just play
music on our devices but you cannot
least do that from your phone to the
home pod hmm so that is its way of
getting around to have third-party
support for the actual home pod it
sounds like a little bit of work you got
to do work yes it is also Apple care for
the home pod will be $39 that extends
your coverage to two years the other
thing to know about it much like the
iPhone and other devices you have two
incidents that will be covered like
let's say you knock over the home pod
and it drops on the ground you will have
to pay $39 additional for each of the
two incidents for in order for it to get
repaired huh so 39 to cover for two
years every time you go in the Apple
Store to get it repaired if something
happens it's an additional $39 and you
can do that twice hmm so if you're
really clumsy I you have to be really
clever the last time I knocked over a
speaker
dude don't jinx yourself I know right
like you work around this I know I love
this quote here Tim Cook was recently
interviewed for the Financial Post and
obviously the subject of the home pod
was brought up because this I rant and
raved about it in the show but really
this is we know Apple is late to the
market that's fine but when Apple has
been late to the market in the past they
at least gave us some compelling feature
or some compelling reason or at least a
polished product to bring to the market
all right the the home pod
is the least compelling product on
launch compared to the competition that
I can even remember yeah totally
you're just telling me I should pay a
whole bunch of money for a speaker that
just sounds better a smart speaker that
but is inferior in every other way right
now I'm just saying right now like
before it's even launched it's already
irrelevant I feel like but exactly
exactly
least compelling Apple product launch
that I've seen in my I don't want to say
in my life but I feel like it yes I
really feel like and I'm not trying to
you know throw out this like
superlatively bow of all-time but I'm
really feeling that way
yeah I'm really feeling that way um Tim
Cook interviewed again in the Financial
Post about this he was asking they were
asking him about the home pod because
guess what yeah it's trailing it's three
years late think about how long three
years is in the tech world that's a
millennium you learned so much in that
time so this is what Tim Cook said and
this is his quote we think one thing
that was missing from this market was a
quality audio experience a very
immersive audio experience music
deserves that kind of quality as opposed
to some kind of squeaky sound says the
guy or he didn't launch it but iTunes
who is all AAC files like mp3s
so I mean start doing FLAC files me oh I
forgot to tell you it does it will
support flap that's right I think I did
hear that at least the home pot will
support flack but I do they sell FLAC
files on iTunes I don't actually know I
don't think they do I'm pretty sure they
don't actually yeah yeah another quote
by Tim Cook just in regards to the
competition of everything happening in
this space Tim Cook said competition
makes all of us better and I welcome it
but if you are both trying to license
something and compete with your licenses
this is a difficult model and it remains
to be seen if it can be successful or
not so what is he really poking at he's
talking about the fact that amazon has
alexa built into their devices but it is
also letting other companies like Sonos
and others use it in their devices
that's a good thing to be because right
now they're winning in the smart home
platform
yes I mean both them and Google are
putting their brains in everything then
they don't have to be Apple devices it
almost makes me laugh a little because
look Apple is the king of Licensing they
freaking licensed the maid for a iphone
program that allowed to use a lightning
port in third-party speakers is he
talking about like branding and name
recognition cuz I can almost see that
with Siri cuz series like when it first
came out it was extremely popular now
Alexis catching up you know and like
Cortana is kind of round licensing is
more like letting another company use
your technology in it yeah so like Sonos
is using right yeah I I understand that
but I feel like he's approaching this
comment that he made as opposed to like
a branding you know as opposed to
he's making fun of Licensing because his
brand is so much bigger and Siri is more
popular you know are just more
well-known you know what I mean yeah yet
Alexa is gaining that ground for sure I
think if you talk about the smart home
if you walked on the street again this
is a for people that care about this
because we're in the tech bubble right
we're totally on Cisco right now and
asked thirty people what when i say
smart home what do you think more than
half of them are gonna say smart what
yeah seriously
I wonder if you went on the street and
said Siri or Alexa like what would
people say you know what I mean talk
English boy
speak English so we'll see what happens
again the pre-orders open this midnight
yes I'm going to buy one I do our own
Apple buy it review stuff we don't ever
I don't ever get a early product review
from Apple I use my own money on it and
that's why my reviews speak to someone
who's actually putting down real hard
cash for this that's also the reason why
you don't get invited that's you know
they could they can intravenously feed
everyone else the kool-aid okay let's

like dying right now okay let's get jump
into some of the more stories this week
iPad rumors you want to hear about iPad
stuff oh yeah oh yeah
iPad is working this is according to
Bloomberg Apple is working on a 2018
ipad redesign with facial recognition
now we've kind of heard stories about
this but these are kind of some updated
details Bloomberg had report on this a
while back the new model is going to
eliminate the home button completely but
an OLED display as we've gotten closer
to this is unlikely the latest iPad pro
models have really kind of turned things
around again Apple decided upgrade the
hardware and the software for them and I
told you I pad Pro is my favorite gadget
of I guess the past two years I think my
favorite gadget was the Apple watch
through series 3 from Apple but here we
go with the iPad pro this new one that's
coming out it'll be a redesigned
high-end iPad 4 as early as 2018 it'll
incorporate iPhone 10 features such as
slimmer edges and yes a true depth
sensor camera for facial recognition
we've got a lot of we've got a few calls
about how much people are liking face ID
over time now I think it's really
interesting because it's different from
the first month versus six months later
it really is how use this anyways this
new iPad model that we're believe we
believe will be shown will have a screen
size similar the 10.5 inch iPad pro
including face ID for unlocking the
device making payments and whatnot the
updated tablet is expected released
later in the year but a little more than
what we'll see if it comes out it's got
to come out this year with the with an
iPad pro upgrade so we'll see that but
again no home-button slimmer bezels face
ID on the 2018 ipad redesign it'll be
interesting yeah I think I would talk it
makes more sense to have the face idea
on the iPad it does yeah yeah it does
seems like I mean I wanted more I'm just
thinking about it you want more space on
your screen well it's just how do I hold
I guess I hold my you know what here's
the ears thing I do hold my eye
like looking at it more than I do with
my phone right yeah your phone's laying
on the table you pick it up you want it
just to work instead of like holding up
to your face with an iPad it's already
kind of directed at your face yeah yeah
I mean you hold it up to just get on
into it you know yeah that makes sense
iPhone like sometimes I'll just turn it
on from over here just so I can like
play a song or something yes that's a
little different you are you are correct
sir also a hints in the iOS 11.3
firmware do hint at the fact that we'll
see an iPad with face ID in the notes of
the developer kind of code and files in
there as they were dug into the by
Felipe Esposito a spa Seto
good job man good job man they have
noted that there's a reference to a
modern iPad and the reason why this is
important is because before the iPhone
10 came out it was referenced as modern
iPhone so if you take that knowledge and
you see the word modern iPad in the code
it's most likely not only a new iPad but
an iPad with face ID recognition so I'm
seeing the notch here is that gonna
bother you yeah yeah it's gonna bother
me yeah it's not just not looking pretty
notch my iPad bro it's not my I don't
want to see you know I don't want to see
a notch on my iPad just white why can't
they just make the top just one long
line yeah I mean I mean like they should
have or the iPhone
yeah yeah it's funny cuz it's one of the
most polarizing things I think the
hardcore fans are like whatever Apple
does it's perfect and then there's
people that are like that is so ugly
it's a it's one of the most polarizing
features I think on the I just the from
a visual aesthetic standpoint I just
found Philippe's code sorry I didn't see
that before but here it is Philippe for
people that are listening um enjoy
looking at Philippe's
good yes the modern iPad code you can't
have a show you can't have a comeback
show without iPhone 10 use this is just
some updates people were like tweeting
me Oh Apple's gonna cancel the iPhone 10
they're gonna cancel I'm like slow
you're slow
you're like one of their most popular
ones so far well the you know numbers
are starting to dictate that it's less
popular than expected so this is the
story a cool
- Ming Shi quo KGI securities analysts
he believes that there's been a
reduction in orders for the iPhone 10
because of weak demand or weaker demand
for the iPhone 10 design and that
basically production has caught up with
that demand and could cease to be
manufactured while the kind of the next
generation iPhone tens are coming now
here's the thinking behind it
he believes based on his sources again
this is rumor Vil that the iPhone 10
when the next gen comes out right we're
talking about the second generation
iPhone 10 Apple doesn't want to release
a cheaper lower-cost iPhone 10 because
it'll be like well if it's not that much
difference why do I need it why do I
need to get the new iPhone 10 yes if
it's about the same so the belief here
or the thing here is that they will stop
making the current iPhone 10 and then
based on reports the new lineup of
iPhones will be actually three of them
this was has been thrown out there a few
times but basically the three models
would be a new updated 5.8 inch OLED
based I phone 10 similar to what we have
now but just you know a new processor a
few new bells and whistles there will
now be also an iPhone 10 Plus which is a
6.5 inch OLED iPhone it's the second
article in their Beach I'm trying to
find it's alright it's okay don't worry
this one pusher is your cursor on it
it's this one this one this one this one
no no that one the one below it so
there's a 6.5 OLED let's call it the
iPhones head I would have $1,500 and
then there'll be a third iPhone that
measures in that 6.1 which will actually
be more like a mid-range iPhone with a
similar iPhone 10 design but it won't it
will not be OLED it'll be an LCD based
screen and some rumors are saying it'll
even remove 3d touch but it'll be kind
of like the mid-range iPhone so three
models 5.8 and 6.5 will be Oh LEDs and
then the third model will be a 6.1 inch
one with an LCD LCD based screen that is
what we have right
but that's why it would if you have
three phones in the lineup right now why
put out a cheaper iPhone 10 is the
fourth model when you have all these
iPhone eights and iPhone seventh and six
is like I don't know if you remember but
once Apple released the iPhone 10 they
showed the entire iPhone lineup it was
like 10 : yeah it was like what the hell
is going on here
like it's something for everyone at
every price point yeah the se was like
really it was a big hit for them like
was a sleeper sleeper so they're
probably trying to you know work some of
that magic again they had to actually
source more parts for it because it was
more successful than they thought they
knew they were gonna release a
lower-cost
iPhone but they didn't realize like how
how much how popular yeah I mean so
Apple iPhone 10 rumors here's one that I
thought was really interesting Apple is
getting into the not into but they're
putting a focus back on ebooks or really
you know their iBooks platform according
to Bloomberg Apple's getting back into
the ebooks fight against Amazon taking
them indirectly the company is working
on a new digital book reader app for
iPhones and iPads and also Apple hired
former Amazon and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble exact
specifically to oversee the unit
according to the report this new app is
due to be released in the coming months
it won't be called it won't be called
iBooks it'll just be called ebooks
similar to Apple has like Apple music
Apple podcasts this Apple we called
ebooks
it'll be a newly redesigned application
specifically geared to taking on the
e-book market we know that Amazon has
dominated that they offer the Kindle
platform which I used to be a Barnes &amp;amp;
Noble guy and then I just couldn't and I
was locked into the ecosystem and I
couldn't do it anymore because I'm like
man those Kindles are like so nice yeah
it was sad seeing all the Barnes and
Noble Nobles closing across it I still
go hang out in them though do you really
I do I'm like I'll ah I love I'm so
those guys fun to walk around and look
at work so right now if you look at what
kind of like the market breakdown of the
of who has the dominant position as of
February 2017 Amazon owns eighty three
point three percent
the e-book market Apple is at 9% oh my
gosh and Barnes and Noble is that 4% so
the thinking here is that Apple wants to
redesign their app make a little sleeker
I'll be the first one to say when Apple
released their remember the news app you
guys use the news that have like the
little like shelf like looks like a
books in it oh well that was their book
another news app I'm talking about the
books yeah it have the Shelf that look
at who's a news app see I didn't think I
was gonna use the news app but because
I'm such an iPad freak I use it all the
time on my iPad so I'm not gonna and
when I first heard about like I'm not
gonna use that but I do now so I'm gonna
admit to it I don't think I'm so locked
in the Amazon ecosystem I don't see
myself using this books app but if Apple
could even take away like a 10% chunk
away from Amazon just to grow their
business I think it's a win for them
it's not like they're gonna overtake
Amazon ever or anytime soon and Tim Cook
even put out this kind of not mandate
but he announced that he wants apples
services to generate 50 billion dollars
by 2021 and so what does that mean
services like Apple music is one of them
I clawed is another one the if right now
they're around thirty billion dollars so
in what three years they want to get a
50 billion they have to support these
things right so yeah
ebooks is this ebook update is gonna be
one of them I gotta say I'm loving the
NASA ebooks that they release for iPad
it's super awesome go check them out
they're free - and just pictures of NASA
pictures of space I will say one thing
about apples iBooks they have that cool
thing where when you flip and turn the
page yes it has the page animation and
that's not a reason to buy it or use it
but I'm just saying that I like it now
that is definitely adds a flavor to your
experience a little bit of flavor Apple
TV news we know that Apple is jumping in
and diving in to content galore they
just signed a deal with a straight to
series order with Damien Chazelle for a
series adop do you know who Damien
Chazelle is without this I don't know
who he is
how about I mean I know he is but I was
just trying to build some drama and
suspense for people that know no how
about like the director and producer of
la-la-land
good movie oh yes okay he's like a new
yeah yeah he's like he's made the
musical he's like yeah make a music yep
and he did whiplash ooh well I haven't
seen that one I have to see that yeah
what the one about the drums yeah
drummer yep yep he did whiplash as well
so he's got a straight two series with
Apple that will be coming out or again
Apple and and I think they I think the
announcements that are pitching like two
billion dollars towards investments of
original content we know how big of a
deal this is and when I see they also
sign like a comedy series starring
Kristen Wiig that'll be produced by
Reese Witherspoon so they're getting
people in place to have original content
and I've got you know with that fifty
billion dollar dollar target that we
talked about for services this is part
of that don't put this stuff in Apple
music just create a no yeah no Apple
musics not the place but get that money
Damian yes get that back get that money
get that back and then finally before we
go to our calls you know we know Apple
is still Dilli dabbling in the smart car
you know there are automated hey you
know they're still testing out
autonomous car systems Apple has
expanded this is according to Bloomberg
has expanded their self-driving test
fleet Hey
227 cars as it accelerates its efforts
to catch up with the competition like
Google's or I guess you call them
alphabets way mo self-driving cars they
received a permit to test three
autonomous cars in California but now
they've opened that up and registered 24
more cars here's the thing you know how
we say like Apple sometimes plays
catch-up mm-hmm how many how many cars
do you think are on the road for
Google's division how many cars do you
think they have on the road if ramps up
to 27 what do you think they I got to
say hundreds because I was weird just at
the Detroit Auto Show and it was almost
as if every car was gonna be
self-driving in the next few years so
give me a number hundreds but what I'm
gonna say like maybe 1500 Google cars
that's a lot but yeah I mean you're not
over us I mean they they have what is it
they're testing autumn automated anima
s' cars in six states already including
and you might yeah actually think of the
final number here so you might be closer
right 600 minivans in
Phoenix alone oh my gosh so you're right
you might yeah I don't know what the
final I know
uber has enlist like they're all
everybody's doing it bro last 27 cars
out on the road I do gotta say that when
we're at when we're in Detroit I did
hear a lot of talk about apple carplay
coming to cars yeah it's gonna be in a
lot of cars and there was one car maker
was it BMW that was that was gonna
charge there was a one car maker that
was gonna charge people to use carplay
no there was one there they were just
gonna put it in standard actually and it
was gonna be free oh let me look it up
for you what it was yep
BMW is in order to use carplay they
they're putting out a subscription plan
basically to use the car play feature
which is free to use if you plug in your
phone directly their chart yeah oh so if
you want to have a like if you want to
have internet in your car you have to
buy it that makes sense you know but if
you want to use your phone if you want
to use the car play phone I see a car
play platform it's $80 a year it's like
yeah you you shouldn't charge people to
use car play no no yeah when you can do
it anywhere I mean I understand paying
for internet service to your car yes you
know that that makes sense yes using a
platform yes I'm just gonna plug in my
iphone yes
all right let's uh let's get that damn
calls yeah okay
again Before we jump into them you guys
and gals are a huge part of the show
call us 1-866-376-8255
and regarding smart home assistance so
I'm in the middle of doing construction
on my house and the home renovation and
as we're wrapping up I'm looking into
you know getting smart switches and you
know things like door locks and the
doorbell and the security system and all
that and as much as I like the idea of
you know having an Alexa in the house I
find that if you're fully integrated in
the Apple ecosystem I'm not sure why I
would have an Alexa it seems to me that
apple homekit does all the same stuffs
you can unlock all your doors you can
buy a camera that works with it you can
get smart outlets and things like that
and and so we actually got one as a gift
over the Christmas break and we ended up
returning it because the more research I
did the more I found I you know we're
Apple music subscribers we're not the
type of family that would order things
over voice we've got Amazon - buttons
anyway for you know for the things that
we order quickly so I really don't know
what the advantages are of having an
Alexa if you're fully integrated into
the Apple ecosystem and you'd rather
your Siri and I'm you know I'm just on
the fence still I don't know I know the
home part may add value to that or not
but I'm curious about your thoughts on
it because I know you can add tools and
stuff to Alexa but I just don't really
see what tools we would add that would
be a value besides from smart home and
lighting which we could do with Siri so
anyway love the show and like teri talks
on that Thanks all right love love the
call I think there's an interesting way
to look at this so first of all right
quite honestly fundamentally most of
these smart home platforms are going to
work the same what it comes down to is
depending on the devices that you have
the the main big core companies for
lights what else
switches smart plugs those are most of
the big brands like philips and door
locks and stuff like they're gonna work
together they're gonna be fine on all
platforms but what's different when you
say oh well which one should I choose I
what makes it interesting is part of
building the platform is being first to
market and maturing it over time amazon
has been here for three years
Google Home has been here for two years
so most people at least the early tech
adopters have already invested in a
platform in a system and they're ready
to roll so I'm not gonna say there's a
super flooding like compelling reason to
choose one or the other cuz but I will
say that Amazon when you add the Alexa
when you talk sorry the echo when you
talk to it the Google home when you talk
to it they're smarter you can do more
things think about the fact that just
having multi-user support if you could
call your friend and it new is your
voice but then someone else in your
family wants to call someone else but
that's on their phone book phone
contacts and it does it on its own
that's subtle stuff but that actually is
important the Alexus skills I think
they're actually useful there's one that
I use to go to sleep called ocean sounds
you can't do that anywhere else fine you
may not want to order pizza but I've
actually tested like or you know getting
a car service to come by its and sure
Apple will get that eventually but you
want everything that's already there
they know what's going on they've gone
through all the ups and downs and again
fundamentally smart speaker wise if it's
just the smart home just make sure it's
compatible with your devices but if it's
anything beyond that you can't say that
Apple is a compelling reason so it
always comes down to what you're looking
for a lot of people tell me home pod
home pod I want the best sounding smart
speaker well if you do then get it if it
is and spend 349 it but I think it also
part of is just getting into which
ecosystem first and getting locked into
it yeah I think it's also price I mean a
lot of the stuff that is Lexington able
is a lot cheaper than Apple you know so
if you want to spend a fortune I know a
lot of Apple stuff costs a lot of money
think about this 349 for a home pod or
an Amazon or Google home system that
starts at 129 ish depending and or
cheaper if you get the small ones and
you could buy like three or four smart
lights with it yeah those of saturn's
this and you already have it there yeah
and the system is not even more than
capable they're the top two smart home
platforms yeah totally I mean the
switches are expensive too I mean
you get like one they're like 30 40
bucks but Alexa ones might be a little
cheaper they might have bundle deals you
know I don't know it's just for me it
from you comes down to price and like
ease of use you know but if you're rich
guy you don't care anyone okay
next call what's up beach tonk love to
show you guys got a quick question so I
recently sold my original Apple watch
the thing was just slow now working good
and I'm gonna get a new one
so should I get the series three now or
wait a little bit for the new series for
when do you think they were released a
series 4 and what kind of improvements
could it be bringing thanks guys love
the show well with the actual Apple
watch series for I think the only thing
that is gonna be because I love the
series 3 right now the only compelling
thing that would make me really say I
got a do it would be either a
significantly better form factor meaning
super slim and light and a camera I like
a FaceTime camera oh yeah that's the
that's what would put me there to be
like I gotta get an Apple watch
three-sport otherwise they can't really
do much to convince me that there's a
super compelling better Apple watch
series for like writing those that's
what they'd have to do it the series 3
is awesome I'm just it's probably also
gonna have a lot of health stuff like
but I'm pretty healthy I think you'd be
more than happy with surgery but if you
want to wait just wait it out ok a
couple more calls hey guys bow from
Arkansas just thrown in my two cents on
face IDs versus touch ID I've had my
phone for about a month now and you I
haven't at a point where I just really
wish I had the touch ID back there's a
couple times it's laying on my desk and
I do have to move it to look at my face
but typically I'd be moving it to look
at my face anyway so I haven't found it
an inconvenience
I do lack on how PayPal and banking apps
it just logs you got in when you launch
the app you don't have to push a button
your hold your finger I feel
a more fluid option and I'm enjoying it
on the other other hand home pod it's
it's me because I'm all about Apple but
the price point is the killer because
I'm willing to jump into a new market
like Amazon or Google to try my home
settings without having to pay $350 so
that's my two cents but y'all keep doing
what you do keep it real
we appreciate it thanks I think
over time and even just like we had said
earlier I just don't hold my phone up to
my face every time to unlock it yeah
this call was funny because in the
beginning he said he didn't miss the
touch ID but then he's getting used to
the face ID so and he sees he sees some
positives about that but also he still
misses the touch ID so I think over time
I ended up just using my phone the way I
normally use it and the angles that I
lift it up to normally want to see my
screen unlocked it's not there or even
when you're outdoors and you have it at
a kind of an angle and the sun is
shining bright behind you and it doesn't
pick up you're like that's annoying if
you have a toothbrush in your mouth it
doesn't work I'm just telling you right
now it doesn't work if you have a
toothbrush in your mouth because that's
happens all I'm serious try it have your
toothbrush like here and go like this
it's not gonna work at least not for me
so because of that over time it's
actually become more frustrating and I'm
not gonna train myself to unnaturally
hold it up vertically to my face every
time I want to that's the thing is like
all these new technologies come out and
then we have to like change our behavior
and that's annoying and maybe eventually
the lens on it will be even a wider lens
for the face recognition so that it can
literally look at you when it's on like
it'd be unlocked when it's flat flat on
a table there were even like patents and
mentions in the code that it might do
that but it's become more fresh a lot
more frustrating over time be cool I
can't wait for voice recognition unlock
you just say hey unlock you know
open and it just recognizes your voice
cool all right we got one more left this
is the last call here we go
beating song it's Michael Pruitt from
Virginia I was just calling to say Merry
Christmas Happy Holidays whatever you're
celebrating I hope it's great I hope you
enjoy your time with your family with
your friends and I hope you get some

us tech heads want we want something fun
to play with on Christmas so enjoy it

on the phone like I'll like feel like I
have to move the cable in front of my
mouth and then I'm like oh it's not
there but yeah just being able to work
on the couch and like you know synced
with my computer I haven't run into any
problems really the only thing I did was
I went to the gym and I I'm not used to
how long the battery lasts and one of
them died you know but the other one
kept going so I had one year at least
you know so I'm getting used to it and
like charging them and stuff like that
but yeah anybuggy booze what's like the
biggest Bugaboo for you the biggest
Bugaboo I'm just afraid I'm gonna drop

would be awesome to have some sort of
volume right right like you know I was
time out right just a touch server just
slide down slide down was like I was
trying that because I saw your video I'm
like does that actually work and then I
went and watch more videos seen that
