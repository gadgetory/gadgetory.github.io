Dolby cinema AMC theater it's one of
only a handful in the entire US and it's
a personal favorite of mine because this
is honestly the most technologically
advanced movie theater that you can all
go to today now it starts with this
signature entrance behind me it's 5 2 K
Christi projectors that form a 12 meter
digital entry display those are their
words not mine so let's go check out to
see what makes this theater so special
now it all starts here in the projection
room behind me we have a dual 4k christy
laser projection system and the content
there is designed specifically for Dolby
vision HDR you know that buzzword high
dynamic range it brings 500 times the
contrast ratio pure black levels and
expanded color gamut and twice the
brightness of your normal theater now
this first demo footage shows a white
dot that pops up on there 60 foot screen
it showcases what the industry standard
is right now a 2001 contrast ratio at 14
foot Lambert's and that's really a
measure of luminance then all of a
sudden this new white dot appears
shining over twice as bright at 31 foot
Lambert's and all of a sudden its pitch
black they still tell you the projector
is on and this displays the contrast
ratio of 1 million to one
inside this theater if you look around
the walls are entirely matte black and
that's really to control any ambient
light and reduce reflections but
anything that can be black in here is
black this theater is also fitted with
Dolby Atmos it's the reference quality
sound system that can decode object
based surround mixing think of really
being able to track a single object like
a bird as it moves from one part of the
room to the back and to the front now
just to give you an idea of the layout
here there's five in screen speakers
there's 48 surround sound speakers
placed anywhere within this theater and
then there's four subwoofers on the
ceiling now the seats here are also
totally teched-out
these are leather they're nice and soft
and comfy they recline backwards also
the leg rest pops up what makes these
special is there are transducers in
these seats what that really is is a
speaker that hears a low-frequency sound
think of like an explosion or a crash
and the seats Rumble to the movie you're
actually watching now if you're
wondering these theatres only play to
the movies right now but they are
equipped for 3d ticket prices are a
little higher it is a premium experience
but AMC is planning to have 50 of these
in the US by the end of 2016 but this is
for the video file the audio file is
honestly the purest and I'm one of those
guys who buys blu-ray discs because I
want the best quality available the best
fidelity this is the place to go and I
wanted to show you what makes this
experience special and it's all about
the tech inside
