goodbye to blockbuster stores I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update it's time to bid farewell to
blockbuster stores Dish Network which
owns Blockbuster announced that it is
closing the last 300 retail stores in
the US and it's ending the DVDs by mail
program but this isn't the end of the
blockbuster name dish we'll continue to
run the blockbuster on-demand streaming
video service which competes with
Netflix and it'll still offer the
blockbuster at home service for Dish
customers blockbuster by mail will end
mid-december but the stores were closed
by January however for those of you that
love the experience of driving to a
video store and fighting over which
movie to rent with your family you may
still find some franchised and licensed
stores in the US and abroad
that will keep their doors open and
speaking of old media Amazon introduced
a new program that lets independent book
stores sell Kindle devices and
accessories yeah Amazon is letting book
stores sell the one product that is
destroying their business model and
throwing in a bonus 10% commission off
any ebook that's bought with that Kindle
which comes to just $1 per book you may
be wondering what book store would want
to do this it's kind of like wily coyote
strapping himself to an Acme rocket you
know nothing good can come of it Samsung
is testing out all sorts of new phone
and screen technologies to stay ahead of
the smartphone race this time Samsung is
working on screens that can be folded
yeah
Samsung CEO told analysts that the
company is working on this to happen
within the next two years we currently
do have technology to create a screen
that's flexible and we've seen that in
curved phones and televisions but
folding it in half is a whole other
stunt Google is implementing a new type
of automatic caller ID for Android 4.4
KitKat users starting next year if you
call an Android phone from a phone
number that you have verified in your
Google profile the Android phone will
automatically show your name and photo
on the screen as the caller ID Google is
basically building a
to base for caller ID from its users
accounts it will only display names and
profile photos if you have the discovery
settings switched on so it can be turned
off if the idea bothers you when logged
on to Google click your profile icon on
the far right and then click on account
under phone numbers click view to change
if you want the number discoverable by
others
that's your tech news update but you can
find more details on the show blog
