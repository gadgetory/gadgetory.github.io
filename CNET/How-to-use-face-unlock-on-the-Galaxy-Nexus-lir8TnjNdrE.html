how to a contributor today we're going
to cover how to unlock your Samsung
Galaxy Nexus using the new face unlock
feature that's brand new in Android 4.0
in order to set it up we'll need to go
into the Settings app which you can
access through the shortcut here in your
notification tray and then we'll scroll
down to security tap on screen unlock
and then in face unlock go ahead and tap
on set it up and then continue and what
you'll see here is a portrait of what
your face the area of your face needs to
be placed into in order to set this up
as you set it up these little dots will
quit blinking and once it makes its way
all the way around it'll turn green and
let you know that setup is complete so
I'm gonna go ahead and do that now as
you can see it says my face has been
captured I'll go ahead and hit continue
and then it's gonna run down if first
whatever reason maybe you're not smiling
the right way or you are wearing glasses
instead of contacts that day and it
can't recognize your face you can't set
up a backup unlock method and here
you're given the option of a pattern or
a pin so just for demonstration purposes
we'll just set up a quick pin and we'll
confirm it again the easiest pin in the
world and then you're all done that's
all there is to setting up face on lock
now going forward if you want to unlock
your phone you you press the power
button hold the phone up let it
recognize your face and your phone will
automatically unlock for you yes it's a
bit gimmicky may win you a few bets in a
bar or with some friends but there it is
face unlock feature on the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus make sure to join us over
at how to see Netcom
