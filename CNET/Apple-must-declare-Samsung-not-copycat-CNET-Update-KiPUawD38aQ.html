maps and creepy ops I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update the never
ending global patent battle between
Apple and Samsung can seem pretty
ridiculous at times apple says Samsung
copied the iPad and samsung says Apple
copies their software patents and it
just goes back and forth and back and
forth but you're going to get a kick out
of the latest development in London a
judge says that Samsung did not copy the
iPad but that's not all the judge
ordered Apple to publish a statement
saying that Samsung do not copy the
iPads design and they had to put this
notice on the Apple UK website and in
British newspapers for six months it's
in order to correct any bad impressions
apple gave about Samsung of course this
will be torture for Apple because who
wants to advertise anything about a
competitor but the judge didn't care and
regardless if you're an apple fan or an
android fan you can't deny this is a
hysterical twist to the bitter patent
war now let's just see how Apple chooses
to word the statement wonder if they'll
be sarcastic or put it in size by font
type nokia has promised something
amazing to come on September 7th amazing
in the same sentence as Nokia yeah okay
please do show us something amazing
because I would be thrilled for a change
of pace nokia just posted a 1.7 billion
dollar net loss for the quarter it needs
all the amazing it can get we finally
have a due date for microsoft's baby
windows 8 will arrive october 26 what
you think I was going to mention the
surface tablet yeah no word on that
delivery date and if you're still
hanging on to windows XP or Vista you
won't be able to try the new microsoft
office 2013 because they said it will
only work on Windows 7 and Windows 8 if
you use Bing for maps well you'll see it
slightly better with some higher res
graphics maps will be a more important
battleground for smartphones in the
coming months because Google is
launching 3d views and so is Apple with
its own map app Foursquare users will
notice that merchants can post status
updates to communicate with loyal
customers it's called local updates and
if you checked in often somewhere or
mark that you like a place you'll see
updates from that place in your feed
remember the app highlight it was the
talk of the week when it debuted at the
south by southwest festival and
reactions were mixed it lets you know
who is near you and what you have in
common and most saw it is kind of creepy
without much value but it just came out
with an update it now lets you post to
people who are nearby regardless of any
connection with them so it's designed to
be like a super local twitter feed let
me know if you end up buying useful
purpose for it by emailing me at update
at cnet com that's it for now but you
can catch all the details in today's
stories as soona calm / update from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
