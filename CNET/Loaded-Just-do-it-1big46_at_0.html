account on the heels of the netflix
streaming only movie service it looks
like amazon wants to do something
similar amazon is reportedly looking
into a monthly subscription service
where you would be able to stream movies
on demand like on netflix amazon already
has a video on demand service but you
pay ala carte for that content but if
they really want to compete in this
business they need to get on some
devices where Netflix already is like
the Apple TV or game consoles verizon is
testing a service that would let you use
your cell phone minutes on your home
phone verizon home phone connect lets
subscribers make calls from their land
lines using their mobile phone plans it
would cost an extra 999 per month this
would work even if you want to keep your
home phone number that you already have
