this friday may 15 this week is a very
important week in television the up
fronts were here in Manhattan to join me
today discussing the up fronts two very
special people from tvguide.com first
across the table Robyn Ross is here
thank you for being here Robyn Ross
thanks for having me again uh you are a
special projects editor I am and I'm
just gonna leave it at that am I left
for the first time ever Adam Bryant
thank you for being here sir thanks for
having me it's pleasure executive editor
I want everyone to know we've got top
profile people this is the cream of the
crop this is the top of the cake yes on
the on the desert that is TV I expect
that to be reflected in my check for
this appearance don't worry about that
you just check in with the cashier on
your way out and that gets all sorted
out so Robin Adam I don't pretend for a
second I don't know anything about the
way the television industry works which
is mostly true sure what are up fronts
this is a very important week in
Manhattan for television just what the
hell went on it sure um basically this
week of the years when all the networks
bring all their advertisers to big
theaters in the city from Radio City
Music Hall Carnegie Hall and they
basically say here's all the great new
shows we're gonna have for next year and
why you should spend your advertising
dollars on our network not with those
other guys and so it's always it's
antiquated process sort of part of the
pilot season where people sort of look
at the new shows but it's always the big
coming-out party for what those new
shows is going to be and over the years
you know out people like us sort of come
at it from a press perspective because
we get to see the new trailers and stuff
as well it helps us prepare editorially
right so it really started as an
advertiser thing but it's it's the first
time we get to see and look at you know
what what they've spent the last 3-4
months working on it those networks and
the shows that are going to be on in the
fall or mid season the next year so it's
it's a it's a big exciting time because
everybody wants to celebrate you know
the new shows coming down the pipe it's
so funny because you would think they'd
want to separate those two
things right and is the same thing goes
with what I cover with video games right
you know you have III which is like a
gigantic Expo but it's mostly for buyers
right right but then press comes so the
same thing with up front you're like oh
hey here is press and here are
perspective at you know buyers they
those two people probably want to talk
to each other or maybe the buyers want
to talk to thee to the press so how is
there like a weird dichotomy at these
things how does that work I mean we have
so many precedents through the year that
I don't feel like we're getting robbed
out i mean it's it's not catered toward
the press at all the press gets to come
in and look and they get to go to some
of the parties and talk to some of the
talent right but it's really more of a
dog and pony show for the advertisers
and they really are just trying to say
you know put your money up front with us
because this these are the best shows
actually gonna want your money you want
to want you don't want your ads on these
shows and so then really catered toward
them you know a lot of the parties they
see the advertisers also like taking
pictures with stars of the show so it's
really just sort of a fun cool thing
that they're just basically trying to to
lower those guys to open up their
checkbooks right it's also a lot of the
networks or all the networks present
their numbers from you know the year
that just passed and so they're either
bragging or talking about you know how
they're going to do things better and a
lot of it is catered to there are
numbers and advertising and and why they
should spend and what worked and what
didn't right it's a pissing contest
right every single one of them at some
point says we're number one and then you
see the asteroid with like which demo
day speaking specifically and so
everybody's number one this year and
they all rip on each other's well yeah
that's kind of fun yeah Jimmy Kimmel
always opens up for ABC and he does a
whole sort of roast he also wrote his
own network and his own president Paulie
but then they'll have heard you know
what happened at the other upfront and
already have you no comments and make
fun of the thing that NBC NBC did the
day before that's so funny how every
freaking industry is exactly the same
yeah for example this year Bob
Greenblatt who is the president or
chairman of NBC he brought out Dolly
Parton they're making a TV movie based
on some of her songs from our lives and
so she sang a song and then because
she's relevant right but but maybe
because Bob Greenblatt is like I'm not
gonna
opportunity again he then brought out a
piano and played piano with Dolly Parton
I saying I will always love you
everything he's got and kind of standing
ovation so you know even if he gets
fired if NBC tail totally like to have
that moment like I got a standing
ovation at radio city music oh I think
he took advantage I think it maybe was a
smart move a smart move in the long run
when he gets tanked yeah that is very
strange just to be fair I don't think
he's getting tanked anytime soon yeah he
has really helped NBC they're there
they're one of the ones that his number
one again after being in the last place
forever so you know they're doing
they're doing okay uh in that respect so
but it was it was quite a thing to see
early Monday morning to kick off the
week Dolly Parton singing with a
broadcast chairman that's so strange I
wouldn't know what to do I'd look around
be like is this for real what's
happening so how many did you get to go
to were you at any so I did a lot of the
cable ones that sort I mean the first
one is going back to march is like
Nickelodeon and i did ABC family and I
did USA so I did a lot of the cable
stuff leading up to it and then what
what they have our new friends which you
probably know about right that's the web
stuff digital so I did a ton of of new
friends and then when it came to
broadcast the only one I did was the CW
okay w's my jam so I couldn't miss it
and what the freaking vampire diaries
nine all the time it's just every day
all the time what do you how do you feel
about we'll get back to that way I want
to talk to Adam Ruger get back to
because Adam was there as well and for
the first time ever I think he might
watch a CW show but we can come back to
that but it's not for us let's be clear
not for us VW show although it's created
by one of the people behind the vampire
diaries has no vampires it's the most
adult looking drama they've ever put on
it actually could be on ABC or another
network and it looks really great well
but will get it's called containment
will come to back at me okay we'll
circle back to containment it's not all
vampires and romance it kind of was up
until this container I'm not into they
have a lot of superhero stuff the whole
DC world is not my things yeah they're
really like you know build in that
universe and that's not made of it for
me though and this is obviously you know
industry outsider I look at network TV
and I'm just like oh
the show's look like garbage on network
TV compared to like what I'm used to
like I basically just watch Comedy
Central in FX and I think FX puts out
better stuff than anybody for the most
part yeah I would agree with that
although they've had a slightly suspect
run lately yeah like stuff like maybe we
don't renew married or tyrant or taco
tell you what was that that was that was
coming back at summer we'll see someone
watched it maybe maybe it was a lack of
resources on the bench I don't know so
does so here's a question does the fox
up front contain FX and FX access that
we did this year sort of strangely for
the first time FX has in tightened day
in years past they've done their own
this year they didn't and I don't know
really why and they didn't sort of they
don't do the whole presentation for
effects but like in their opening sizzle
reel they sort of focused on FX and FX X
and National Geographic basically the
sort of the broad umbrella that box
networks now owns okay and so they sort
of referenced them but they didn't mean
the majority of the upfront was focused
on Fox Network which is the big you know
top of the top of the cash sheep I guess
so there was some mention of FX but not
a lot of drill down lies you would have
gotten at a specific FX up front so I
got a bone to pick with Fox um they
announced the show called Minority
Report oh yes and that's one of my
favorite films in the last you know two
decades and then I saw this trailer and
I'm like man in 90 seconds they kind of
ruined that movie for me but what do you
do you have an opinion on this show it
to me it just looks like you know one of
those ugly sci-fi channel sort of see
see rated movie i I don't I didn't have
that reaction I only seen the movie once
and i'm pretty sure that I kind of dozed
off in the middle of it so I like
stirring minority room I mean it was a
while ago and it was just a bad
situation but from what from what I
remember of it uh you know I was sort of
surprised that it's it's not really my
type of thing sci-fi is not really my
jam yeah and I
was I was surprised it actually how
accessible they kind of made it feel in
the trailer as someone who usually just
Tunes it out right away I was kind of
surprised by what it by what it looked
like and what it was about and so I was
intrigued enough to actually want to sit
down and watch the full pilot really
from there but yeah I mean why what what
about it sort of undid the movie ruin
the movie I just think the the problem
with network TV and this is with that
Gotham show to everything feels very
watered-down right uh maybe because like
I don't know it's like no one's dirty if
you never noticed that like there's not
enough thanked gritty Anna yeah there's
not that I mean it just seems like uh
they they don't you know pay the same
amount of attention to detail as they do
on other shows I mean coming and I
always reference FX because they you
know the production value there is sort
of over the top right for a lot of stuff
I mean for some for like the peak years
of sons of anarchy I mean that show was
kind of unbeatable for me and then when
you look at a show like you know Gotham
or even this minority report it just
feels a little cheap cheap there there
little sugar coated and maybe you have
to dumb it down for a generalized
audience I don't know I don't think it's
a dumb it down I think some shows like
you know the good wife or you know
Parenthood there are there have been
some quality dramas and think that
haven't necessarily had to dumb things
down but i do think what you get on
broadcast TV or what i would notice is
that things move a lot faster things
happen more quickly they think because
there's so much advertising money again
that we're talking about sort of dumped
on these networks they feel like they
can't afford to have people change the
channel at all so they heard i keep them
locked in they had to keep them right
there they have to move the story along
they don't want anybody to say on board
I'm changing the channel so I think you
just speed sort of factors in and they
go through things quicker and sometimes
I think that's it at the expense of
diving deeper into characters are
getting a little grittier and more
complex or things like that so it's that
revenue model that actually influences
and changes the very structure of a
narrative sure and I think you can even
see that in basic cable I think when you
have you know AMC putting on Mad Men and
Breaking Bad you know back in the days
they took their time with those shows
and let them build they didn't have to
worry about it but then when they get a
little bit of success The Walking Dead's
and what that comes
on it does you know for better or worse
it changes the way they approach the
business because net mode that's a huge
moneymaker and so they you know HBO
everybody's has gone through this once
they get a little prestige its great but
when they get the thing that really hits
then that's what they're going to try to
sort of go in that direction because
that's where the business just sort of
naturally go so you always want in my
opinion the biggest creative strides any
television shows ever made is when it's
on the ground floor something when it's
new when there was new things get a few
years under their belt they naturally
sort of become more like a broadcast
network just by sort of the nature of
the business of mm-hmm so I because we
got questions about uh people saying
well you know if I DVR a show all the
time like who's benefiting from that
they I mean more and more they are
factoring those things and you know a
couple years ago all the network started
saying you know again to the advertisers
to the press as well don't just don't
just report the overnight ratings
anymore because it doesn't it's not the
same you know when a show ads four
million extra viewers and DVR replays
you know that's that's significant and
so some shows that you know a year ago
or you know five years ago would've been
canceled because their numbers are
terrible they come up in the DVR and
they're like that's that's not it's not
so bad so I think for a while the
networks have been looking at those
numbers and making decisions based on
them and now they're trying to get I
think the people on the outside they're
covering the industry to look at it the
same way and I think for the most part
we still sort of are tied to those
overnight ratings but we do factor in
those things that we're writing a report
about the bubble shows and what's going
to come back or not we say you know they
might keep this one because it adds five
million viewers every week in DVR place
so that it does it does play a factor
now more than it used to hmm I mean
because you know what I always wonder is
like well how is any revenue being
generated right because if your DVR Aang
you know it's the same thing with like
if you have ad blocker turned on on your
wet on a browser right you're not
getting served the ad if you DVR you're
not getting served the ad yeah and I've
seen a lot of networks they're really
trying to push advertisers into their
on-demand platforms yeah you watch a lot
of that stuff the week or we're not you
can't fast borders which is only but but
also as far as the network's concern in
terms of DVR you know once those ads are
sold their souls right there giving the
money whether or not
the advertisers actually getting the
best bang for their buck yeah and again
that's why you might see some
advertisers say I only want to buy the
shows that do really well with live
audiences and they maybe don't spend as
much money on the shows that have a
small audience tuned in but half the big
DVR playback no it's it's it's a new
world it's changing all the time it
really makes our job both difficult but
also interesting yeah see how the models
changing all the time what's crazy is i
don't really think the way we have TV
now with DVR were kind of still in this
you know Wild West period where it's
sort of unregulated you can fast forward
commercials I I truly believe that the
the hourglass is running dry on that I
don't think you will be able to record a
TV show in 10 years and skip the
commercials it's just not gonna happen I
mean what do you guys think I I truly
believe like you will and and I guess
this you know leads into a bigger
discussion but I really think eventually
you know watching a live show will be
this like strange sort of experience
like did you watch them shoot that show
live did you see the first recording of
that I think in terms of watching live
like I know for for me personally a lot
of it has to do with social media like
the shows that I'm really that I like to
be you know present on social media with
I I will won't miss it because then I'm
not part of the conversation when it had
you know if i were to watch 12 hours
later so i think in that respect if
people if social media is still is huge
and still a big part of the
entertainment process like those are the
shows that will still get the live
viewers but then if if you don't care
about being part of that conversation
like that's that's when you'll watch it
a couple days later yeah and i think
along with that not just wanted to be a
part of the conversation but not to have
everything spoiled for yeah i think i
think ABC has built their entire
thursday night around you have to watch
us live or everyone's going to tell you
what happened on scandal and you're
gonna want to kill the internet the next
day and it's actually done well for them
and that shonda rhimes block Grey's
Anatomy scandal had to go with murder in
the fall was just enormous and so it
really worked for them before long
another thing you said about sort of 10
years from now i don't know i want to
put an exact timeline on it i just think
the way things are going the way we
niche sort of platforms or what not will
you have your netflix is in your who's I
think it's just almost somewhere in the
future I think it's basically just going
to be a here's a bunch of content and
just watch what you want think you're
going to be a lot of personalization
just you building your own scheduling
you know part of the up run system
showing you what nice and what days and
time slots things are going to be on and
I think that's not that's going to
matter or less and less i think it's
just going to be here's a lot of content
put it in your box and watch it and will
I i don't have a timeline for that I
think it's going to be a while but I
think that's also the worst going
because you have so many different
people not just networks and cable cut
and channels you know they have you know
PlayStation everybody's you're making
their own programming now and I think
it's just going to be a big web of of
shows and things to watch and entertain
yourself with so what freaks me out is
like late-night the late night guys
where the the you know it seems like a
lot of it is consumed live but then I
find out who had the best night in late
night the next day when I said when I
see what clips are trending and what and
what and what's hot so for me it's like
oh well I saw that live I'm you know
you're somehow like you had a superior
experience but it's very strange it's
almost like these performances that they
get recorded and then everyone sort of
like it you know trickles out through
the internet and and sort of you know
has its arrived yeah I mean it's funny
David Letterman recently he did
interview with The New York Times Sun
Oven his goodbye tour and really said
like he totally missed the boat on all
that like Jimmy Fallon the Jimmy Kimmel
those guys came along and he said that's
kind of one of the reasons he knew it
was time for him to go cuz he's like
that's not what I do and that's not what
I'm ever gonna be good at and he really
doesn't like you still see clips from
his interviews come out but he's not
producing content specifically aimed at
sure that internet generation you know
you have Jimmy Fallon doing all these
bits with Brad Pitt and things like that
so I mean it's interesting I think those
shows aren't just late night shows
anymore they're really aimed at the
internet I think like you said it's
weird it's a weird time I that some
seems like a lot of trouble that I don't
wanna be dealing with um yeah it's crazy
what do you guys I mean we should
obviously disclose I think everyone
knows where it worse where a CBS company
but what are you guys did they do stuff
with Colbert how did how did that yeah
yeah can you um play that out for me
yeah Robin take that one first oh thanks
why would you have like a colbert thing
no but I think Adams avoiding the
subject okay fair enough no watch I mean
everyone like I said ABC has Kimmel you
know a lot of these networks have this
big opening um the one for CBS was
already taped and they did a whole whole
sketch with Colbert and they basically
had him you know about to go out the
door and then he gets stuck watching it
and then he's just binging and binging
on all these amazing CBS procedurals and
then he has a beard and then les Moonves
shows up and you know it's like let's go
it's time to go and next thing you know
they both have beards they've been
binging for so long and there's a dog or
somewhere along the dog has a beard also
nice yeah and then um it was a funny bit
i think he just went on a little ya know
long and and but when stephen colbert
did come out onstage after that i'm sort
of a taped thing that he's led to his
introduction on the stage and i think he
was better there in the live setting i
think the the bit went on a little maybe
too long especially since I don't you
know I I don't personally know a lot of
people who just binge CBS show CBS is
one of the networks that has the biggest
live you know viewership so sure people
are watching those shows when they're on
and maybe not saving them up for weeks
and weeks on the DVR to sort of cram
through them because they probably don't
have DVR as ever you're saying I just
mean I just thought maybe the concept of
the bit was a little flawed to write on
maybe maybe Colbert is a person who you
know would be binging because he's been
busy doing his other show you for a few
years I guess so so the big question
that we've gotten for whatever reason
people think like we have his number on
speed dial but he's actually chained at
my desk right now everybody's just
waiting for you to come back um people
want to know you know the shtick that he
does he did a character for nine years
yeah but I'm one of those people that
kind of don't really buy into the whole
character thing I think Steve Colbert on
Comedy Central was seventy percent his
real character sort of persona and then
thirty percent of that you know
psychotic Republican thing so what do
you think she is probably right and that
was sort of again that was the basis of
the bit with saying i've been playing
Stephen goes but who's the real Stephen
Colbert and so
sort of that he was gonna go out and
find himself that's when he got stuck
watching criminal minds for hours but
yeah I think what I don't want to see
when I'm afraid we are gonna see is uh
just more of the same like you know talk
show it's like when conan went to TBS
everybody was like always going to turn
the world upside down because you know
he's gonna get revenge on leaving being
fired from The Tonight Show and really
what he went and did was the same talk
show that people been doing on those
networks forever and rice that's what
he's good at what he wanted to do so I
get that so you know it's gonna be
introducing Colbert go from that format
where he was talking to America and
playing that character to where he's
having to be the affable guy behind the
desk letting these celebrities you know
she'll their movies and stuff so it'll
be interesting to see if he if he plays
into that sort of making digital-only
content as well and sort of focusing on
doing taped bits like that I want to see
him do more that I want to see I want I
want the best parts of his old show to
transfer but I'm afraid we're still
gonna have to be stuck kind of in that
sort of late-night format that we've
been seeing a lot of for for many years
so crazy to think about what that show
is going to look like very exciting all
right when we come back we got to take a
break we're going to go through Adam and
Rob and have lists in front of them
there's like cancelled shows shows that
are coming back I have a list in front
of you now I'm an expert officially I've

then once that happened I went back and
did some some read some homework some
research okay oh yeah not a big fan well
thanks but what other podcasts do you
listen to I listen to a lot of the
grantland's network yeah yes I listen to
marin obviously and there's a used to be
on the grant one networking that's now
on slate i believe it's the moment with
brian koppelman he's a screenwriter he
interviews a lot of actors and the
screenwriters and stuff and he said it's
pretty good i listen to a couple TV
podcast listen to The Nerdist podcast
you know some of the bigger ones and I'm
not like a deep dive I've started
listening lately to a boxing podcast
called the ropes again boxing yeah yeah
really yeah I've re did you know he's
into boxing I mean I know I'm relatively
new yeah I have a really good friend of
mine shout out to kyle thomas he'll
never listen to this problem he he came
up a couple years but he's been a boxing
fan as long as I've known him and there
was to sort of Brooklyn guys he had
watched her their younger career and
they were doing a big fight in Brooklyn
it was sort of like the king of brooklyn
fight so he was gonna visit anyway so we
went to the fight and then through that
experience i started watching more and
more and he came back for the big
heavyweight title fight the garden a few
weeks ago let's go Jennings and I we
went to that and of course watch
mayweather pacquiao all that so I've
recently sort of become more and more
obsessed with it i'm not an expert or
anything like that but I've been
listening to the podcast trying to to
grow out you know when I get into
something I want to know I won't know
the history sure so I've sort of doing
it in reverse well that that I don't
know how I feel about
boxing just because I don't I like
hockey which has a bit of boxing in it
uh but it's very strange to me that it's
still a thing yeah I mean the thing I've
noticed most and again I'm not going to
be any kind of expert on the sport or
you know the work that goes into I think
they all do work really hard totally
they're amazing athlete but the thing
I've noticed more just about going to
some of these events the way into stuff
like boxing or boxers are so great with
their fans unlike any other sport you
see because a lot of them are just
they're guys who spent a lot of time in
the gym and they work hard and they all
have sort of you know a lot of have blue
collar backgrounds or just they're just
normal people and yeah I don't think
because boxing isn't recognizing the way
that baseball our best they don't have
that inflated sense of ego unless your
loin mayweather maybe you know any i see
people just it coming up to them and
like they stop and pose for like a
hundred photos and they never seem like
it's an imposition to them or anything
like that so i don't know i mean in
terms of the sport itself i I think it's
I enjoy watching it yeah it's it's uh I
don't know again and I'm still too new
to filmmaking branford Grandpop cuz you
know you don't come or you don't come
across people who are like oh I'm brand
new into boxing me yeah you know true
it's true all right but it's an
interesting time I mean going back to
the TV connection there they're putting
you know network TV is putting it on
boxing fights now yeah I new league
called the premier boxing champions
which is a they made some cards on CBS
and the afternoons on saturdays i did a
prime-time cln NBC one saturday night
there on Spike so they're they're trying
to make it not just be the premium cable
stuff anymore and I think it's an
interesting time for the sport or maybe
people like me who are new to maybe jump
into it it's like oh I turned 50 and
then I got into boxing it's weird well
not 59 I wasn't saying you say what how
do you feel about boxing I'm curious
it's not my things away cuz I mean I
love sports yeah wouldn't animal TV
during March Madness like I oh yeah I
grew up playing a lot of sports um more
team sports volleyball and basketball
but boxing I just when I found out that
Mayweather is the highest paid athlete
in the world or I guess I was just like
what I yeah that was my i was like huh
yeah so and it's just not my thing to
watch and I could care less of the fight
the other weekend I've taken us very far
afield from our original topic ya know
the problem i had and that's what we do
on the show it was a hundred dollars
yeah how is that okay it wasn't worth a
hundred dollar here's I'll say this I
spent it my wife took some convincing
but she's also sort of with me has
gotten into the sport a little bit more
which is kind of funny she is not you're
not putting words and I like into it no
she's been she's watched the last three
fights that I've watched you know right
beside me because it's been on the TV or
because your lady funny actively
reviewing together actively she actively
like said let's let's do it you guys had
your own steam cars the man of Jim
Lampley who's the hbos lead commentator
so I yeah anyway again getting
distracted um I don't know where we were
good money yes bae i paid the hundred
bucks i think the thing about sports is
the feeling you want from sports isn't
necessarily the event itself but the
anticipation of what could happen and so
like seriously I the build up to it even
if the fight wasn't good order i think
it was i think just the anticipation of
seeing what you're about to see somehow
it felt it feels like it's worth it even
though it's probably not worth 100 bucks
especially when you know it ended up
pretty much exactly everyone thought it
was going to but don't you think that's
part of like the the con job is that
they they wrap this piece of in
like this you know amazing hundred
dollar box and you're like oh my god
this thing's a hundred dollars yeah I
mean maybe I mean I think it's a lot of
height but again I think I think for a
long time these guys who've been getting
there you know heads bashed in four
years and haven't gotten that kind of
attention of that kind of respect I
think they deserved the money as much as
anybody who sits in a dugout for half a
game oh I'm not saying they don't
deserve the money and they better spend
it quick before they just go to mush
because that's unfortunately kind of
what happens but anyway alright we
digress a little bit with some boxing
but I'm glad we snuck that in because I
was trying to talk about it the other
night the other the other day with a
some of our co-host and they just
weren't maybe on a future podcast when I
guys when I've done some more of my
homework and yeah a little more
well-versed in the game will be chess
more have a buddy who's super into it
and
ever have a conversation with them I
want to punch him i will say seen Cena
fights live is fun yeah just like any
sporting event seeing it live and being
there with the crowd you kind of get
swept up in it so all right I'll take
your word for it there miss Bryant um
all right let's get to the renewals the
cancellations you guys have little notes
on your list surrounding new shows that
are coming okay so these are the new
shows what do we think about new shows
what are the highlights I guess we'll
switch back and forth between you guys
I'll go first I guess the big one that
our users are responded to and this is
gonna sound crazy again we are owned by
CBS but the one that seems to be getting
the most buzz is Supergirl oh yes CBS is
finally getting in on the superhero
craze but just the trailer was very well
received at the upfronts I think
everyone's been talking about it
watching it on on replay stars Melissa
Benoist who is on glee and it's sort of
gonna tell the origin story of that
character you know again I've always
been more of a Batman fans Superman's
not my thing and so Supergirl obviously
wasn't I didn't follow that as well but
the trailer it looked it looked like it
was doing some things well I think the
the tone of it was right i'm not i'm
really i'm just curious to see where it
goes against CBS is known for their sort
of doing their cop procedurals and i
guess in some way this is a person may
be catching bad guys but I really kind
of it's from greg berlanti who has
renovated CW's line up with arrow and
flash those also DC superheroes so I
think it's got a guy who knows what he's
doing behind it I just wonder how it's
going to be received on that network
with that audience if it's gonna if it's
going to work so I don't know but that's
that's when everyone's big talk is been
buzzing about for a while it was one of
the most expected as we picked up it was
and the trailer so far has gotten pretty
pretty positive reviews okay is there
any like so did CBS pick up any more
like acronym shows or no or actually
they cancelled CSI they're going to wrap
up CSI which have been on for 15 years
and totally sort of reinvigorated the
network that many years ago yeah they
they're ending it it's going to be a
two-hour series finale in September and
they're bringing back actually William
Peterson marg Helgenberger they were
there originally they
both since left the show but they're
coming back for the end so they're gonna
make a big event out of that and then uh
Ted Danson Ted Danson who was currently
on the show he's moving over to CSI
cyber which is the latest spin-off of
CSI which is coming back next year so
they're still gonna be acronyms NCIS is
still going strong with three shoes
what's NCIS them for NCIS criminal
investigative service she's like Navy
police it it's basically the csi's of
Navy elevator they don't really do the
whole crime scene science as much
they're just a team of investigators who
saw a naval related goat or something in
DC in LA and in New Orleans currently
who knows maybe we'll get NCIS
Poughkeepsie next year oh man that would
be awesome all right and uh uh Rob
what's your first highlighted new pickup
well we mentioned it will be for
containment obviously that was uh had a
lot of buzz in the pilot stages of what
was going to get picked up it comes from
Julie plaque who I'm you know a big fan
of because she did create the vampire is
in this been off the originals um so and
actually one of the stars in containment
is coming off of a run on the Vampire
Diaries is a really dynamic villain that
everyone loved so I'm excited that he's
getting another show who was bad his
name is chris wood okay um he's great
like someone definitely to look for but
this show is actually based on a Belgian
series and it takes place in Atlanta and
it's sort of pre-apocalypse when there's
like a viral outbreak and basically
there's a cord it and where people are
either stuck inside the court in the
quarantine or stuck on the outside and
that sort of sets the stage for you know
unlikely heroes and people trying to
save their loved ones and I like that no
one's doing that no one's really doing
that yes contain was gonna break some
barriers yeah um it's like pre walking
sort of like walking dead but they'll
build up to what actually happened
before walking dead started right ends
lose like a Walking Dead spinoff also
that's coming on this summer yeah and I
think it's actually gonna sort of walk
in that territory as well I think it's
going to be it's it's it's being sold as
a prequel or it seems to be so as a
prequel and basically I think we're
going to see the virus sort of
and the original show Rick falls asleep
and wake or he goes into a coma and
wakes up in the world awful zombies I
think we're gonna see how that came to
be over in Los Angeles where the new
show is so you have a lot of comic book
fans pissed off at that yeah i mean i
don't know how i feel about it i had a
love-hate relationship with the show I
didn't read the comic books that much I
read some of them before the show
started I think I think there's an
opportunity there i think you know it's
hopefully it gives them the chance to do
more creative things because there's not
any sort of precedent for there's not a
book they're following the room and they
can tell maybe a different kind of
stories i feel like the worst thing
about the walking dead is that they kind
of do the same thing over and over again
they go to a place it's safe for a while
then it's not name on it that's just
kind of how the world works that's how
the book yeah those two it was on and on
forever and so you know I think there's
a lot more danger a lot more uncertainty
maybe a lot more complexity in sort of
the early stages of this we've been
watching these people for years now sort
of wrestle with their you know their
morality as they kill zombies and humans
and maybe it's going to be much early in
the process when right dealing with
those feelings so I have hopes that it
will be different although I'm pretty
sure you're going to get zombies getting
their head smashed and pretty soon
because that's what people love totally
it's crazy especially with that you're
playing with a idea that has this finite
sort of conclusion that you know where
it's going alright so playing with that
is probably an interesting sort of
juggling situation we should note that
containments not on this fall actually
being held two minutes easy which is
only 13 episodes a big trend this year
actually the last few years a lot of the
networks are not necessarily putting on
some of the stuff that looks the best
right in our eyes based on you know a
trailer which is not really the best way
to review these things they're holding
that stuff back to me its season
sometimes it strategic like an NB C's
case they've had really good Falls I
have football on they do really well in
the fall and then they sort of slack off
through the rest of the year so I think
they're trying to hold back some of the
big guns that they have and try to put
those on in January in the spring so
that they can sort of sustain their
number one status right through the
whole year so but so yeah a lot of these
shows some of them are being healthy
yeah another another show that I think
we both are looking forward to or I am
that's also midseason is wicked see I
can't remember you liked it right so we
both had put it on our list it used to
be called la crime we made a list sort
of right prior to all the pickup's of
the shows that we kind of want to see
get picked up and this was on there and
then this is wicked City good City
seeing the trailer just reaffirmed
everything i'm excited for because it is
going to fill the stalker sized hole in
my heart because i am probably one of
like you know a handful people who like
stalker on CBS Oh stalker the show I
thought you were like getting some
stalker fantasy and it also stars at
westwick from Gossip Girl Who I actually
and I from cousin no he I've actually
heard this from an AVC executive that
like this is gonna be the role I mean
he's kind of unrecognizable I mean the
show takes place in the 80s I like that
it's a limited it's supposed to be a
limited series so a lot of the people
mover technologies yes if it carries on
it'll be a whole new case correct you
detective model or Fargo they're gonna
redo it all right gotcha American Horror
Story so a couple of people signed on or
signed on for you know one season only
and and that's also nice because got you
go into it knowing there is going to be
resolution at the end of that first
season if it is you know gonna move on
to another story but you know basically
he's a serial killer in Los Angeles in
set in the 80s it's sort of gritty
Sunset Strip kind of feels like drive a
little bit already then the script has
lots of call out for Van Halen song to
be played so yeah there's a lot of
scenes that take place at the whisky so
there yeah it's said in that world it's
actually the conceit of the series is
that it's actually all about sort of la
crimes new year I think some of them
will be maybe invented some will be
based on real crimes this one is again
about a guy who has killed a lot of
young women and the cop is trying to
catch him but then twist along the way
is that one of the girls he's dating is
also kind of crazy so there's like a
Bonnie and Clyde serial natural born
killer sort of thing okay yeah alright
sounds sounds interesting choice for
cheeks yeah definitely a little more
Alex to that well I am not the biggest
viewer of
network TV comedy or really any comedy I
like I you know I like to laugh I just I
make priorities for drama no i don't i
mostly time we were all that thought
Adam we have to we have to pick this
bone what do you mean you don't like to
you know like joy I ever liked to laugh
I love to laugh everything i watch on TV
you not live watching berries hey not
less hello I'm because I'm too busy
crying and sobbing and you know wishing
for that's why you need the palate
cleanse your to saw no I well I don't I
don't know watch comedies either to be
fair neither of us Goldberg's I do I
don't watch some comedy I don't watch
Goldberg's I love so good baby I'm good
the Goldbergs I really really enjoy but
also i'll watch a lot of dramas that are
also really funny the admin it's one of
the funniest shows on TV regardless of
how serious it takes it so breaking bad
was darkly funny and sure well I I I
appreciate comedy it's just not my my go
to see me there's very hover on Sunday
when I catch up when all the things
there ought to watch on TV I'm gonna
watch every comedy everybody I grew up
watching friends yeah cheers and cause
me and all that stuff you know I I have
a place in my heart for TV comedy it's
just not as much of what I do day-to-day
now in this job well and and I don't
really watch the broadcast comedy
broadcast TV comedy there's besides
Goldberg's and maybe modern family which
is oh my god it's enough ready yeah that
show but um yeah cuz none of it's funny
it's not funny right no I'm really
laughing it it's it's a hard thing you
mean the reason you get these shows that
are you know still watched like Francis
on forever because they got the formula
right and it's hard it's a hard thing
it's about chemistry it's not the right
cast I think Parks and Rec had that cast
and I thought it was really funny show
when I when I was able to watch it but
it's a tough thing but anyway what I was
saying despite my aversion to watching
TV comedy I think two of the most
interesting shows this year on fox and a
sort of a nostalgia throwback comedy
block of John Stamos starring the show
called grandfathered where he's sort of
the quintessential bachelor who then
finds out not only does he have a son he
never knew about but that son also has a
child so he's all of a sudden gone from
bachelor to grandfather he's too
good-looking
more than when paired with that the only
other guy who you think could follow
that is Rob Lowe I'm not age right right
right he's starting the show called the
grinder he's basically that actor has
been on this he's been on a TV show
playing a lawyer called the grinder for
eight years his show gets canceled and
he decides to move back home and take
over his family law firm because he's
just convinced he can be a lawyer
regardless of whether he's in training
Fred Savage from The Wonder Years plays
his brother who actually is a lawyer and
kind of gets upstaged by his better
looking older brother cool so it's a
really you know the trailers for both of
those are really charming I think they I
think the nostalgia factor for John
Stamos is harder than ever with the
netflix picking up the 40 so I think
it's gonna be good and the show seemed
to actually have the goods in beatbox
building their comedy block around that
those two shows on 20 nights so I'm
anxious or eager to check those out
mm-hmm okay you're really good at
selling these show ya know I'm psyched
I've been sitting in these rooms all
week listening to all the buzz words be
just becoming the man is the parent
that's it they told me it was good i
watch the trailer I'm convinced now so
uh you have no comedies on your list ah
what I'm assuming no I don't uh although
although I this is kind of I guess it's
a comedy one thing that we're both sort
of interested to see how how it does so
the CW picked up a show called crazy
ex-girlfriend it was originally
developed at Showtime as a half-hour
comedy it's now going to be an hour
musical type of show but its stars
Rachel bloom who actually lived with one
of the girls in broad city she was
telling me so she and you know looks
sort of his in that world it's paired
with jane the virgin which is virtually
CW's only non supernatural type of show
so it's a great pairing it's definitely
it's definitely out there in terms of
the musical aspect I have no idea how
it's going to work she watching then one
show where that's worked I mean will CLE
lasted you know how everybody's it is a
bet I so they did I'm not a musical
person
oh d so randomly breakout and yeah okay
it's bolaño production on thursday yeah
there's a lyric about a pretzel and then
a giant press l 20 feet it's also an odd
probably like in tongue-in-cheek in a
way to like how ridiculous it again it's
just a trailer so we don't know what the
execution is in the actual pilot and
she'll get cancelled just from a trailer
is that from the reception yeah I don't
know I mean but the premise of the show
is basically she had this crush on this
guy in high school who kind of rejected
her she meets up with him later when
she's sort of successful in Manhattan
and he's like I'm moving to this weird
small town in California moot you know
if you're ever out there come see me so
she packs up her whole life and moves
out there for this guy and it's that
sort of the idea so yeah she's a crazy
ex-girlfriend or whatnot so I'm really
not sold on it I am more want to watch
it just for the the fact that the crazy
factor yeah of what the pilot what the
trailer made me feel when I saw it I I'm
not sure how it's gonna work but I'm
intrigued just see what it is cuz it's
one of it whether it's a success or a
failure it's gonna be something unlike
anything else is on TV right here it
sounds like broadcast rubbernecking is
what it sounds like I just can't look
away from this disaster I have to watch
it yeah um another I mean I'm not all CW
though the other thing I believe that
yeah well my other jam is i love the
sort of dick wolf i love chicago fire in
chicago pd and there's now gonna be
Chicago med um which was acting city of
all she comes well in the same way
there's also going to be a criminal mind
spin-off and so both were sort of head
back to our pilots which basically means
an episode of the show it's stemming
from this season featured and introduced
those characters that you know had it
tested well which they obviously did
they then you're you've already met
these characters and then you go off and
they'll have their own show both of
those spin-offs i mean i i've been
watching criminal minds since the
beginning and then Chicago PD and Fire
I've sort of come to this year or maybe
a little bit last year so both of those
I'm actually excited for just you know
pretty much because I do like the
originals though alright let's be
sticking with medical drama there's that
was sort of a big trend this year yeah
see in addition to Chicago med they also
picked up a show called Harbor
which I'm not endorsing at all medical
show heartbreak she's a thoracic surgeon
she's a heart surgeon so yeah that's my
thing it's like it looks bet it's it's
my it's my personal bed for the first
show cancelled this year but I don't
know if you guys have like cool like
office pools we're working on it yeah
let's talk about it we see the actual
pilots for me yeah I mean I go to a TV
get do you ever have like Death Watch
like that sort of thing shows that are
on the bubble later on informally we do
that but you should totally do it
formally by CBS also has a medical drama
this year called code black I like the
script Robin did not yes we both read it
just the pilots around before got picked
up it has the it felt like it had the
energy of ER to it which is as medical
drama that I really did like and again
that you could say that that seems
repetitive to go back to that place and
maybe it is the trailer did not to me
didn't seem to it give me the same kind
of feelings I had about the script right
but I want to see the whole pilot the
trailer was well received by others it
didn't quite hit me the way I hoped it
had but it stars Marcia Gay Harden she's
sort of the the main doctor and she's
she's got a tragic backstory that makes
me want to save lives and it's basically
the whole conceit of that show is that
they were working at sort of the busiest
ER in the country and basically code
black is when sort of if they're so full
of patients that like all the bets are
off and everyone has to sort of all
hands on deck put them together this
constant chaos guys they're trying to
avoid getting to code black and I'm sure
they probably will fail in that every
single episode you know what's gonna
happen right here's how that shows gonna
work and you guys already read the pilot
yeah but it's always they're gonna
they're gonna it's gonna start right not
every show opens with credit they stitz
going to start and then just like that
schmuck with the glasses on CSI which is
gonna be like dr. weir a coal-black well
in the right ones gonna roll think it
happens at the end of the first or
second acting yes eyelids yeah um but
but we'll see it i think i liked about
the script was that despite all the
chaos in the intensity there were some
emotional beats that I think landed they
landed okay in the trailer but i think
you know it'll depend it's hard to judge
any show on a trailer even the judge on
a pilot because so much happens and
concerns with setups coming together
so you know but it's a it's of the the
medical dramas that i read in the run-up
to this season that's why i like the
best and it got picked up so we'll see
what happens alright we've got good
black doctor what's up so there's a huge
list here and we're gonna put it up on
will link it in the show notes later
today if you head over to cnet com / the
404 real quick before I want to move on
to some cancellations and then we're
gonna start to wrap things up what uh
what's the players have anything to do
with the movie no no that's actually
it's a new show okay DC that's from the
same people who did the blacklist okay
so it's a really high octane thriller um
it's it's kind of a weird concept that
I'm not quite sure if that my head
wrapped around basically philip
winchester who was in a Cinemax show
called strike back which is again really
action-packed he's like a former
military guy who's now security
specialist anyway his his wife is killed
and he's recruited by Wesley Snipes tues
we found him he to be what they call the
player they have this sort of weird
setup where he and another lady ah they
bet on crime and basically it's
basically conceived for this guy to go
out and stop different bad guys every
week because it's a procedural but the
whole gambling can see it's set in Las
Vegas I don't understand exactly how
that factors into the trailer doesn't
make it clear how that factors into the
story all that well but it does look
like if you if you're into sort of the
muscular thrills yeah blacklist I think
you're gonna find a lot to go with that
show and they're putting it on right
after the blacklist on Thursday night so
it's going to be sort of a two-hour
block of that kind of show so you know
again a procedural a big hunky guy
catching bad guys and Wesley Snipes in a
three-piece suit why not it but speaking
of movie actors and and movie
adaptations we said Minority Report the
other one is limitless right which is
give me on CBS and they've said you know
Bradley Cooper's in the pilot they've
sort of said bit you know pending
availability he might appear again but
then again it's it's based on in that
movie right now that's interesting that
he can use he basically takes a drug
that sort of makes him the smartest man
in the world or something like that so
once this new guy
does it and the pilots a different
character right I guess Bradley Cooper's
sort of showing him the way I'm offers
him the pills somewhere once he takes
the pill his when his brain works the
FBI is like oh we'll just use him to
catch all the bad guys sort of the CBS
is latest you know Sherlock or Patrick
Jane to the mentalist sort of a really
smart guy catching back so is a
superhero detective yes some capacity
you'll notice also the other trend of
reboots I don't know if you saw coach
the my rights when Uncle Buck will
choose what is based on the movie no le
reve it but yeah so they mean nostalgia
is just that's crazy i'm obviously
looking forward to the Muppets because
yeah it's the further aft at the trailer
I don't yeah I mean there's no
organizers are pretty good here's my
question are the Muppets gonna be there
for the TCA panel or is it what you see
a pen so twice a year there's a group
there's a function called the television
critics association winter and summer
press tours and basically as I was
saying earlier you know the upfront we
have our moments that aren't you know
about the advertisers they basically
it's about 10 days in a hotel ballroom
in LA where all the networks sort of on
a different day bring all their new
talent or they do like big panel
discussions of cooperatives and then we
sort of we can get them on video do you
want to have Kermit the Frog will be
available for uh well I'm just curious
because you know I mean who else there
maybe Jer I mean air burned uh well yes
but bill preity who is the second
producer of big bang theory is behind
this sort of reboot break and they're
promising that it's going to be sort of
a more adult version of the Muppets
which I don't think means it's not aimed
at kids but it's it's gonna sort of it's
going to poke fun at sort of the modern
family office mockumentary style of okay
we're telling and it's actually gonna
delve into their personal relationships
more cool expect to see some Kermit
piggy drama right i mean what Muppets
always like she is as well it was not
just like sort of the variety show that
they used to do in the bat in the past
it's gonna be more a narrative story I
think involved in these characters so
but the trailer had all your favorites
in there you know Fozzie's there and
Swedish Chef all that stuff so fuzzy
babe it's the animal our boss loves
animals
why not and then all right real quick
though the strangest debut first what's
the weirdest show where you're like how
could this work I know talk about the
ex-girlfriend show that sounds crazy
enough um can't what I'm blinking the
name the tattoos uh blind spot yeah but
you know it's it's funny it's it's a
weird conceit but I think it's gonna
find an audience it's basically it's
kind of like the board identity meets
prison break she's basically this woman
woman is found in a duffel bag in Times
Square tattoo the lawyer she's naked but
she's covered in tattoos all right they
mean for you have you know she has no
memory of it course not they wiped it
yeah and then slowly she begins to
realize that she knows kung fu and she
speaks Chinese and so she looks like
memento a little bit yeah sort of so she
sort of becomes like a special ops a
person who again helps them catch bad
guys because there's some big conspiracy
that's tattooed all over her body so she
got dumped in Times Square where there's
where there's no cameras anywhere right
right yeah nice okay look at my two
points but yeah it's it sounds kind of
crazy but I think again it looks like
the kind of thing that could catch on
and they're putting it after the voice
which is their best time slot they have
on it is true and that's where they
launched the blacklist to success a
couple years ago and it's getting that
time slot and again it feels very action
packed in the same way so we'll see
given credit for taking a chance right
or at least it's not something you've
heard of before you know yeah and it's
not there also rebooting heroes thing
about heroes in the fall yeah nobody has
for that and that's about uh so the
cancellations uh and and shows that are
ending are there any like big sort of
surprises on this list and again we'll
link to in the show knows anything likes
that's really sort of well then adding
them in I mean the Mindy project was a
big one there's a crow yes today I mean
they officially announced just like few
hours ago that it is getting picked up
by hulu but i think you know the ratings
had sort of suffered over the years but
i think people were sort of surprised i
think there was a big fan outcry
probably the biggest one this year was
for revenge which had been off for four
years that show to me went off the rails
a long time ago but it's still what
audience it had left was passionate
and you know our colleague Sadie she
wrote about the finale and thought they
really felt kind of rushed and silly at
the end which to me it always felt silly
but I think there was some
disappointment there with that one and
also as a new show on ABC called forever
which a lot of people had sort of
latched on to its ratings weren't great
but it did get the ax and there's been a
lot of tweets in our direction people
hoping to somehow president that one and
maybe they will I don't know that that's
still that was about a guy who dies
and wakes up in the Hudson River
everytime he dies and he can't die so
maybe maybe he will live on somewhere
else I don't know i don't hate that yeah
that feels a little john Baldacci yeah
he was also using those powers to goth
crime though is it's always using powers
of solder that's it cuz what else do you
know no one ever has fun at robs banks
and does cool stuff they're like no I
gotta save the world alright we'll take
one more break and then we'll finish
things up with Robin and Adam stay tuned

why don't we they don't include us in
any of this stuff did you guys ever get
to like have fun with like a new front
door an upfront or something like that
yeah in Valle we going cover them
anymore like but like we don't get a
ticket when you get a ticket to go to
the event you get to go to the party
yeah there's rubble there's their
sliders and sushi just rebooted did you
guys rub elbows with any like big any
big-time celebrities where maybe you had
like a starstruck moment I really I mean
it's hard for us to get really
starstruck because I mean we deal with
it all the time you just I mean I'm just
always with babies people so come on no
thanks but you know there are people
that we over the years covering
different shows I've sort of formed you
know I wouldn't call them friendships or
even relationships but just people you
see a lot your inner i saw the Gotham
cast and I've sort of talked to Robin
Lord Taylor who plays ping gonna show
talk to him a few times to the season so
it was good to see him bid Mackenzie the
star that show I covered for years on
Southland you know the best one on that
show is who's that is he still on it
Donald yeah I love him yeah he's great
he was on my favorite show ever that got
cancelled after one season your ears yes
there is not even need to like great
show how good was that so good i was so
chairs was worn cherry no it was a Sean
Ryan yeah right all right and the guy
who wrote oceans 11 right huh love that
it was a great show but but you know it
had a per pound of perfect ending it did
it's almost contained in that sucks but
it yeah it was a great show if you
haven't checked it out it's on netflix i
would feel so if not i'm sorry for lying
and what the hell neff looks like reboot
that show if you're looking for
something um so what about you romney
any celebrities that you're like no I
mean I did the these all have red
carpets that we tend to not necessarily
go to but I did the CW one just because
they're they're all their finales are
sort of this week and next week and it's
a good place to get scoop you know the
vampire diaries cast I've been
interviewing since probably since season
two and rock yeah and the emission they
see Robin at the end of the carpet oh
god here we go again you roll their eyes
no it works to my advantage
they don't want to you know I mean short
long story short you know what their
major character just left after six
years so it's a big story point which
one unit dobrev who you know and used
today Ian Ian just got married to the
rumors about him doing press but sure
you know I again I've been interviewing
him now for so many years so you guys
hug and you can't really hug I mean
ketchup um but no you huggin like it
takes a while to let go and he's like
okay someone good know if anything's be
obviously oh really um but no I so he's
now happily married he is sounds like it
um but you know like ABC ABC family was
fun because um you know this they put up
the music as soon as the presentation
ends and you got all the four Pretty
Little Liars like literally start
dancing in the middle the dance floor
and it took like a couple minutes for
the ad sales people to realize it was
them and then they like beeline for
pictures so I mean you you see that kind
of stuff but you know we kind of sort of
head out really early on a starstruck
moment yeah actually wasn't even there I
watched the presentation on the live
stream but maybe topping Dolly Parton at
NBC was the end of NB or ABC's
presentation they brought out Montell
Jordan to sing this is how we do it when
with rewritten lyrics about ABC that was
a team this year this is how we do all
of their cast was on stage also dancing
or whatever what she gets for something
like that I don't know but it was yeah
either he probably does it for free
because this is like the biggest
promotion he's at in 10 it's like my
Spotify numbers gonna go through yeah
again assuming it wasn't a track he
still still had the voices it was way so
I don't like that who had the best up
front who won I know and yeah I know
it's tough with CBS CB who but that
aside looks like based on content based
on the shows that i'm most likely to
check out i'd say ABC yeah the most
shows i'm genuinely interested in income
and their present mean all the
presentations are slick and they're in
big theaters they have all these
graphics and whatnot so you know it just
it just depends but i think in terms of
content ABC and again on the comedy side
FOX NBC and CBS we're kind of they were
what they were but you know you sure
opinion yeah i mean i think i was a bc i
was into a lot of stuff i was surprised
by the is it the family yeah we were
both i think a little bit like oh that
actually looks really good so i mean
yeah i would say i would probably agree
with that that's also a midseason show
yeah just a quick hit it's about a
politician whose son goes missing when
he's young and shows back up when she's
about to announce she's running for
governor but it may not actually be him
it could be some sort of conspiracy so
it looks sort of mysterious and twisty
but Joan Allen stars and that she's
great always has been great so you have
that one really intrigued me that wasn't
my favorite trailer us although times I
hadn't actually read that script so I
didn't know what to expect and that
trailer I think really worked how can we
do well how come we can never I know
this will never have we can never have a
show like black mirror be on a broadcast
you know us broadcast network why like
why can't we have nice things like that
I don't know I mean those brits man
they're just weird how good is black
mare you like black i I've seen a little
bit of it and watch more on deficit but
again it's on netflix i think again it's
gonna be no I know go in at all it makes
your own network it's all been
globalized we get it but like do you
have you watch black mirror you haven't
had the pleasure I don't know I don't
watch there's no vampires in at you I
don't not into british shows there's
nowhere it's not even a british show
just people have British accent I'm
gonna do the looking for again I'm a
madman a guy I've been talking about a
lot out that Jon Hamm did a couple
episodes did he did the Christmas oh
there's a new Blackmer I I mean I don't
know maybe it's that one out that what
you're saying I don't know I I know he
did something did the created the
Christmas special which you have to find
you're on your own wet terms right but I
thought he was doing two or three with
me was the Christmas special longer it
was like an hour and a half okay so
maybe that was it but it was a damn good
yeah I haven't see her all good I'm nama
I don't I don't do those alternative
methods we go so no it's just that you
have to get a real fancy antenna yeah
real fancy hang out of your your
apartment exactly pointed toward the
other side of the Atlantic so we got um
we got some questions from viewers and
here's one that I don't even know if you
have an answer to it but I'm just gonna
lay it out there a lot of our listeners
want to know how to like modify stuff
and like do DIY stuff but do you have
like a TV watching like hack that you do
like oh you
a lot of people know this but you can I
mean I know it's a very specific and
strange sort of thing but is there
anything that like you as professionals
in your industry do you have any like
pro tips for people because for me like
I get what were you say I mean this is
not a hack at all but I mean now I have
I have a roku so obviously I can access
everything now and then actually have a
new pretty new DVR it's time warner that
does you can record for shows and watch
a fifth which is you know has completely
changed everything changed everything so
I mean all that stuff is kind of you
know anyone can do we're actually the
worst people to ask because you get a
lot of things yeah we don't want yeah
sometimes I'll watch stuff you know
three or four weeks before it airs and
so it makes life easier to not have to
watch everything the night it's only
yeah so so my pro tip would be to become
a total a journalist and that's a very
is actually the answer I liked actually
for the screeners I don't know and it's
a great job but you know it there are
probably other ways to make money in the
world that might be better for you I
don't know but no they say journalism is
dying but you know it's it's not it's
it's is it like boxing is here to stay
right on um so what about like what's
your what's your personal setups like at
home do you have like a command center
you're like a battle station where you
like set up shop and go to work judios
right ahead room is my my home ya know
so again I just have one big TV i have
my DVR I have a Roku I um yeah and
that's pretty much and I have like you
know some once in a while if I have a
screen or that's only online like where
I have a link to i'll use my hdmi cord
and plug my computer my laptop into my
TV so I can sort of watch it on my big
TV but so it's not like I'm picturing
this like it's not that but I mean you
don't have like a command center know
and like assume the position you get
locked into it's really nice yeah we
have tvs &amp;amp; dvrs at our in our office
from here as well so I mean I have like
three I guess three screens at my my
desk here in the office was at my laptop
my screen like I do double screen and
then i have my TV DVR
so with a lot of what are your like pet
peeves when you want you have like a
like because for me if anyone talks to
me during a show i freak out yeah some
especially something during like Game of
Thrones we're like every line of
dialogue is very critical yeah yeah I
mean yeah it's it's my mom it's just me
and my wife and we are my command
station just on the couch and we have a
normal-sized television yeah but the
giant thing everything but she generally
if she's watching something she's she's
as engaged as I am so she doesn't talk I
remember very clearly being at my mom's
house though we were visiting for the
season 5 finale of lost and I just told
her up front I was like you haven't ever
watched this show you're not going to
any antennas like so either leave or
just don't say a word because you're
gonna ruin everything so so yeah that's
a big pet peeve but I think that's
normal so if you don't want to enjoy
something you don't want to be talking
through it all again let's pretty much
why I don't go to the movies anymore
yeah you know it just does it yeah I
will tell tales of theaters to my
children I know I almost always go to
the lincoln center theater on 68 street
broadway because the demographic gets a
little bit older right generally more
respectful though they say to do yeah
they say go to like another time I know
like retire like a retirement community
and the closest theater to that
community that's where you should go
yeah yeah I found that to be true it's
remark although I did see the fault in
our stars for some reason on opening
weekend there with a bunch of 30 well
yeah and that was the work you have to
go to the one you have soda the one on
eighty-fourth and broadway that I now go
to where you get assigned seats and you
can recline all back and you don't have
to get there early because you already
have your seats that's a high near me I
want to go to one of those theaters
where they serve a whole meal like yeah
I've done that yeah that's starting to
become at alamo drafthouse there Spence
attracting ah depends I ended up in
malaya like when the mozzarella sticks
come I'm not gonna be paying attention
wonder how the waitress I really need
your order that's a tough man yeah I'm
not trying to make like a five hour
excursion you know I don't want to eat
through the whole movie or else come out
of you rolling out of it
just a little snack it needs to be like
that needs to be like vacuum tube to you
