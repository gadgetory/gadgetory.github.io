with our iphones and we share them with
whatever device we have handy well now
we're bringing together photos with
iCloud so that every photo your tat you
take are available to you on all of your
devices we're not only preserving the
common organization edits you do to all
of your photos for your consistent
iCloud photo library but your device
actually has access to more photos in
the cloud then it can physically store
locally so you can get at them all
wherever you are now of course if you
have this many photos you want great
search and so we now in iOS 8 photos we
give you great search suggestions for
instance of locations photos taken near
where you are right now photos taken a
year ago today photos taken in your home
but we also give you search and so that
search lets you match on things like
location time and also on albums that
you've set up now we also help you
perfect your photos with great new smart
editing controls so we have special
smart controls for light and color and
also for things like Auto straightening
and cropping I'd like to give you a demo
of our new Photos app now all right
let's take a look at photos so here I am
in my large cloud photo collection and I
have great search here so I have all my
suggestions but I can also start typing
and you notice I get matches on location
and time period but also an album so
here I have beach day with Mandy I can
tap right in there look through these
nice photos let's take a look those are
good ones now that's a photo that I
think has potential but it's really
quite dark and kind of washed out but
fortunately we have these great smart
editing controls that I can use to fix
it up so I'm going to bring up our
levels you notice I have levels for
light and color down there at the bottom
I'm going to tap on light and I get this
great smart light meter now I can just
drag this across like this and it
lightens up the photo really nicely so i
dial that in just the way I want what's
happening under the hood is really
amazing you notice that to achieve the
lightning effect it brought brightness
and contrast up exposure and highlights
down and shadows up based on detailed
image analysis of what would achieve
that effect now I could go in and I
could manually try to tweak those
parameters like have that level of
control but I don't need to because it
does such a great job and I also have
that control for color so I can just
drive up the color for instance bring
out the sky and the skin tones and a
look at the difference of what we've
been able to achieve before after it's
really awesome
now what's really great is that my edits
of course immediately went up to my
cloud photo library and so they're
available to all my devices so let's
take a look on my iPad so here's my ipad
now I'm gonna go into my favorites album
and we notice that right now in
favorites I don't have that picture
because I didn't favorite it but now
that I made those nice edits the picture
is looking great I think I'll make it
one of my favorites i'll just tap on my
iphone on the little heart and you
notice that it appears automatically
here on my ipad so i can go into that
photo right here now we have those same
editing controls tailored for ipad
something to go in to do a crop I do a
kind of extreme close-up crop here like
this hit done and of course these
changes are gonna go up live to my
iCloud photo library and they go right
across to my phone
of course you may be wondering what
about the mac well good news we are
working on a new grounds up photo
solution for the Mac built with iCloud
in mind now it's going to be shipping
early next year but I'd like to give you
a sneak peek now all right so let's take
a look at photos so you see I get
beautiful buttery scrolling here I have
my moments right here I can pinch out if
I want from moments to collections and
all the way out to years I can scrub
through my photos like this even in your
view if I find a photo I like just let
go and I'm zoom right in you watch as I
magnify this photo the interplay with
the title bar it's really gorgeous I'm
gonna go ahead and browse through these
a little bit now here's a photo that it
looks really like it's got some
potential but it could use some
brightening up can have these same kinds
of adjustments you notice here I have
these light and color meters well I can
disclose these controls so we can watch
what happens in real time as I make the
lighting adjustment and notice how some
of these are going up and some are going
down to create this effect it's really
great I can do the same with color let's
just boost the color bring out the sky
bring out the skin tones and it's that
easy the new Photos app to really create
beautiful images and that's a quick
preview of photos coming to Yosemite in
the future and to the new photo solution
with iCloud photo library coming with
iOS 8
so now in iOS 8 you get all your photos
in your organization cross your iOS
devices and soon with your Mac and via
the web windows as well now this is all
your photos and also your videos and
these are in their original format and
their full resolution now this uses your
iCloud storage so your first five gigs
are free and we have some great new
affordable plans coming where you get 20
gigs for just 99 cents a month and 200
gigs for 399 so we can all afford to get
all our photos safely up in the cloud
that is photos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
