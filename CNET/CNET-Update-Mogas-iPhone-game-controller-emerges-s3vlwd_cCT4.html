game controller I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update we have an
early look at another type of iphone
game controller thanks to photos posted
on twitter by the account of leaks
created by moga this controller hugs the
phone for games played horizontally it's
reported to have a built-in battery to
charge your phone while you play games
and the left and right sides come
together to close when the phone is
taken out you'll also notice it has two
thumb sticks which is unique from the
more simple game controller that
logitech is reportedly working on shown
here when microsoft unveiled the latest
surface tablets it also showed off some
upcoming accessories like a power cover
and a docking station which were said to
not be available until next year but as
it turns out the docking station just
went on sale now for two hundred dollars
although quantities are limited the
docking station includes a DisplayPort
audio input and output jack an Ethernet
port and four USB ports but we're still
waiting for that power cover Motorola's
customizable Moto X smartphone has
dropped in price to one hundred dollars
with a two-year contract and that is
only if you order it from the motor
maker website with AT&amp;amp;T or if you get
the more plain version from sprint and
US Cellular the customizable 32 gig
version on motor maker is also a little
cheaper at the price of one hundred and
fifty dollars motor maker lets you
choose from 18 back cover colors and
seven accent colors the Instagram as our
coming the photo-sharing app says it's
rolling out photo and video adds to its
150 million active users in the US the
company released a sample ad to show
what it'll look like you'll know a photo
or video is a paid ad when there's a
sponsored label where the time stamp
should be instagram has made no money in
the three years it has existed and since
Facebook paid 1 billion dollars to own
it putting ads on it comes as no
surprise it should be easier now to find
photos and other content on tumblr the
blogging site just rebuilt its search
feature to support multiple tags and
words to hunt down topics and there's
the option to filter research to
different
types of posts like only images the
popular twitter app tweetbot got a
redesign for iOS 7 on the iPhone and
with it comes a price hike the new
tweetbot now costs three dollars a book
more than before if you think that's
pricey well the cost may go up again
it's listed as a limited time sale aside
from the new look the app is also said
to be faster and people tend to pay for
an app like this since it has more
settings and features than Twitter's
official app and iPad version is
reportedly in the works that your tech
news update for more details head to
cnet com / update and follow along on
Twitter from our studios in New York I'm
