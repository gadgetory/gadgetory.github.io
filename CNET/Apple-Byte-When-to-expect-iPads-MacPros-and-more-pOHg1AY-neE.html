actually not here see these trees on my
shirt I'm actually looking at them right
now in Hawaii but you know I still have
a show to do for you guys so welcome to
the Apple Biden I know there are always
things going on in Apple's world but
this is my chance to respond to you with
your burning questions it's our ask me
anything episode + stick around because
we also have a special giveaway now
let's get to your emails and we start
off with some relevant ones like a bee
Mills Stewart Nguyen and Mason Mitchell
who all of them pretty much combined ask
the most popular questions when will the
new imacs macbook pros and iPads come
out will Apple biters we're still
expecting to have an event in October to
announce new iPads and there's a real
real strong chance we'll see processor
upgrades to the macbook pros and imacs
as well especially with OS 10 Mavericks
expected by the end of the month so do
not buy any of these three guys right
now until we get the next update because
they're all due for a refresh all right
Fred Addison on Twitter ass do you think
apple will ever introduced memory cards
into iPads or iPhones well I've never
say never with apple but the chances are
slim to none and slim just left the
building Chris Jackson ass where's the
iWatch you know I really thought that it
would be ready to roll this year after
talking to my peeps but with another
apple event expected soon I just highly
doubt we'll see it this year because
cramming in the iWatch right now it just
doesn't make sense and the buzz over
Samsung's watches pretty much died down
now Apple could surprise us but it
really looks like we'll see this next
year all right Adrian ciega on Twitter
ass is the apple byte ending hashtag
Google ishes now a lot of people have
requested that I stopped doing the Apple
by so to make them happy I'll be hosting
Google ishes a show all about this great
stuff happening with Google and Android
and as for the apple byte we'll just
find another asian guy with spiky hair
and a blonde streak that looks like a
skunk to still host the show now before
we go on I'd really
to make a correction from last week's
show I said that you get unlimited skips
with iTunes radio a lot of you let me
know that's not the case which is
completely true I don't know why I said
that people even accuse me of being
stoned last week on youtube I really
meant that it's ad free but you're still
limited to six skips within about an
hour window before you can skip tracks
again and you know sometimes I make
mistakes and yes I'm going to give
myself a bad apple all right let's get
to the emails where some of you crazies
ask questions completely unrelated to
the show now Miss Vicky to win asks
what's your favorite type of Apple well
that's easy McIntosh Dowd rights in with
did you ever imagine that you would have
regular viewers in Afghanistan you know
I honestly never did and I like to
imagine a lot of things oh so thanks for
watching now Neil Dean on twitter asks
what's the usual color of your undies
well this is kind of personal but I'm a
big fan of denim on denim it's pretty
trendy right now so the answer is denim
I actually wear underwear with the denim
print on it so it's like wearing jeans
on jeans you should try it out too and
homeless guy on Twitter ass brian Tong
will you marry me please no all right
let's get to our giveaways and it's time
once again for an awesome giveaway from
our friends at designed by humans now
every month I pick my favorite shirt
designs from them but we're giving you
