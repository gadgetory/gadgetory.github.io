pixel 3 XL I have the XL here with the
notch and we have a lot of thoughts
about this phone we've had plenty of
time to come up with thoughts because
the device has been leaked for weeks and
weeks and weeks the unboxing turned out
to be real the leaks look exactly like
the device what do you think of it it
looks like the pixel 2 with some minor
refinements so of course we have the
knowledge screen on this 6.3 inch
XL the pixel 3 has a 5.5 inch screen on
the back you still have Google's
two-tone display as they're calling it
or two-tone color which just means
there's a glossy part on the back and
then this matte part this part is
actually shrunk it's gotten smaller
every single iteration 12.2 megapixel
camera on the back but the back also is
all glass Google is some kind of special
at cheating with the glass so that you
can actually finally have wireless
charging and a pixel is the first pixel
to have wireless charging is that right
yes that's true and it's great because
it means that it brings the pixel kind
of up to the level of some of the other
flagship phones and Google's in fact
even selling a pixel stand for $79 that
kind of has some pixel only special
effects I guess you think it's still a
standard Qi charger so if you have
another device like an iPhone 10 you
could put it on there so it's not a bad
investment but when you have a pixel
plus the stand it has that kind of
glanceable ambient mode where you can
just see notification from across the
room it's a pretty cool idea I think so
too right you know that's not what's
gonna get people to buy the phone you
know I think the camera is something
that Google is really trying to sell and
you know notice of course that this is a
flagship device with one camera on the
back that's a rarity at this point it
really is you know you've got Huawei
you've got LG coming up with three
cameras on the back and you know there's
speculation that a Samsung phone is
gonna have four cameras on the back and
here you've got Google basically
thumbing its nose at everybody else
saying you know with your four cameras
or three cameras we can do all of that
or more with just one one camera and a
ton of crazy software plus one piece of
hardware that's in there that image
processing chip that have talked very
little about with the two and they
talked a lot about it with a three and
it's supposed to make everything so much
more amazing with one camera that seems
really strange that they could push it
do you think that's going to work I mean
I think Google has a really great track
record with photography on the pixels
and I think that Google's bread and
butter isn't software right that's where
its prowess
that's where it came from the hardware
is just a conduit to get to the software
it's got a lot of AI it's really ahead
of the others in that I think one thing
that really stood out is for a long time
we've been saying that the pixel phones
are really great at low-light
photography and Google is calling this
future night sight basically saying
you'll never need a flash again because
our low-light photos are so good and so
bright you know Samsung's phones tend to
I guess / brighten those low-light
scenes so they sometimes seem really
unnatural I'm really looking forward to
what this phone can do if I can live up
to that promise yeah I mean Google was
really boastful with that they're all
saying wait nope we started with the
world's greatest camera first put it
into a phone saying that you'll never
use a flash again with this kind of
software improvements that's really
really bold if that's possible that'll
be very impressive because iPhones have
always been really great when came to
cameras Samsung has really come close to
it pixels have been great and this is a
lot a lot of bragging that they have to
live up to so what's interesting is
though even though Google only wants to
have one camera on the back there are
these two cameras up front on both the
pixel three and the pixel three so these
are eight megapixel ones much more
noticeable on this guy it looks like a
robot face to me constantly I can't
unsee the face I see I see it I see it
definitely so the whole point is that
there's a second telephoto lens so that
there's depth to your portraits and and
you can to your portrait shots but also
more importantly so that you can have a
wider angle to take either you and all
of your friends or more room for your
background landscape if we test it out a
bunch like it during the actual live
event and we were messing with this and
that was way off in the corner and as we
zoomed out you could see way more people
behind you that so much more is captured
without having to have a selfie stick I
think people are gonna actually use that
a lot I think so too and you know it
Google's not the first company to have
this this was a page taken out of LG's
book but it could be the case of you
know the Apple effect where the pixel
phones popularized this in other devices
so from a hardware perspective what
we're looking at is something really
iterative probably gonna be a lot better
than last year's pixel - but no real
killer feature here yeah it's kind of a
nice design yay let's talk a little bit
about the software though right yeah
absolutely I have some feelings about
Android Pi on this device
and I think that you know the gesture
controls are pretty good not as fluid as
what Apple has and not as food is what
some other Android phone makers have
used as well so for example you swipe up
and then it just kind of like stops it
bounces back at you and if you want to
go to the app tray and see all of your
apps you have to swipe up again and also
you can slide right on this kind of home
button but you can't slide left you have
to press this back arrow and I just feel
like others have done this better why is
Google doing this to us Google's using
their Android pie which ditches the home
button in general then now there's this
little - saying that you can move the
pill yeah it's being a pill because it
doesn't work both ways and you're right
it's a strange kind of version of
Android pie considering it's Google's
why doesn't work as well as others but I
think that's gonna be some interesting
back and forth between the first buyers
of this device and Google to see if they
can change this like 9.1 maybe it'll be
a little cleaner yeah that will be
really interesting to see it's true I'm
some other software that definitely
stood out also was well you can now
trust your phone you can silence an
incoming call by turning the phone over
that's not new to the phone industry but
it is new to pixel there's what I know
you really want to shift things it's
nothing better than a call screening
kind of thing I cannot believe the the
demo that they showed when you get a
call you can actually sense you tell
your pixel ya ask who this is and what
you're calling for and then you can
choose with a bunch of little options
how to respond back I thought that was a
really interesting way to basically like
suggestions like smart reply is how to
make your phone work for you better and
I thought that was their gimmick with
the whole presentation and that's a
really cool feature it will be really
interesting to see how that works and if
you are able to parse out robo calls
from like you know accidentally like
asking grandma you know who that really
is obviously you wouldn't have somebody
from your inbox who you know would be a
call you don't know but what if it's the
doctor's office or the pharmacy this
isn't somebody you necessarily want a
robo call you want to be there to pick
that up so it will be interesting to see
how many false positives and you know
false negatives there are in that case
that's come in a pixel first and that's
the thing like it is Google going to
give that out as a feature somewhere
else I don't know if they will but it's
gonna be on the pixel one thing we
haven't talked about yet is pricing and
this is a real hot-button issue
so $7.99 brings you the 64 gigabyte
version of the three it goes all the way
up to $9.99 for the top-of-the-line 128
of the XL but there's no way to increase
the storage it's these are your options
and so it seems a little bit of limited
don't you think I do think that because
I've done a comparison with you know the
total storage capacity for other phones
and you know even the LGV 40 only has a
64 gigabyte option that's your only
option but it will take microSD card so
you know you're taking all these amazing
shots you can save and raw but where do
you put it if you run out Google's
saying well you can go ahead and use
unlimited you know Google Photos cloud
storage but you can't save everything
that way and what if you don't want to
you just don't have as many options
you've got that and you might have
issues with your wireless carrier I
don't what your data plan is like I
don't know what your speeds are like and
you're shooting 4k and you're sending it
up to the cloud that might be a problem
over time so that's I think it's a kind
of a weak kind of answer for their
shortage on storage but it is what it is
I think another thing that's really
interesting and worth noting is that
this is one of the few flagship phones
truly flagship phones that starts at
under $1000 we've seen the price of
phones creeping up and up and up and up
and it almost doesn't matter who you are
and even though it gets really close on
the 128 gigabyte version of the pixel 3
XL it doesn't start off there so you can
still save a few hundred dollars by
getting the pixel and you have the
benefit of everything that Google offers
which is of course you know the security
updates that are more timely and the
Android updates that are also before any
other phone that's the other thing about
the pixel 3 versus the XL hardware-wise
they're not tremendously different
you're not really doing a lot of
trade-offs other than the size of screen
maybe and size of battery so even if you
wanted this power and one of the cameras
you're getting essentially the same
thing at $7.99 which is I think a little
easier for people to jump on board with
the pixel phones are coming out right
when we're about to go into a big
holiday crunch and there's already a ton
of competition we've got Samsung phones
out there we got LG we've got iPhones
you get an iPhone 10 R that's coming
around the same time as the pixel at
7:49 so that's another competitor at
around the same time we've got the
oneplus 60 that's coming up as well and
seen it was first to report that that's
come for $550 so that's more expensive
than the past one plus but that's still
cheaper than this pixel phone and
there's a lot that it can offer Android
enthusiasts the pixel phone seems to
appeal to a wide array of people it's
either somebody looking for a budget
phone pure Android phone or they want
the top-of-the-line phone so they're
competing against everybody which is a
very very difficult feel to take on and
in the u.s. this phone's also in an
interesting sales position because
Verizon is the exclusive carrier you can
also buy an unlocked from Google's store
or you could get it through Google's
project five with the project via SIM
card yeah and the wireless carriers
would probably do some crazy holiday
promotions that these new top line
phones will be like a BOGO or you'll get
one for half price you get a whole bunch
of really good deals on really good
phones I think you've hit it right on
the nose and that those holiday promos
are going to change the pricing dynamic
or they're gonna mess with Google's
plans entirely now our reviews are
ongoing on the pixel 3 and the three XL
come back to see a net for the full rate
of reviews</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
