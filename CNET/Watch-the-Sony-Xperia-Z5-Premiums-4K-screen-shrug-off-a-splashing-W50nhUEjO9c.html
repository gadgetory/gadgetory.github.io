Sony phone we'll be waiting for while
the regular experienced ed 5 with pretty
much a reissue of the dead 4 before it
presenter five premium comes with a
larger screen with a whopping 4k
resolution the screens actual resolution
is 3840 by 2160 pixels which equates to
around eight hundred and one pixel per
inch on its 5.5 inch screen now that's
the highest resolution I've ever seen on
a phone and in fact is about double the
resolution you'll get on the iPhone 6s
plus however can you actually tell the
difference well to my eyes no not really
you'd want to put the same high-res
photos side by side on this and the
iPhone it couldn't really tell a lot of
difference and the same goes for
high-definition video as well maybe if
you got particularly keen vision and you
get right up close to the screen you
might see some small differences but it
certainly isn't a difference that
reaches out and smacks you in the face
and given the price I really would want
it to do that physically there's no
question but it's part of Sony's Xperia
line it's got a glossy minimalist design
and sony has made the sides a lot more
squared off still waterproof almost so
many no longer recommend submerging it
in the water instead the waterproofing
is just designed to keep it safe from
spilled drinks or when you're taking
calls in the rain what you can't do
though is use it for underwater
photography speaking of photography
though the camera is one other Zed by
premiums trump cards with a whopping 23
megapixel sensor it can take some great
shots with plenty of color and loads of
detail and of course it can shoot video
in 4k as well and on this one of course
you can even watch the footage back in
4k
inside it's running on a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 810 processor with three
gigabytes of RAM which makes navigating
the Android interface incredibly Swift
gaming is of course handled extremely
well as its photo editing there's really
very little you can throw at this thing
to slow it down
you'll also find Android lollipop
software and on the side is a
fingerprint scanner which works quickly
and accurately this phone is worthy of
its premium name it really does do
everything you'd expect from a top-end
phone
but yet I'm still not quite calling it a
triumph stuff in 4k into a screen sounds
impressive on paper but in reality it
doesn't really add all that much to your
experience what it does do is bump up
the price if you're after a
high-performance Android phone you can
safely use in the rain the z5 premium is
definitely worth a look if waterproofing
isn't that important to you though and
you don't really care about bragging
about your 4k display save yourself a
bit of money and look elsewhere
