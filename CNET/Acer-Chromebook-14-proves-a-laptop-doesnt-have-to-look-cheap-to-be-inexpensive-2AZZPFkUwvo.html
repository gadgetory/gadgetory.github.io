bodies so they look and feel a bit
disposable but then something like this
comes along and you realize it doesn't
need to be that way for its $300
Chromebook 14 Acer talk what is a pretty
typical set of Chromebook components and
dress them in a nice and thin all
aluminum case it has a bigger than usual
14 inch full HD screen - so you've got
more room for work but it's still small
enough for a daily commute and with up
to 12 hours of battery life you can keep
going when you're done working running
Google's browser-based operating system
doesn't require high-performance
components and you definitely don't get
any here and with 32 gigs of storage and
no SD card slot for adding more you'll
be relying on the cloud or an external
drive plugged into one of its USB 3.0
ports power users who leave a lot of
tabs open while streaming music or
movies might find this system a little
sluggish on occasion and it remains to
be seen if it will be enough to smoothly
run more demanding Android apps when it
starts supporting them later this year
for now though it gets the job done and
it does it in style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
