your brain it sounds impossible but it's
closer than you may realize and it's
just the kind of fluid human-computer
interface needed for a are a brain Mouse
for a are the woman in this video has
ALS she is completely trapped inside her
body she cannot move or speak but she is
typing with her mind not with eye blanks
with her mind
an array of electrodes the size of a pea
has been implanted where her brain would
normally control her birth her motor
functions
she is typing at eight words per minute
directly with her brain now to be clear
we are not talking about decoding your
random thoughts think of it more like
this you take many photos you choose to
share some of them similarly you have
many thoughts you choose to share some
of them as it turns out the vibrotactile
sensors embedded in our skin allow us to
interpret complex inputs the pressure
change in a puff of air the vibration of
the vocal cords and on the jaw as
language what you'll observe in this
video is a man deaf and blind speaking
he is using only the sensors of his hand
in his skin to hear to process interpret
and yes even reproduce the spoken words
of his teacher remember he is deaf and
blind he is repeating words that he
cannot see or hear by feeling them wait
just a minute
right minute did you forget to shut off
the water
that they forgot from the 1950s until
today what all of these techniques have
in common is our brains ability to
reconstruct language from components
that's Freddy he leads this project and
that's Francis
she's an electrical engineer she is not
deaf and blind but she can hear through
her skin she has a system of actuators
on her left arm they are tuned to 16
different frequency bands Francis
currently has a tactile vocabulary of
about nine words she learned them in
less than an hour the lights indicate
the actuators firing and you'll see that
they fire so fast she must learn to
actually feel the words</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
