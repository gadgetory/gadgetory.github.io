cutting the cord it's a trend that lots
of people have try it out ditching the
traditional cable packages and moving
towards watching more stuff online like
this video so if you're tinkering with
the idea of saying goodbye to your cable
TV here are the top five tips for
potential cord cutters at number five
taking an inventory of what you actually
watch if you've got cable you got this
endless stream of video being pumped
into your home at all times but what do
you really watch and how much are you
willing to pay for it
let's do some math with these three
shows Lois bar rescue and my cat from
hell because you know cats all three of
them are available for subscription on
iTunes Louie costs $19.99 my cat from
hell cost $19.99 and bar rescue sells
for 39.99 for a past of vol 4 because
apparently it doesn't do seasons right
there that's seventy nine dollars and
ninety seven cents or by eighty bucks so
if you want to break it down to a
monthly cost you're gonna pay around six
dollars and 67 cents per month but
iTunes charges you a front for season
pass so you're not really paying about
six bucks per month and number four find
out how you can watch sports if you're a
fan of an out of market team like if
you're a San Francisco Giants fan in New
York City you can get something like a
subscription to MLB TV the same options
available for basketball fans with NBA
TV with local teams being blacked-out
regional sports fans might be able to
check out playstation view but that's
really limited right now sling TV is a
very good option for folks who like
watching sports on networks like TNT and
ESPN number three an antenna can be your
friend depending on where you live you
can probably get plenty of broadcast
channels for free in HD over-the-air
using an antenna one of my favorite
tools to use is at TV fool comm and it
is a TV signal locator it put some
information about your address and
you'll find out what channels you can
see if you're far away from broadcast
towers you might need a large antenna if
you're nearby you can probably get away
with some cheaper antennas a number to
pick your device if you cut the cord say
goodbye to your cable box so what's
gonna replace it you'll want to set top
box compatible with whatever service
you're using iTunes video only works on
the Apple TV
buddhu Amazon and a number of other
services run on the Roku if you want the
convenience of a DVR with you
over-the-air TV you're going to need
something like the TiVo Romeo channel
master DVR or simple TV and the number
one sip for a potential court cutter is
to ask a question is it worth it at this
point you have an idea of how much money
TV shows services and hardware will cost
you so do you really want to cut the
cord you can also look into smaller
cable bundles from a provider to see if
it matches the pricing you figured out
alternatively you can call your cable
company and try to negotiate a lower
rate Consumer Reports is a good guide on
how to handle that kind of thing also
don't forget that you're likely sticking
with your cable company since its most
likely they are your internet service
provider so you're never truly cutting
the cord if you're convinced to go the
internet only route you might want to
look into a faster connection for more
