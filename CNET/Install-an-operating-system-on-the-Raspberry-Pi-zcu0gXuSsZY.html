Raspberry Pi in my earlier video I
talked about the hardware and told you
the components you need to get started
in this video I'm going to show you the
easiest way to install an operating
system on the device I'll be using the
more expensive Raspberry Pi version B
for $35 but the cheaper model also works
with this method you will need a USB
mouse and keyboard a monitor with an
HDMI cable either an Ethernet cable or a
USB wireless adapter a power supply
capable of outputting at least seven
hundred milliamps at five volts and a 4
gigabyte class 4 SD card or better I'm
using a 16 gigabyte class 6 SD card from
transcend and old motorola smart phone
charger and a spare HD TV my MacBook Air
has an SD card slot but if your computer
doesn't you also need an SD card reader
installing an operating system on the
Raspberry Pi used to be a real pain but
it's now easier than ever before thanks
the Raspberry Pi foundation's new
out-of-box software also known as noobs
head to Raspberry Pi org click the
Downloads link and download either the
noobs zip or torrent file while that's
downloading you'll need us format your
SD card remember formatting will erase
everything on the card the easiest way
to do this is to download the SD card
associations official formatting tool
which is available for both Windows and
OS X computers once the files finish
downloading
extract the noobs files to your freshly
format SD card and safely eject it from
your computer before touching the
Raspberry Pi it's best to touch a piece
of metal to minimize the risk of
damaging the device with an
electrostatic discharge next simply
connect the HDMI cord the mouse the
keyboard the Ethernet cable the SD card
and the power supply at which point the
device will boot up set your language
and then choose the operating system you
would like to install I recommend trying
raspbian for your first boot the process
can take up to 20 minutes once it's done
click OK and the system will reboot when
it starts up again choose option number
3 to boot directly to the desktop then
choose the second option
treats desktop login user PI at the
graphical desktop click finished and the
system will reboot into the raspbian
desktop if ever prompted for one the
username is PI and the password is
raspberry inside the desktop you can
browse the web or even download
different games and programs from the PI
Store I recommend trying open arena a
port of the 1999 hit game quake 3
there are also pre-installed games which
can be accessed by clicking the Debian
games icon only one operating system can
be installed at one time if you ever run
into problems press and hold the shift
button and the up arrow during boot to
enter recovery if you're new to
programming I recommend checking out the
pre-installed apps scratch be on the
lookout for more raspberry pi how to's
feel free to reach out to me on twitter
with suggestions and be sure to check
out my article on how to dot cnet.com
for more information and the links
you'll need to get the job done i'm dan
