on its shield handheld and turns it into
a set-top box a class that you can use
all that super here on comic book
information on to ace and it's taught by
Stanley oh I like that and NASA shows
off its weird simple super ball robot
that might be used to explore moons like
Titan pretty cool yeah like that stir
our daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best cake
talk show in the known universe every
co-host Ashley scale the druggies always
man to my right Pizza King kale
anonymous hey I'm the king I like that
song won't it go oh the foreigner I'm
sorry as I am I I know I say this every
day no I don't actually say it every day
but there's these first two stories I
just love to death as as a super fan of
both of the there's some really good
stuff happening today so we don't want
it than this one it's like a wax on wax
off almost kind of if you are me
watching the show you're gonna love
these first two stories so let's get
into the headlines like they do that you
might have a clone somewhere watching
this cael eating pizza just gonna
like show sucks who's that's me alright
so let's talk about in video then he had
a press conference at GDC this week Game
Developers Conference up to San
Francisco and had some very interesting
things to say but for me and you that
the really interesting thing that they
had going on was the Nvidia shield has
transformed it's no longer a controller
with a screen attached to it it's now a
set-top box and it's like a little wedge
too it's like this cool little wedge
looking thing yeah um so it it has 16
gigs a storage inside you can see it's
actually a really cool looking like on
the top is there's some design to it
there which I like I like that it's not
just like a plain box there's some
really nice design to it 16 gigs to
storage on board powered by the nvidia
x1 processor which is very nice comes
with a controller that you're used to
seeing that shield the video shield has
had before just without the little clam
shell screen did you say comes with it
yeah okay cars at the controller and
then it actually is it uses android TV
so it can access some google play games
and apps as well as grid which is
invidious streaming service it streams
games over the internet so you can play
games do you play all kinds of games
like Arkham Arkham City like there are
so many good games all right downloading
streaming streaming so directly your TV
is just frequent and from what I have
heard people have used grid or have
tried it really like it and say that
it's it's pretty saw
it's not really choppy it's pretty
smooth will you agree to my interest
tell me tell me more okay so grid is
actually right now if you have a shield
as far as I'm aware it's free but
they're gonna charge for the service
starting in June um no pricing yet but I
would imagine if I had to guess maybe it
would be somewhere in the neighborhood
of like $25 I think it might be less I
because because the thing is is so you
think about Netflix and it's like okay
that's eight bucks a month but then you
can anything about gamefly which is one
game at a time but mailed a physical
copy of the game mailed to you that's 15
a month so I don't see why it couldn't
be fifteen dollars maybe 20 like I don't
know I think they could really make a
play at the sort of streaming video game
services like they could really cement
themselves as the provider if you grid
is like the provider like the netflix of
streaming movies or whatever they can
recycling not either yeah not as what I
mean not as well as they'd hoped I mean
I think there's been like some kind of
runs at it but like they haven't really
done as well as I think it video can
really do in this space so grid is kind
of exciting Oh much how much is that all
you've said that yet so grid it doesn't
have pricing yet but the shield of the
set-top box shield and Vidya shield will
know controller the controller 199 and
it comes out of May really so it's
basically what everything that the steam
machine if you've been keeping up on on
gaming steam has been promising they
want it well they've bet said they want
to make a console yeah that is all the
pc games on it kinda like this but it
seems like this is doing that but
without having to download everything
and steam machines have been like from
400 to four thousand dollars in price
right and so uh this is very interesting
like on the grid website some of the
featured games they have for grid are so
these are the games okay these are some
of the feature games it's not all of
them but bat batman arkham origins as an
ugly ugly controller but you know what's
funny is it's it's actually really
comfortable in hand like have you ever
held the shield yes it's really well
made and i like that it has a little
remote okay anyway so here are the games
here the games Borderlands 2 ooh which
or to Alan Wake and alan wake american
nightmare Batman Arkham
IM batman arkham city borderlands brutal
legend Darksiders 2 a bunch of Lego
games like harry potter and lord of the
rings like all that stuff my my favorite
one of my favorite platforms of all time
psychonauts available on grid and
stacking another another double fine get
there's a bunch of Double Fine stuff on
here but yeah it looks like featured
wise there's some decent titles here and
then and then like I said it's also it
has access to android so it has access
to the Google Play Store which means you
can play games like crysis 3 you can
play metal gear rising revengeance which
is gonna be coming soon I the telltale
games so like Game of Thrones a wolf
among us like all that stuff's available
so I think it's a really good time and a
really good not for lack of a better
word a really good play for that market
like I think it's a really good move
really smart I'm very interested in a
few things and fill me in if they've
mentioned these playing with friends
co-op connecting counts that kind of
thing I didn't see any job that yet apps
did they talk about apps maybe they have
netflix maybe they have hulu they said
google android TV and they said apps and
games so i'm assuming you will have
access to google play apps that are that
are made for shield so i can't i can't
imagine that like people like netflix
amazon hulu aren't gonna want to get in
on this all right i can see them all
kind of getting on board okay okay so i
would imagine right they would be
available yeah pretty cool and there are
they releasing the shield any cheaper
just the portable wine it looks it's cuz
i've won one of those for they might
just be done with that at this point
like when the set-top box comes out that
might be like this is the next evolution
of shield so we're gonna leave the
global clamshell handheld behind okay
we'll see so my question to anyone that
is interested including yourself would
you be willing to replace one of your
current consoles with that no but here's
the thing but here's the thing i have i
don't have a problem buying an apple TV
for a hundred bucks and if i could buy
rights 200 something similar to that
with a really nice solid controller
which if you buy a controller for xbox
is sixty dollars yes so why not just by
uncle system razy good christmas gift
too
remember this remember it's a really
good Christmas they'll probably knock
the price off like a 20 lb like some
sale or something around holidays but
like I said when you consider okay well
i could buy like a set-top box for a
hundred dollars plus a controller that
can you know link up via bluetooth
that's sixty dollars it's like why not
just buy this so into me it makes sense
the price point totally makes sense and
and onenote real quick to not to
artificially extend this but i think the
reason why this makes sense on tomorrow
daily is because this is like an
advancement as far as like streaming
yeah and gaming and technology and
getting it all into one little thing is
having a big streaming and killing off
hard hard media from brick-and-mortar
time in the future our entertainment I
mean this is the way it's going
incorporate some VR into this which
NVIDIA has a VR headset and we're good
to go watching you bullying and that
could be a good thing where you could
stream stuff right into your nvidia vr
headsets heard it here first unconfirmed
allegedly you might have total
speculation you wanna you want to
talk about the more future of nerding I
really do okay so if you've ever wanted
to actually use all the knowledge you
know about comic books whether it be
like hey I know the backstory of you
know the vision or Captain America and
you want to use all of that or maybe
learn more about that okay there is now
a horse that is available and it stopped
by Stanley this is pretty of the father
of comic books now this is on edx.org
which is uh this this website where they
offer some kind of like unorthodox
classes this lighting stuff does this
yeah they offer these like online
courses that you can either audit or pay
a little extra to get this like
verification thing so they partner up
with Stanley to create this course
called the rise of superheroes and their
impact on pop culture you about to do a
Stanley impersonation dude little class
talk uh the rise of superheroes was
their impact on pop culture there's not
like my grandma Chelsea oh well I don't
know anyway so it's taught with Stanley
and Michael ruslan who is the executive
producer of the lego movie and the dark
knight series and Batman vs Superman a
whole bunch of stuff that guy is legit
uh-huh and so they'll t so they'll
basically start the evolution of
superheroes from folklore because
all kind of based on okay yeah and myth
a clue from across the globe and narrow
it down to the rise of superheroes in
the 1930s and their role on society
because superheroes are kind of our
mythological creatures if you complete
the if you complete a verified
certificate in the course your sibs if
you will actually get original artwork
by Stanley that is also Stein signed by
him and Michael that's de life so it's
actually really cool so again it was uh
it's if you want to get into it it's a
fifty dollar minimum fee but that's for
the verified thing right the verified
thing but I think you can do it free if
you don't want that yeah you can just
for free but you can get for free by out
of the course for free yes on it the
course but if you want that really cool
certificate that's the thing right right
yeah yeah so there you go if you want to
check it out it's on edx.org I'm gonna I
think I'm gonna take this course I feel
like I want to do it I actually I went
on and like registered and I'm like now
I'm just deciding whether i want the
certificate or if I just want to audit
the course cuz I'm like I'm not gonna
like the significant because if you like
frame it and stuff you could frame it
and so it's like well maybe I want that
but then you can actually just FYI if
you are going to school you can actually
use this certificate for things like you
know coursework like if you can if your
university is willing to accept it as
coursework as like an elective you could
potentially ask them if they would which
is kind of awesome that's awesome there
you go so they like that so 50 bucks and
you get Stanley it like are they gonna
be they're good they're gonna be like
online yeah they're gonna share kind of
the responsibilities of teaching Stanley
is a pretty pretty great speaker yeah I
imagine he won't be doing all of it he's
very busy he'll probably mostly Michael
because I I mean he's very busy too but
I assume he has more free time than
safari some Smithsonian piece involved
as well like some some historical cuz i
know i saw in the the thing it said like
they wanted to talk about like how comic
books like that when they talk about the
history of comic book characters they go
through things like how comic books
almost got stamped out because like
McCarthyism of the 50s and like stuff
like that which I find super fun take
this course I think I'm gonna do the
fifty dollars we're gonna be a plus
students are gonna bring our red apples
for Stanley and
pues lon we're gonna we're gonna do it
we're in a daze we're gonna a pluses I
said his name right Mike who's line
right oh yeah okay and he's like yeah
that guy's big time so that actually
brings me to our hashtag the day which
is TD schooled and I I think I want to
know if you could take any course what
would it be and who would your teacher
you go first I think I would want to
learn well okay wait Kim can you verify
is this fictional people or real life
people I'd say fictional IC champion i
can go fiction yet oh man that makes it
so much harder um i think i would want
this is really dumb but i think i would
want to take an illusion class with joe
Bluth from arrested development like
illusions which with Joe Bluth like I
think that would be really fun and like
awful but really fun right right I of
course audit that I would not pay I
would take I would take a filmmaking
class with a tommy was 00 the room
they've made the room oh my god cuz I
want to learn how to like really make
techniques I want to make a really
really bad movie he's got some
techniques there oh hi oh hi tomorrow
daily I think I've been amazing just to
hear him talk like just to hear him like
trying to be like we put the camera in
the corner it's weird I don't even know
what accent I'm doing this is so what is
it TD T schools yeah IC class also if
you like own one of your friends like if
you like zing him online hashtag TD
school too yeah I'll so it just seemed
so much so much like someone's like this
coffee was burning you like it's not
burned you idiots TD school yeah you can
totally use them I'll read those ones i
can't read those in and favorite them ok
we got to talk about this last story ok
so NASA this is kind of crazy we all saw
curiosity land on Mars unless you're a
baby and you missed that which is fine
you're excused um but it was really hard
for to land this giant car sighs rover
on a planet very far away so what you're
seeing right now on the screen is
something called it's a concept called
tense egra T so what this is is rigid
components connected by flexible
materials so you can see they're sort of
cables that are kind of elastic and then
there
rods that are part of the structure and
it looks very bouncy right so we're
watching it kind of bounce up and down
here so nASA has this interesting little
robot called the Super Ball bot and that
what you were just seeing that the
actual real life thing not the
simulation is the Super Ball bot this
was one of the earlier builds of it so
oh it's got motors in it yeah they have
actuators in there so that was an early
one with six actuators in there and and
so the point of this is it's Super Bowls
built around that concept of tents egra
d and impacts are not as terrifying if
you have a device like this so if it
falls off a little cliff or if it hits a
pothole that can be really dangerous for
something like curiosity but it's not
for something like this because it can
just readjust itself and it moves this
is the new version of Super Bowl this is
the big giant version of what the Super
Ball bot is and you can see it's
obviously evolved quite a bit it moves
by tightening and loosening the elastic
structures all these rods that's great
just like we do our muscles which is
pretty cool really cool and so the goal
of this is cuz I know we like talking
about go you guys gonna the goal so they
can see where they're going exactly the
goal of this is it's to put a payload in
the center of the Super Bowl so what
they're saying is is if you're looking
at this device and in the you can
actually see in the simulation like when
we were looking at that there's like a
little sphere in the middle of it so
they're saying okay well maybe we could
have like a sensor or a camera or
whatever it is in the middle of that
device protected by the tents egra T
robot and so when it moves it keeps it
safe in the middle it's sort of
suspended in the middle and can take
some some damage because it it gets
diffused the force of impact is diffused
across this robot yeah it just seems
like it would take a lot of the
guesswork out of you know like lighting
stuff so you just be like all right
we're gonna toss it onto the planet oh
no it's ready cuz I kill you literally
just described exactly what the image
shows of how they would deliver this
payload to a planet they showed like a
like a thing where they had a like a
spacecraft fly above the surface and
literally just open the bottom and like
pulling out the thing and just let it
fall to the surface
could save a lot of money in the space
program won't a lot of calculations to
my calculations alone can be a little
looser about it right well there's a lot
of people they make something well some
people get questionable about like the
space programs wasting a little money
because this thing didn't work and it
really has work and then if you're
building these things you're like yeah
we toss it on there yeah we throw it my
mom as a dog toy that's kind of like
this it's like this pace it is baby toy
to that just like built on that exactly
try to bounce it around so I mean you're
just like here you go play with this and
tell me if you can so they've been
adding actuators over time to this super
ball and right now the current version
has 12 so they've gone from six to 12
and then the finished one the goal is 24
and they want at some point to be able
to they think at some point they might
be able to use super ball to explore the
surface of say tightenin so they would
do a flyby and then just drop it on the
surface cheaper too it's a lot cheaper
it seems I could be way cheaper and then
you could throw a bunch of them you
don't have a big science lab imagine
imagine that imagine related about 30
and then we had like you know Mission
Control had like 30 hoots and then just
stick them out you're gonna get students
just like drive them around and like
look around that you just you know find
a planet just go around it well they
said they meet in the middle like
Benjamin Button okay the cool thing
about the 10 secretary devices is
they're very compact you can fold them
down into very small things and then
just like drop them out and then they
expand so super cool I thought this was
so awesome like I think we should just
start using this forever you we're going
to take a quick break we'll be right
back it's Wednesday so we have a mod
squad an old friend if you will a repeat
mod squatter somebody we've seen stuff
from before and then we also have your
user feedback and our phone tiger for
the day so don't click away tomorrow
daily
welcome back to the show I hope you
enjoyed those dancing origamis they're
delightful um so it's Wednesday which
means we have another round of Mod Squad
I don't know we don't have a graphic I
just like to think of it as like a 60
spy movie like James Bondish Mod Squad
Mod Squad I don't know anyway okay I'm
doing my best yet right um so it's time
four Mod Squad this is as I said a
familiar face Olivier see has returned
to mod squad on this week's show with
his we saw the drone millennium falcon
which was awesome and it was everywhere
which was super awesome Ian Ian anybody
comes all over the place now first but
whatever I totally us first and then but
now Olivier see has returned with what
he promised which is a TIE Interceptor
he's got thai fighter oh nice tie
fighter quadcopter now it looks amazing
see okay the the Millennium Falcon was
pretty good but it had all the big
journals and like the quadcopter holes
in it and so it's just sort of a shell
on the outside this on the other hand
looks way cooler I think most impressive
yeah super good um it is custom carbon
and it's a custom carbon and aluminum
frame so he's like these are all like
custom yeah it doesn't he's crazy custom
things which is pretty cool um in the
video it's really loud I am tired of
this guy only building one I want to see
a bunch of time I wanted to fly him over
a comic-con and I want him to fight the
Millennium Falcon it should be chasing
the Millennium Falcon one so you want
space warfare I do just with drums like
I want I want to remake that I want to
just recreate like a space fight with
drones like a Star Wars so you space you
said it's very loud and it looks like it
can't go very fast it will cause the
extra weight so the extra way to the
frame obviously like slows it down um
well I mean that is a big hurdle cuz I
don't think TIE fighters go that slow no
they definitely be critical Oliver I
know as if we could do any better yeah
ours if you like a bunch of scotch tape
and paper and we just throw it all right
I'm gonna get juice box let alone
building that thing that's very cool no
it's super gay you know you know you
know you know that this is going to lead
2like thinkgeek making these of course
it's not little tiny little ones that
are like ham pie do they have those
sized ones i know i would love to say
probably would maybe April Fool's Day
this year when they introduce like the
fake stuff that becomes real maybe it'll
be one of those that's what maybe that
um all right guys let's talk about your
user feedback we talked about robear
yesterday japan the japanese robot bear
nurse yeah that's carried that was
adorable and also scarce I walk the line
scared or embarrassed or stared Orville
scaradorable um and we asked you guys
what you would want your robear to do
for you and you guys had some really
great answers Andre wrote in and said
Robo wing whoa whoa or man so a hot wing
man or a wing woman or a robo vacation
buddy it would be funny to see someone
get me a date with the help of a robot
listen Andre I just want you to know you
do not you would not need help getting a
date if you had a robot friend I mean it
would be pretty easy that's true it's
like dudes with a puppy like it just
women just like that's like that's like
an urban legend is that true cuz you're
a guy I don't maybe maybe because you're
in the like this sort of like robot
looks like a movie trope like where it's
like a guy with a puppy and ever had the
girls i'll come up against okay well but
my girlfriend's afraid of robots like
she's afraid they're gonna take over the
world she generally concerned about that
so I don't think like if she saw me to
bar with chappie that she'd be into it
like she'd be like all right nope and
also you look maybe a little lonely if
you're hanging out with a robot that's
true maybe you can't get any human
friends that's kind of weird maybe I'm
strikes people is kind of weird I like
it I like we're going like we going Neal
wrote in and said I'm in the military so
I need to rub off the shape of my face
overnight it'll get me an extra five
minutes in bed every morning uh I hate
to be critical on all of these very
dangerous as is because if you toss a
freezer are you and you're just giving a
robot a razor like us that's dangerous I
do i do like that because he has no time
he needs something that fix just push
shave my face so I just I just wanna
sleep in a little kudos on that you need
the George Jetson thing ripped a my bed
does all the things yeah I like that um
I'm gonna try not to put your name
because
I might be terrible at this but um
syafiqah syafiqah syafiqah sayaka yes I
yes I pika says the robot already
existed in the movie just a nice looking
soft huggable robot yes it's baymax it's
pretty close to beta how do we do it
okay how do we do it boo doo doo doo I
think I saw a lot of comments for that
on youtube so all you YouTube users I
read their comic you guys like crash
they were like baymax and they also said
first yes first baymax first baymax and
then lastly Joey emailed us and said a
robot to stop me from coming up with
stupid robot ideas oh the irony I like
that you know what I saw a lot of on
YouTube that that I'm surprised nobody
mentioned here was that it looked like a
robot from friday night at freddy's my
Freddie Freddie's everyone's like oh my
god five nights at Freddy's because it's
like like it's your bear that's tiny
rabbi and then it could like ya know I
after they said that I couldn't unsee it
it's like this thin line between
baymeadows do you know what else I can't
unsee just to this is sort of it once i
want someone said it now i can't unsee
it is you know jason momoa is Aquaman
yeah ralph garman said it looks like
John Travolta in Battlefield Earth and
now I can't unsee that picture and I'm
like no you ruined it for me Ralph
Garman why oh now you'll know now you
and all of you will never be able to
unsee that with me you're welcome you
can thank at ralph garman on twitter for
that um okay guys it's time for very
last easy to use your feedback it's time
for our phone talker for the day
pretty sure I just ruined kales whole
entire week with that but it wasn't my
fault it's ralph garman salt so that rob
zombie looks like the guy from
battlefield earth yes worlds close look
it's almost closing in on me I get um
I'm on wrote in to us and said hi
tomorrow daily i'm aiman from Sudan
Sudan of all places amazing first person

the time that this very it's very poetic
yes I'm sorry that I got so distracted
by that but like when someone did some
you know some really business something
really nice and creating that is really
creative I don't think at like only
maybe only someone from Sudan could come
up with that describe our daily getting
distracted by your comments when you're
showing us cool photo totally it's great
photo yeah really good picture I what
would make it better i think is like um
