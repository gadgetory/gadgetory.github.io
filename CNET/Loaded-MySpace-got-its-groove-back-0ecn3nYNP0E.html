million new users in the last 30 days

42 million free songs to stream and
that's more music than what Spotify and
Pandora offer the myspace music player
has unlimited and on-demand listening
radio modes it recommends songs and also
integrates with facebook and it's that

users in mid-january to 1.6 million
users today also making waves in the
music scene is smartphone and tablet
maker HTC the company is working on its
own music streaming service according to

sketchy on that music service but HTC
has already made music a key component

dre and music exec Jimmy Levine new HTC

features and expect to hear more next
month at the Mobile World Congress Expo
in Barcelona Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke at
an investor conference Tuesday noting
that Apple has done more than others to
address the issue of improving working
conditions at its manufacturing plants
Cook said Apple will report data each
month on the conditions of its suppliers
in an effort to be more transparent this
comes after growing criticism over the
working conditions at the factories in
China where Apple products are made of
course there are other companies that
also use these same manufacturing plants
like del aguila packard but critics are
focusing on apples saying the company
has the muscle to make a difference
another solar energy company has filed
for bankruptcy protection energy
conversion devices based in Michigan is
the latest solar company to be hit hard
by the plunging prices of solar panels
it manufacturers flexible silicon solar
cells and develop solar projects but
these silicon cells though are not as
efficient as traditional flat solar
panels when it comes to converting some
to electricity analysts expect more
solar companies to out of business as
prices continue to fall so ever feel
like you're addicted to the internet or
maybe you just can't put down the phone
to check facebook the American
Psychiatric Association says internet
addiction can be a real disorder and
it's considering adding it to the DSM

mental health profession internet
addiction could be alongside other
disorders like cocaine dependence some

a measurable impact on the brain but
more research is needed those are your
