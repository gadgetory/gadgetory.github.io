here with Michael cluley from rim
showing off the new playbook 2 point 0
operating system for the PlayBook tablet
tell me Michael what is going on with
the new playbook software it's great to
be here Donald and we're really excited
about playbook OS 20 what playbook OS to
doto is essentially bringing is the
built-in email calendar contacts
application as kind of the big
headliners for this release so within
the email application you get your
unified inbox which all our BlackBerry
users are used to already it's a great
way to get all of your information
coming in to write once not only do you
get your email accounts in there but you
also get your social accounts like
LinkedIn and Twitter you get access to
all information the email claims is also
bringing features like rich text compose
which allow you to you know change the
font sizes bold italicize all of that
within the email client itself including
a great improved virtual keyboard that
has autocorrect auto suggestion and
contextual word prediction really make
the email and messaging experience you
know to the next level I see nail the
email makes sense especially for a
blackberry device you really want a
powerful email client what I'll see you
have great so within the contacts
application we're moving again with that
social centric experience so a user
would add their LinkedIn or their
Twitter accounts to the device we go off
and we pulled down the friends you
follow the contacts that you have in
common and we merge that and integrate
that all into one contact card for the
user so contacts email calendar is the
the third application the built-in
application that we're adding and it
also brings in that social integration
into the
so your meetings aren't just about where
they are and when they are but it's
about the people you're meeting with so
you know who you're meeting with you
have all that great information about
them you know if they've changed roles
because i get linkedin updates you know
when the last time you met with them
because i can look at past meetings so
you have all that information before you
can get to that meeting and you're well
prepared in advance we also have what we
call growing numbers in the month view
the bigger the number is busy you are so
it really gives users that way to triage
their calendar quickly look at it so you
know what I'm really too busy on this
date let's try and book a meeting that
day and then dive into the further
details like that alright I'm exciting
place when I blackberry playbook user is
going to be able to access this on the
OS coming in February of this year and
and it's going to bring those three
things that I mentioned plus many things
else like the video store also powered
by Rho V or we're bringing in support
for android applications including some
of the thousands of great titles that we
have already all right Michael thanks
for joining us today thanks for showing
me BlackBerry PlayBook the list 2 point
0 and I'm excited to see it when it
comes out in February cnet com I'm
