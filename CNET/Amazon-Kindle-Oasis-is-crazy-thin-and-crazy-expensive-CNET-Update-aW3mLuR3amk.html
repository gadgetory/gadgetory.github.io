understand why anyone would buy it I'm
Bridget Carey this is you're seen that
update I'm worried that Jeff Bezos has
lost his mind because the Amazon CEO
thinks you're gonna pay more for a basic
Kindle e-reader than an iPad Amazon took
the wraps off its brand new Kindle Oasis
and it is the thinnest and the lightest
ereader yet but it also comes at a
laughable price it costs 290 dollars
that's more than an iPad Mini in fact
for that price you could buy two Kindle
paperwhite and still have 50 bucks left
over to buy some actual books or forget
the books just go ahead and buy a $50
Kindle Fire tablet so what new perks
come with the high priced Kindle Oasis
well unfortunately you are not getting a
water proof Kindle Oasis is a strange
choice for a name when it can be
defeated by hydration but it is 20%
lighter designed to be held on the side
with one hand so you can flip it to
rotate the screen and hold it in the
other hand also the lighting technology
got a little better it's more uniformed
and you get a swanky leather case that
also includes a backup battery so you
can keep reading for months without
charging if you want a 3G internet
connection that'll cost you extra that's
three hundred and sixty dollars it's
hard to justify why anyone would spend
that much unless you have a pool of gold
coins you dive into every night but
let's move on to some smarter Amazon
decisions the online retail giant
recently threatened to banish anyone
that's trying to sell faulty USB type-c
charging cables on its site you see this
new type C port is popping up on the
latest phones and laptops but some
cables sold on Amazon come from sketchy
manufacturers and they could fry your
device as some people learn the hard way
but soon you may not have to worry about
using a bad cable the group that sets
the standard for this USB type-c port
created new certification technology to
protect consumers so it's not certified
it just won't work on your device the
hope is that this would also stop
hackers from hiding a virus in the
charger in other news google found a new
way to guilt you for
lazy if you find it hard to make time to
work out or accomplish other goals now
Google Calendar will find the time for
you inside the Google Calendar app
you'll find a new option called goals
just pick the goal and how often you
want it on your calendar and Google's
gonna find a spot where it fits and yes
you can adjust it if you found another
reason not to hit the gym that's all for
this technique sound up and you can head

New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
