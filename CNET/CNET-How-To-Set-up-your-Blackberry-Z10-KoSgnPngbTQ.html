need a few minutes of your time and a
solid Wi-Fi connection
I'm Jason Cipriani a Sina how-to
contributor and this is how to set up
your BlackBerry z10 on the initial
screen you'll be able to select your
language and you navigate through by
swiping along the bottom from right to
left you'll be able to connect to a
Wi-Fi network and verify your cellular
network after you've entered all your
information and you are connected to a
Wi-Fi network which takes a few seconds
you'll then continue on by swiping to
the left again you'll need to select
your country and agree to the standard
terms and user agreement next step after
you've agreed to that is to set up a
BlackBerry ID or sign in with your
existing ID this is what you use to
purchase any content through BlackBerry
World then you'll also have the option
to enable or disable diagnostics in
location information and the final step
which is why you need a strong Wi-Fi
connection is a software update some
software updates are rather small this
one is only two megabytes other software
updates are going to be a lot larger
than that so a solid Wi-Fi connection
will speed up the process for you once
the software update has been installed
you'll be able to swipe to the left
again and then you'll be walked through
a gesture tutorial that shows you how to
navigate through apps pull down the
settings menu and the basic overall gist
of how BlackBerry 10 operates once
you've completed that you'll exit out of
the setup app and then you can scroll
through your home screen or go back to
the setup app and set up other items so
as you can see setting up your
BlackBerry z10 is a painless process
once again
