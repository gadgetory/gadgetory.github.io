I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com joined by
senior writer Daniel tournament today
we're talking all about vine and Twitter
tell us a little bit about this new
video embedded service so this is a
iphone and ipod touch up right now it's
a standalone service Twitter bought the
company in October and they just
launched it today okay what does it do
it does six-second video loops so you
can shoot a video of kind of anything
you want it's the examples of the showa
are like kids in the park or like a
runway show or maybe you know making
making a recipe or something and you
just shoot it you seen using your
smartphone iphone in this case and you
can then embed it in a tweed put it on
Facebook run it just in the vine app and
it just runs in a loop and it just it's
kind of like a long gif yeah Jeff I
guess what's the point of that since it
is only six seconds well they say it's
about brevity that you can create you
can express yourself creatively in six
seconds and so that's the that's the
time frame they chose they said that
they experimented with anything from
like four seconds to 10 seconds and
they'd settled on six there's another
service that I've written about called
tout which is a which is also you know a
phone-based video app that they chose 15
seconds and you know frankly based on on
that you know like you can you the
difference between six seconds and 15
seconds doesn't sound like a lot but it
really is it you can cover a lot of
ground on that much time sure it is
interesting how Twitter sort of
determines the length of things 140
characters for example or six seconds
you know they really are focused on
brevity and people seem to respond and
obviously use it they do and it's
interesting you know talked about the
hundred forty characters I mean when
when Twitter first launched and it was
just a hundred and forty characters
because that's what the limits were
based on text messages which is what you
know why they chose that length now
there's so much stuff that you can put
in a tweet that the whole idea of like
140 characters just kind of like you
know it's an afterthought you videos
photos articles summaries there's a
chart out there that lists all the
different metadata that you can that
it's included in a single tweet and it's
an unbelievable amount of information
well I guess that just goes to show that
we'll see what people can do a six
second
but will probably be more than we
initially think right now imagine so yes
great so the service is called vine it's
available today and it's free it's free
it's only for iphone and ipod touch they
said that they'll you know probably put
it out for quote other platforms later
on but right now it's it's just for
iphone and ipod touch and it is a
standalone service even though twitter
owns it they've launched it as its own
thing and you don't need a twitter
account to use it great thank you so
much staff writer senior writer daniel
