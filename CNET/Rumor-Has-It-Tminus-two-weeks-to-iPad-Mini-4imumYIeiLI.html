Dreyfuss and welcome to rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
biggest tech rumor and vote on what
sounds legit and remember that you can
vote too so keep your eyes out for the
interactive poll if you're watching on
cnet first up is a rumor about the sony
playstation 4 which we've been talking
about since we were a wee podcast based
on the recent announcement of the super
slim playstation 3 and some very
scientific calculations math alert rumor
mongers are concluding that the next
iteration of Sony slam dunk console will
hit store shelves in 2014 here's how the
math works the ps2 slim was released
eight years ago the ps3 was released six
years ago add to carry the one and
you've got a 2014 release date for the
ps4 we've been saying 2014 since 2011
when that seemed like eons in the future
now it's basically next year and I still
think it's true the slim with Sony's
last best hope of getting ps3 s into the
hands of the seven gamers in the world
who don't already own one and now
they're tapped out I think 2014 also
sounds about right even though the next
Xbox is rumored to be announced in 2013
the ps3 was also released after the xbox
360 but that didn't affect the bottom
line next we have a new rumor that
Amazon is going to start selling
something crazy and specific and outside
of its comfort zone amazon selling a new
thing is basically its own meme I know
well this time the crazy new product is
actually the best and worst idea in the
world wine why is this awesome because
wine delivered to my house on the cheap
at the click of a button why is this the
worst because wine delivered to my house
at the click of a button free the next
day thanks to amazon prime oh god this
is the end of Emily I'm never going to
see her again but seriously you might
have assumed that Amazon already sold
wine it's a perfect fit and especially
because it already sells caviar but it's
harder than you think to sell wine
across state lines amazon actually
entered the wine business in 1999 with
the stake in wine shopper calm but then
closed down ten years later because the
business did not perform to expectations
maybe they have a new plan this time
maybe they're drunk Oh ipad mini I hope
this next rumor comes true because we've
been talking about it for a year and
we're sick of it citing unnamed major
apple investors fortune says that
Apple's invites for an iPad Mini
specific event will be sent out next
week presumably for an unveiling the
following week as you may already know
the iPad Mini is speculated to be seven
inches and according to new leaked
pictures it'll come in a white version
as well another important popped up this
week saying that the iPad Mini is
actually already in production citing
anonymous sources our favorite Japanese
blog Macotakara said the production of
the product is underway in a Brazilian
Factory I've been saying yes to this
rumor since October 2011 the ipad is a
great product it would make sense for
Apple to make it in different sizes just
like it did with the ipod and plus i
have a humiliation day bet riding on
this one i've been voting no on this
rumor since we first heard Steve Jobs
say you'd have to file down your fingers
in order to use the thing but the timing
is incredibly suspicious and the
persistence of the rumor has my
confidence wavering it would be a
perfect infusion into the holiday market
plus I like to imagine it being built in
some hidden factory in the Brazilian
Amazon workers toiling away as monkeys
swinging from vines above the factory
roof also once we get to specific dates
for an invite being sent out things
start to sound less like a rumor and
more like a coordinated PR leak but
whatever i'm sticking with no because my
dignity is riding on it jungle book and
logic be damned what do you guys think
don't forget to vote and we're going to
go ask the people of San Francisco what
they think
I think it's a good idea i mean i think
there's definitely some demand for for a
smaller ipad would you want one uh yeah
definitely it wouldn't it wouldn't
surprise me if they did if Apple's gonna
compete against the fire and the the
galaxy I think they've got some work to
do so yeah I think it's probably pretty
likely would you want one considering
i'm a student and i've seen so many
people use an ipad in CS classes and
computer science classes i say it's a
fair bet i was already looking into the
ipad but having a laptop and something a
little bit smaller would work out really
well i don't see they use for it um cuz
i have my laptop and my phone so i think
people would be more willing to carry a
bigger phone is on I mean a bigger
smaller iPad as long as it had all the
features of their phone but no one wants
to answer an ipad now my friend here
works at apple and e is on the
development Wow let me ask you have you
heard this rumor that apple will be
releasing a smaller version of the ipad
reckon confirmer what's happening walk
behind you hurt tomorrow oh that's mom
brother friday interesting so we will be
getting invites / and i've had many of
it where's this friday news who's next
friday uh changing a story let me see
your credentials all right so would you
be interested in a smaller version
example gratitude yeah love one bigger
iphone it lasted well most of the people
on the street had heard of the ipad mini
and for a second we thought we'd met an
insider who worked on the ipad mini team
but i think it was the beer talking
let's go back inside and see what cnet
council thinks the cnet council is
composed of five editors who cast their
votes anonymously their opinions are not
an endorsement by Cena or CBS
interactive obviously because these are
rumors folks and the scenic council's
verdict is yay for editors 21 think the
ipad mini invites will in fact come out
next week which will be a great news for
you and terrible news for my dignity
because i'm going to be humiliated yay
you're happy about that our comment of
the week this week comes from cisco 2k
who writes Google will provide a map for
the iOS 6 and it will be the best map
the ever
created and they will charge for it
let's see 85 million iphone sold and 35
million iPads at two bucks that is some
sweet pocket change our other comment of
the week comes from tapper 562 who
writes Apple maps got me lost hope
you're okay tapper did you make it home
that's our show everybody share your
rumors that rumor has it at cnet com or
call one eight hundred 750 cnet and
tweet us tune in next week for more tech
rumors really already so tall okay so
I'll ask you didn't get today the whole
I don't like hey guys I'll ask you first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
