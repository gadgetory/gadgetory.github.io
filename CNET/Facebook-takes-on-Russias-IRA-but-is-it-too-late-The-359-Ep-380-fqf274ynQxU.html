Joanie Saltzman yesterday Facebook CEO
Mark Zuckerberg dropped a big update
about how the social network is
combating political meddling John were
the details so soccer Brooks said that
Facebook would be taking down more than
two hundred and seventy pages and
accounts run by the internet research
agency or IRA if you're wondering you
know why didn't Facebook already do this
and that's because it had but up until
this point most of Facebook's take downs
had been designed to prevent the IRA
from interfering interfering in foreign
elections this time Facebook is taking
down the IRAs pages and fake accounts
and all accounts that are targeting
people living in Russia itself ah so I
mean is this is this enough or this too
little too late for Facebook well I
think one thing that it definitely shows
especially in the way that Facebook
announced this move is how much more
transparent they're willing to be about
what they're actually doing you know
they gave examples of some of the pages
that they were taking about taking down
in the past when they've made moves like
this it would take a long time even for
them just to say what it was that they
were taking down right well they kind of
have to be a little bit more transparent
now given the hot water in from the
whole Cambridge analytic Adana flap
right now
we've got confirmation that Zuckerberg
will be appearing before Congress to
testify and next week you know obviously
this comes after mounting pressure from
from that controversy just curious what
your uh would you expect any here if
this is gonna be you know if this is
just gonna be a sideshow well I mean
whenever somebody goes to testify in
front of lawmakers it becomes a lot of
theater I mean there's a lot of theater
involved no matter what but as you know
correct me if I'm wrong but I think
Zuckerberg has never testified ever
that is correct he's really good at
sending his lieutenants right and so you
know it speaks to the fact that he's
that Facebook is starting to realize
that you know the buck stops there and
he needs to be the one you know he said
in the past like I'd be happy to testify
in front of Congress if I'm the right
person to do it
and I think the response that a lot of
people had was is you're always the best
person to do it
at least you should be alright so the
big story from yesterday was a shooting
at YouTube's headquarter
a police confirmed the shooter was Nasim
Mojave automat 39 year old woman who had
various YouTube channels and complained
that YouTube is no longer paying for
content now Joan could you help me break
down with the monetization policy and
why someone would you know I have a
grievance against YouTube right so
generally speaking monetization
complaints by youtubers are centered
around the fact that they believe that
their content should be allowed to have
advertising run on it and therefore
making them money sure especially in the
last year and a half
YouTube has had a lot of difficulty
because it's trying to straddle
satisfying two different contingents its
youtubers the ones that upload stuff and
its advertisers who want safety and what
their ads are run against YouTube's had
a really difficult time figuring out the
happy medium where it is putting ads
against stuff that's safe for
advertisers but not censoring
quote-unquote the youtubers that are
uploading content by D monetizing them
so that's essentially what the the
conflict is about alright so lastly I
just show it's not all grim news I
wanted to give a shout out to Patrick
Holland for his lovely feature on robot
companions these soft cuddly
contraptions can help people who are
dealing with cancer diabetes depression
dementia and more and there's even one
modeled after the athletic Patrick node
that after spending 15 minutes with it
he did not want to let go so we wanted
to end on a you know a cute and cuddly
note alright so for more these stories
check us out on CNN I'm Roger check I'm
Johnny sauceman thanks for listening
okay that concludes a recording of the
audio podcast thanks everybody for
joining us I'm gonna go ahead and jump
back into the chat room and see if I can
dig out any good comments and questions
and let's talk more about the duck
because that's the only thing I want to
think about right now Patrick Holland
always does such a nice jobs on his
story I really enjoy his personality I
only got to meet him for the first time
this year at CES when we were there he's
so much fun where where did he come up
with this where did he find this cuz
this originates with the parousia
correct yeah yep our CEO it was the that
serves the I guess that's the name brand
companion robot
around for a while and he went to this
VA hospital and he saw how various
patients sort of lit up when they saw
pero who's almost like a celebrity like
oh there's the there's the seal one the
doctor said like especially patients
dementia when they're holding the seal
they don't know that it's a robot they
think it's the legit thing and the
doctors are like you know what this
helps with the care like we're not gonna
break that illusion so these kinds of
robots definitely have a real powerful
impact on you know for adults for for
children particularly in terms of a
calming influence and in helping with
their recovery and just this stem from
his interaction with the athletic scss
when he spent time with it and then he
he decided to do a bit more research and
start digging into some of these other
robots that that also comes for the same
purpose yeah it's very cool let's take a
question from Mike Shaw in the chat how
long until apartment start charging an
extra deposit for Robo pets that is
because you know robot robot pets don't
do any of the things that ruin
apartments I don't eat and get food
everywhere that's true defecate and
urinate that's what one of the doctors
mentioned like you know it's very hard
to bring in a dog or a pet for Hospital
this is like you leave it with a patient
you know it's not gonna poop anywhere so
right you know like in burn units those
people it's there's such strict
guidelines about bacteria and about yeah
yeah
Matthew dad sure goes on to point out
you know what are we really supposed to
be worried about what's a landlord
worried about with a robo pet and oil
spills I don't know maybe it I don't the
worst-case scenario but I've got
batteries so it could technically
explode only if it was made by Samsung
Oh or Boston Dynamics is the worst case
like it becomes a Westworld sort of like
it because I because like a Chucky
overthrows the landlord that oh you're
right that is the worst case scenario
that is pretty pretty out there but I
mean we've all watched Black Mirror we
know it could happen very true we've all
watched the fictional thing
listen how many times against El grito
how many times have we cited Terminator
on this show right well you brought that
up right those those flipping robots I
mean one of them that's that's some
danger right there I did I just get
freaked out with the one that opens
doors that's the one that creeps me out
the most but whatever it's just this
like no no no changing in here strange
or he wants us to talk about Russia yeah
speaking of Russia can Facebook be
considered as a metaphorical nerve gas
one that has enchanted society that is
an interesting perspective on this
diving deep that yeah well I think that
you know to go without analogy I think
that maybe that has happened and this is
like for whatever reason we're in an era
right now where people are sort of
waking out of that stupor a little bit
if you want to call it a stupor I don't
know if it's fair or not but you know
there definitely was a period of time
where tech companies facebook included
were cut a lot of slack because as they
brought so much convenience to our lives
and I think the Facebook itself cut
itself slack because it believed in its
mission was a good one and so now that
the public is realizing and Facebook
itself is realizing that even though it
had good intentions it can be used for
ill and very dramatic and and you know I
don't even know if it's necessarily good
intentions I think the intention was for
Facebook to connect as many people as
possible right
that mission blinded them to the
potential consequences that were there's
obviously a very sprung up I don't know
if I'd call Facebook itself nerve gas
element maybe the if we're gonna use
that analogy like the rhetoric around it
the misinformation that might be the
nerve gas because it's not like Facebook
itself is inherently bad right well what
about the the Facebook YouTube snapchat
generation that's sprung up around it is
that is there any redeeming quality to
these generations that have been oh yeah
someone indoctrinated by the facebook
model oh I don't think indoctrination is
is what's happened at all to people that
were born in the age of these things I
think that they just think about the
world their worldview is shaped by it I
think that younger people are actually
more skeptical of Internet companies
than
people are but is it what would you say
that there's like maybe a sweet spot in
between the I am you know me like some
sort of middle generation that the the
older people I don't know I don't know
what I'm trying to say here you say the
younger people are more skeptical but
there's got to be something of a
demographic whether it's well maybe it's
actually more of a psychographic at this
point rather than an age bracket right
people who just are more susceptible to
I mean once upon a time it would have
been films and now it's social media
right only playing video games they
blame you know right I mean are you the
Jen's ears seem to be probably the most
skeptical right there right they haven't
grown up with this all their lives I
think they're they're I guess they're
more savvy about it then I think you can
older folks who sort see Facebook as a
convenience and as a newsfeed yeah for a
lot of people well the Jen's ears were a
bit more of the screw society kind of
screw the man kind of I can't use the
language I want to use really kind of
was right if you look back in the 90s
culture wait wait you Jen's ears are
they're the ones ask the Millennials
they're really young one they're like
the super young ones oh maybe I'm
thinking Generation X
oh this categorization is this gonna be
the new millennial bug worry about all
the clocks to reset
Josh boy de let's talk more about
Facebook will Mark Zuckerberg be
testifying a rule it just be for show
like all the other testimonies from
these companies now we said that he will
he's put on buying yeah sure I mean what
whether or not he actually says anything
or fee the furs I don't know that
that'll be interesting how how
transparent he'll he'll be cuz there's
definitely a lot of pressure on him to
give answers and the company has been
more transparent yeah as you pointed out
earlier I don't know if Zuckerberg is
gonna be it's just very interesting
because he's not if you see my
interviews he's kind of an awkward
interview yeah though it'll be
interesting how he handles what
presumably will be an hour or two hours
hours they're gonna have to refresh his
firmware before they say welcome back in
yeah they're gonna have to reboot I put
them in low-power mode
mm-hmm yeah I'd be worried that maybe
the old outdated scripts might not
function up the up the key I'm sure
they're they're rewriting the AI
algorithms specifically I mean do you
have a sense it's my understanding that
Mark Zuckerberg has never I mean besides
just testifying in Congress that being
in first he's never really put himself
in a position where he's this vulnerable
and no no I mean so we it's hard to know
I controlled it's very controlled it's
very short usually you know the
company's terms but it's definitely an
unfavorable terms yeah and the only
times he's gone to conferences are like
earlier days of all things D conferences
right C I think maybe TechCrunch there
were a couple where he had like long
half-hour segments right he didn't want
Sarah Lacy at one point yeah that was 30
minutes long but that was definitely in
the early days when Facebook was an
up-and-coming company yeah there's a lot
of optimism and there's very little
skepticism right here's hoping that he
doesn't broadcast this one in VR we have
a great counterpoint here from snow
ponies they say no I think young people
are far less skeptical they don't seem
to have any concerns about privacy they
share everything and that is also true
well it might be true for certain
Millennials yeah I mean it's we're like
over generalizing for sure but what kind
of sharing are they engaged and that's
the question I want to ask because from
a lot of perspective it's a very
skeptical very sarcastic very meta kind
of perception and and the content that
they share they're not actually overly
concerned maybe some not more than some
are very let's call it self-absorbed
well I mean I think let's look at the
Parkland students I mean that's a good
example of how a Gen Z age bracket like
the reason why the discussion about gun
control is different for that mass
shooting versus other ones is because
that's a generation of kids
understands how to use social media and
to not get caught up in like trolling
like they understand how to deal with
trolls and they also know how to use
social media in a way to advocate for
their own personal causes in a way
that's kind of a it's a it's
unprecedented in gun control discussion
in this country yeah I remember snapping
like snapchat played a huge presence
like in terms of like the heat map for
for activity during that protest so for
sure that's I mean it's yeah I mean it's
like I said it's hard to generalize but
that's gen CI with the Millennials I
mean I think there is an element where
there is over sharing but I think that's
also just what I mean like my parents
overshare yeah something like when
you're that age you're probably doing
dumb things to you just now have a much
wider platform to do it that's it though
I mean we we as people have had a
history of over sharing in certain
scenarios you always everybody knows
that one friend who you get them in the
group get a couple drinks in them and
all of a sudden you know way too much
about the deepest darkest secrets now
that we have this wide open it's is
Facebook just the bar is that what it's
really become is like the drunken
ramblings to the BART I mean you could
argue that like the stuff in your brain
that happens when you see those likes
rolling in is not dissimilar from how
alcohol lowers your inhibitions that's
that's kind of stretching it but it's
kind of fun to think of okay of getting
validation yeah yeah yeah well if you
combine that with actual alcohol yeah
that's like way horse
I like this comment from serene joy that
just came in privacy is indirectly
proportional to convenience I would
rather give my android apps access
multiple sensitive data for serving me
to the full extent another interesting
perspective as always sir enjoy thank
you for contributing any take back on
that one right yeah convenience versus
privacy is often there after that people
it's the whole thing we're publicly
people prefer privacy but privately they
yeah and I think that where everyone's
becoming smarter Facebook and people
that use it about like you know when
like a little like jelly
fish game asked to have access to all
your friends data and you're just like
okay three years ago because like you
just don't realize what they're entitled
to now we're starting to realize what
that entitles them to and also the the
handset makers and comes the Google
software makers like they've done a
better job of making sure you're aware
that's because those early days like it
was like those terms of services you
just scroll right past it hit okay and
boom you just giving them access
everything yeah they're a little bit
better now at making sure you understand
exactly what you're giving up yeah so
we're gonna step into some delicate
territory here what we saw yesterday was
as always horrifying and humbling what
else have we we learned what else can we
take away what can we learn from in this
situation that developed in San Bruno
yesterday well there's not much that we
can learn yet because we're still
learning what happened good yeah yeah
just that this I mean this happens or
too often we don't we don't really know
all the details but yeah this this
happens scary now this individual the
the the shooter she came in on a mission
because she felt her she was wronged by
by YouTube as a platform correct well we
don't even really know that for sure
these are still trying to determine a
motive I mean like our CBS Ola has
interviewed the family of the shooter
and the her father did mention that
that's what she expressed we don't we
don't know for sure if that's the actual
motive but that's sort of been brought
up as the potential it's part of the
context you know what might have
happened maybe but we still don't know
understood I'm glad that we're not
speculating here but it is something
that you know it's on a lot of people's
minds because it's terrifying
yeah totally terrifying we want to know
why you all grapple for why why did this
happen you know what would we are still
learning a lot I know that there is a
number of Twitter accounts out there
searching out and trying to debunk the
act of trolling that I never circulates
that was one of the other issues that
flared up again
yes right whenever there's because
Humanity is terrible exactly it is this
kind of tragic incident like there are
trolls out there who are spreading
misinformation I mean there's someone
who hacked one of the accounts of one of
the YouTube employees who first alerted
the public that this was even happening
so yeah there's just like every time
something bad happens like there are
there are folks who just sort of make it
worse yeah happened again yeah be the
first to say that takes a special kind
of asshole to try to capitalize on an
event like this special kind of Butthead
well I'm sticking with my language I
mean years ago like we I think a lot of
folks look at or heralded Twitter as
like new platform for like sharing real
time news and sort of crowdsourcing
information up to day and now it's like
it's become this complete misinformation
zone but coming full circle with
Facebook we just talked about we you it
does illustrate the how hard it is I'm
you know I'm the last person to say Jack
Dorsey and Zuckerberg oh they have it so
hard they're billionaires but it does
illustrate the difficulty like we
learned about the fact that there was a
shooting in our newsroom we learn about
it through Twitter yeah that's right we
first found out that it was happening
and realized we needed to start covering
it in a responsible way and you know
that's how we learned but then terrible
other misinformation was spread at the
same time so one step forward two steps
back in minutes after we learned about
it somebody starts to deviate you down a
path of misinformation yeah absolutely
Parkland like conspiracy theories pop up
like it's just and it just shows you
like yeah it's it is a good tool for
information still in some respects but
you have to be a lot more cautious and
critical about what you're seeing yeah
the one recurring comment I'm seeing
circulated both in our chat and outside
of this is that people automatically did
assume that this was some kind of
disgruntled creator who was mad about ad
pocalypse about the deamination plague
crossing YouTube right now we'll have to
still learn more to figure out exactly
what the details were on that but that's
a place to start I guess yeah yeah so
switching gears real quick just to get
back on me happy well maybe this isn't
happy but at least it's less
utterly depressing certain joist is off
topic what's up with all the Tesla buzz
so many negative news so much negative
news coming in why do they even set
unachievable targets well I'm not sure
what he's referring to I can't remember
cuz a few days ago in my brain I'm like
a goldfish I forget everything in like
15 seconds but um
nothing like hit some numbers and it was
encouraging
Tesla misses production go of 2500 Model
3 s's a week that's probably what he's
referring to so you can clarify I mean
yeah let's see here's the deal so they
were yeah they they missed production
but I guess they raised more money this
year so that's probably why so mixed
signals that's what your show yeah you
know I mean like the fact that they mr.
production don't goals is not great but
demand for those cars are still really
high so there's clearly a lot of buzz
for Tesla gotcha yeah I always feel I
always kind of hesitate to draw
conclusions when a company misses its
own internal goals because that's not
like outside world factors you know what
I mean like they said really high goal
prompt maybe it's possible they just set
the goal wrong and they couldn't get
there it's kind of like when like
there's reports it's very different but
on my beat like when BuzzFeed misses a
revenue target and people are talking
about how that's the end of BuzzFeed oh
it's like no no they just said like
course not a really high target and they
didn't quite make it but they still
profited yeah so maybe yeah I gotcha
that's a good takeaway so enjoy does
clarify production and accident there
was an accident
oh there was the yeah there was a
accident a few days ago I think someone
else is an auto pilot accident
and I thought sorry correct for rollick
I thought I read somewhere like someone
else tried to like replicate that and
they're like almost got an accent
themselves are they trying to replicate
an accident on Idol Paulo and then they
almost had an accident or something that
goes something like that yeah I mean
come on we'll have to dig more on this
one Mike Shaw says the accident was
human error if your car tells you to put
your hands on the wheel you should
probably put your hands on the wheel so
that's the thing it's not like a people
treat it like it's autonomous driving
it's not it's right level one autonomy
like I know there different levels to it
yeah but it makes me remember the
episode of The Simpsons where Bart
steals the car and then he goes cruise
control my man and sits in the backseat
and then they drive straight into a
cornfield or a better more relevant more
concurrent was probably the episode of
the office where the man tells Michael
Devon water yeah life imitates art I did
see one thing that I wanted to bring up
myself before we shut it down for the
day is a Russia tried to launch their
first drone delivery and it smashed
straight into a wall anybody see that no
oh man the video is adorable it's
adorable it's adorable they tried to do
their own the Amazon like drone and
package delivery thing is well done and
it's hard making drones that deliver
stuff that's hard work man if anybody's
looking for a good laugh it's all over
the place you'll find it I think we are
out of time yes we are so one on we
closed it down for the day thanks
everybody good discussion yeah on heavy
topics on difficult topics we appreciate
you being you we'll try to keep it later
tomorrow we'll try and try let's just go
get the seal or the duck in here yes I
think somebody reached out the beeping
and overnight that to us all right all
right if you liked anything you saw or
heard here check us out on CNN our
podcast is available on iTunes tune in
stitcher feedburner google play music
and the Amazon echo see y'all tomorrow
take care everyone have a good night</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
