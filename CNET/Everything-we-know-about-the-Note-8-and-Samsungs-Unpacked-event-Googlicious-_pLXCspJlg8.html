Google issues for everything inside the
world of Google it's what we know and
expect to see from Samsung's Note 8 and
unpacked event on August the 23rd but
before we start we all know about the
solar eclipse seen here in the US but
Google had to get in on the action
during an eclipse a viewing party at
14th Street Park in New York to unveil
the official name of Android 8 as Oreo
we're only five people that were really
paying attention to it like you can see
the anti-climactic statue unveiling here
again during the solar eclipse viewing
party it's gonna leave that right here
ok let's get to the big stuff and we
have to give props to Evan blast who has
been revealing a constant flow of images
and specs for no date before anyone else
until Samsung confirmed the leaks by
publishing the note 8 on their Us
website and then taking it down later
right come on the secret's out so let's
jump into the specs the note 8 will have
a monster 6.3 inch AMOLED display with
minimal bezels and a new 18 point 5 by 9
aspect ratio at a 2k native resolution
it will be IP 68 rated like other Galaxy
phones for water and dust protection and
the design will be more squared off
compared to the s8 and s8 plus it will
bring six gigs of RAM a bump up from the
standard four gigs in most versions of
the s8 NSA plus there are 64 gigs of
internal storage plus a microSD card
slot for more expansion now the u.s.
gets a snapdragon 835 processor globally
it's the Exynos 88-90 5 chipset the note
8 will get a rear dual lens camera for
the first time with 2 12 megapixel
sensors one with a wide-angle lens and F
1.7 aperture and dual pixel autofocus
and the other with a telephoto lens and
an F 2.4 aperture with a 2 X optical
zoom it will support wireless charging
and quick charging via USB type-c with a
3300 milliamp hour battery that's less
than the note 7s but you know what we
know how that thing worked out and it
will also come in midnight black maple
Gold orchid gray and deep sea blue again
these pictures brought to you by Evan
last now no one has narrowed down the
price yet but it's expected to be close
but below the 1000 price point in the US
and shipping sometime in September now
this is really a chance for Samsung to
make right after its note 7 disaster and
would also be nice to see them you know
offer some sort of a bundle or break to
customers who previously bought a note 7
and then we're forced to return them so
guess what we'll find out on the 23rd
and guess who is back at it again
venture beats Evan blast revealed
details and images for the new Samsung
gear fit 2 pro last week running
Samsung's Tizen OS and we expect to see
this at unpacked as well the fit tube
probes band can be fully submerged in
water to track swimming workouts with an
ip68 rating for brief interactions with
water but it's not meant to be submerged
for long periods of time it will sync up
with the speedo on app that we talked
about last week the fit 2 pro will also
have GPS and support offline play with
Spotify and has this new clasp that's
more reliable compared to the fit 2 it's
compatible with both Android and iOS and
the leaked screenshots shows us it will
retail for 199 US dollars but we'll wait
for the official confirmation and this
next one won't be ground-shaking
but we could see a new gear VR headset
it was updated with the galaxy s 8 in
April but it largely stayed the same and
added a motion controller now we'll see
if the new gear VR is compatible with
the new note 8 or if it adds anything
new we know Samsung is working on their
own standalone VR headset that includes
positional tracking they even showed it
off at Mobile World Congress in Shanghai
in July no word if it will make an
appearance at impact but you know what
you never know ok here's the details
Samsung's impact event is Wednesday
August the 23rd it starts at 8 a.m.
Pacific time 11 a.m. Eastern Time and
will last about an hour you'll be able
to watch all of our live coverage with
myself and the CNET crew starting at
7:30 a.m. right here on CNET we're at
live stream youtube and periscope
channels where we'll be taking your live
calls as well so we'll see you all there
