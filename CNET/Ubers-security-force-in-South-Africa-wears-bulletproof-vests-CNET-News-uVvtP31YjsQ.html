economy including uber
I'm Richard neva I covered Google and
Facebook we actually went to Africa for
another story but while we were there we
started talking to Ober drivers in
Johannesburg and later in Nairobi before
we got there we already heard of
violence between taxi drivers and uber
drivers one driver's car was set on fire
in June that driver died two weeks ago
taxi drivers are angry because of
extremely low fares offered by uber they
say uber is killing their business we
asked you were drivers what uber is
doing to protect them and they told us
about a security firm uber hired called
high risk security we went to this train
station in Johannesburg and found the
security guards they refused to let us
take their photos but I can tell you
that they were just an all-black
military gear with bulletproof vests
they were intimidating to look at much
less to approach but we did and they
were actually pretty nice we learned
that when you hail an uber at that
station the Apple direct you to where
the security guards are far away from
the taxi stand to make sure riders and
drivers are protected we talked to this
uber driver who told us that his friend
was hospitalized after he was attacked
with an iron by taxi drivers he said
he's had friends who have quit driving
for uber because of the violence we also
talked to a taxi driver who told us he's
more mad at uber than at its drivers he
basically said it's a Western company
that's come in and heard poor people we
have a lot more details in our story

South Africa check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
