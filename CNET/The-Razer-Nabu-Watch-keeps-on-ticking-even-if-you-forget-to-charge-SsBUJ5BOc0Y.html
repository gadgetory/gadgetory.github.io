mice keyboards and headphones Razer
branched into laptops and fitness
trackers now they've got a watch but
they want you to know it's not a smart
watch to watch with a few smart features
built-in it's gotten notifications will
pull in your text messages and things
like that from your phone but otherwise
it does world time stopwatch alarms and
things like that instead of being a
second little smartphone like device you
interact with you on your wrist like
most smartwatches this one's designed to
pull in more ambient information it'll
be your fitness tracker it'll pull in
those SmartWatch notifications into this
tiny little scrolling interface and it
has a couple different batteries so even
if you run out of juice on the primary
one for the notifications you'll still
have a secondary watch battery that
lasts for up to 18 months so you'll
always be able to have the time and
alarms and things like that you'll never
be without the time of day on your wrist
it's probably head with some of the
other smart watches out there
the Inaba watch is going to be shipping
this month January for $149 for this
plastic one and there's a upscale forged
Edition for 199 dollars
it's the novel watch
