for cnet.com and I'm here with the Jabra
Revo headphones you probably know Jabra
from its bluetooth headsets but yes it
is indeed making headphones this also
comes in a wireless model but that
Wireless model does cost around $250
while this one while retailing for
around 199 can be had for closer to a
hundred and fifty dollars and that's a
good price this is a very good sounding
headphone it's also very comfortable
it offers nicely balanced sound decent
mounted base and clean clear sound I so
like that the headphones fold up and it
is nice that Jabra labels the inside of
the ear cups with left and right so it's
easy to tell which is left and right
this headphone does come with a
detachable cord and the cord does have
an inline remote and microphone for cell
phone calls was nice like a lot of the
premium headphones these days this has
two headphone jacks another person can
plug in his or her headphones into the
open Jack and listen along with you to
whatever you're listening to whether
that be music or movies these do come in
a white version as well and as I said
these are very comfortable earphones for
on here headphones I typically don't
like on your headphones as much as over
the ear headphones but these are
comfortable they do have memory foam in
the air cups and they also seem well
built with metal armatures that hold the
ear cups as well as some air cushioning
in the headband itself really the only
thing I'm a little bit critical of is
the included carrying bag it just seems
a little cheap and thin it's really
almost like paper like you do expect a
little bit more from headphones that are
in the 150 to 200 dollar price range
aside from that small drawback I really
did like these headphones comfortable to
wear they sound good and they're good
for mobile use I'm David Connolly and
those are the Jabra Revo headphones
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
