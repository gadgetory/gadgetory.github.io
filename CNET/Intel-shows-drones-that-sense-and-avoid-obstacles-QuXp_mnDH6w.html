smart aware robots that can not only
move in two dimensions but they can move
in three dimensions I'd like to take
this moment to invite some more of my
friends to join me on stage to show you
just what I mean
along with the drones are our friends
John Daniel and Michael from ascending
technologies they worked with us to
integrate realsense technology into each
of the Firefly drones you see here now
there's something very unique about
these drones they also have an Intel
processor the helps these drones use the
information from real sense to see think
and adapt no more collisions guys why
don't you walk through the drones you
could see they put down their patrols
the drones are adapting to them so I'd
like to try something a little bit more
advanced though we're gonna try the
first-ever drone ping-pong game to
demonstrates the DOH drones ability to
avoid a moving object so let's put to
the drones down and we'll use this drone
here and we're gonna play a little drone
ping-pong simply moving the drone
between us you see the drone continues
to try and stay in one position but keep
it from going in the audience
avoiding us at all times
I can tell you we played this in a
conference room one day and it was
pretty exciting so let's drop the final
drone and I'd like to go over and talk
to young and just hear a little bit yawn
can you can you tell us a little bit
about what you've done here with real
sense in your Firefly drones sure so we
are using six realsense cameras to
create a 360-degree view as you can see
here so we see obstacles far away are
blue and close by our app so we can move
around a little we use our intel onboard
computer to expect the most relevant
information and send it to our triple
redundant nest tech Trinity autopilot
which then calculates position data and
obstacle avoidance commands this is all
done with our GPS or a motion capture
system so okay not our GPS just done
with motion capture why is this a big
deal it's just so much easier and safer
to fly a drone with this technology you
can just focus on the goal and that the
system handle the dynamic environment
it's a game changer for the whole
industry thanks you on this this is
great we think that drones have a
possibility to change our lives in many
ways
you've heard about drone delivery but
there's much more Jones can deliver
medications and life-saving
interventions to remote places inspect
power lines agricultural fields and gas
lines assist humans basically keeping
the humans out of danger with our
technology these intelligent robots open
doors that can lead to amazing wonders
these goals can avoid obstacles and the
fact is the real world is filled with
all kinds of obstacles almost like a
giant obstacle course
so we decided to build one here at CES
and we want to see if our drones can
safely navigate through it we call it
our very own game of drones we've used
programming to strict the drone to fly
the shortest difference distance from
Daniel down there at the far end to the
mirror into the stage here their job is
to fly the shortest distance and we've
contained them to that space but we've
not told them how to get there their job
now is to navigate that obstacle course
the best way the shortest way they can
to safely get to the other side here
just outside so Daniel let's see what
happens what you see is the drone takes
off and Daniel will put the controller
up as he just simply releases it and
says go from point A to point B being
here
he puts the controller up and the Jones
off on its own control you'll see it
moving left to right but not only is it
moving left to right it's having to move
up and down as it avoids the obstacles
that we put in its place
the Jones doing this all on its own we
could go in and change if somebody wants
to stand in front of that drone they're
welcome to
but we made one last obstacle to prove
to you this is live we put a set of
doors at the end preventing the drone
from getting to its final home
so let's say we let the drone go home
and we go ahead and open the doors
the real leap forward that the industry
has been waiting for is literally give
drones sight to increase not only
autonomy but safety and that's exactly
what real sense Intel processing and
these Firefly Jones have done we took it
a step further though just prior to see
us we took these drones out into the
real world to see what would happen and
let's take a look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
