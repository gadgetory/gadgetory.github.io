to the apple pie for all the good and
bad inside the world of Apple will
announce our iphone 5 case winners but
first to the show now the hottest news
and rumors are still surrounding the
ipad mini and a new report from the
Guardian says the mini is expected to
only come in a Wi-Fi version they also
report the revised version of the
current iPad the same one we told you
about over a month ago we'll bring the
new lightning connector and 4G
connectivity that's compatible in the UK
as well there's new images on the web
this time from an Australian writer
showing off the iPad minis purported
design that fall in line with what we've
seen time after time see I'm a poet and
I know it now a new iPad has already
shown up in one developers app analytics
with the designation iPad 36 according
to MacRumors it appears to be using the
same a6 chip found in the iPhone 5 or a
variation of it it's believed to be the
new updated full-size iPad instead of
the mini which has been seen in logs
using a derivative of the iPad Tuesday
a5 chip now some outlets report that
production challenges with components
for the maxi pad mini will limit launch
supplies of the device but the Wall
Street Journal says component suppliers
are pushing to meet apples plans to
build more than 10 million units in the
fourth quarter that means make sure you
have at least a 7-inch stocking or
bigger to put more things in the
stocking alright we're done with the
ipad mini talk and we still expect an
announcement this month but what about
macbook pro 13-inch retinas according to
our cnet sources the 13-inch retina pro
is still on track for production in the
fourth quarter but it's not clear if
they will make it in time for the
holiday season or if we'll see them
released next year my guess is that if
they aren't in production right now we
won't see them until 2013 now there's
still also know peeps or chatter about
new imacs macros or Mac minis and it's
starting to feel like we'll see those in
the beginning of 2013 as well now the
new fifth generation ipod touch and
gen ipod nano have started shipping to
customers this week so we wanted to show
you a few tidbits from our first look at
the new ipod touch with Scott Stein is a
lot thinner and a lot lighter believe it
or not than the iphone 5 but it also
obviously is not a phone and doesn't
require a contract but also has slightly
different set of specs under the hood
this uses an a5 processor not an a6 that
matches what you'd find in the iphone 4s
and also the second generation ipad it's
a dual-core processor now it works with
siri which is built into this finally
and all the iOS 6 apps work here you can
get Apple maps with flyover and
everything runs really smoothly but it
may have a slight impact in terms of the
way the games look but that retina
display is going to be a killer app for
video quality the fact that you can look
at it in 69 and be able to look at
videos with less letterboxing and also
play games that are potentially iphone 5
compatible and be able to take advantage
of all that stuff on the App Store
that's going to be a big appeal here
this is 1080p video and it shoots it
with image stabilization which is a lot
like what you find in the iphone 5 but
the camera is 5 megapixels so it's not
eight megapixels but it does have a lens
construction like the iphone 5 so it's
really kind of a hybrid and it has
panorama which is that new camera
feature and all the other iOS 6 features
it has HDR and this new ipod touch is
absolutely the best i pod that's been
around and it's a pretty cool device
even outside of that so there you have
it i'm scott stein and that's a look at
the new 5th generation ipod touch from
apple alright that's a look at the ipod
touch let's take a look at some of the
other wild stuff Apple is thinking up in
a recently discovered apple patent Apple
is possibly looking into the future with
their notebook concept that replaces the
traditional keyboard and mouse with a
single transparent work area that's
multi-touch when the notebook is closed
the lid could still be used with a
touch-sensitive surface that allows you
to interact with the display I should
reiterate this doesn't mean apples doing
this right now but it's getting inside
the heads of what the Cupertino kids are
thinking about all right let's check out
some quick bites in a press release
Microsoft's Czech Republic team
announced that microsoft has plans on
releasing office
for iOS and Android sometime in March of
2013 we know office for the ipad has
been a long-running rumor and it would
appear to confirm this now Microsoft
corporate then issued a statement saying
the information was not accurate uh-huh
it was on a press release so guys put
march two thousand thirteen on calendars
and apples really affordable really
affordable $29 lightning adapters have
also started shipping but if you don't
believe in pain that much a third-party
solution from china-based iphone 5 mod
calm might be the way to go claiming
they have cracked apples authentication
chip to allow third-party solutions to
work I love you China alright Apple
appears to be quietly improving its map
app in iOS including adding a 3d view of
the statue of liberty and the placement
of some locations have been updated it's
a move in the right direction but I
still wouldn't rely on it for at least a
year and guys if you love shows like
American Idol or X Factor because who
doesn't love hearing talent like this I
do now Simon Cowell and will I am are
working on a new project called x factor
for tech to find the next great
entrepreneurial talent where they hope
to find the next Steve Jobs will I hope
you don't all right let's announce the
winners of our iphone 5 giveaway and I
asked for five apps on my phone from a
previous episode and some of you tried
to be outgoing and named more than five
