Kardon Soho wireless on your bluetooth
headphone which carries a list price of
two hundred and fifty dollars at first
glance this looks very similar to its
wired sibling but Harman has made some
small design improvements including
moving from cloth cover to your pass to
this leather covering I also much prefer
the new lightweight carrying case that
comes with these headphones which fold
flat and are very travel friendly as you
can see they have a swanky premium feel
to them though they're small square ear
cup design may not appeal to everyone's
aesthetic tastes
I found them comfortable to wear though
they will jostle around a little bit if
you move your head from side to side
quickly that said they do offer
reasonably good noise isolation despite
their small size as far as features go
you get NFC tap to pair technology for
devices that support it as well as app
tech support you can also listen to
these in Wired mode if your battery dies
and there's a built in microphone for
making cell phone calls I'm not sure
what the battery rating is but it seems
to be well over ten hours because I
didn't have to recharge after a week of
using them on my commute to and from
work the big extra feature is the touch
sensor built into the right ear cup it
allows you to advanced tracks forward
and back and raise and lower volume by
simply swiping your finger across the
ear cup you can also tap once to pause
or answer calls until now this is a
feature found on even higher-end
headphones like the parrot Zeek I
sometimes had to swipe a couple of times
to advance tracks but overall the touch
controls worked well for me and I really
liked having them on board the sound is
also quite good for a bluetooth
headphone and by that I mean the
headphone sounds pretty natural with
clean fairly balanced sound there's a
decent amount of bass but it's not
overpowering and the clarity is good I'm
not sure the sounds quite on par with
Boz's sound like on your bluetooth
headphone which also costs 250 dollars
but it's close in the end I came away
liking this wireless version of the Soho
a lot more than the wired version its
fit and style may not be for everybody
but it's a very good on your Bluetooth
headphones I'm David Connolly thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
