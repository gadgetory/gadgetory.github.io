Carey and this is your cnet update
facebook is changing things up again the
social network is rolling out a new look
for the homepage news feed that clears
out some of the side clutter and makes
photos posts and activity much larger
with more imagery so if you share a
story you're going to see a larger
thumbnail on a larger headline if you
check into a location a map will show up
Facebook feels that bigger is better of
course that also means advertisements
will also be larger but first let's
break down what's changing you still
have the main news feed but since the
main news feed only shows you selected
highlights now you can toggle between
more specific fields to get every post
there's an all friends feed that will
show you every single post from your
friends in chronological order but
there's also a following feed for all
the news outlets personalities and
companies you follow the photo feed
shows every photo shared and the music
feed will show everything related to
music and the musicians you said you
liked and all these changes will be the
same on the desktop website as in the
mobile app in fact the main website
redesign was inspired to be more like
the app experience with a side
navigation bar that slides out it's nice
that Facebook is clearing up the sidebar
clutter for a fresh presentation but the
fees are the bigger deal here with
several feeds to scroll through you'll
stay on the site longer engage with more
posts and of course run into more
advertisements in the process if you
want to be among the first to get this
go to facebook.com slash newsfeed there
have been a few other social media
updates the Twitter app has a new
feature called top tweets when you
search for something it will recommend a
tweet it thinks is popular and
Foursquare just updated the iphone app
making it easier to check into places
when you see a list of venues to
check-in app you just press and hold on
the name of the place and then you're
instantly checked in without the prompt
to have to write something about the
place now if all these Facebook changes
have you annoyed there are alternatives
out there take for example path path is
a social network design for you to share
updates with only the people closest to
you your
limited to 150 friends within the path
network because the point is the only
share of people who actually care about
what you have to say what a concept well
path just got an upgrade at least you
have a private chat between multiple
friends and you can send messages in new
ways like with a voice a location map
even cute stickers but you got to buy
those stickers a post on paths can be
shared on Facebook Twitter Foursquare
and tumblr so you can still reach out to
those wider networks that's your tech
news update you can find more details on
