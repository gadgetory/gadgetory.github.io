have to be a word I'm Bridget Carey this
is your cnet update it's time to bid
farewell to language as we know it the
word of the year is not a word at all
for the first time ever the fine folks
at oxford dictionaries society that the
word of the year should be an emoji
specifically it's the face with tears of
joy used when you're crying laughing but
before you weep for the future of
language Oxford did say that this emoji
best reflected the ethos mood and
preoccupations of 2015 and according to
some statistics it is the most used
emoji in the world this year of course
these cartoons are growing in popularity
as more people get smart phones that use
the icons and it's also picking up with
the help of social media remember when
Hillary Clinton tried to connect with
young people by asking them to share
their thoughts about the complex issue
of student loan debt in three emojis or
less dominos pizza outlets you order a
pizza just by tweeting the emoji slice
and you can even buy emoji keyboards for
your desktop computer because apparently
we need tools to emoji faster Facebook
is testing out emoji reaction buttons
that go beyond the thumbs up which let
you mark a post with different faces or
a heart for love and Twitter seems to
also be moving in that direction a
Twitter user noticed his appt had the
ability to select from 12 emoji beyond
the heart including the 100 sign and a
party confetti horn this option was
hidden inside of a developer build of
Twitter's iPhone app when asked by the
verge Twitter's comment about it was
just one emoji response the monkey with
hands over its mouth as our
communication changes so does the way we
listen to music pandora is evolving to
become like other on-demand streaming
apps where you can request the specific
song you want and pandora announced it
would buy up most of its rival our do
for 75 million dollars and next year the
plan is for Pandora to include a feature
for on-demand listening similar to
Spotify or Apple music meanwhile beats
music is shutting down at the end of the
month on November 30th it also was a
paid on to man music service apple
bought beats and it's encouraging users
to migrate to the Apple music app which
has now been around
six months and it's also available on
Android devices and we say goodbye to
another music service forever zune yeah
this week Microsoft shut down all zune
services for any of you that still used
the zune player for connecting online to
download music from the marketplace or
the zune music past subscription program
which actually changed to the groove
music service back in 2008 microsoft
stop making zooms but now by killing the
services the zune name shall no longer
be spoken in the halls of microsoft but
we shall never forget that's it for this
tech news update and there's more at
