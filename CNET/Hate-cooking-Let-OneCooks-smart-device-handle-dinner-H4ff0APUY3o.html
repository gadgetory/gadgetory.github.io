struggle to find the time to cook your
food at the end of a long workday well a
company called TNL corporation has a new
product called one cook that they're
demonstrating here at Tech West at CES
2016 that might just totally
revolutionize your home cooking routine
it's basically like the fresh direct
delivery service meets ass part robot
food cooker all-in-one this company will
actually send you the pre-prepared food
and then also you just stick it straight
in the device and it will cook
everything for you because here's the
here's the kicker it actually has RFID
scanner built inside and it will just
know the recipe and know exactly how to
cook it how long it will take what
temperature to cook it at and prepare it
quickly too they did a demo for me the
other day and they prepared kung pao
chicken in about five minutes flat and
it tasted great so we're really excited
to see what help this company has in
store for us another thing that's really
cool is the app it has an android or iOS
app that has pre-programmed recipes so
you can just start the cooking process
remotely you can also add in your own
recipes or adjust the existing ones it's
a really cool interactive experience
that makes the whole cooking process a
lot more seamless or so it seems will
hold on to that see if we have the same
feelings about it when we test at the
cnet smart home the model they're
demoing now is just a prototype but if
the product gets fully funded on its
Kickstarter campaign which starts next
week it'll have a very different design
I'm getting pretty hungry how about you
guys I'm Megan willerton Christine
