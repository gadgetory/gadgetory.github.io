the gas station for weeks with the 2011
Chevy Volt samsung's new edgelet 3d tvs
are no joke turn your favorite tunes
into ringtones plus our top 5 personal
digital disasters and how to avoid them
it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the cena tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's get started with the good the
Chevy Volt was first introduced as a
concept car way back in 2007 and it
quickly became one of the most
anticipated cars in years now as the
bolt makes its way to showrooms Bryan
Cooley takes it for a spin this is the
most anticipated car in your life no
pressure there let's find out about it
as we drive the 2011 Chevy Volt and
check the tech the 1970 Z car the 76
accord the 86 taurus all watershed
introductions and all pale in the glare
of the hype around this guy the 2011
Chevy Volt it's being asked to save the
environment your fuel budget and GM's
reputation in one stroke I don't envy it
now inside the first thing you notice is
into production this white stuff this
was in all the concepts and I thought oh
that's interesting they're trying to do
like an what an iPod Classic meets a you
know imperial stormtrooper but it is
more notable than that though are these
touch sensitive buttons almost every
button here is a touch contact kind of
like on current my Ford in my link in
touch which have not been a big fan of
that part of touch now if you're looking
around you may have already noticed
something else really cutting-edge on
this car no dials no gauges all screens
you've got one in the center that we've
seen before
this is all new a complete LCD square
instrument panel it's basically like a
7-inch tablet just sitting in front of
you all the time you've got a huge array
of media options on this car and they
aren't the main story but let me just
run you through them
you've got your usual radio categories
as well as XM radio on this guy you've
got the hard drive disk aux button right
here again Touch cycle through at 30
gigabytes of hard drive space - rip -
and of course aux USB you do have
bluetooth streaming and of course
- hands-free another indication that a
volt is being moved as a mid to high-end
car is the fact that it has navigation
standard on it as you might imagine
aside from in the driver's seat you can
also run your volt from your phone
OnStar mobile lets you lock and unlock
the doors start the Volt to prep the
cabin climate check your charge state
tell the car when and how to charge even
blow the horn to find the thing okay
here's where GM has been spending all
their time and their bajillions of
dollars developing the voltec powertrain
here's what makes this car interesting
it's an electric car but it has a gas
engine there's a 1.4 liter inline-4
super lean-burn gas engine here that
does nothing but turn a generator that
generator puts juice into a big old
t-shaped power cell that's in the middle
of the car and that power is an electric
motor that drives the front wheels
through a one speed gear reduction
transmission bottom line 150 horsepower
273 foot-pounds of torque huge Delta
there because it's all electric power
zero to sixty about eight and a half
seconds not bad you're gonna get about
35 40 mpg but there's also a number
called mpge or equivalent that's 93 and
your evie your range before the car
starts to burn any gas to replenish its
batteries is around 25 to 40 miles
there's a whole lot going on here
this guy into 120 or 240 outlet charging
apparatus right here this guy lives on
this kind of wind-up thing in the back
you see you got a regular plug on there
that can plug into whatever outlets
you've got and then this will go into
the door here that guy on the side of
the car that's this new universal thing
that all the electric cars are using
that plugs in there so yes there's
nothing wrong with charging this car it
works really well you do get a bunch of
electric-only range a nice amount that
might even handle your entire commute I
just think there's an awful lot of
hassle that goes around with it if
you're not really committed and for most
folks just putting gas in it and getting
like around 60 mpg it's pretty good and
all the hassle of charging may not be
worth that 93 MPGe
interesting trivia about this guy you
can go potentially a year without
burning gas if you've got a short
commute and you plug in every night and
only commute in this car so what happens
to that gasoline sitting in your tank
gas does go bad you know it jellified it
gets real nasty well they have a
pressurized gas tank on this car also
sensors that will run the engine and
burn off some gas about every couple
weeks I understand it if you never use
gas otherwise okay so you decided the
volts for you here are the numbers
$41,000 with destination now there's a
little bit of I don't know I think it's
a little misleading on the Chevy Volt
website that shows the price of this in
great big bold numbers with a $7,500 tax
credit already - doubt of it but that's
a tax credit that's not a rebate as of
today's taping though the Obama
administration is trying to convert it
to a rebate that'll be different right
now it's a credit it's a $7,500
deduction if you will off any federal
tax that you owe in the tax year you buy
this car if you don't own a federal tax
you don't get any benefit and even if
you do get a benefit it can never turn
into a refund all I can do is reduce
your tax to zero so in other words
you've got to at least $7,500 federal
tax to get the full $7,500 tax credit
from buying one of these cars it's not
as simple as getting a check from the
government if the Obama administration
just changed the law as they're trying
to you will actually get a $7,500 rebate
deal time at the showroom that will be
different Brian had a lot more to say
about this car and you don't have time
to show it all to you so head over to
scene ITV and search for 2011 Chevy
Volts for the full review you will not
be sorry now yes a lot of us scoffed at
3d TVs when they first started showing
up but some of the new sets like this
one from Samsung are winning over our AV
crew just don't make 3d performance your
main priority David Katz minor from CNN
and I'm here with the Samsung UND 6400
this is an LED based LCD TV with edge
laid configuration which means it's
mighty thin and Samsung has actually
made this TV even more compact than in
previous years it has this really thin
bezel around the edge here not quite as
thin as the step up models but still
pretty darn thin it's less than an inch
from the edge of the picture to the edge
of the panel and there's a transparent
frame around the extreme edge that makes
it look even slimmer so all told this is
one very compact looking TV it's also
Samsung's least expensive LCD to include
3d technology the company is throwing in
two pairs of active shutter glasses and
additional pairs cost about 50 bucks
apiece that's the pricing improvement
for sure compared to last year TV also
has Samsung Smart Hub internet
technologies the first one we've
reviewed with that Smart Hub sweep that
just means that all the internet apps so
streaming services are all grouped into
one big home screen here it's actually a
little bit jumbled in our experience but
Samsung did add the ability to search
video services unfortunately that search
is pretty crippled that doesn't hit
Netflix or any of the other a major
service level it does get Vudu another
issue with Smart Hub it's missing Amazon
Instant which is the streaming services
from Amazon although the other content
is pretty darn strong smart house also
offers a limited recommendation engine
for its video services as well as access
to Samsung's extensive app store so you
can go on to the App Store and download
games and Google Maps ESPN even some
additional widgets although the company
did drop Yahoo widgets overall samsung
Smart Hub is very complete although
again the interface is a little bit
cluttered and people who are getting at
it for the first time might be a
intimidated TV is very well featured
otherwise you can find plenty of
adjustments in the menu including a
10-point color temperature system as
well as a color management system that I
really did a pretty good job of
improving the color in our experience TV
also has the full ability to adjust the
D judder processing you can go in and
play around with things like shutter and
blur reduction to your heart's content
when you took the samsung UND 6400 into
the lab we were pretty impressed by its
picture quality for an edge lit led the
black levels are pretty darn good and
color accuracy at least the bright areas
is excellent although we did see some
blue creep into the darker areas of the
picture we also appreciated the
excellent video processing which handled
1080p24 well and as an added bonus this
TV does 3d a lot better than it did last
year we're not sure if that's the
glasses or the new panel itself or some
combination but it has less crosstalk
and overall better 3d picture quality
than its predecessors the back panel on
the Samsung is four HDMI inputs which is
pretty good but the analog connectivity
is pretty sparse there's only one
component video and one standard video
input and they require breakout cables
to work Samsung also throws in a PC
input in three USB ports that's a quick
look at the Samsung at UND 6400 series
and I'm David Katz Myer I gotta say for
my money I think I'd rather have the
apps than the 3d I'm just saying moving
on custom ringtones are a great way to
tell who's calling you before you look
at the caller ID but what if you can't
find the right tune to sum up your
relationship with that person
Jessica dole card has a handful of Handy
options for creating your own ringtone
in this week's tap that up
hey guys and girls Jessica's all-court
here with CNET this Tapout apps is all
about making your own ringtones good
news is there are dozens of good free
programs out there for Android and
iPhone range ride is one of my Android
favorites and it was also one of the
first you pick from all the songs in
your music library then drag the arrows
on the waveform to set the start and end
times you can zoom in for more precision
or manually enter times into the open
fields then just save the ring tone ring
droid also records sounds to create new
tones lucky stars mp3 ringtone maker is
almost identical and look and feel
except that it adds a fade setting which
is nice that has ads which you can just
ignore share tones is another fantastic
freebie because it's got a shared
database of ringtone timings for songs
that you already own so if somebody else
has edited the ringtone just so you can
quickly apply those settings to your
songs to make a ringtone identical to
theirs finally there's Mongo ringtone
but strangely you have to search for it
as top ringtone maker pro in the android
market this app pair is an online
ringtone store with a voice recorder and
with a ringtone editor for your own
songs
now unfortunately making iPhone ring
tones is harder since you can't save the
file directly to the device like you can
on Android phones but all my picks to
offer step-by-step instructions ringtone
maker comes with a fate option a
recorder and an easy song picker
ringtone starlight features a timeline
and a fade tool as does ringtones which
also looks much more polished ring tone
ring mix is probably my favorite of the
bunch
it's a liqueur it includes album art
when available and it has a button to
automatically carve out a ringtone
selection
there's no fade option though but you
can choose to escalate the ringtones
volume as it plays but uh I'd stay away
from that one if I were you all these
iPhone apps are free that have
inexpensive upgrades that cut the ads
and unlock advanced features such as
changing a song speed or pitch so there
you have it now there are seven ways to
make ringtones on your iPhone or Android
device well get crackin and if you have
more suggestions for great apps you want
to see on this show email tap that up at
cnet.com i'm
is all curt and keep on tapping Wow
sex on fire all over that video I don't
really think that I have anyone in my
contact list who warrants that one right
down I like the baby monkey song and
with that little TMI let's take a break
but come right back for more tech review
right after this
welcome back to the CNET tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at CNET TV
continuing on in the good last week it
was reported that some Samsung laptops
were being shipped with key logging
programs installed on them now it turns
out those reports were false but it does
bring up a valid concern what if you
suspect that someone's trying to spy on
you and what you're doing on your
computer well here's Seth Rosenblatt to
show you how to protect yourself from
those prying eyes Samsung does not
install its laptops but that doesn't
mean you won't encounter a key logger in
the future hi I'm Seth Rosenblatt and
today I'm going to show you how to
detect and remove key loggers those
programs that sir fishs Lee record a
breach happens with keyboard for parents
or your boss to pore over however if
you're not already familiar with mucking
about in your computer's registry and
system directories you really ought to
get some help with this key loggers are
hard to uninstall because they
intentionally hide themselves from the
Start menu and it's unlikely that you'll
know the name of the program so if you
suspect you're being tracked with one
start off by grabbing security task
manager from download.com once installed
it will tell you information about each
running process and it will specify if
they're dangerous or not note that it
may not have rated all processes that
are running so you may have to research
each one online to make sure they're
safe if a dangerous process is detected
you can end the process from within
security task manager now do not restart
your computer otherwise the key logger
will start again the next step is to run
a full scan from your antivirus program
most a v's like AVG Avast or Avira will
detect key loggers and quarantine them
for you make sure it's up to date of
course if your AV doesn't detect it and
you're absolutely positive you've been
tracked by a key logger there are some
more invasive techniques we can use
although they require knowing the name
of the logger first look for its
registry key which is used to load it
when Windows is
started open a command prompt and type
run regedit go to the menu bar select
edit then find and the name of your key
logger the search should turn up a
registry key like this one delete all
the keys that turn up from the search
next we have to make sure that the key
loggers executable files are removed go
to windows explorer and hit the Alt key
to bring up the menu bar go to tools
folder options and view under advanced
settings you'll see an option for hidden
files and folders make sure that show is
checked and then search for the name of
the key logger this could be as easy as
searching for its name although some key
loggers like star logger abbreviate its
folder name to just the initials SL next
you'll want to unregister the key
loggers dll file open a command prompt
and navigate to the folder containing
the dll then type our eg SVR 32 /u and
then the file name of the dll without
the quotes and brackets and you should
see a pop-up window telling you that the
file has been successfully unregistered
at this point you may have to check the
registry again to ensure that the
registry key was deleted restart your
computer and once more check the
registry and your Windows system folder
to make sure that the key logger is gone
finally you ought to have a clean bill
of health
actually the double check after
rebooting is the second to last thing
you have to do the final step is to
figure out who put the key logger on
your computer good luck with that for
seen it I'm Seth Rosenblatt
if I were you I would hold off on trying
to dig too deep into the registries of a
company issued computer I mean if your
IT department went to the trouble of
installing a keylogger on your machine
they won't take too kindly to you
monkeying around in there because
they're probably kind of mean
speaking of mean let's see what we've
got going on in the bed sometimes when
products don't compare favorably to
their competitors it's hard to call them
bad per se so maybe for this week we'll
just call this section would not
recommend here's a look at an all-in-one
printer and a 7-inch tablet that are
clearly worthy of that distinction
hi I'm Justin you with CMS comm this is
your first look at the Dell p5 13w
multifunction printer so we actually
have mixed reviews about this device it
performed well and it output
professional quality text prints and we
do like the handy eco mode that'll save
you money and helps the environment but
those features don't really offset a lot
of the snags we ran into during testing
but before we get into those critiques
let's check out the printer itself the
white P 513 W sizes up about average for
other printers and it's a multifunction
printer which means you can print scan
and copy all directly on the machine the
scanner sits on top of it and can handle
up to 1200 by 2400 resolution images but
we're remiss to see that Dell emits an
auto document feeder on the top now that
would normally be really useful for
businesses because it lets you scan or
copy a stack of documents hands-free
unfortunately though you do not get that
on this device which is a little strange
for $150 printer another issue we take
is with the multiple paper jams that
came about because of this 25 sheet
paper output tray
now most printers can hold double that
amount so if you're printing a high
volume of documents this definitely is
not the printer for you like all modern
printers you do get an 802 11 B G print
server built right in now let's you
ditch the cord and hook it up to your
computer wirelessly again though we ran
into a speed bump here trying to
configure the network settings although
that problem did eventually fix itself
and finally we're not particularly
satisfied with the output performance
either qualitatively our
test sheet a full black text looked
presentable from far away but upon
closer inspection we did notice several
jagged lines at the corners of some
characters particularly in italicized
text and even at its highest quality
setting we wouldn't recommend using this
printer for professional documents
either the graphics quality just doesn't
stand up to competitive printers from HP
cannon and Epson that sell for the same
price or less and you can read the full
review including alternative printer
recommendations but that's going to do
it for me
I'm Justin you you just took a first
look at the Dell p5 13w multifunction
printer hey i'm donald bell and today
we're taking a first look at the Arco 70
this is a 7 inch Android tablet priced
around $275 for an 8 gigabyte model
there's also a 250 gigabyte model for an
extra $50 normally when I see tablets at
this price they're pretty horrible but
the Arco 70 has a lot going for it the
touchscreen is relatively responsive
there's a VGA camera on the front for
photos and video and on the side here
you have a micro SD memory expansion
slot and HDMI output that will mirror
the screen on to an HDTV and crank out
720p video on the downside the
construction quality feels pretty cheap
although you have to admire how thin
they've been able to make this it's
running Android 2.2 which is somewhat
antique at this point and there's no
support for a Google suite of mobile
apps including maps Gmail and most
importantly Android Market Arcos has
their own app store on here but the
selection is pretty thin there's a
kickstand on the back which is cool
except that's really flimsy and the
screens viewing angles are decent but
not great there's tons of video format
support but unless you're running it out
to a TV you're stuck watching it on the
screens 800 by 480 resolution if you're
the tinkering type there's a community
of Android and Arcos fans out there that
will help you tweak and customize this
thing but there's nothing that will
magically turn it into a dual-core
honeycomb tablet still the price is
right and if your expectations are
humble you can have a lot of fun with
this name so that's the Arco 70 Android
tablet for cnn.com I'm
see what I mean they're not completely
terrible
I'm sure someone out there could find
some use for them but they could be
better all right let's go ahead and
check out this week's bottom line this
week Brian Cooley is counting down his
top five digital disasters not like a
y2k outage or Skynet taking over the
world you know more like personal
screw-ups that can feel like disasters
if they happen to you see how many of
these you fallen victim to yourself
you know it's easier than ever for your
life to go down the tubes these days
with just one errant message post or
call a thanks technology
I'm Brian Cooley with top 5 personal
digital disasters and some ways to keep
them from happening we're gonna rank
these roughly by their potential payload
for catastrophe let's get to it
number 5 miss posting across your social
media it's a mouthful but I can't help
the stupid stuff you post in tweet this
is about the things on Facebook Twitter
or LinkedIn that shouldn't commingle but
sometimes they do with disastrous
consequences like this recent debacle
as you can imagine that was not supposed
to show up as an official tweet from
Chrysler the guy who posted it and the
ad agency he once worked for no longer
handle Chrysler's social media if you're
using one of those cross-platform social
tools like tweet deck as he was ask
yourself first is the cross
contamination risk really worth the
modest convenience of rolling up all
your accounts into one interface while
you're just one toggle away from
disaster number 4 reply all it's old
school but still a beauty the
inadvertent reply all has made more
bowels turn to water than any other
screw up on this list in fact a former
head of HR here at C net had her
intelligence critiqued by a former
employee of mine and yes she was on the
reply thread so instead of C seeing the
person you're dissing remove the reply
all button from the toolbar on Outlook
it's not hard to do you can still reply
all with ctrl shift are now on Gmail and
Yahoo they're a little better in this
respect since reply all is a drop down
instead of a straight click as it is for
reply so different behavior but if you
use Gmail's keyboard shortcuts that can
get dicey so check out Molly's how-to
video on customizing those and then you
can make the reply all keystrokes
something you've never mistake for the
reply keystroke and therefore enjoy the
continued benefits of employment number
three but dialing now with the advent of
capacitive touchscreens which require an
actual finger press
it's not really but piling anymore but
Aaron touch dialing nonetheless I could
raise your hair with a few stories I
know along these lines most smartphones
today are all screens you can hardly
pick one up without activating something
auto lock doesn't always save you due to
lock it delays and such on Android
phones there are apps like not call log
or do not call there are basically crude
roadblocks but hey if it avoids this
it's worth it number two this one's kind
of new and fresh checking in when you're
checked out if you tell the office here
and then they see you checked in at the
ballgame or the beach or the bar you've
gone Bueller so before setting out on a
great day of hooky remember to drop the
Foursquare and Facebook check-in habit
stick a post-it note on your phone if
you have to you gotta go dark and don't
forget to turn off the background
locators like Google Latitude or you'll
be chatting up the dude from the
Chrysler thing in the unemployment line
okay our number one personal digital
disaster just about anything while drunk
email text calls tweets updates after a
bender have you ever really not cringed
at those the next morning and let's not
forget the Facebook pictures that result
pictures of you vomiting touching
yourself wearing a Nazi outfit all
tagged with your identity for easy
searching and career-ending a lot of
folks forget you can untag yourself from
facebook photos just click the little
untag link next to your name doesn't
mean somebody won't go in and tag you
there again but you know you're not
really that popular for more top fives
like this go to top-5 cnet.com i'm brian
coolie thanks for watching
the bottom line this week five out of
five I win
yes I admit I have done all of these
things at least once but nothing too bad
ever happened I don't think I mean I'm
sure I have some enemies out there
somewhere but I do still have a job
alright folks that's our show we'll be
back next week with a brand spanking new
scene at tech review until then there
are tons of great videos available every
day at Cena tv.com I'll see you next
time and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
