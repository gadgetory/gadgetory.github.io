cnet this is your first look at the
samsung galaxy s blaze 4g this is a new
phone for t-mobile and it is based on
the samsung galaxy s family design so
it's a little bit more solid than some
of the phones that we're seeing today
like the galaxy s2 it's got this thick
top up here and it does have sort of a
plane back that it is pretty comfortable
with the soft touch finish on it the
screen is a 4 inch or rather a 3.97 inch
but I like to round up super amoled
screen so it's really bright it's pretty
it's running android 2.3 point six
gingerbread then scott samsung touchwiz
on top of that so you'll have access to
quick settings in the pull down menu
you'll be able to see an overview of all
of the home pages as well inside you've
got a lot of Samsung preloaded apps and
t mobile apps as well for example you've
got quick for voice chats on the front
facing camera which is 1.3 megapixels by
the way you'll also have things on here
like t-mobile live TV and Netflix the
camera on the back is a 5 megapixel
camera with flash and it does support
720p HD video it is a pretty solid
camera Samsung is definitely known to
make some good ones and this one so far
delivers now if you care about speed
you'll be happy to know that there's a
1.5 gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon s3 processor on here that is
very speedy and it also has support for
t-mobile's hspa+ 42 network which is the
faster of the 2 4g networks for tmobile
this phone will cost you one hundred
forty nine dollars and ninety-nine cents
after a fifty-dollar mail-in rebate and
that is with a new two-year contract
well this phone doesn't have the
absolute most top-notch features on the
market I think that you will be pretty
satisfied with it because the camera is
good it's fast it's pretty to look at
it's not too big not too small I think
it's going to be a good fit for a lot of
people I'm Jessica doll court this is
the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G you can
