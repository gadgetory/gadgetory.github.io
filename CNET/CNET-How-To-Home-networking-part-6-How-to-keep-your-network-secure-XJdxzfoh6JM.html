secure well think again because recently
that's report saying that most home
browser can be hacked but no worries i'm
here to tell you that you should be okay
as long as you follow my five simple
step i'm talking about it in and by the
way I'm don't know you soooo you know
that so let's start oh by the way all
these five step requires the access to
the routers web interface and if you
don't know how to get to it make sure
you check out my previous video on the
subject matter now the first step is
that you have to encrypt your Wi-Fi
network basically giving it a password
so that only you and those you trust can
add Wi-Fi devices to your network now
this pass would have to meet three
criteria it has to be hard to guess but
easy to remember and easy to type in on
a small screen so think about a
convention for example you can eat a
straight line on a keyboard such as qwe
RT y plus your postal home zip code and
that would do you can always throw in
more numbers or you a different straight
line just you know go with that
convention and the second step you need
to change the default important
informations they are called default
because they are public knowledge and
everybody knows the two of them need to
be chains are the default IP address and
the default login password the IP
address can be changed almost anything
you want so instead of the default 192
168 11 you can make it ten eleven twelve
thirteen or fourteen fifteen sixteen 69
basically have fun with the numbers not
that one the IP has been chained you
have to use the new IP address to access
the router web interface changing the IP
address actually have greatly reduced a
chant that your router can be hacked
from outside now the router default
login password have to be of course hard
to guess and different from the Wi-Fi
password I talked about earlier third
step do not turn on any remote access
feature unless you know very well what
you're doing this feature includes ftp
of remote management and if you do turn
them on make sure you put on restriction
you secure HTTP
or you a non-conventional now the first
step make sure you upgrade the routers
to the latest firmware this can be as
easy as a few clicks or maybe you have
to download the firmware and do that
manually you should do that at least one
when you first set up the home network
remember do not do anything during the
upgrading process because if you turn
the router off during the upgrading
process you can actually brick your home
router and the last step is that make
sure you log off the web interface when
you are done for some routers this mean
you just close the web interface or one
more thing if you use powerline adapters
for your home network make sure you turn
on the security feature on all of them
and that's it it should be okay now but
if you're not that you've got to be a
really bad or a really important person
and in that case you need a professional
to take care of your network for you and
speaking of professional if you are a
bad person and want to be good call me
and write you up and that's because I am
don't go and this has been a quick guide
on how to keep your home network secure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
