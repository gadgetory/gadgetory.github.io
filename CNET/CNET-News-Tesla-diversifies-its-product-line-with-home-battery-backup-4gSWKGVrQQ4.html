completely off grid you can take your
solar panels charge the battery packs
and that's and that's all you use hi I'm
Wayne Carini Messina here at Tesla's
Southern California design Center where
CEO Elon Musk has just announced a new
division of the company called Tesla
energy we have this this handy fusion
reactor in the sky called the Sun okay
you don't have to do anything it just
works shows up every day and produces
ridiculous amounts of power Tesla energy
is going to offer the power wall that's
what you see behind me this is a battery
backup system for a home's it comes in
seven kilowatt hour and ten kilowatt
hours sizes what this does is it stores
extra electricity which can be generated
from solar panels were taken from non
peak hours from the grid the fact that
it's wall-mounted is is vital because it
means you don't need to have a battery
room it means that a normal household
can mount this on their garage or on the
outside wall of their house and it's
designed so you can stack them on the
wall so if you look at the wall in the
back there are some that are paired up
so you can have two you can actually
attack up to nine of the power walls and
very importantly this is going to be a
great solution for people in remote
parts of the world where there's no
electricity wires or where there's or
where the electricity is extremely
intermittent or extremely expensive so
it gives you safety security it and it
gives you a complete and affordable
solution we're gonna start shipping in
approximately three or four months and
the cost this is $3,500 Tesla energy
will also offer the power pack an
industrial scale version of the
technology this comes in a 100 kilowatt
hour modules for 25,000
the company will be working directly
with facilities to install these devices
I'm Wayne cutting them for seeing it
here at Tesla's Southern California
design headquarters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
