just gonna do it I'm gonna build a skype
Apple bites dude I don't want to be a
video skype really I like tons of all
this video messages you know oh shoot
I'm doing it okay you do I'll let you
filter through that okay I will I'm not
you can curate that content tell you all
right let's get to the show again a lot
of stuff going on in the Apple world
we'll talk about some of these iphone
rumors that have come out from earlier
the week but let's get to some of the
new stuff first and in a recent report
from bloomberg they say that apple will
be flying drones to improve the maps
data and hope to catch up with google
we've had people call in and ask us why
what's so wrong about apples Maps and
there is nothing
wrong with apples Maps but beat him and
I have told you plenty of times when
google has been historically more
reliable when Jubal has brought out had
features before apples intagram let's
talk about a transit Direction transit
sometimes yes um and things of that
nature just just all-around just being
correct too yes yeah maybe Jack giving
you the right directions that is why we
lean towards Google Maps no I will never
say never to Apple maps i have used it
sometimes like when i'm in yelp it kind
of just like automatically pushes meet
Apple maps I'm like okay i'll use i'll
give this a try but here's some good
tidbits of how Apple is going to use
these drones to really try to bolster
and improve the quality of their Apple
maps now again it's said to be using
this to catch up to google maps they'll
be able to capture an update map map
data a lot faster than a I don't know if
you guys and gals have seen some of
apple's like pictures of apples minivans
I don't know at that first row rumor to
be Apple apples car project that i was
like no don't no no no like I'm not
seeing that so there's some like mini
vans that are out there they're actually
collecting the GPS data but Apple has
worked with the FAA to get approval to
use these drones to improve their maps
we believe that Apple's worry Apple
question yeah this might be very naive
but doesn't this google use satellites
they use a combination yes satellites
and what else are they well here here's
the other thing um they use a
combination of services to pull all of
those different resources for data they
don't use drones from at least the last
time I checked Yeah right there were
services or you know third-party groups
that they had acquired an integrated
into their service for you know 3d
mapping the actual cities and whatnot
but we haven't heard them actually using
drones now if your time out streaming
like if they have they have their car
you have google earth yeah they have
yeah they probably they have to tap into
that I'm sure and for sure I think that
what Apple's drones are doing is maybe
it comes down to they don't have
necessarily the same partnerships to be
as efficient to collect this kind of
closer to the ground data like we know
at Google Street View right that's all
done via car
yeah apple doesn't even have an
equivalent to that really so I'm
wondering if so this is a subsidy
equivalence of the apple or of the
Google car driving around taking
pictures they're gonna have drones I
think drones probably more efficient
they've definitely more efficient the
thing about it also again we don't know
exactly what they're going to use the
drone for specifically other than the
fact that yeah it's going to help pump
up their maps data but we also don't
like a drone battery life right now is
like 30 30 ish minutes 40 ish minutes
tops yeah I mean I can't see this like
dude being sooo seriously effective
right away so might only be used in
certain spots in certain cases but
anyways um it is interesting the other
thing that Apple is looking to do to
also improve their maps they've hired
pilots that were part of Amazon's
primary program that is still in the
works right we're talking about drone
delivery drone drone drone all the time
they also have their own Apple their own
indoor mapping initiative they did they
had an acquisition of a recent company
for like doing interior mapping they're
called indoor I oh where this would be
advantageous maybe places like shopping
centers museums so being able to get
that done as well as pretty interesting
so look I applaud they need to step up
their game I still don't use Apple maps
exclusively I still don't use it as my
primary but again this is all good news
that are pointing into the direction
that there are taking this seriously and
they're trying to build some trust back
so we'll see how it all plays out I
don't see myself just all of a sudden
using them I maybe I use it in a
different context like you know they
have you know how Google has a street
view yeah if they had if Apple had drone
view then that would be something oh hey
I might take a look oh hey oh hey
Beecham I like that I like where your
say Apple you know I have ideas it can
holler at me tersely Colorado column I'm
free for retainer if you need that bar
bomb its Bat Mitzvah yeah and if you can
hire my dad to he's a highlight he flies
Cessnas there you go um hook him up
Huckabee chukka beat him up let's go
beat him up also in an email exchange
that
is according to be an exchange between a
macrumors reader and CEO of Apple Tim
Cook air pods could be expected to ship
in the next few weeks based on this
exchange now that emails have been
verified to come from Apple's corporate
servers but here's what they say the
customer brought to Tim Cook and you can
I believe it's Tim as Tennessee cook at
Apple comer tim crews just responding
the emails he though that was a kind of
a thing that Steve Jobs used to do
that's cool or is it Tim Cook's
secretary anyway the customer was
basically plain like I I was promised
this wireless future what is going on
with the air pods and I'm stuck waiting
for these because they aren't coming out
Tim Cook responded in an email saying
thanks for your note sorry for the delay
we are finalizing them and I anticipate
we will begin to ship over the next few
weeks oh so that's funny like almost he
almost did a press release and an email
to a customer sure and you know what
sometimes we have seen where customers
get maybe like a little snippet of
information that they don't expect to be
put out me too now they're never gonna
release like the specs or images of the
next iPhone I mean they have all the
Chinese websites to do that already yeah
so true the just a little nugget if this
is the case though in a few weeks I mean
that the airpot still may not make the
holiday season if they're shipping from
factories in the next few weeks it's
still going to take another week or so
to get here again the stores I still
believe in I could be wrong and you guys
can all call me out later if you want to
I don't know if the earpads are gonna
make it by 2016 based even on that
timetable of that email exchange yeah
yeah so tough one are you let down you
know we I know how I feel about I'm
gonna buy them but I'm not so I'm not
let down I'm not gonna buy them but I'm
bummed out for consumers who are excited
and they got the iphone 7 and they're
like you know now I don't have my ear
pods for Christmas so too bad rich
people that's too bad you don't have you
gotta wait like I said I'm gonna buy
them and I'm gonna try them
i'm ninety-nine percent going to return
them but i'll still give him a chance I
I will always give everything a chance
I'm not that person who's gonna make I I
do I don't want to have them hanging out
of my ear though I did see someone in
the wild wearing pair yeah because we
have apple head it was here well yeah
yeah it was it was a dude and it looked
like he was wearing like I did a
double-take is it look like he was
wearing earrings you know what I mean
like I was like oh those are trippy
earrings yeah or you know like when
people do those big rings like this
giant holes yeah yeah the plugs the big
lugs yeah I kind of look like that too
from a distance I was like whoa what oh
that's the air pods yeah you're kind of
like okay so looks like an earrings from
a distance from this isn't isn't a bad
thing but it's not a bit I don't think
it's a bad thing at all all right let's
just jump into some of these iphone
rumors that you may not have heard of or
you may have heard of the latest from
the wall street journal is jumping on
kind of the rumors that we've heard that
apple will have a curved OLED screen
that could come out in the next iPhone
as soon as next year you know what we
love to call this phone I mean we have a
variety of names where if I phone what
you want your future iphone x I'm still
down with iphone x iphone extreme I've
own extreme iphone 10th anniversary or
when I'm sorry when I hear this curb
screen thing I just wanna Jana mmm dude
okay you know what you can't yawn when
I'm presenting a story for show no
that's absolutely the headline maybe yah
not you no no I know what you're saying
and you're very good at covering your
tracks but this is I'm just merely
relaying the information to the people
this is the best part of the story that
I love because everyone use it as a
headline for the shows i ended up kind
of doing it as well but the nugget that
came out of here that everyone blew up
was the fact that according to The Wall
Street Journal yes and oled display
could be used in here but the report
says more than 10 prototypes of this
phone are being considered and people
are like headlines were literally yeah
some iphone 8 10 prototypes to the works
and like okay in related news Apple's
working on next year's iPhone like
they've always done that true yes this
is
nothing new but it's like all day like
10 proto why do I do the report also
says that an iphone with this oled
screen may potentially not be released
because look they have 10 Prada may not
also they may not have the supply of
oled displays in place they also say
that this oled screen based iphone would
be priced higher oh yeah no oh yeah so
like we kind of talked about a past
shows could you really imagine an apple
iphone with three potentially three
different sizes two types of different
screens two different types of cameras
depending on the model I this is this is
not your mama's iphone know from 10
years ago this is not this is not your
mama's I from from 10 years ago that's
that's how I'm going to put it Apple is
also hoping that suppliers for OLED
displays can increase their yield rates
right now it's anticipated that samsung
will be the primary supplier in 2017
with the hopes that companies like sharp
LG Display and Jack Japan display will
be able to catch up in 2018 to provide
those parts so that's one of those
things and then just a quick overview
for those of you just to kind of get a
refresher the rumors as they stand right
now our two LCD based screen iPhones the
current 4.7 and 5.5 inch screen sizes so
those will be LCD based then a rumored
somewhere between a 5.1 to 5.2 inch
iphone so somewhere in between that that
will have the OLED display hmm that will
be higher priced yes so take that as you
may that's the latest but this is but as
we move on this is probably my favorite
this is not most likely one of the
prototypes but a patent that has been
granted to Apple was recently revealed
that showcase how Apple has been working
on a foldable iphone concept okay this
this is the reason why I like this all
right people like what are you talking
about a foldable iphone does this does
this kind of call back the old school
days of like the motorola razr oh yeah
and flip phones are just gonna say could
you imagine a dual screen super thin it
would be kind of cool it phone almost
like a Nintendo des yeah like been open
yeah clamshell but like half the
have the thickness so for people that
remember how cell phones used to be
there's a lot of people here that only
know the iphone as like that type of
form factor and screen right oh so it
that on that article they show kind of
some of the different designs that this
foldable phone can be if you can show
people that are watching beach and just
scroll down with it so yeah it's a call
it's a clamshell type design it has a
metal backing but they also talked about
how this phone this foldable phone could
be flipped close to protect the screen
or another option you could flip it the
other way in the screen to actually be
on externally on the outside hmm let's
kind of run it back yeah be like a
little nail art like alarm clock next
your bed or something Oh totally I just
I'm just kind of fascinated that hmm
because phones are so much the same
these days if it was thin enough what I
what I consider doing a flip phone
iphone I think I would I i think so too
i think i would like would it called the
fly phone to flip iphone the flipper
flipper filipino phone the butterfly
phone Oh with the butterfly but but
butterfly phone but I fun butterflies in
the sky like a fat twice as high now
that's cool because to just even today I
was like looking at my phone and we got
these cool like little cnet things that
like suction cup on in the back yeah so
you can like put your phone and it'll
sit on your desk like a little TV screen
and then I was looking around and some
of the people around us have like little
special stands for their phones and
stuff but this this would solve that
problem it could it could just you can
prop up your phone at your desk wherever
butterfly phone we already got the theme
song ready got it we got the TV
commercial ready to roll holla holla
I'll dude ideas you Apple my extra
crunchy ABX see ideas I like that
abbreviation also yeah yeah ABX see you
down with that you're all not yet he's
like not yet all right um and then just
a little kind of uh maybe you guys
should be aware of this I'm not here to
try and freak you out or anything like
that but a new security a vulnerability
bug has allowed activation the
activation lock bypass
on iphones and ipads using 10.1 or 10
point 1 point 1 i'm not gonna get into
this super deep but let's just put it
this way so let's say you have your
phone is lost and you always someone
tries to get into it and it always has
that screen that's like oh you know how
do i connect to this or try and try and
get into the phone I it's called the
heck the activation lock it just
basically prevents anyone from really
using it without the legitimate owners
position so when a lock devices started
though okay so let's say it's like power
down powered up users are prompted to
enter a Wi-Fi network you know username
and password well there's an option for
other network and if you select that
then it asks you to type in you know
your security information but here's the
trick depending on which you know
protocol you choose web wpa2 there's no
limitation on the number of characters
you can punch in there so you can just
type in a ton of characters like ton of
character just whatever it doesn't even
have to make a difference but at a
certain point in time is by entering
like a really long string right copy
page is like 10 at the prompt will
actually crash and then expose the
devices home screen oh wow they can get
into your company you get injured i'm
watching this video that it just like
typing where it's in that blog post and
he's just typing like an emoji over and
over i can to get a super long username
password string of characters that's
funny yeah so um we don't know if this
is gonna be fixed anytime soon of course
it will be or a better be but i just
want to let you know just just so you
guys not trying to freak you out that's
crappy police out some guy like SAT
there and just typed forever i mean okay
i guess you could go back in history me
like how did they figure out how to make
penicillin and stuff like that you know
but like this is look at this dude he's
just typing they're there there's people
out there for software web to geographer
realize they like again we don't we're
not privy this i think actually be
interesting to try and find someone to
talk about that stuff totally because
and that's just how vulnerable all these
platforms are quite honestly there's
always a way there's always a way
there's a way in everything
unfortunately nothing is unfortunately
nothing is secure right now not as much
as we'd like to believe it is not even
your heart
especially not your heart yes that's one
of the most vulnerable yes vulnerable
password bonum yes you could get hurt
thank you it can be healed though yes
okay since we're getting on the cheesy
note no sponsor which means more stories
for you hello all right let's keep on
going apple says remember we talked
about the iphone 6s shut down the
battery issue that they had we talked
about how Apple is offering a way for
you to check out if you have a phone
battery died was manufactured from
september-october of i believe it was
was a 2015 outs 2015 so check this out
in a chinese website posting that Apple
themselves posted they described exactly
what was going on with his battery issue
and why it was important apple says we
found that a small number of iPhone 6s
devices made in September and october of
2015 contain a battery component that
was exposed to controlled and be an
error longer than it should have been
before being assembled into the battery
packs what as a result to the air a part
of it a component of it as a result
these batteries degrade faster than a
normal battery and caused unexpected
shutdown errors to occur it's important
to note this is not a safety issue so so
and this is exactly what you were
talking about what we've talked about
remember people say no I'm around thirty
forty percent my battery my phone to
shut down it just shuts off this is
exactly what it was Wow so in some cases
well you know whether it's extremely
cold temperatures or because of this
flaw that's what it is it's a component
in the battery that was exposed to what
they say ambient air longer than it was
supposed to be so the good thing it is a
free replacement and apples also created
away really easy to let you check your
iphone 6s serial number to see if you're
eligible for a new battery you got it
just got to go to the support site on
Apple comments this is I think it's
right here if you if you can read these
characters you pull the shiny side for
the lake in that luck if you could just
read these uh use translate in Google
and then you could figure this out
you're
I sure there's a even be to provide you
the Chinese Intel that you need here on
the Apple an extra crunchy yeah it's
very very important that's crazy so they
have to like they had to be sealed from
the air and so a piece like let's say a
circuit or an exposed connector that is
inside the actual battery housing before
they assembled it was exposed before
they assemble the battery just that just
goes to show you like how complicated
all these devices are that they're
building in a foreign country these are
great these are great points to be made
yes it also I you know people sometimes
we rip on Apple it's because you know
when when you like them we love oh but
when you claim to be the best and you
act like you're the best then you better
be the best that's all I'm saying you
can't leave stuff exposed to the air I
mean come on you got to be the best
hahaha killing me mad I'm like dying
that's your baby I'm bright like blown
away by that oh no go away that's the
way the world is it's just the way the
world works sometimes uh in other news
we talked about how Apple was canceling
their Airport routers last week a
Bloomberg report did talk about this but
sometimes timing can be very ironic or
just sad JD Power just released their
latest wireless routers customer
satisfaction survey and guess who came
out as number one is it Apple Wow they
were there like we should rethink this
Apple was rated out of a 1000 point
scale the number one wireless routers
based on customer satisfaction with a
point rating out of a thousand at 876
second was a sous d-link was third
tp-link was fourth netgear fifth okay
also just to show you you know that most
of this is most likely based on the the
ease of setup it's a lot easier if
you're in the apple ecosystem and just
talking where to set them on and talking
with the device it just works fluidly
I'm sure yeah it may not have the best
signal the best power
it has features that are exclusive to
someone in the apple ecosystem like you
know the time machine aspects you know
airport extreme Airport Express play
like audio and things like that that are
kind of built into the those hooks in
that specific ecosystem the Apple
themselves for wireless routers also
earned I five Power Circle rating for
consumers that means it's basically the
best consumer product the highest out of
any company is well they're
discontinuing the line that sucks oh and
I know that some people call this about
it that they were frustrated the thing
the thing is that there there's gonna be
a lot of ways that some of these
features still work in different ways
but i just thought it made me laugh when
i pulled this article up because like
the timing couldn't have been any better
/ worse depending on what side of the
coin you're on I mean do you think they
would rethink that after they get this
report I mean that's I seems that seems
hilarious it is hilarious I think that
they wouldn't just because it's all
about really mean it's all about this
it's all about the money yeah yeah yeah
they have shown to us that they're not
willing to really invest in some of
these like ancillary things anymore yeah
just their turn the monitors now to
airport base stations if it's not making
enough money for them based on the
bottom line or the metrics that they
expect to they're just they're just
basically scrapping it and this is you
know like a car manufacturer one because
cutting you know JD Power and Associates
I always associate that with car yes car
gets gets the award they're like making
commercials about it they're like JD
powered associate Award winner two years
in a row come check out our car at the
nearest dealership Apple's like oh yeah
we're just gonna cancel that I'm sorry
we weren't we weren't supposed to know
that they were canceling their
award-winning that's so fun what if they
what if that article never got out and
they put out an ad like we r we r JD
power so just for many wireless routers
and then like six months later at the
next Apple keynotes like we are
discontinuing our award-winning power
associate we're gonna go out on top this
that's the way to do honey in use of do
not try this at home safety tests of 400
fake apple charges you know you by the
amazon you know you're trying to get a
car charger or a wall
charger on the cheap oh yeah chargers
bought online fake chargers bought
online revealed that 99% are dangerous I
believe it a large scale test of 400
fake apple chargers this is a report
from the BBC were bought from eight
different companies at eight different
countries online the tests were
commissioned by the UK consumer
protection body chartered Trading
Standards Institute of the 400 chargers
purchased just three of them had
sufficient insulation to protect protect
against electric shocks in the most
basic safety tests before what three
were those just so our i do not know
they don't list them I don't I i looked
at the article I don't believe they list
them here's some great help from the
Institute they provided four pieces of
advice alright this is our apple byte
extra crunchy PSA for today plug pins
plug the charger into socket don't
switch it on or connect a device if it
doesn't fit easily the pins maybe their
own size have you had that before it's
like I have loose chargers oh my gosh i
had that i've had that when you've
bought generic stuff generic faulty
chargers markings look for manufacturers
brands names or logos check for the cee
safety mark there's warnings and
instructions but the funny disclaimer
said Oh a lot of these counterfeit
Chargers have fake markings and fake
safety who flits so it doesn't matter
like a fake apple logo or something on
them so look if you don't want to buy a
ten-dollar charger go to your local
apple store and buy a 30-dollar one
instead the only problem run into is my
phone says this this uh what does it say
like this is not compatible it's not
compatible with this device and I'm like
ignore it it's the worst but I've never
had a problem where yeah there's like a
authentication chip yeah basically if
you're in the made for iphone or made
for idevices program there's an
authentication chip that is you you pay
for in order to kind of say made for
iphone i say whether it's a charger of
all types Apple has this program with
third-party manufacturers and companies
that make accessories so that's why if
you're not basically you're not paying
apple and you don't have this made for
iphone sticker on your box that's why
you get that message
okay but it still works exercise 1 99
percent of them I've never been shocked
by an apple charger you know neither of
I'm I'm still alive do ya and mine are
like freight apart like coming apart
exposed wires and stuff I still not
getting shocked now I said don't try
this at home how about just don't try
this a report coming out of business
insider says a former senior manager at
Foxconn one of apple's manufacturing
partners we know the name Foxconn
because you heard a lot about how there
were poor working conditions there for a
while people committing suicide based on
whether it's mental health or the poor
working conditions right there was for
about a year and a half or so it's a
hot-button issue and then Apple did an
audit and had to review that but also
basically puts out a yearly report on
the conditions in there been doing there
in your manufacturing processes and
stuff so a former senior managers at
Foxconn allegedly stole 5700 iPhones and
sold them for 1.5 million dollars Wow
million-dollar gonna going to jail for a
long time yeah they say the Taiwanese
man his name only reported as psy has
been indicted over the allegations and
faces trial with a potential 10-year
jail sentence if found guilty the way so
it was like how do you just steal these
how do you just grab them off the
factory line the phones in question are
said have been made for testing rather
than sale smart guys I smart guy sigh
and they were supposed to have been
scrapped once the tests were complete
and he's like scythes lying gonna throw
these are you guys gonna throw these out
over here all these iphones okay I'm
just gonna grab him hey she also worked
with eight other employees to help him
acquire the phones and it was like a
ring oh yeah yeah Chinese folks we liked
rings like correct rings dude it's just
how it rolls there is no there is no
crime without a ring period no matter
what you are if you like you need a ring
on a ring if you don't have a crime ring
you're not a crime lord you're weak the
Hall of Doom that's a crime ring there's
so many good crime rings that i can
think yeah
I mean come on you guys see Sopranos it
wasn't one guy oh so good Sopranos it
wasn't one guy was a ring all right
talking rings you want to talk about
that we want to see what we have yeah
yeah we got some phone calling ring ring
let me get this set up real quick my bad
oh no it's not your bad is we're just
this is a free-flowing conversation and
show it can go in any direction at any
time all right here we go call number
one Bryan beat you Dave in tacoma
washington let's go back to 2014 and
remember that app commercial about apps
and developers and for second and
knowledge that are sounds great because
of its apps so my question is does Apple
not realize that until they invest in
their developers and make better more
robust apps that people are can buy the
next iPhone because they don't see the
benefit of any applications of hardware
being push past the a7 chip the iphone
5s great show love the dynamic between
the two of you thanks for the question
thank you so much for calling I think
that when you talk about the app
community and it's not necessarily yes
you are right hardware is part of what
drives developers forward to build apps
but i think really quite honestly the
reason why iOS has so many apps and apps
developers is because they sell the most
phones yeah that's definitely when you
when you're a young developer trying to
make money and make an appt what's the
first platform you're gonna go to you're
not going to go to windows you're not
you're not gonna you're not going to go
for a smaller platform you're going to
go to the biggest audience that has the
largest potential for you to get your
app seen purchased used and then make
more apps and therefore make more money
so it may be discouraging I don't think
apples hardware is preventing app
developers I haven't seen app developers
drop off in any significant way shape or
form they're more flocking to iOS and
developing apps purely because it they
sell the most phones yeah I feel like
that commercial he's talking about from
2014 is Apple being misguided like the
powers are apps no it's your phone that
runs those apps and and in every case
when someone built a nap
I always see like Android people saying
when is the when is the version for
Android going to come out you know it's
always for Apple first yeah so yeah that
makes sense so just there I don't think
it's gonna look until we see any kind of
shift of a large majority of these
clinical killer or key new emerging apps
come out on Android first once in a
while there are but I can't mean I can't
even really think of a a real solid
example almost nighttime gonna say
ninety-five percent of the time and app
debuts on iOS first for sure everywhere
else before it goes anywhere else
totally so okay next call
hi this is Bryan from New Orleans I've
got two quick questions for you number
one I and an IT professional we manage
around 200 iPhones and on the new
iPhones we're actually noticing that the
glass seems to scratch easier ever
really seen this before any previous
models but we are noticing that just
wondering if you've heard anything about
that question too um any complaints
about the new macbook and not the fact
that the keyboard is a macbook pro sorry
not the fact that the keyboard is the
shallow which it is but just kind of
plastic enjoys it makes when you type on
it it's not a real pleasant sound it
seems to be louder than in years past so
I just want to get your opinion on those
two things love the show thing thanks
for the call in regards the first
question I haven't heard anything you'd
you'd know more than us quite honestly
because you're around them but I haven't
seen anything that's significantly
calling out the screen for being less
durable mom and in my own experience I
haven't had anything happened just based
on normal you so I honestly couldn't
answer that accurately yet the other
question though in response to the
macbooks the new macbook pros keyboards
it was one of the features that I felt
would be a controversial one from a
standpoint of people are going to either
like it or not because of what they're
used to it definitely has more plasticky
clicky sound to it from when I've used
even just the 12 inch super ultra thin
ultra-slim macbook but it I guess I hate
saying this at the end of the day Apple
is basically saying we think it's better
you're going to get used to it and if
you don't like it you can't do anything
about it true so it's one of those
things that yeah it feels different it
is shallower it might make a little more
plasticky noise because just I think the
keys are thinner and fatter and I don't
know if that plays into it although
underneath yeah yeah and I don't know if
that plays into it it probably does but
even if we could we can't really change
anything about it but your your
observations are right on the money yeah
I feel like with every keyboard there's
like a little learning you know you have
to get used to it it just feel the
macbooks back in the day used to have
these silvery larger plastic Keys
without the same amount of space between
this
one so and people got used to that cool
all right next call hey guys it's
matthew from turlock on the last show
you guys talked about how Apple's
getting out of their router business and
I was wondering if that means Apple
won't be offering the time capsule
anymore I'm wondering because we have
two macbooks that back up automatically
to that time capsule over Wi-Fi using
time machine software and it's super
convenient I was wondering if Apple will
stop selling that product and if so what
will users do to back up their laptops
over Wi-Fi using time machine like can
users hook up an external hard drive to
a third-party router or something Thanks
we don't know what's going to happen
once Apple gets rid of their apple
airport wireless routers I think it's
still going to be some time you know and
they're going to support them for a
while so let's just say you only have to
worry about this in maybe a year year
and a half or two when the next standard
of 802 11 is it a F comes out I can't
remember the top my head I always keep
on there's so many different ones that
are actually in the word summer
commercial use summer for consumers but
they'll find a way to make it they'll
figure out a way for it to work yeah
yeah you know the time machine backup i
plug in a hard drive directly to my
computer I'm not saying that's what you
want cuz you want wireless backup but
there's gonna be a way to do it there
they'll go buddy allowed to write you
can do just yeah to certain degree not
if you pay if you pay for that service
but just not your computer yeah Bob you
know so and we'll see how they address
it but we just really don't know yet so
and I for a quick little thing I
appreciate our friends on periscope that
watch this live they can't hear any of
the questions or they still hang with us
you'll hear when we get our new studio
back up and running trust us all right
trust trust the process
hey i'm flying all the variants of you
think love gold is an actual grayish
color because men are really for such
plus magic it looks amazing and able to
take it to paint but do you pick it a
girlish color that might be the best
question of the year do you think rose
gold is a girlish color I look this
whole York you're asking the right
person this whole I'd look at look what
I'm with you I really this whole idea of
colors being associated or linked to
like genders I think as time has gone on
that has just become like a lame
argument it's redic dudes wear pink all
the time and it doesn't matter like if I
wanted pink I got pink shoes you can
judge however you want but I would never
worry about or care about if you like
the color go for who cares what other
people think it's like serious it's
crazy my son is like three years old and
he talks about this like daddy I want I
don't want girl color so I'm like what's
a girl color what are you talking about
it's just the color yeah it's like this
weird like I don't want to say it's a
sexist thing but you know it's like
built in a little bit for what they
built anything like I mean from from
when kids are born yes they're putting
like a blue Lou ornate yeah and it's
like it's it's ridiculous so it's been
hard for me to like convey that to my
son like there's no such thing as a girl
color you can wear whatever color you
want yes I know what girl colors I'm
like yeah who's telling you this let
alone colors I mean what about floral
patterns I'm like so high on floral
patterns i remember my brother he was
like dude why you wanted flowers all the
time and I'm like because I like to and
get away ladies like flowers yeah guess
what oh my gosh 23 years later dudes be
wearing flowers that's why don't be a
trendsetter get all roles gold outfit I
don't even care if you got made fun of
it's not my fault I didn't tell you to
do that okay okay I be a rose gold
phones in Halloween next year why not
look when you're younger you have to
deal with this whole like gender
identity with color thing yes I think as
you get older your are you really going
to knock talk to someone because Iran
arose
old like jacket no I don't care like I'm
not going to talk to you if you're a
jerk you know so it's just it's just
part of growing up but I see we were
saying you might get teased by a friends
but guess what own it if you do go on it
that's their own insecurities it is
they're concerned about themselves and I
would say oh you just aren't wearing
rose gold cuz you can't pull it off and
they're gonna say yeah cuz I would never
pull it off I'm like yeah I'll let's
keep walking now humana be a man just
step off those gold own it own it okay
that's it man that's it now that we just
had it that we had to go off on our on
our let our color color gender
identification color gender I call a
quality yes apple byte extra crunchy
