editor here at cnet today we're to take
a first look at the qua way pal this is
a new phone for metro pcs now I know
you're looking at this phone and you're
thinking is this really 2013 am i
showing you this well it is and you know
this is metro pcs so the carrier tends
to go a little lower end on their phones
and I know that not everybody needs a
device it's really fancy you don't need
and not everyone need something that
does a million things has all this stuff
on it so there is a place and a time for
a phone that just makes calls and sends
messages but I really don't think the
Huawei pal is the one you want it
doesn't make very good calls actually
and that really is its primary and
pretty much only function it is just way
too basic it takes that simplicity and
runs with it way way way way way farther
than it should so now I will talk about
the design for a minute though it is a
very simple candy bar it's really from
another decade actually it has a very
small display not much bigger than kosis
stamp its color I don't know actually
how many hues is on it and but it is
simple i mean it's serviceable the menu
system is deadly easy it's just got
icons on the first page and in a list
based menu system inside you'll be very
very familiar if you use the phone for a
lot of years it is very light in the
hand it's so small i could almost close
my hand completely around it you almost
you really don't notice it's there below
the display there's a big navigation
array i kind of liked it it is it has a
nice retro feel it reminds me of
something when i first started reviewing
phones here at CNN like 10 years ago and
as circular navigation toggle it's
really big it's raised above the surface
of the phone so it's very easy to use
there's an ok button in the middle a
couple of soft keys one you can program
as a shortcut to a feature of your
choice or the talk and ends power
buttons there's a clear button and then
there's a dedicated speaker feel control
so again spacious very easy to use
simple to master keypad buttons down
below you know there is no out there is
no keyboard there's no physical keyboard
there's no / g board so you're going to
be texting using only this new health
and america keep it up on the top
there's a 3.5 millimeter headset jack
over on this side there's a micro USB
charger port that is only used for a
charger doesn't have USB sinking not
that you're in there's really much to
put on this phone anyway but just keep
that in mind there's no dedicated volume
rocker so when you're on a call you're
going to have to use that navigation
targul to change the volume
and interestingly this isn't a huge deal
but just thing I noticed interestingly
you actually have to go side to side to
raise the vault raising lower the volume
not up and down so it's a little
counterintuitive on the back there's a
single speaker actually pretty good
output but a call quality isn't that
great as I said inside the phone there's
no camera there's just a few megabytes
of memory there's a 1000 contact phone
book and you can pair of contacts with
photos but how are you going to get
photos on the phone and that's another
matter you're gonna have to actually
have somebody text them to you since you
can't there's no memory card slot
there's no camera and there's no USB
sinking there is a web browser so that
of course is deadly sim pode only is
going to serve up the really most
stripped-down mobile web pages I'm
navigating around with that toggle it
just really felt like I was living 10
years ago but it is there so you can use
it this phone way too simple is easy to
use but just two simple as far as
features in design I'm Ken German here
are the first look at the far away
