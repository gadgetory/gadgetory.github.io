automakers developing sub brands of very
efficient cars here's BMWs it's going to
be called the I've series but it's a
whole sub brand of their standard line
of vehicles kind of the way Toyota is
expanding Prius to be an entire sub
brand of their line of cars now what's
happening here is a pure electric on
this car i'm going to show you another I
in just a few moments this is a little
mega city car if you will it's about a
hundred miles on a charge lots of
aluminum and carbon fiber keeping the
weight down to under a thousand
kilograms that's what about 2,700 pounds
not super light not tesla roadster light
but we're getting in there as you can
see we've got a lot of show car features
here those suicide doors will never make
it into production neither will that
space-age dashboard but when this car
comes to market in 2013 we're talking
about a very different kind of BMW one
that is all about electricity and not
necessarily all about the ultimate
driving machine message efficiency is
becoming a huge headline for these folks
now they point out the wall this car is
a city car it's not a dinky little car
this is a pretty spacious machine even
in total concept car trim here but let
me show you the iseries that you really
want to see I ate it's over here okay
this one's called the i8 concept now
we're talking even more show karush even
less likely to show up in a showroom in
this form in 2014 when it does arrive
however let's take a look at this now
this one's not pure electric it's a
plug-in hybrid so it can get a lot of
electric range because it's got big
batteries as plugins do but it's also
got a three cylinder twinpower turbo gas
engine now twin power can mean different
things in BMW language that can mean a
twin stage single turbo or twin turbos
don't know at this point but it gives us
car big performance aspirations not just
efficiency zero to 60 in under five
seconds while delivering something
around 87 miles per gallon they're also
talking a lot about the connected
services that will be coming in all
these iseries vehicles things like park
at my house a service where you can let
ppl park at your space where you live or
drive now which is a car sharing service
between be
w in a big rental company in Europe that
focuses solely on city car share of
efficient vehicles like that I three and
of course you can see inside the dash of
this I ate their envisioning all kinds
of connected services for navigation
communication streaming infotainment of
all kinds and I also see what appears to
be a vision of an augmented reality
screen laying information on an actual
view of the road in front of you but
again this is show car stuff in the
details the big story here is BMW is
launching a sub brand of electric or
highly electrified vehicles 2013 for the
I 3 2014 for the IH</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
