Cherokee a luxury handsome beast now
available with a turbo diesel along the
waited is it the perfect Grand Cherokee
or just the perfect reason to go back
and check off the v8 let's try this 2014
Grand Cherokee summit all-wheel drive
with the diesel check the tech now it's
not a stretch to say that the current
Grand Cherokee is kind of the American
Land Rover they've taken this guy
upscale very mature and sophisticated in
its lines but it remains a serious
off-roader spot the latest ones by a
revised face and rump slightly smaller
more streamlined taillights and such in
other words it's just getting more
elegant every year now technically a
Grand Cherokee in this current guys is
not a truck at least not in the opinions
of a purist because it's not a
body-on-frame vehicle it's a unibody
design but it makes for a very car like
vehicle now because we've got a summit
which is the top trim level we've got a
standard 8.4 inch squarish but very
large UConnect head unit we've seen this
before in Grand Cherokee is another
Chrysler products I'm not gonna go real
deep on it if you want to get some
details on a check out our other reviews
of other trim Grand Cherokees we're
really here to talk about diesel today I
will mention though that at this point
CD is optional we have one here in the
console you would get this either by
optioning CD on a cart or getting the
blu-ray headrest system we have that I
don't approve of but basically optical
discs by by now we have an all-wheel
drive diesel vehicle but because of
Grand Cherokee this sort of American
Land Rover thing that's all been refined
out it comes down to a nice set of
elegant electronics your shifter here
it's very familiar automatic shifter
that goes to an 8-speed automatic and
here you've got your mode you can go all
the way over to snow sand an automatic
selector and then you've got mud and
rock selections augmenting that you've
got choice of ride height here and you
can lock her down in for low so you've
got the full complement of real Jeep
off-road terrain
rated stuff now interestingly this new
diesel in the Grand Cherokee is not a
German unit not an American unit but
because of the new Fiat parentage it's
made in Italy by VM Motors and
apparently they've got a mechanic
running around barefoot because someone
left a sock in here it's a turbocharged
diesel as they just about all are these
days 240 horsepower it's gonna fall for
a big vehicle 420 pound-feet of torque
this is a dramatic difference a stark
difference between those two metrics and
interestingly of all the grand cherokees
this one has the least horsepower but
also the most torque now the weight is
stunning as well I had to do a
double-take and reread the materials 50
300 plus pounds kerb weight 0 to 60
happens in 7.8 seconds which is kind of
a miracle but again thanks to all that
torque it happens your mpg is actually
pretty good for a vehicle of this weight
it's 21 City 28 Highway that is 8 miles
per gallon better than the v8 5.7 liter
Grand Cherokee it's a huge difference
even though neither our numbers to brag
about all wheel drive on our vehicle you
can get these in rear-wheel drive towing
capacity and all-wheel Drive is 7,200
pounds a little more actually if you get
rear-wheel drive and your range as
diesels tend to have is stunning 730
miles on a tank let's get right to the
heart of the issue driving this thing
reminds me of a school bus the power
comes on pretty mushy it's rubbery
throttle response there's a ton of power
there don't get me wrong but it's not
accessible in a responsive way I find
that part of be a chore to drive on the
other hand the ride quality is super
even over really crappy muddy rutted
roads where you would take this thing
ride qualities nice and weird for that
engine the interior cabin noise would be
superb as well so the engine and its
behavior and power delivery and noise
are completely at odds with the way this
car looks outside and in and of course
it feels it's weight it feels it's 50
300 something pounds but
not in a tubby way it's it's well
controlled weights which not every
suspension can lay claim to doing
successfully visibility is not bad all
around the vehicle you've got some
pretty good vis the corners because of a
large quarter window between the C and D
pillars and of course members is a two
row car there is no third row or third
row options
okay let's price our summit dese on our
2014 configuration this guy's gonna
start off a little over 48,000 delivered
that's just for a summit at
all-wheel-drive 3000 add the diesel
option 5,000 it's an all the cart
tick-box the only other option i would
add on this high trim vehicle is the
optical disc drive why not you've got a
thousand CDs at home I would skip the
$2,000 do a headrest blu-ray system like
the plague and go get a couple of iPads
all in a little over five years to pay
off the diesel option here that's
ballpark math you need to value things
like it's very long range its unique
torque curve although it's towing
capacity on this vehicles no better than
a gas v8 here's what this vehicle
appeals to someone who bemoans how nice
jeeps have gotten in recent years or
drives a ram Cummins pickup as their
work truck or generally likes the sound
of a diesel engine for the rest of us
this one doesn't necessarily fit
