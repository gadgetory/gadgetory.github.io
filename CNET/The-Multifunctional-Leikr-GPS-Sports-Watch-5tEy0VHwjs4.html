cnet.com on the floor at CES 2013 with a
very early look at the like or gps
sports watch this is a product that's
coming out of Kickstarter and it's
rapidly approaching its goal with an
expected delivery date of June 2013 this
is the sports watch that uses a GPS
antenna built inside of it to track a
number of different elements here for
example you can track your current
location you can track your pace how
fast you've been running how long you've
been running it's also got wireless
connectivity built into it so you can
pair it with an aunt plus heart rate
monitor or a number of Bluetooth
low-energy accessories it's a really big
screen here two inches it's probably the
biggest in its class we're told and it's
a basically either the really
interesting technology that the more
light you put on it the better it looks
so it's gonna be really good for those
of you who like to run outside in the
daytime you don't have to worry about
that screen washing out in the Sun the
full color screen it has built-in
compatibility with OpenStreetMaps that's
an open sourced mapping project so you
can actually upload your maps to this
and upload route to it so for example if
you have a running buddy who has a
favorite route in your city they can
send it to you you can upload it and you
can pretty much follow the dotted line
on the full-color map right here it uses
a gorilla glass screen so you don't
really have to worry about cracking it
and a medical-grade rubber band so you
don't have to worry about any sort of
irritation a lot of times when you're
running with a sports watch you get a
lot of sweat into the band starts
irritating you have to worry about that
with this watch right here charges via a
USB with a cradle right here and you can
also use the USB to think but we're told
that most users are probably gonna use
the Wi-Fi connectivity built in for all
the map syncing and downloading of the
GPS data no wires nothing to really
worry about right there this is a very
early look at a pre-production version
of it the final product is actually
gonna have a number of changes for
example this is IP X 6 waterproof the
final product targeted ipx8 so you
should actually even be able to use it
when you're swimming that's good for
triathlete if you want to swim with this
thing on
you've also we have also been told that
there are gonna be a couple of changes
to the interface for example the main
screen right here that shows six very
small attributes of what you're doing
right now will possibly be customizable
to show larger data so it'll be easier
to see while you're running well I've
been Antoine doodle which he Netcom and
we've been on the floor at CES 2013 with
the liker gps sports watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
