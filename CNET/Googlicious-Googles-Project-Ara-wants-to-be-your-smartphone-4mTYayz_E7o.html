google issues for all that Google that
we can pack inside of a show each week
let's get to it and first it's the
gadgets the Samsung Galaxy s5 is here so
here's a sneak peek and what you can
expect from Samsung's flagship phone
another year another samsung galaxy
super phone with the galaxy s5 Samsung
once again reaches for the top with
high-flying specs like a 5.1 inch 1080p
HD screen a 16 megapixel camera android
4.4 and pretty much the fastest
quad-core processor around it also adds
a fingerprint scanner and the cell phone
world's first heart rate monitor so does
that make Samsung's Galaxy s5 the
smartphone to be you know not
necessarily I'm Jessica doll court for
cnet i'm going to show you around the
phone samsung has really talked up two
of the phone's features the fingerprint
scanner and the heart rate monitor now
other phones have had a fingerprint
scanner before and this one uses a
slightly different approach if you don't
do it just right you're going to have to
rely on your password backup luckily the
heart rate monitor is much more
consistent it ties into the revised s
health app and can track your heart rate
over time you may not use this on a
regular basis but it is a fun extra for
fitness buffs the galaxy s5 still does
everything that the s4 did and then some
like there's a download Booster split
screen mode a ton of motion based
gestures and you can use the screen
while wearing gloves thanks Jessica and
is it me or did that glove kind of look
like OJ's I'm just saying alright
Amazons fire TV is also official their
android based set-top box brings things
we haven't seen from any streaming box
with pretty accurate voice search super
fast streaming and gaming support with
an optional Bluetooth controller it's an
impressive product and if you live in
the Amazon ecosystem it's almost a
no-brainer but it's hard for me to see
why I'd personally make space for this
with my Roku my game consoles and Apple
TV n that's the challenge they will face
but it's a legit product for ninety nine
dollars and the game controller is an
additional thirty nine ninety nine
that's what's happening in the tech toy
world but what's coming down the
pipeline well
is giving us a sneak peek at project ara
their modular phone project just in time
for their our development conference on
April the 15th and 16th what makes this
phone unique is that there will be no
casing holding the different modules
together instead it will use electro
permanent magnets to lock the components
together google is planning three
different models ranging from a six
module mini try saying that 10 times
fast because you can't to a 9 module
phablet and it will really be up to
developers to rally around this creative
concept now sometimes companies can get
a little ahead of themselves in Google
is no different after the wall street
journal reports that google has been
working for the past year to register
the word glass as a trademark they've
successfully received a trademark for
Google glass which makes sense but the
US Patent and Trademark Office rejected
their submission because they said it
was too similar to other existing
trademarks in that the word is merely
descriptive they really don't need to be
overly obsessed about that and just
focus on the product like signing a deal
with ray ban and Oakley parent company
luxottica to work on creating frames
compatible with glass now seriously
let's get that aviator model going on
okay now the googs is testing a new
gmail for android app that lets you pin
and snooze emails according to get calm
it also includes categorizing males into
groups like social finance and travel
925 google reports that this design
transition to managing apps on a full
page of content is being called google
to internally to make its app scalable
from the big push for wearables like a
watch to phone and tablets and all the
way up to pcs and we'll obviously find
more about this at the upcoming google
i/o also google is expanding the ability
to access app content in their search to
24 new apps so if you search for
anything on your device in you can get
that content you are directed to open
the app in the app if the app is
installed now the bleacher report invent
bright tumblr and urbanspoon are just a
handful of the apps that are getting
support and Google wants to be part of
every aspect of your life and you might
be able to add a network carrier to that
soon enough according to a report from
the information google has been
exploring providing its own wireless
network in cities where Google's fiber
high-speed infrastructure exists
so if you're in kansas city missouri
austin texas or provo utah you might be
one of those lucky people also provo you
can find the scenic bridal veil falls
just 10 miles northeast and that's a
factoid you can tell your friends yeah
yo Mitch check this out I just found
this out about Provo Utah they have this
amazing beautiful thing all those we
give you or not alright guys that's
going to do for this week's show email
us at Google licious at cnet com or
tweet me at brian Tong thanks so much
for watching and we'll see you guys next
week for some more of that ghoulish asst
