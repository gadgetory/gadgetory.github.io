app that launched earlier this year the
update as you can see here has a
different layout it's running on the
iPhone 10 and it has the ability to add
videos from your library your camera and
also a whole bunch of new poster effects
Apple's new version of Clips has a few
new filters and also some updates for
iPhone 10 for instance you could take
your headgear in a hallway and overlay
it with different backgrounds now I'm
standing at a futuristic Blade Runner
City Star Wars whoa bb-8 I guess I'm on
the Millennium Falcon and I am a
hologram or River from San Francisco it
looks like animated art land 8-bit world
or here or here or here and I'm still in
the hallway scenes is basically taking
the true death of camera and pulling out
my face and putting on a 360-degree
video that I can then walk around and
turn and show details up but there only
so many scenes and clips you can't put
in your 360 degree videos yet and there
aren't any others to add just a selected
number of scenes
and there's no support for an emoji yet
you're gonna have to upload those
separately like I just did there are
some new filters like watercolor
charcoal Sienna indigo and comic book is
still here live titles are back you can
add them into any video they auto
transcribe yes they no throws idiomas
the layouts changed a bit with a giant
red recording button right there and a
photo button there live titles which add
live transcribing happen here and then
there's extra effects that can be
layered on over here
filters and also some stickers and emoji
new titles and effects include some from
Star Wars and other Disney franchises
clip still only shoots in square video
unfortunately but its features are great
the new updates available now and I hope
some of these features make the move
into iMovie
I'm Scottsdale mrs. clips on clips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
