and today we're taking a first look at
the qmadix I harmonics Qi sound this one
4999 wireless bluetooth speaker system
is built to appeal to frequent travelers
it's small has an interesting looking
design and even comes with its own
carrying case what really sets the Qi
sound apart though is its ability to
produce stereo wireless audio over
Bluetooth that's right true stereo sound
with two speakers that are linked by a
cordless connection available in both
white and black colors the Qi sound
consists of two pod shaped speakers that
way about a quarter of a pound each the
left speaker has volume as well as track
forward and advanced buttons there's a
small internal mic too so you can make
and receive calls when the device is
paired to your phone on back of each
speaker is a power connector to charge
its internal battery unfortunately
there's no audio input to hook up older
devices via wired connection it's clear
the Qi sound is built for travel and the
speakers fit snugly into their carrying
case magnets in the speaker rims also
help them stay put on the road there's
no room for the charging cable inside
the case however which is annoying also
while it's nifty to be able to separate
the left and right speakers to tweak
your audio experience the Qi sound
quality in general won't blow you away
there's not much bass to speak of and
it's audio quality is a bit brash
splashy and distorts at high volume for
the same price the original jawbone
jambox offers better performance still
wireless stereo audio is a pretty slick
feature so these guys are definitely
worth a look I'm Brian Bennett and this
has been a first look at the qmadix I
harmonics Qi sound be sure to check out
