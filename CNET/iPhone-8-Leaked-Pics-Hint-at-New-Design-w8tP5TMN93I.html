the next iPhones are going to look like
a photo of the front and glass backing
of the new iPhone has been shared on
reddit the photo caption says that this
comes from a friend in the industry and
that Chinese manufacturers got the parts
last week so there's not much here to
prove that this is a reliable source
this is pretty much all based on hey I
know a God who knows a guy in China so
if that's cool with you the post does
also offer a second image with more back
panels these are assumed to be the back
of the iPhone 7s the larger 7s plus and
then the front and back of the iPhone 8
the captions suggest that all three
models are going to get wireless
charging capabilities if you've been
keeping score at home on all of these
Apple rumors then it should come as no
surprise that Apple may reveal three new
iPhone models in September 2 with an
incremental upgrade under the 7s label
and then one high-end iPhone 8 this
would commemorate the fact that this is
going to be the 10th anniversary year of
the iPhone now it's hard to resist an
iPhone rumor T's and these photos do
match up with multiple reports and
previous leaks the iPhone 8 is said to
pack new features that could implement
new camera effects Apple has been
talking about augmented reality apps and
the model would have an all screen front
with the touch ID fingerprint sensor
hidden under the glass instead of a
standalone button we're seeing more
phones evolve into an edge to edge
screen Samsung's Galaxy s8 has very
little framing on the top and bottom and
the newcomer essential phone it has a
bezel that looks very similar to what we
see in the leaked iPhone image where
there's only a little cutout in the
center for a camera and the screen goes
back up to the top corners like little
ears but with extra features and the all
screen front design this next iPhone 8
is rumored to cost a pretty penny
perhaps as much as a macbook around
$1000 I'm Bridget Carey you can catch up
