to the Apple by for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple this
week's lead story has a rotten smell all
over it now Apple was just granted 44
patents covering a wide range of
products but the biggest one was a
patent that gives Apple a way to stop
iPhones from taking photos or videos at
concerts or other venues now the patent
describes your phone's camera detecting
an infrared signal and interpreting the
data that signal could disable both
photos and video recording now an
infrared emitter could be located on
stage where pictures or videos are
prohibited now at first I want to throw
it a bad apple I mean I paid for these
tickets I know a lot of you are
screaming for one so here that's for you
but at the same time I hate how
conscious are completely ruined by
everyone holding up their phones taking
videos and snap chatting I just hate
that unless it's justin bieber falling
through a trapdoor okay no Bieber's were
hurt during the filming of that concert
but on the flip side there are some good
uses for the patent museums could use
this same text to automatically display
information about an object you're
viewing now Apple is already working
with artists for exclusive new releases
on Apple music and they've even funded
music videos like hotline bling so you
could logically see how they could apply
this to apple branded concert events
just another way to control the
experience for better or worse alright
another Apple granted 10 will allow you
to control the Apple TVs user interface
with 3d real time in air gestures in the
future think a Minority Report now the
patent would allow you to control pinch
and zoom rotate and press virtual
buttons to control the Apple TV without
a remote it would still require some
sort of camera sensing Tech and Apple
did acquire primeSense in 2013 that
company was responsible for the tech
inside the first Microsoft Kinect now
Siri Plus this Plus a TV streaming
service would be a pretty sweet package
if it ever comes out also another apple
patent brings a 3d graphical user
interface this time to computer systems
that
be able to detect a user's gaze and then
allow them to interact with a virtual
touch screen to control navigate a Mac
based on the context of what they're
doing again all of these pads do not
guarantee we'll ever see them in the
future but it could happen alright I was
trying to hold off on the flood of
iphone news but you can't stop it you
can only hope to contain it check this
out an image from nowhere else fr of a
leaked iphone 7 casing claims to show
the back of the upcoming 4.7 inch phone
with a larger protruding camera cut out
backing the claims that will see an
improved c MOS sensor but rumors of a
dual lens camera for the iphone 7 plus
continued to conflict after this picture
from microblogging site Weibo shows off
the pill shaped enclosure for the dual
lens it's still uncertain if this is an
early prototype so we'll just have to
wait until sep tember I know it's far
away for the official confirmation also
a picture from nowhere else FR shows us
the rear shell with two symmetrical
speakers on the base and a single
Lightning port with no speaker headphone
jack Weibo leaks claim to show us
Apple's ear pods with a lightning
connector on the end of them even if
rumors claim will see the standard
airpot headphones with a lightning
adapter dongle but in an actual story
that's not a rumor apple supplier cirrus
logic has announced a new m5 headset
development kit that's specifically
geared for accessory makers to quickly
produce lightning based headphones now
m-phy stands for made for iphone ipad
ipod and the kit includes form factor
reference designs and the advantages of
the high fidelity audio connection but
one thing we know the next iphone won't
have is wireless charging and I feature
accessories that I actually love using
on the show so check out mophie is
bringing wireless charging to their
juice pack line and they're calling it
charged force there's these different
charging pads like one for your office a
Destin or even one that mounts on your
car's air vent and it gets even cooler
with magnets that align it to hold it in
place now you didn't know this but most
of their current cases actually have the
tech inside them already cases start at
$99 and the different charge for spaces
start at 39 i've been using their air
vent one in my car and it's honestly
pretty sweet and yes i'm working on
getting some for you the apple biters in
the few
all right now the overall sense i get
from everyone including myself is that
the next iphone won't really be that
special and all eyes are already on the
10th anniversary phone but maybe google
is going to give them a little scare
that they need a telegraph report says
google is planning to release its own
google-branded smartphone that will
compete directly with the iphone we've
heard google has wanted a more
integrated apple-like experience
controlling both hardware and software
for a future phone the new device is
expected to be released by the end of
2016 so we will wait and see and you
know what let's wrap things up on a high
note Florida resident Thomas s Ross
filed a lawsuit against apple claiming
that the iphone ipad and ipod infringed
on his 1992 invention of a hand-drawn
electronic reading device see you can
see here how this device looks exactly
like the iPhone iPad or iPod now Ross
filed for a utility patent that protects
his invention in 1992 but it was
declared abandoned in 95 by the USPTO he
is seeking 13 billion dollars in
restitution and a royalty of 1.5% on
apple's worldwide sales of infringing
devices Thomas s Ross my friend good
luck to you alright that's going to do
for this we show you can always email us
at the Apple vidas cnet com or tweet me
at brian Tong if you have a cool sketch
of your iPhone or iPod or whatever that
you think deserves 13 billion dollars
send it along thanks so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
