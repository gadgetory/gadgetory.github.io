know which graphics card you want right
now that's the nvidia geforce 980ti only
available in big bulky 17-inch gaming
laptops like this big guy right here or
this guy over here laptop certainly but
I wouldn't exactly call them portable if
you wanted to get something that was
just as powerful but in a smaller
15-inch package that's been very hard to
find but here's a relatively new one
that manages to pack a lot of stuff into
a much smaller chassis it is the Acer
predator 15 so in this somewhat smaller
15-inch body you can get all the power
and all the features of a 17-inch gaming
laptop without making any compromises
except maybe for fan noise especially
when you have the extra fan cranked up
what's that you say about an extra fan
well I'll tell you you can outfit this
thing with a traditional optical drive
that goes into a slot in the side or you
can pull the optical drive out and
replace it with an extra fan and why do
you need that extra cooling because if
you have a big 9 ATM card in here and a
core i7 CPU the system could conceivably
get pretty hot and that is one of the
few instances where you might actually
need extra cooling in a laptop besides
that I appreciate the fact that even
though this looks like a gaming laptop
they've had a little bit of fun with the
design they've marked out the WASD keys
and the arrow keys with red key caps of
course the backlit keys have different
colored lights and you can change them
up as you want and I also like how
there's a lot of aesop reloaded software
on here that lets you monitor system
functions including the clock speed of
the of the CPU and the fan speed and the
system temperature so you can actually
see if all that extra fan noise is worth
it it's not the smallest gaming laptop
out there and it's not the most powerful
but it's a really good mix of those two
qualities so if you want a gaming laptop
that's gonna be really fast but it's not
going to dominate your life or your desk
then check out the Acer predator 15
