and today we're taking a first look at
the HTC One SV judging from this phone's
attractive cultural design and premium
construction you might think that HTC
has rolled out another flagship device
well guess again the HTC One SV is
available exclusively in the US on
Cricket Wireless 43 49 99 but is
definitely a mid-range handset powering
the One SV is a zippy 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon s4 plus processor
supported by one gigabyte of RAM sorry
folks no fancy quad-core processor here
the phone doesn't run the latest google
android OS either jellybean but rather
android for dough ice cream sandwich
still the one sv has plenty of pep to
drive its software and the phone feels
pretty quick and responsive HTC also
layers its sense for UI on top of
Android which offers tight social media
integration plus a few handy interface
tweaks for instance to name one slick
trick I can use two fingers to easily
drop widgets and apps shortcuts on the
home screen of my choice just long press
an item with one hand then swipe left or
right with the other the real allure of
the HTC One SV though is it sweet
styling the phone is crafted in gentle
curves sports vibrant red highlights
plus is very thin despite its trim and
pocketable size the phone features a
removable 1800 milliamp battery and
microSD card slot two other great
features include access to crickets 4G
LTE data network that is if you're lucky
to live within its coverage area and the
free move music download service with
move you can download tunes directly
from the cloud to the One SV without
paying anything more than your cricket
subscription fee on the front of the
device is a 4.3 inch 800 x 400 pixel LCD
screen a 1.6 megapixel camera above it
and capacitive android buttons below
also read the earpiece has more red
accents in the form of dashes embedded
within it on back is the phones 5
megapixel camera with LED flash and a
battery cover painted in an even more
wild shade of crim
the back uses a soft touch coating as
well for a sure grip with striking looks
premium feel plus compact and thin size
the HTC One SV is certainly a head
turner it's also great that it doesn't
come with a confining service contract
attached but is it enough smartphone to
be a tempting deal be sure to check back
soon for a full review I'm Brian Bennett
for cnet.com and this has been a first
look at the HTC one sv</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
