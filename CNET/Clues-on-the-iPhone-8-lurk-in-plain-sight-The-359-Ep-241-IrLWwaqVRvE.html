at studios in New York City in 59
episode 241 my name is bebe G in the
house today we've got Alfred Inge and
Ben Fox Reuben what's up guys hello
hello hello to livestream hello to
YouTube hello to periscope we got
periscope today we also got it and juicy
tips juicy tips I don't mean how to
please your iPhone
so Jessica dual core came out with a
story today about how iOS 11 could
provide some juicy clues about what the
iPhone 8 might look like it's mostly
speculative but it's a lot of pretty
good educated guesses so we're going to
be running through a handful of those
we'll also get to Julian Assange's
office it's an artist recreation of it
in England and gets in Liverpool right I
believe so yes
somewhere in Liverpool we'll talk all
about it and also to end on a very nice
positive note a new spider-man doll that
talks to you and tells you comic-book
stories
so certainly bounce he also tells jokes
he also tells jokes yes I look forward
to that yes so sending your questions
and comments BVG we'll get to as many as
you can at the end of the podcast and
let's make this thing happen
all right what stop doing okay here we
go called racial expression - welcome to
the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred
Aang iOS 11s new features offer some
useful early clues about the highly
anticipated iPhone 8 our own Jessica
dual court said in a story today for one
thing Apple's heavy focus on augmented
reality in iOS 11 gives us a pretty good
idea that AR will play a significant
role in the new device do you agree I
mean I think that with that with you
know the addition of AR it definitely
means that they're planning something
big for their cameras you really can
have like a our capabilities be that
great without really having like the
camera to back it up you like you take a
look at that phone Lenovo put out right
where it was like this gigantic phone
and they had like a pretty good camera
on it with that right that's what the
that uses google tango yeah earliest
ones to do it
so that's another thing that Jessica
mentions in her story that some or all
of the models of the new iPhone 8 may
have three cameras which sounds like a
lot but if you are going to do AR and do
it right you may potentially need that
many cameras on the back of it I mean is
it worth arguing that the iPhones
already have three cameras though
because you take a look at these 7s
where it's technically it's not another
camera but it's dual lens and then they
have one on the front already so that to
me I feel like that's already three
cameras okay three cameras on the back
though
and do you think the back three hammers
on the back yeah because that's that way
you get depth perception and we're the
actual thing yeah I guess that makes a
lot more sense as far as like AR goes I
think the other interesting thing is
essentially you know Siri maybe you'll
be able to start activating just by
saying like the same way that you would
be able to activate like Alexa right
with hey Siri you can do that but yeah
right now but the idea would be to add
more capabilities to add the thing for
me is is that Siri just isn't that good
Gangan with so I don't really see this
actually making her much better I mean
do you think that with more people
interacting with it on the home pod
though that it might help can assume oh
yeah more people would use that yes that
would definitely give Apple more data
but at the same time I think Syria is
pretty far behind next two artists in
England made a perfect recreation of
Julian Assange's 43 square foot yes 43
living space in the Ecuadorian Embassy
in London is this what do you think
people would want to get out of this
like what is the purpose for doing this
I mean you know all those live streams
that they do for like WikiLeaks with
Julian Assange and like a green screen
and things like that I feel like it'd be
like a tourist stop where he can go and
like pretend that like you're with him
or something like that I really hope
there's like a wax replication of him
that hasn't done that yet right but like
I kind of think that creating such a
small confined space is potentially a
way to get more sympathy for him or at
least like raise a little bit more
awareness that this guy has been like
stuck in the embassy for the past five
years I mean I think it's interesting I
hope they do the same thing for like
wherever Edward
Snowden is holed up where you can kind
of like get a look at like what it's
like inside this this person's like
their daily life you know I think is
really interesting as far as like
historical purposes I think it's like
really cool
you don't think Edward Snowden is in an
awesome Russian mansion somewhere um I
don't know I don't know okay last to end
the week on a very positive note
toymakers furrow created a
voice-activated storytelling spiderman
doll it's packed with 100 comic book
stories in on audio it's also one
hundred and fifty dollars so kind of a
more expensive toy but I don't know I
think it's kind of cool I could watch
the spider-man movie for like 15 times
at that price and I feel like that would
be a much more fun experience than this
toy I also don't like smart toys so I
was trying I was China and positive but
I guess that wasn't gonna happen
anyway if you liked what you heard check
us out on CNET for more about these
stories I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred
Aang thanks for listening that
spider-man is cool I don't know what
your what your griping about I hate
smart toys whatever you never had a
Teddy Ruxpin growing up that a problem
yes no I he's a he's a you he doesn't
have just give me a phone uh-huh
and Angry Birds or what we're kids
playing now I don't know I do think it's
cute however it is kind of expensive I
probably like it's like maybe if it was
a Teddy Ruxpin like cuddly kind of thing
but this thing's like rock hard like who
would play with this on a rubbery I
would like some juicy tips into a
leasing your Spider Man toy oh don't go
there no no this is for children bad
this is already a friendly show that's
true
it is a family-friendly podcast I
retract my comments kids play with
action figures and plastic dolls yeah
I'm but exactly and this link does not
look like an action figure it's like
trying to be cuddly and then also an act
is just weird I don't agree with Scotts
verbage of cuddly necessarily but I
still think it's pretty cool yeah cuz
give me something read any comics I can
be that much lazier yeah I agree that's
that I like that idea
anyway okay but we have Apple question
we don't have too many Apple questions
but actually this is a great opportunity
to pull
the ongoing series we have on CNET James
H is asking if there are any possible
new adaptable software's for people with
disabilities such as himself and we
actually have an ongoing series on CNET
right now mmm it is called ted enabled
tech enabled yeah you had some great
stories for Tekken yes oh I wrote one
story for tech enabled about a
smartphone that quadriplegics can use
just by using like head movement so it
uses like facial recognition and then it
registers your face as the mouse so like
you move your head around and it uses
that to click on things on your
smartphone instead so you don't really
need to touch it or anything like that
a lot of people have been using this to
kind of like control their smart homes
and things like that or just you know
chat with people I actually used it to
chat with one of its co-founders who is
a quadriplegic over in Israel and we
talked on skype using just that which is
really cool was that also the same story
where you mentioned a guy that is like a
really badass Street Fighter player and
that's my other that's my other other
winery this guy play Street Fighter with
his face we didn't really go yeah really
neat yeah so in this one it was
basically about um this there's there's
these two companies one called
AbleGamers and the other ones called
special effect that they helped create
like special controllers specifically
for disabled gamers and people would go
to them for like consultation sessions
and they'd figure out like what your
needs are like based off like what your
abilities are and like what kind of
control they need to make for you so
they had one where it's like completely
mouth controlled where like you would
play with your tongue only but and then
they had ones where it's like foot
switches so if you couldn't like use
your hands to control in like a
first-person shooter kind of thing but
you could use like fingers to like like
shoot right they had like a foot pedal
thing or like a board thing where like
you could swivel around that to like
move around in the game and then like
just shoot like pressing like one button
only it's really sweet that is really
neat that's yeah that's pretty awesome
too you know people that want a game
help them game as much as they but I
think James's question was more about
software both of my like questions were
more about hardware itself except for
the smartphone example but I know that
Apple actually does a lot when it comes
to like being more accommodating for you
know people that want to you use like
their technology and things like that
most of a lot of it's like for blind
users where they have like screen
readers really that are really helpful I
don't think they revealed that much
about that for like WWDC though where
it's like new or so or like the iPhone 8
arguably like more Syrians especially if
you're going to utilize the home pod
yeah those could help people with you
know a variety of disabilities so that
is obviously helpful I just think that
like even with Alexa and Google
assistant which are you know far and
away a better products then Siri they're
still kind of frustrating to deal with
so somebody with a disability that's
actually going to try to rely on this
stuff for their smart home I don't
really think that we're quite there yet
but it might make certain things much
easier for cert somebody to do I think
so again this is obviously ongoing there
will be lots lots more coverage in this
series in fact I don't know how much we
can really divulge but I know Rogers out
on working on another story right now
how much can we spill on what about for
a road trip
that's for Rogers road trip my mistake
yeah you'll just have to wait and see
we're going to talk about it at all all
right guys that's what I figured we
might be how shush on this front design
beam so pretty cool one additional
feature that I thought was interesting
that Jessica mentioned in her story was
the idea of integrating with home pod
for instance my wife constantly loses
her phone around the house we're not
going to do this because I'm not buying
the home pot it's three hundred and
fifty dollars and we already have like
two echos in my house or Ben can't
afford three hundred and fifty dollar
all right whatever let me get to let me
start my GoFundMe that would be really
nice so let's say you've got the home
but you don't know where you put your
phone you can ask Siri to find your
phone which I know is like such a first
real problem but at the same time it's
like instead of getting on your computer
do Find My iPhone something like that I
think that could be a pretty useful
function for something like that yeah
I'm so because ndu I'm surprised Amazon
hasn't already done that with the echo
at like find my Amazon phone exactly why
would they why cause there are no
happens on phones I doubt definitely
anybody in the chat go ahead and chime
in with some of your predictions or
thoughts about what we're gonna see out
of the iPhone
it's kind of quiet today but that's
alright yeah getting close to the end of
the week yeah okay so everybody's
getting a little sigh I've gotten into
the summer I disagree with one of the
predictions that she made based off of
what i OS xi has to offer and that is
the iphone like stand-alone like VR
headset kind of thing similar to like
what daydream is with like Google mm-hmm
I really don't think Apple is gonna come
out with something like that on their
own why not I think they're gonna come
up with like VR stuff or I don't think
they're gonna come out with their own
headset can you get like can you imagine
like a like a cardboard kind of like VR
headset from like Apple maybe I don't
see it so Tim Cook keeps coming out and
saying like I love the possibility of VR
I love the possibility of a are
obviously tipped his hand quite a bit
with WWDC talking about AR kid and all
the different focuses on AR I don't see
it as so unlikely that they wouldn't try
to like push into VR and if they did
especially with a phone you probably
need some sort of headset that would
accommodate so whether that's going to
be from a third party or whether that's
going to be from Apple itself and it's
going to cost like five hundred or a
thousand dollars I still tell me there's
a chance that that I think there will be
VR on it because they were showing that
off at WWDC I just don't think like
you're saying like either from like some
kind of third party I think right that's
the route that it might go or like some
other division from Apple like maybe
like from like beats from dr. Dre or
something like never never they will I
from VR Dre I really don't think that
they're gonna come out with like a new
beats labeled product like they had a
chance to do that with the home pod and
they didn't I mean they do that don't
they do that with like the lightening
nuts and lightning sorry the air pods
what like you know they come out like
when they announce the air pods and
they're like well we've got so much
courage I was like check out this new
lineup of like wireless headphones that
we also have I think you're right yeah
yeah but like it was really like a quick
throw away and it wasn't like ear pods
brought to you by beads it wasn't home
pods brought to you or home pod brought
to you by beads which I might have
expected as like a quick addition just
to like give them like a nod like I we
we bought this like you know stereo so
or like this audio company but it seems
pretty clear to me that they're going to
sunset that brand at some point yeah you
think they're going to Sunset Beach
I hope so I mean like or adjust or
they'll just keep it like in that very
small yeah but like it makes like a ton
of money for them mmm yeah I guess like
it sucks yes but like it's at a really
high price and a lot of people buy it so
it either way like if it's gonna make
you a ton of money and you don't spend
that much money on it to make it like I
really expect them to promote the name
beats a lot yeah that's my point I think
like beats are like dumb popular and
like I think I don't think they're gonna
sunset anytime soon yeah I don't think
they're gonna send Sun it at anytime
soon but they're really not showing it
off as much as they could be which is
too bad because they're coming out with
audio products so beats car you know I
think Beats is gonna take over Apple
actually right yeah for the word
prediction of 2017
award goes to cool all right so we got a
few wish lists from Chad TV for what's
up Chad TV for the iPhone he says I hope
it has a more open OS says I'd really
like to see that Iowa's see the iOS
users can download and use files like OS
X and not have to sync to iTunes which I
believe we're seeing coming right open
file
yes mint on the end yes with the the
files like Explorer kind of thing or
whatever yeah yeah but like it's a step
in the right direction but it's probably
not as robust as we might hope for yeah
somehow it works on an Android yeah he's
exactly right
yeah TVs question you know definitely
like implies the fact that like if you
do want like more openness then you're
probably gonna want to go with Android
yeah I mean I think the issue reason
like part of the reason why Apple does
is so if like the lack of openness
outside of money is essentially like
they're very like gung-ho about like
security aspects of it and that's why
like there's also a lot of like alarms
for like security when it comes to
Android wear like people's sideload like
these apps that end up like locking up
their phones and things like that so
Apple is kind of like let's take that
step out of it and just you know make
sure everything's locked down to the way
it is that's like the side of reason the
main reasons like probably for money
but I mean the main reason is usually
for money you know I'm kidding
mm-hmm gen TV also asks for allowing for
wireless transfer over Bluetooth
drop and NFC absolutely yeah like it
would be nice if they opened up the NFC
chip to more functions like I wouldn't
hold your breath now I wouldn't hold
your breath either it's something that's
mentioned in Jessica story but it's like
more as I go maybe sort of probably not
going to happen thing that that was the
bucket that she put it under the other
thing that we haven't mentioned was this
whole point about like they're going to
get rid of the home button that seems
like a very high likelihood that we've
been talking about for like a couple
years now that like this is the
direction that Apple is going in the
question is is like are they going to be
able to include the fingerprint sensor
on the front of the phone because we saw
that with Samsung's Galaxy s8 they
weren't quite there yet they had to
include the fingerprint sensor on the
back of the phone yeah reach out super
far you got a dig deep reach in and put
your finger on it
right like all the way in about how to
please no no is that galaxy say good
lord all right I've got it Thursday
we got we have a good one to elaborate
on Scott Scott Maya asks do we think the
AR kit will be as big as Apple is making
out to be mm I don't right well you know
there's a great question there accurate
and there claim that this is going to be
the biggest AR platform ever because
it's bit they have the most phones like
out there like right well not more than
like Android does but it's like
essentially they have so many phones and
it's gonna be on all of them that
technically it's true that it's gonna be
the largest AR platform like ever for
them ya know it's because they they
don't have nearly as much fragmentation
either but there are obviously way more
Android phones but Android phones run on
any number any fun that's a thing like
I'd like to see the comparison of how
many Android phones are out there that
can actually run like project tango or
like there AR capabilities so totally
there technically correct about that as
far as like usage goes though I think
they're completely wrong on it we're
like there AR features are still like
kind of like the fun cool the ones or
it's like hey look there's a fidget
spinner on this table whereas like with
Google's like AR capabilities it's like
you're gonna be able to know how much a
beer cost at this place and you're gonna
be able to like get your Wi-Fi password
like using the AR on this so biggest
sure most useful probably not like
I mean I think your emotion problem I
was probably gonna make like a couple of
those points and you got to them so well
done that's I agree I'll save some of my
points no no all right so that's
probably about a good place to bring us
home for the week uh wrap it up yeah all
right
I'll I'll do my best mm okay the 359
podcast is available on iTunes soon in
stitcher SoundCloud Feedburner Google
Play Music app and of course Tina calm
also be sure to get something cool for
Father's Day oh cool I'm a father yeah
