lighter than its predecessor with a
flattened keyboard and an expanded
touchpad it's also got new Intel CPUs
faster storage and a brighter Retina
display it's also USB see only which has
been controversial to say the least
but you know all that already what you
really want to know is what about that
crazy touch bar how does it work the
touch bar is a long OLED touchscreen
that sits above the keyboard replacing
the traditional function key row and it
usually displays basic controls like
screen brightness and volume but when
you launch a supported app new
contextual buttons pop up on the screen
is it a gimmick if you spend a bit of
time trying to figure out different apps
you'll end up with maybe five or six
favorite things that can really
streamline your experience and I started
using a few instinctively almost right
away the initial thing you'll want to do
with the touch bar though is setup touch
ID with the built-in fingerprint reader
just by placing a finger on the touch ID
and clicking down user profile switch
almost instantly you can also change the
default buttons in the keyboard
preferences menu just by dragging new
ones to the bottom of the screen and
right on to the touch bar in Safari each
tab you have open is represented by a
tiny thumbnail image tapping on one
switches the browser to that tab
messages has an emoji button which gives
you a long scrolling collection of
everyone's favorite nonverbal
communication tool scroll over to the
one you want and just tap on it iTunes
get useful transport controls including
the ability to scrub back and forth in
both songs and videos it's definitely
finer control than you get with just the
touch pad and until we get Photoshop
support apples photos offers the most
in-depth touch bar support there's a
wheel for rotating a photo as you crop
it you can also run through all the
built-in photo filters or just
brightness and color all by running your
finger across the touch bar of course
these are examples of Apple's own apps
the only ones that currently have touch
bar support if you prefer chrome to
Safari for example you're out of luck at
least for now but Microsoft Adobe and
others are expected to add support in
the near future the touch bar is fun but
the biggest decision when it comes to
the new MacBook may actually
down to something more practical are you
ready to move into the USBC only future
we're connecting nearly any accessory is
going to require a special cable or
dongle
it may seem daunting but many of the
latest ultra-thin Windows laptops have
also gone USBC only so does a good
chance we're all gonna end up there
eventually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
