bite your nails over courtroom drama and
share your spleen on Facebook I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the next blackberry phone will
not have a physical keyboard instead it
will be entirely touchscreen but it's
not a clicky touchscreen like the storm
was research in motion showed off the
new blackberry 10 operating system at
the blackberry world conference in
orlando and what you're seeing here is
the new OS on a prototype sample model
for developers blackberry 10 OS will
have new camera software it'll also
handle multitasking apps but most
noteworthy is how the keyboard works
Cena editors got their fingers on it but
well we can't show you because they
didn't allow press to take video or
photos of the on-screen keyboard so use
your imagination and picture this it
will display suggested words above the
letter it thinks you're most likely to
type next one of our editors said it was
as if the device was reading his mind
and eventually the keyboard will learn
how you tap keys and where you tend to
place your fingers you won't see a new
device until the end of the year but if
you're a loyal blackberry fan who's
addicted to that physical keyboard sorry
the first devices will be all
touchscreen is it the right move for
blackberry send me your thoughts by
making a quick video message on tout or
right to update at cnet com the best
comments could make it on the show in
