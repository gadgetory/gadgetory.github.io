San Francisco with reporters roundtable
google says we soon may have augmented
reality Google glasses it is the coolest
tech demo we've seen this year google
has announced that it is working on
project glass an effort to create a
glasses based heads-up display for the
real world with the Google glasses
you'll be able to look out a window and
get a weather report overlaid on your
field of view look at a product to get
information about it look at a bus stop
and see when the next bus is arriving
share photos and maybe even look at a
face and get the name that goes with it
who wouldn't love that Google glasses
can be seen as a competitor to Apple
Siri the personal assistant on your
smartphone that is supposed to help you
live your day-to-day life of course
parodies for the demo of google glasses
followed quickly after the official
google video they highlighted the
annoyance factor of having content
especially ads pop up in your field of
view and the potential dangers from
walking or playing the ukulele while
distracted
when will you be stumbling down the
street behind a sea of Google content
Google glasses may be available this
year ok so our guests to talk about this
really interesting in sci fi development
our first our writer Martin Lamonica who
has been covering this development for
us over at cnet news Martin thanks for
joining us sure also the CEO of recon
instruments dan eisenhardt this is a
company that is now making actual
augmented reality glasses or I wear for
skiers dan thanks for joining us today
thanks for having me today of course
Google wouldn't join us for the show
this is just like there when they
announced their driverless cars they
made a big splash the news leaked out
and then they wouldn't talk to anybody
for a while about it to say they're
doing the same thing with all the stuff
that comes out of the lab Martin I want
to start with you tell us specifically
what did Google actually announced with
this is called Project Glass right right
so it's called Project Glass it's from
this slab which you reference called
Google X labs and all they did was a
disclosed that they were working on
these odd augmented reality glasses I'm
not sure they actually use that term but
they said they were working on this
project this new type of glassware that
we that's essentially a it sort of these
wraparound glasses with a small screen
above the right eye and you can operate
this as you would operate sort of a
smartphone except it's voice-activated
and in this video that they showed with
the announcement there was this guy this
kind of cool guy from New York moving
around town and getting going through
his day and always will notifications
come up in that screen and you know it's
like magic he he has the information
when he needs it he can find things in
the book story there's a little
notification that the subway is down etc
so that's what they announced that
they're working on this and that they
want some feedback on what people would
like what people think about it Oh
feedback we can give them that hey so
Dan you've been doing this you've been
doing augmented reality products tell us
a little bit about your product first
yeah we develop and sell modular
heads-up display systems that snap fit
into fashion eyewear from the leading
players like scott and smith optics and
UX our products are very compact their
wireless they're not obtrusive and so
they're very highly suitable for
everyday use we've tied with the snow
sports segment first nine percent of
users there already wear goggles so in
terms of user adoption that was an
easier step for us but we we've got our
focus on a lot of other applications as
well that will roll out in the near
future also outside sports so your
goggles it looks like they take the
location altitude speed information GPS
and project it not in fact over the
users field of view but in a corner
below where the goggles give them them
coverage what have you learned about
this product in terms of what users can
process and what they want in your
particular current market which is snow
sports for us the most important thing
is safety so we cater to consumers who
are in constant motion and never depend
on a non-obtrusive a dependable display
they can use for glanceable biometrics
and GPS information like heart rate
speed and distance but also practical
things like navigation smart phone
connectivity and tracking down friends
locations so what we've discovered is
that people want to want the situational
awareness they don't want obtrusive they
want something that when they want to
look at it it's an active choice and
that's that's I think we've successfully
delivered on that so what's your take on
the Google announcement here we Google
is doing a lot of good for the heads up
display industry I think with their
recent PR campaign i'll call it that
people starting to learn and starting to
dream up difference in areas for
commercial for the mass market
applications i think people deep down
know that this is not realistic as it
looks today I think it's close but it's
probably 2-3 years out but against
people think
what was to come and we're very thankful
for that I mean as you as people know
our platform is based on Android it's an
open source model so we like to appear
in Canada so Martin you've been Martin
by the way covers all the cool stuff he
covers he's on the robots beat here so
he's got the best the best coverage
areas well what do you think of this
technology our people ready for it and
is the technology ready for us I said
well judging from the reaction i think
people particularly tech geeks our
beloved cnet readers would be all over
this and it seems like I mean it really
was the coolest hard hardware demo but
the cool is demo for a long time
certainly this year so I think there's
definitely a long lot of tech tech
appeal you know sort of as a fashion
statement I mean Sergey Brin was seen
wearing them the next day which was kind
of funny in terms of how ready it is um
I think it's what they showed was a
stretch you know to do all that so
seamlessly would be very would be
difficult it's not to say it's beyond
the beyond capabilities of what's what's
available now but it would take some
work to to make it so smooth I mean just
just for example the voice recognition
software has to have to work seamlessly
and I think you know I think there's a
lot of organ ama questions to like you
know how do you operate this you know
those what does the screen how do you
focus on the screen how do you control
this in the first place that wasn't very
clear from the video now Sergei was seen
wearing what may for all we know have
been a wood and plastic casing for a
possible google goggles when because he
didn't let any but he didn't let scoble
put him on his head that's right and I
wouldn't let Scoble wear anything that I
was touching either but that's different
sort was he wearing the real thing or
was he just showing what the Nerds of
the future will be looking like um
honestly I don't know I mean I suspect
he was playing with some sort of early
prototype I mean they're testing them I
mean this is this these are real things
it's not complete vaporware but as to
how ready it is you have the hardware or
the services behind it I think that's I
think that's that's a ways off and
honestly we you know it's really
speculation master that's how ready it
is let's talk a little bit about the
technology that's required to make
augmented reality in your eyeballs work
there's a lot of things as there is with
any kind of ubiquitous technology
there's a lot of pieces that have to
come together there's the optical the
the input method the data and all that
and let's start with the optical now Dan
just to educate people hear what you've
got one of the interesting problems with
with products like yours is you've got a
product which is inches from your
eyeball and yet the user is focusing on
things that are hundreds of feet away
optically infinity how do you square
that without having the user having to
shift focus all the time and how will
Google do this so we're using a sort of
a high contrast ocular display
technology which is basically a micro
LCD and then we have an acrylic display
technologies like a prison technology in
front of it which magnifies the image
and then augments it out in front of you
so so we've got the optics scientists
working here our labs designing that and
and we thought that was the best
application for for for our users and
but no we have a platform a system that
is basically agnostic to the display
type so once we feel the transparent
displays I'm mature enough and here you
know I think you trust in a few good
things there there's still a lot as a
long way to go in terms of power
consumption in terms of brightness for
outdoor use and then the safety aspect
that needs to be overcome and I mean
heads-up displays and in-situ displays
and by no means new technology it's been
around for four decades yeah if your
f-18 fighter pilot exactly exactly but
there you've got a big helmet and you've
got more space you you're connected with
a cord to a power source if you want
something that's compact that's not
obtrusive that that's fashion
fashionable and that can last you for
more than 30 minutes and it doesn't cost
you five thousand dollars
it's very very difficult to imagine that
that can be done today there's a lot of
companies that have been working on this
for four decades I do think it's coming
but I do think that there's just a bunch
of challenges that need to be overcome
now I did a little i was looking at
these pictures of Sergei's had thing
which he had a what looked like a very
small monocle below that his field of
vision or in the corner of his field of
vision that appeared to be a mirror that
was reflecting something that was coming
out of a projector at around his eyebrow
which led me to think that what was
happening with that particular product
was that it was projecting something
into his eye rather than being a
see-through type technology and in order
to do what the what the video showed
where the images were actually in front
of your face not just in a little corner
like recon that's a fairly different
technology Martin do you know anything
about that type of kind of retinal
projection type of stuff is that what we
were looking at here that's a good
question you know Dane probably could
might be able to comment on that but I
think I think you hit the nail on the
head and that's one of the big
challenges you know is like i said
earlier controlling it but also having
that immersive thing so that's not so
that it doesn't so you can continue
doing what you're doing say if you're
walking down the street for instance
being able to shift focus and still get
useful information um but I can't really
comment on the head I can comment on
that I don't think it's a retinal
display technology and the reason why i
don't think it's retinal display
technologies because the iBox is very
very small which means only a slight one
millimeter movement let's say off the
frame where the hazardous place it's and
you're completely out of asian you can't
see anything so it's very very sensitive
to movement and I think if you're out
and about it's not going to be practical
because of that technology so i don't
think i actually think what's been shown
there is a variant of what we have with
just their the optics lens exposed so it
looks like it's see-through okay that's
that's my theory so dandy you have only
your little gizmos there I mean we've
seen the demo
but we haven't seen the whole the whole
Megillah here where do you have one
there what's this AR yeah yeah I do have
one with me and this is this is
basically how it looks it's specifically
designed to fit into ski goggles I've
got a goggle here with me as well in
case you don't know how that looks like
this is one of our partners this is UX
so it looks pretty much like standard
pair of goggles but it actually has a
cavity built into it on each side on the
right and left side where which means
you can take our heads up display and
basically snap fit it into the Gulf
that's so that's how it works now and
what how do you what'd he do for input I
mean how does the user control this
thing today I mean they've got these big
heavy ski gloves on do they like jabbed
or eyeball with their ski pole I mean
how do you tell this thing to do stuff
yeah for this year we've got a remote
control which is Bluetooth Low Energy so
it's got 23 years their lifetime on it
and it's blood friendly big buttons here
select buttons and directional buttons
and we've got a scrap so you can put it
on your wrist or on your goggle strap
but with our technology we can do
gesture controls voice commands all
kinds of things imaginable we just
started out with with this basic
application which comes with the goggles
okay now Martin I want to talk about how
Google gets the information that it will
then magically display in front of your
eye of course they have google can get
location information orientation which
way you're pointing we hope it knows
what time it is and those who your
friends are what information is
necessary to overlay check in it the mud
truck or this book is a three dollars
less on Amazon or Google than the one
you're looking at do they need image
recognition or can this be done just
with what the smartphone already has um
I think for the most part it could it
can be done with what a smartphone has
assuming this voice recognition but
you're right it implies a lot going on
behind the scenes and I think you know
so you know so I talked in our official
intelligent software expert
about this story to get an idea of you
know what's involved in this sort of
thing and he said you know for this to
really make sense for anyone to actually
want to use this you'd have to do a lot
of data analysis and filtering in the
back end I mean you could walk up to a
store and see 50 ads and see all kinds
of information that you don't that isn't
relevant to to what you want at that
moment and I that would will be the
trick is to is to highly personalized
relevant information that will actually
help people rather than you know confuse
them are bogging down so we've got to
talk about safety and distraction and
all the parodies and some of them are
just hilarious involve people bumping
into poles falling down stairs or
getting so many pop-up advertisements
that they can't see the real world in
front of them dan you've worked on the
safety issue here how much in new
information can a human process when
they are doing the job of navigating
their body through the real world what
what else can they deal with well you
know you can sort of compare this to
when the smartphones came out and
suddenly we're all glancing down at the
smartphone every sort of ten minutes and
some are even texting while they're
driving their car so which is not
recommended so we can definitely get
used to a lot of things we can we can
train the eye to to look at the the most
relevant information there in just a
brief a split second but there are
limitations so and when you talk about
safety you know your own health is at
risk here and then and also others so I
think we do as the display and
manufacturers have a responsibility
towards the consumers to not to put
anything out there that could be a
liability so is the way this works from
a business perspective that I mean
obviously people will buy these things
but it are we are we gonna see ads
popping up in front of us minority
report style as we're walking down the
street all right have you guys take this
one well I could jump in and and just
remind people that's how google makes
funny right i mean they make all kinds
of cool services which our ad-supported
so you would think that that would be
the business model here on the other
hand you know there's a question as to
what actually works for the user
it could really be poorly done as all
these blooper videos are all these kind
of party videos showed I think if there
is advertising it has to be really
really judiciously time and not too
annoying yeah let's hope let's hope dan
go ahead yeah I totally agree with that
I think it has to be opt-in it has to be
value adding to your particular
situation but I do think it's possible
to engineer that okay are you do get
like little hot toddy advertisements
when you're out on the slopes on your
product not yet but who knows would make
them all right so now if if a listener
or viewer of the show wants to
experiment with this very cool
technology they can of course be a skier
or snowboarder and by the recon
instruments products how much does it
cost to get set up to get this kind of
augmented reality for your products then
we've got the two versions at 299 and
399 for the module and then there's a
wide variety of goggles that you can
choose from at different price points
ranging from sort of hundred to two
hundred dollars all right now for the
different partner brands for the full
boat version for the four hundred the
three hundred ninety nine dollar version
of the recon instruments thing what
information do I get when I'm on the
slopes you get well a lot of information
all the standard GPS and from the
navigation so all the resort maps in the
world are already pre-loaded in there
you get body tracking connection to your
smartphone so you get text messages and
caller ID and playlists heads up and and
jump airtime is another app that we we
have so that this guy is really the
limit here and then obviously with the
smart phone connectivity you get access
to all those apps as well because we
have an open SDK so the community the
communities can just develop an app for
our system if it isn't already there
that sounds so cool i have just I just
editorial comment that's cool now Martin
when are we going to get this stuff from
google for the rest of our lives row for
walking around what's google telling us
Google's not saying people are
speculating this and that I mean they I
guess what's significant is that they
thought it was
advanced enough that they shared what
they're actually doing so does Google do
that you know year before the release
products two years I mean it's it's kind
of hard to say but I think I think I
think what we'll probably see is a
product and a certain set of services
now obviously voice is going to be
really important to this so you know
that's got to be cooked and it's kind of
like apples doing with Syria does a
couple things and it does it well and I
think it's google smart about it they'll
they'll take a similar approach so
instead of having everything that that
guy did in the video maybe it'll be a
few maybe look a couple location
services or I'm not really sure but my
suspicion is that belt now it'll take a
while for this stuff to actually develop
what else is going on in the labs that
we know about over in Google skunk works
like it that was one of the interesting
things that came out of this this little
news cycle is that Google fessed up to
Google Labs Google X labs which until
now has been secretive and they haven't
as far as though they haven't even
acknowledged it exists but they they
have it's far off stuff so one of the
products you mentioned earlier is the
driverless car which google has actually
been doing for several years and making
real progress on and a few other things
that have that have are you know so
rumored our web of things where you know
devices in your home we're all connected
to the internet and could be controlled
remotely that sort of thing one of the
guys who worked on the driver's car and
worked on on this project glass is an
expert in robotics and machine learning
and artificial intelligence so um you
know those some of the hints as to what
they're working on just kind of more
like you know the cyborg you know and
giving up the Machine off in the sky
artificial intelligence doing more and
more things and I think this whole
Internet of Things business interest
Google as well Martin we're counting on
you to tell us when the Google BOTS are
going to be marching down our streets
like an automation so keep on the on the
keep on it there oh do my best thanks
for your time
dan is CEO of recon instruments hey has
google approached you about this
technology by any chance uh I don't have
any comments there okay I didn't think
it would I had to ask dan thanks so much
for your time dan eisenhardt again is
the CEO of recon instruments you can buy
this augmented reality stuff right now
if you are a winter sports fan Marta
Monica is a writer for us over at cnet
news gentlemen thank you very much for
your time we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
