joined by senior writer daniel Terdiman
and just a few months ago Daniel wrote a
fascinating story about this kid who was
squatting yes squatting at AOL let's
start from the beginning Daniel how did
you find out about this kid I was in a
meeting with a VC down in Silicon Valley
and the CEO that the pc was meeting with
knew the kid and had put him up as an it
for an internship at the VC firm and he
just was like you know I do you remember
that kid that i told you about who was
living at a well then they went on in
their conversation and i was like hey
that sounds interesting and so i
contacted the CEO after that meeting and
like hey do you think you'd be willing
to introduce me to the to the kid and I
didn't really think it would go far
because it seemed like something that
they wouldn't want to talk about sure
but the kid was actually kind of trying
to raise money and he was interested in
publicity so he talked to me and told me
his story and it was you know it was a
lot of fun no briefly I give us his
story how many months was he's living at
AOL and it was two months that he was
there and this wasn't a wells Palo Alto
headquarter not headquarters but their
offices in palo alto and he had he had
been part of an incubator that was in
the building so he had a basically a
badge that you know let him in and out
of the building in here he just decided
would be sort of like a personal
challenge to to stay there and get by as
little money as he could and so he found
some couches that he could hide on at
night so he basically work all day was
really doing real work building his his
company and he'd just worked these long
hours and then when everybody else would
leave the building he'd like go to his
couch and spend the night and he was
eating the food in their kitchens and
showering at the gym i think i read and
it kept his stuff in the lockers in the
gym and so I mean he got away with it
for a couple months until finally they
caught him that's pretty incredible and
when we say kid he's really what in his
20s it was I think he was I think it was
19 or 21 what had happened and what's he
doing now I mean he obviously was found
out so he's no longer able to squat
there yeah I mean he was trying to build
this startup as an education business I
think he raised a little bit of money
enough money to get an actual house to
live in and so you know last time I
talked to him he was trying to raise
maybe like a half
million dollars to you know keep the
business going and that hasn't happened
yet as far as I know but you know he's a
he's a you know an entrepreneur with
moxie so he's you know I think a lot of
people were you know watching him and
seeing what he was up to absolutely that
kind of tenacity has got to be rewarded
at some point all right fascinating we
look forward to the update when you hear
more from Eric great thank you senior
