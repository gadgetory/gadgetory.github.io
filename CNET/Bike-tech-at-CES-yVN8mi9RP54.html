I could navigate circumvent crazy you're
locking traffic here for the show
by using a bike instead of car and fast
Vegas had other ideas even though the
forecast that would be sunny the entire
week I was here it's been raining in the
desert non-stop all day I had hoped
exhibitors would let me test out their
bikes in the wild but I ended up with a
low-tech bike rental it's only
technology was a backlight with two
settings on and off even in the rain
I did get some biking in on my first day
and I tried some great bike tech to the
small circle fully electric bike has a
crazy transforming design that folds
down to about 19 inches
Seattle cycles unveiled a pedal assist
ebike that can fold down small enough to
store under a desk but is steady enough
to bike hands-free electron wheel can
electrify the bike you already have by
swapping in a front wheel with a
wireless electric hub and perhaps my
personal favorite the fire 5 bike light
from a cine powers itself from the
vibrations of your regular riding the
rain eventually washed out my plans like
a second day in Vegas but there's always
next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
