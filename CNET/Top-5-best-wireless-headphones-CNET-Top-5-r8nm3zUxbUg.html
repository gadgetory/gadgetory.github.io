headphones I'm a fan of wireless
headphones mostly because I'm a spaz who
used to get his wired headphones caught
on everything humanly possible anyway I
talked with the man with the golden
eardrums
CNET editor David Carr annoy that come
up with the five best wireless
headphones you can get at number five is
the beats X there are a lot of options
for number five but after a lot of
discussions the beats X got the nod at
number five they have a richer sound
than Apple's air pods and pair instantly
to Apple devices like an iPhone the
beats X lasts around eight hours on a
charge and they're pretty comfortable
number four is a Plantronics backbeat
pro to the design of the backbeat pro 2
is a little on the boring side however
it's a very good value the backbeat pro
2 has lots of features like pausing your
music when you remove them from your
ears in a pinch you can even use a
headphone cable to make them work like
normal wired headphones plus since the
Plantronics it's a good headset for
calls too number three is a sony MDR
1000x noise cancellation feature check
wire option sure but the center part the
MDR 1000x sony has a couple of other
features including the ability to muffle
your music by holding your hand over the
right ear tub that will allow you to
hear the outside world take your hand
away and the music kicks back up at our
normal volume coming up at number two is
the Bose sound sport Wireless how about
another in-ear model the Bose sounds for
wireless is very comfortable and they
fit securely these headphones have an
open design which means you'll still be
able to hear the outside world when
you're active outside that might not be
for everybody though and speaking of
activity the Bose sound sport are also
sweat and water resistant and the best
wireless headphones you can get right
now is the Bose QuietComfort 35 all
other noise canceling wireless
headphones are compared to the quiet
comfort 35 because it's the gold
standard at active noise-cancelling
battery life is rated at around 20 hours
like other headphones on this list the
QC 35 also can double as wired
headphones wired or wireless these
headphones also provide X
it's out by the way we plan on doing
some more top fives on headphones based
on price and style in the future you can
check those out of top 5 cnet.com let me
know your favorites i'm matt is and i'll
see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
