edition of what the future today we're
taking a look back at the most WTF
stories of 2018 we've got a lot to cover
so let's get right to it I think most
people would agree watching their kids
take their first steps is both exciting
and terrifying that's probably also how
a lot of people would describe seeing
Sophia the robots first steps at CES
this year she finally got a pair of legs
that let her walk I'll be it slowly 0.6
miles an hour to be exact
now we first saw Sophia in 2016
back then she was just an AI enabled
talking head that gave disturbing
answers to questions okay I will destroy
humans
now since Sophia learned to walk she's
become quite the celebrity
Will Smith tried and failed to seduce
her
I think we can be friends let's hang out
and get to know each other for a little
while you're on my friends list now and
she sang a duet with Jimmy Fallon nassif
EO will be joining us at the C net stage
in a few weeks at CES 2019 in Las Vegas
so don't forget to tune in to our live
coverage for that we talked a lot about
SpaceX in 2018 but nothing grabbed our
attention quite like the first launch of
the Falcon Heavy rocket in February
maybe it was the fact that this was the
largest and most powerful rocket yet
from SpaceX maybe it was seeing both
first-stage boosters return
simultaneously and safely to earth or
maybe it was the pelo Elon Musk's
cherry-red Tesla Roadster complete with
a dummy astronaut named star man
now we haven't heard much about star man
and his ride in a while but last month
SpaceX said they both made it beyond
Mars orbit and what about Falcon Heavy
well we haven't heard much from SpaceX
about that either but parts of its core
have been spotted in transport in
Arizona that's led to speculation that
SpaceX is getting ready to launch Falcon
Heavy again in the near future I can't
help but groan a little every time I
hear about another flying car in the
works but the PAL V Liberty may be the
closest thing we've seen yet mainly
because you can pre-order one right now
we first saw the Liberty at the Geneva
Auto Show in the spring now it's not
really a flying car a la Back to the
Future 2 and despite its appearance it's
not a helicopter it's technically a
gyrocopter that means it can't take off
vertically it needs to get up to speed
on the ground before going airborne and
you do need a pilot's license to fly it
but what it does have going for it is
its size in car mode it fits in a
standard parking spot
and it runs on gasoline now originally
the first units were supposed to be
delivered in 2019 that's been pushed to
2020 starting at $400,000 I'm gonna keep
holding out for a flying DeLorean this
world has a serious plastic problem we
use too much of it and we don't take
care of it when we're finished that's
why there's the ocean cleanup project
it's a massive collection device also
known as Wilson that's trying to clean
up the plastic in our oceans in October
it left the San Francisco Bay Area for
what's known as the Great Pacific
Garbage Patch that's a huge collection
of plastic floating between California
and Hawaii it's estimated to contain
80,000 tons of debris now Wilson arrived
there in November but it hasn't exactly
been smooth sailing so far engineers
have been troubleshooting problems since
they arrived basically the plastic they
collect isn't staying inside the system
but they've said they're confident
they'll get it to work
now it's also worth noting altmetric
named ocean cleanups work mapping the
Great Pacific Garbage Patch one of the
top ten most impactful scientific papers
of the year
all right how do you think we did what
made you say WTF this year let us know
in the comments if you feel like it give
us a like give us a share that's gonna
do it for us this year will be at CES
and 2019 look out for us there
I'm Andy Altman thanks for watching with
the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
