crave and look over there to drum with
the gun
ok all you professional gamers out there
here's a pro tip for anyone trying to
earn coin for playing video games it's
not over till it's over which is the
lesson competitive gamer why she got
after he scored the first / in the
professional game of guilty gear xrd
side against his opponent agawa at the
evolution championship series in Las
Vegas ogawa jumped on the opportunity
and swiftly pummeled what she geeked as
he was up celebrating watch the video
just so smart he couldn't first because
of the super
oh my god
oh my god well she thought it was over
and stood up and ogawa gave him no
remorse how does exactly what happens
don't our celebration papa Oh God take
it it flex Donnell unbelievable flying
car company terrafugia has been hard at
work developing a flying car design
called the tf-x and they are now ready
to take it to the next level us-based
company announced on Monday that the new
design for the tf-x will be tested as a
one-tenth scale model at the MIT Wright
brothers wind tunnel in boston
massachusetts the tf-x is estimated to
take up to 12 years to develop and once
it's available to the public it will not
require a runway instead of will take
off like a helicopter using twin
electric motor pods and will fly itself
with a computer-controlled system that
only requires the pilot or passenger to
input a location and it will fly you
there automatically using a megawatt of
power to lift off the ground the tf-x
has a 200 mile per hour cruising speed
in a range of 500 miles the hybrid car /
airplane will land itself for you but
only when the pilot has decided that it
is safe once on the ground the tf-x
transforms back into a car which looks a
lot like a boat to me and you're able to
cruise around the town in your fancy
flying car boat hybrid thing
okay back to that drone with a gun
mentioned earlier in the show a video
was posted on YouTube earlier this month
of a drone flying in an unidentified
location firing a small firearm four
times the video was posted by youtube
user Hogg wit with the description that
only reads homemade multi-rotor with a
semi-automatic handgun mounted on it the
description continues with the second
sentence note the length of the muzzle
to the rear of the frame is 26 inches
great writer chris Matyszczyk alarmed by
what he saw in the video reached out to
the FAA for comment who wrote back to
the following statement the FAA will
investigate the operation of an unmanned
aircraft system in a Connecticut Park to
determine if any federal aviation
regulations were violated the FAA will
also work with its law enforcement
partners to determine if there were any
violations of criminal statutes
whether you believe in the theory of
evolution or not it is clear that famous
video game characters have been slowly
evolving over the past 30 years in a
search engine company called pick click
is examining this evolution and a
collection of videos called the
evolution of Nintendo characters in the
videos we can watch Mario change from a
pixelated blocky blob into a slick
expressive HD avatar pic click was nice
enough to give cnet a first look at
Mario link from The Legend of Zelda and
Donkey Kong
