Thursday March 22nd 2012 I'm Jeff
Bakalar from cnet.com and it is time to
get loaded mobile social gaming giant
Zynga has acquired the company behind
the insanely popular game Draw Something
for a reported 180 million dollars plus
30 million dollars in employee retention
the irritatingly named OMG pop studio
will join the zynga family which puts
out titles like words with friends and
farmville now are you ready for this
hours apple rumor according to a report
from Reuters the next iPhone will boast
a 4.6 inch Retina display which is of
course more than an inch bigger than the
current screen on the 4s however Mac
enthusiast site macrumors still thinks
that a 4-inch screen is much more likely
so is Google rethinking its Google
Wallet strategy according to Bloomberg
the company is eyeing changes to improve
its mobile payment system due to slow
adoption and push back from some
carriers Google on the app that makes
your phone your wallet
Google is considering sharing wallet
revenue with carriers like Verizon and
AT&amp;amp;T in order to get them to endorse the
technology even though it sounds like
those companies are readying their own
competing systems a new verizon study
suggests that 2011 was in fact the year
of the activist and vigilante groups
like anonymous with more than 100
million users data being breached
hacktivists make their present felt more
worldwide in 2011 than financial
criminals that usually heavily
outweighed incidents like data breaches
and finally we're following up on the
ongoing controversial Mass Effect 3
ending gate saga this war has brought
you here today the next few hours will
decide the fate everyone in the galaxy
there will be no second chances and no
room for mistakes one way or another
this war ends today
the company's developer Bioware says
that they're actually considering giving
in to players complaints and will offer
some sort of downloadable content that
would according to the company's
co-founder help answer questions so if
this is how it's going to work now I'm
actually going to go call up Robert
Zemeckis because i don't like out back
to the future three ended i'll see how
that works out those are your headlines
for today i'm jeff bakalar for cnet com
