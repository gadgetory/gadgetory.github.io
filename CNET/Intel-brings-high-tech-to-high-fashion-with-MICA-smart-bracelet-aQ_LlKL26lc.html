frontier of wearable technology and that
means merging the worlds of high tech
with high fashion I'm Bridget Carey with
an early look at the meekest smart
bracelet we're getting a preview of this
during New York Fashion Week where it's
being shown off every year it seems
there's a new wearable tech hitting the
runway for fashion shows and Miko was
created in partnership with a fashion
company called opening ceremony mica
stands for my intelligent communication
accessory and this was designed more for
high-end fashionistas than for the
hoodie and sneakers wearing techie so
first let's go over the tech inside this
bangle has features that are similar to
some smartwatches it has a curved
sapphire touchscreen display on the
wrist so it faces you to show
notifications and alerts and that
includes text messages calendar
reminders and meeting alerts it doesn't
require you to sync this with a smart
phone because there's a 3G cellular
radio inside so you would need to
connect it to a data plan and that means
it has its own phone number that you
would text to see a message on this you
can charge it wirelessly or you can
connect it to a USB cable and the port
is inside the clasp now let's talk about
the fashion side this one comes in white
snakeskin with Tigers Eye from South
Africa and obsidian from Russia but
there's also a black version with black
snakeskin pearls from China and lapis
stones from Madagascar so if this wasn't
obvious already this is a luxury item
and it's going to be sold at Barneys New
York for around $1,000 although no price
has been officially set yet it'll go on
sale in time for holiday shopping
looking fabulously techy for seeing that
