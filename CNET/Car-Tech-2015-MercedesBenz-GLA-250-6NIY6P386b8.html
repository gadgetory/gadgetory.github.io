from small to large but in the US we're
really just used to the big luxury
barges can the 2015 GLA 250 convince
Americans the mercedes-benz can go small
I really like the design of this car I
think it looks great from the outside
and it's got practical interior space as
well it's got room for about five people
it's got cargo space it's kind of like a
hatchback but raised up a bit higher
driving position and it also comes with
all-wheel-drive and that helps a lot
there is an option that we have in this
one it's that called pop bar wood trim
it feels a little bit plasticky to me
but according to the spec sheet it's
real wood we also have a panoramic
sunroof a big opening in front a smaller
opening in the rear for the rear
passengers and the front opening opens
all the way so that's kind of nice to
get a lot of fresh air in the car for
cabin tech we've got the standard
mercedes-benz command interface so I've
got this dial on the console with a back
button in the Clear button some buttons
on the dashboard here for quick access
to functions so I've got my audio I've
got my hands-free phone system but what
I don't have here is navigation because
that option comes in a package that
costs two thousand four hundred eighty
dollars but to get that option actually
need another package is the Premium
Package which costs $2,300 that's almost
five thousand dollars for navigation
also in this car I only have the base
audio system I can upgrade to a Harman
Kardon logic seven system this GLA 250
also has the driver assist package to
say these Benz
does this stuff really well so for
example I have adaptive cruise control
that will actually match the speed of
slower traffic ahead of me that's
something mercedes-benz almost invented
we've got Lane Keeping Assist in here
which old steering wheel keep the car in
its lane bridging towards economist when
you put those two things together I
don't have a rear-view camera on here
but what I do have is automated parking
assist so that can almost take the place
of them
the GLA 250 comes with a 2-liter
four-cylinder engine but that's what
direct injection and turbo charging 208
horsepower
258 pound-feet of torque and that engine
is mated to a 7-speed dual-clutch
transmission that's a type of
transmission that uses
computer-controlled clutches to shift a
lot faster a lot more direct than a
torque converter transmission there's a
button on the console here and that will
let me change between a sport mode and
eco mode and a manual mode now this
engine will get this car according to
the EPA 24 miles per gallon city 32
miles rail and highway those are pretty
piece of numbers that we can average
around 30 and it's also got an idle stop
features it'll actually shut down the
engine and I found that system works
pretty well I've been driving around
with it in San Francisco and it hasn't
really gotten in the way of my driving
but I can turn off that system with a
button on the dashboard with mercedes
benz 4matic all-wheel drive system now
in this case this is really a front
wheel drive bias system but when I get
slippery patches it can actually put up
to 50% torque to the rear wheels that's
for the ride quality I think that's one
area where mercedes-benz falls down a
bit with this car and I haven't really
seen mercedes-benz do a good comfortable
ride in a small car yet and it certainly
isn't up to the standards set by rivals
BMW and Audi and their smaller cars
let's price out our 2015 mercedes-benz
GLA 250 base price thirty three thousand
three hundred dollars to get navigation
we have to add the technology package
that costs two thousand four hundred
eighty dollars but to get that we have
to have the premium package for another
twenty three hundred dollars that's
almost five thousand dollars for
navigation driver assist package cost
$2,500 and that cool parking assist
feature cost nine hundred and seventy
dollars with destination that puts our
total price at forty two thousand nine
hundred and fifty five dollars so I
quite like the looks in the practicality
and the general driving character of the
GLA 250 one thing I don't like is the
ride quality that's something that
mercedes-benz just can't seem to get
right in their smaller cars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
