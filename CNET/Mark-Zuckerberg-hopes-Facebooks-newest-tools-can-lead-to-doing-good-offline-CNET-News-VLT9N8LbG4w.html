a difference for as long as these tools
have existed usually they do this
without talking to us but it's a good
reminder that a lot of the best things
that happen aren't because some Engineer
in California started building something
but they start with someone somewhere
who has an idea and is passionate about
it and does what they need to do to make
it real so take one raising four causes
for example you know we're not when I
started Facebook I wasn't thinking about
it as a way to raise money to fight
disease but you know a few years then we
started noticing that people were using
it to raise money for a lot of different
causes including raising money to for
healthcare costs for a friend and for
people halfway around the world we start
talking to experts in the area and we
started building some AI tools that can
flag for our team and then flag for
first responders when people are posting
on Facebook or expressing thoughts about
suicide or self-harm so we can help get
them the help that they need quicker and
in the first month alone or in the last
month
Sariah since we launched this in the US
these tools have helped first responders
reach out and help more than a hundred
people who needed that support quickly
you know Facebook has has mostly focused
on helping connect us with people we
already know but I think it may be just
as important to help connect people with
with people outside of their social
circle to provide a new source of
support and inspiration so that's why
we're starting today to test Facebook
mentorship and support so it's a new
tool that combines the expertise of
nonprofits with the community of
Facebook to help connect people who who
have the shared experiences and share
goals but who don't know each other yet
and there's no doubt that that we live
in a challenging time right now but one
of the things that strikes me so much is
the deep sense of optimism that you all
have or this belief that even in the
face of real challenges or disease
poverty hunger that every one of us can
make a difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
