now we've got three different phones
we've got the play the g7 and the
brand-new g7 power let's talk about
what's the same on all three at this
point they all run Android 9 which is
the latest version of Android they all
come with a Snapdragon 632 processor but
they vary in lots of different ways it's
left with the g7 first and they will
talk about what makes them different
the g7 this year costs $299 because in a
new mid-range and the power mode let's
talk about the g7 a little bit more
you've got the small notch on the top a
very modern design with a 19 by 9 aspect
ratio two cameras on the back and you
can actually do portrait mode with the
two cameras or on the front camera
through software
each of these Motorola devices has the
ability to do portrait mode some can do
with the dual camera some can do it
software and that's a really good
feature to have when it comes to a nice
budget phone Sarah looks happy
also new on the g7 is a new auto smile
capture mode so if you have a subject
and they're smiling and standing still
the phone will automatically take a
picture of that person if you have
multiple people it'll wait for all of
them it also works on the selfie cam
that camera feature is not available on
the 7 power or the 7 play the g7 series
has a brand new camera trick it's called
hyperlapse it's a video time-lapse
feature that stabilizes everything for
you as you're running around it looks
pretty cool so playing around with the
g7 it's really zippy it doesn't feel
like a budget phone in any way that
build quality is quite good there's
glass on the back the glass on the back
does not allow wireless charging none of
these devices have wireless charging but
at that price point I don't know if
anyone's going to worry about it
you've got USB C on the bottom and you
have a headphone jack which is a very
nice feature to have in 2019 what an
idea motor ball has all been quite good
about keeping their version of Android
quite light you're not gonna have a ton
of skinning on this please feel like an
actual stock Android for the most part
there are some nice flourishes thanks to
Motorola Google photos is the stock app
for photos on this the Moto g7 has four
gigabytes of RAM and inside you're gonna
get 64 gigabytes of storage I guess that
means we should talk about the other g7
in my left hand is the g7 in my right
hand is the g7 power like I said this is
brand new for this year they actually
have the same screen size at 6.2 inches
but the g7 powers a little taller also
the screen res on the g7 power is a
little lower than the g7 so g7 powers
actually the $249 model it's the
mid-range of the g7 series on the back
you've got one camera you've got the
fingerprint sensor and the back is not
Gorilla Glass it's a polymer glass on
the top you have the headphone jack not
on the bottom that's fine it's got some
bigger chins because of the larger five
thousand milliamp hour battery that
Motorola claims will give you three days
of battery life that's insane they also
say that if you charge us for 15 minutes
you'll get nine hours of battery life
that
pretty impressive this thing has three
gigabytes of RAM it has 32 gigabytes of
storage again it's a $249 model now in
my hand I've got the Moto G 7 play now
this is the least expensive model at
$1.99 on the back there's no glass
that's okay you've got a fingerprint
sensor a single camera on the back
headphone jack on the top and you've got
a USB port on the bottom USB see it's
got the same processor as the other
models with two gigabytes of RAM it also
had 32 gigabytes of storage on board all
three of these can be expanded with a
micro SD card to up to 512 gigabytes of
storage
thanks to microsd expandable 'ti the
build quality on the g7 play you know
it's $1.99 so it feels pretty good I
would say if I compare this to any
device I've ever held think of the
Samsung Galaxy s3 you know that really
old phone calling I'm kind of a plasticy
back and it's got a decent fun this is
not bad from $1.99 in the limited time
I've got to use beefy devices they're
running the Snapdragon sticks to the two
processors and will say everything felt
very zippy things were responsive the
screens feel good they look good now
again these aren't the highest res
devices and unless you're doing VR
you're probably not gonna notice it so
if it's right here you might see pixels
but I don't know who does that maybe you
do it that's weird
the new Moto G sevens will be around in
the spring in North America but here's
the thing there's actually one more that
won't be available in North America is
called the Moto G 7 plus it's got a
slightly faster processor and we'll
cover that in a different video
stay tuned has seen that for a full
review of each of these phones coming up
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
