coming to Windows 10 this fall that
allows you to view 3d content through
your screen kind of like a magic window
we call this new feature view mixed
reality now this feature is not only
available in what amy is showing today
but it's going to be available in a wide
range of experiences okay so Amy I'm
five-eleven how big is the curiosity
let's find out you could head towards
the back of the state okay I'm going to
drop the rover right next to you like
about here perfect okay okay here we go
yep nice let's capture this yeah
at seven feet tall and nearly 2,000
pounds it's pretty unbelievable that
we've landed this on Mars with view
mixed reality we can bring this Rover
that was over 250 million miles away
right into the classroom giving us this
is this unique perspective to understand
the curiosity scale and size and the
relation to the world around us in this
case me now here's the good news
all of this can be done on any classroom
Windows 10 PC that just has a simple RGB
camera even a plugged in webcam will
work and it's free so we just saw some
examples of how we could simplify the
complex using mixed reality but let's
pivot and see how we can learn through
experience now field trips are a great
way to enable experiential learning but
not all schools can offer as many field
trips as they would like but with
Windows mixed reality devices we can
bring those field trips right into the
classroom now Amy's going to be using
one of these new affordable headsets to
take us on a trip into the future far
far away guess where we're going yep
we're going to explore space
I'm looking at the solar system in a way
that used to be impossible in textbooks
the eight planets are usually shown in a
straight line but in this immersive view
I can actually move around and get a
sense for how they're spread across
space now these types of applications
can be really rich for self-guided
learning not only can Amy explore our
solar system but she can travel through
time and into this case into the future
where the year is twenty four ninety two
now this will be the next time that the
eight major planets are in closest
proximity to one another the last time
has happened was about a thousand years
ago
zooming in I can see how the planets
will look when they're grouped closer
together 500 years from now
what a cool way to learn about space
it's this type of immersive education
that can enable any student to explore
the world or even the galaxy without
even leaving the classroom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
