Ford Evo's concept which came out before
this Frankfurt Show but I'm getting my
first look at it here is that it's a
different face for a Ford vehicle and
jamei is the design boss of Ford says
remember that face it's going to be
coming out in a production car soon in
fact that Detroit he says they'll roll
out a new Ford of some model that's
gonna look like this in general the new
corporate identity could be a new Ford
Fusion it's due for a redraw but we'll
see now obviously you've got some show
car stuff going on here it's not gonna
go to production these gold wing doors
are nothing more than a good way to get
wet on a rainy day but what we're having
here is a new look for Ford that it's
not a complete redo but a significant
shift as they say let's go take a peek
inside at some of the tech and the stuff
you have to visualize in terms of
technology this is a mock-up dashboard
it's really interesting it's kind of a
neural ecosystem vehicle so for example
if it's part of the same cloud the rest
of your life is as you pull away from
the house this thing could automatically
set the alarm or turn down the HVAC
those tedious things you've got to do
manually every day let's say you're
driving home from work you got some cool
tune jamming on the stereo you get out
you walk into the house it automatically
segues that play back on whatever cloud
service you're using over to your home
audio system it could also have some
kind of sort of connection to your daily
routines to know what kind of efficiency
mode it should be in maybe have itself
all ready to drive normally in the
morning cuz it knows that you don't step
on it they're in traffic but on the
weekends maybe it knows automatically to
put itself in more of a sport mode these
are all just some of the ideas you can
do with a cloud oriented car and Ford's
been talking about that for a couple of
years I also like to get away from me
design here big old divider between you
and the passenger this is my car you're
just lucky to get a ride in it now that
evos has envisioned as being a plug-in
hybrid and it's not coming to market
anyway so who really cares about the
specifics but this I do care about look
at this little guy what is that maybe 13
inches front to rear this little guys a
free cylinder EcoBoost 1 liter motor
EcoBoost and Ford Talk means
turbocharger and direct injection
you can look inside there see those
little tiny pistons and a whole bunch of
counterweights you got to have to make a
three cylinder not vibrate itself to
pieces but this Tilly feels like a
hundred and eighteen horsepower in a
tiny package which of course will be
fuel-efficient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
