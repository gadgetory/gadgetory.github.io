extraordinaire dan ackerman who covers
basically all things mac all things
laptop across the industry and also the
author of the tetris effect mr. dan
ackerman thanks for coming in great to
be here and that that plug for your book
was was delivered and we'll talk about
that a little later but what everyone
wants to talk about really is the new
MacBook Pros with the touch bars and I
guess also without you've had a chance
to spend extensive time on it and we
really want to just get your in-depth
you know feel review what what is what
is the overall take on these guys first
of all I mean these are brand new
macbook pros you know I admit they may
look very similar to the ones that were
placing but when we first got our
exclusive early hands-on access to them
several days before they were actually
announced the thing that struck me the
most when we when they first pull the
little cloth off them at apples
Cupertino headquarters was that they're
much more different than I expected
literally everything about them is
different the actual size of them the
keyboard is different the screen is a
little bit different the touchpad is
very different the connections are
different and obviously the fact that
yet this touch bar is different and the
components are different is it different
for good or you've been with it now
again your first impression are these
differences better or is it take a step
back or maybe in different areas they
work to its advantage and disadvantage
in general it's a pretty sizable step
forward if in part because the macbook
pro line hasn't really had a serious
redesign in about four years so bringing
them up to modern standards duh duh does
feel like a big jump now there are a
couple of areas uh where is it's awesome
the touch bar is really cool the giant
trackpad that you know the time the pads
on them are twice as big as they were on
the previous models that's awesome
screens brighter obviously thinner
lighter those are all pluses there are a
couple of changes that you may have more
mixed feelings about the primary one of
course being they got rid of every port
except for these USB type-c port switch
are now for power for everything uh you
know so no more mac safe even you have
to just use USB see for that
did keep the headphone jack that
survived this round of cuts see what
happens next I've apple doesn't hate
headphone jacks and everything just in
in the phones uh and the other thing
that's a little more subtle is they've
changed the keyboard it's much closer to
the very flat keyboard on the 12 inch
macbook they call that a butterfly found
mechanism because if that's how the keys
go down is like a butterfly under people
that people that are listening and can't
see you I'm just gonna pretend that his
hands moved into butterfly make like a
butterfly like a fly in the sky so it's
not quite as it's not quite as flat as
the one on the 12 inch macbook but it
takes some getting used to and frankly
if you're like an all-day everyday type
is you may never love it so Dan I want
to kind of break down some of those
individual things you talked about
because they're there is really a lot to
talk about the touch bar when I first
saw it I was like I think I'll use it
for some things not for everything and I
really don't know how people are going
to use it you are no matter what going
to be forced to use it because it has
some of those you know mein general
functions like volume and and brightness
on it just from a day-to-day thing but
what was really your overall take on the
touch bar yeah I'll show to you real
fast right here I've got the 15 inch
right here and here's the touch bar and
you can see it right above the keyboard
so it's sort of like in in this case
it's monochromatic so it doesn't really
jump out at you it replaces the function
keys and frankly the function keys were
replaced many many years ago and made
you know brightness and contrast and
muting and and reloading and things like
that rather than what they originally
for which was basically some terminal
commands that nobody uses them for so
why would we keep these old keys label
f1 f2 and you know that doesn't even
mean anything uh so I get that by
default it does a lot of the same thing
so you can tap on the volume button and
the brightness button um and things like
that you don't get that tactile feedback
you get from clicking the button so it's
more of a look than to do it by feel at
least until maybe you memorize exactly
where on on the keyboard it is but the
thing that it does really nicely is it
adapts to what you're doing so if you
launch Safari you get a different set of
buttons on there if you launch itunes or
photos or messages or any other apple
app you get a different set of buttons
right now
it's it's apple apps later Photoshop
will come in other apps for now it's all
apple stuff so if we don't use those
it's not going to be as useful but I do
like how it adapts like if I'm in safari
and I have a bunch of tabs open it shows
me little tiny thumbnails of all the
tabs and I can just tap on them to
switch between them instead of mousing
up and clicking on the tabs in the
browser on my screen did you find it
made overall did it make the experience
more efficient less efficient or
sometimes better sometimes not helpful
what did you find out I think you've
nailed it exactly right there it's about
efficiency it's not gonna like knock
your socks off and change your life it
shaves a couple of keystrokes off here
and there and frankly that actually
counts for a lot sometimes like if you
want to open if you want to go to the
address bar in Safari what do you
command l and then then you type it in
here in the touch bar you just tap the
touch bar and then you're right in the
address bar so you went from two taps to
one that may not sound like a lot but I
started doing that immediately and I
never look back tinctly you pick up a
couple of these little shortcuts and you
go oh that's awesome and then you just
you're just doing it like that and then
that's kind of what we've seen in the
past from Apple right it's it's really
that's why I was curious about your
experience it's it's coming down to
changing your behavior and is the
experience good enough to change your
behavior and from what you're telling me
it is I think any time you give somebody
you know a set of keyboard commands or a
set of mouse clicks and you can find a
way to shave a couple off that you're
going to naturally your brain will
gravitate towards the easier way to do
it and this fun fun fun stuff too like
in messages which everybody uses because
it ties into the messages on your phone
there's just a big control strip of
emojis so I know you like that San
Ackerman oh you like the load is Dan
junior likes that because he sends me
dozens or hundreds of freaking emojis
every day on his mother's phone is INF
and daddy emojis I can never get
anything done they just keep popping up
on my screen just like no words just
emojis guns i think that sounds like all
of our lives quite honestly whether you
have children or not it's our favorite
form of nonverbal communication now
better than ever also the trackpad is
you seem to point that out specifically
because of its larger size how did that
make using the macbook
better for you or if we're there any
drawbacks as well I'd like to hear both
sides of the coin yeah according to
Apple at least what they want you to do
is rather than having a touchscreen on
the on the screen itself where your hand
could cover it up and get in the way
that's how they feel windows touchscreen
laptops work your hand is always in the
way they have the touch bar on top and
they have the big touchpad below it and
they envision you sort of combining
those two to form a sort of you know
secondary screen experienced it's not a
touchscreen but is kind of close because
that's what this really is it's a whole
it's a second display built into your
laptop it's just a really skinny one I
will say it's an OLED display which is
that kind of screen we find in the you
know highest NTV so it looks pretty
awesome does the actual OLED touch bar
quality-wise actually look better than
the actual screen like does it shine
bright like what do you think it's
bright it's it's when it has colors on
it the colors really pop it doesn't do
enough graphically for you to really say
oh I'd watch a movie on this if it was a
little bit bigger but the screen itself
the screen itself is perfectly fine it's
it's the same resolution as a previous
macbook pro which is the retina higher
res not quite 4k but better than full HD
however it's apple sense of 25% brighter
and it is definitely brighter and they
say it has a wider color range on that's
again playing catch-up because so many
windows a high-end Windows computers are
now adding higher resolution screens up
to 4k and a lot of them were doing you
know p 3 color and srgb and just these
wider color gamuts so in some sense it's
catch up but in another sense it's the
macbook is such is so predominant
especially including the creative
industries it's almost like the entry
isn't really there until Apple does it
um you hit upon two things that I wanted
to follow up with that you touch you
touched upon the touchscreen that what
is your take we know what apple says and
what Apple wants to do you've pinnix you
been around surface devices from the
beginning do you wish Apple actually
incorporates on this and I know it
requires them to actually have a
different OS to support this but does it
still feel like they're a little behind
or it's okay it's a weird philosophical
question and you're exactly right when
when you say is this
Mac OS need a touchscreen as it is or do
they need a new operating system that is
a touchscreen one I feel on a Windows
computer it kind of do need a touch
screen at least to get like a really
good smooth experience but is that
because we've trained ourselves to be
touched people with phones and tablets
and other devices so we just naturally
want to touch everything or is it
because um Windows is just so naturally
clunky especially in Windows 8 which we
just replaced that you just needed that
touchscreen to just swipe stuff in
easily without going through you know
all the different windows menus uh
that's an interesting philosophical
question I'm not sure we have an answer
to it apple says they don't see
combining you know the touchscreen stuff
the phones of the tablets with the
computer stuff anytime in the near to
medium future which i think they call
out is you have 10 15 20 years for them
at least for now those are resolute Lee
separate this is however one way of
adding touchscreen to a laptop without
making it a touchscreen laptop but what
do you think personally like what do you
what do you cuz look you have kids right
I have nieces and nephews they touch
everything it's like ingrained in just
how we're interacting with anything with
a screen so I'm just curious what do you
think personally like do you do you want
to see something like that or is it
important or is it not important I mean
that's exactly right and it is about
your I say it's all about the children
which I'm just completely true every
little kid I know they see a macbook
they run up and they start touching the
screen right away I occasionally find
myself just going oh yeah we scroll down
this object doesn't work uh you know
dinosaurs like myself we can still
handle a non-touch computer but once
once my generation has has passed from
the earth the young people will demand
touching everything and and they won't
be wrong you'll be too busy talking in
emojis only a no actual language so we
won't be able to understand them but
they will demand touch in some picture
picture pictogram form yeah again we'll
see how it plays out and it is really a
philosophical thing and I think even our
viewers and listeners and tech fans some
lean on one side versus the other as
well you hear a lot of people lean
towards oh just give me a Mac
touchscreen I mean I feel that way
because I only
can imagine oh if you give me this
windows experience but with the Mac
flavor that oh man that would just be
like amazing but we'll see how that
happens you also touch upon creatives
and this is one of those debates that
initially came out the macbook pro isn't
really more for a consumer we know
creatives will still stick with the mac
platform for now but a lot of creatives
were bemoaning the lack of the ports now
we gotta go dongle we gotta go full
dongle now where it may not necessarily
be the most powerful you know raw power
machine this the solid state drives are
extremely fast but as a creative are
they kind of is could this be a point
where they're actually at least
considering transitioning to a different
platform not yet doing it but seriously
considering it based on what they've
seen oh well you're right Brian you you
never go full dongle everybody knows
never go full never never uh you always
hear complaints about every new you know
Mac line or Mac product especially from
the creative people who make up such a
huge chunk of that audience and you know
what they're the ones paying these very
high prices for these devices so you
know you should definitely listen to
what they have to say that said I had an
artist in here the other day demoing
some other hardware and he said you know
this windows thing I'm trying out this
is really cool but I've been so invested
in in in the mat in the Mac ecosystem
for you know ten plus years I'm not just
gonna switch just because something else
has a cool feature that this doesn't
have it's more of a it's more of a
holistic approach uh so I don't think
they're gonna lose those guys uh you
know in the near future the USBC and
down low thing is annoying I really find
myself plugging anything into a laptop
anymore they did lower the price on
those dongles it's not an excuse but
it's something it's a six bucks dan save
six bucks that's right that's right and
they want you to plug into like these
special USBC connected monitors from LG
that are very expensive uh it's i'll
give him credit for one thing it's not
proprietary you know USB seasoning you
seen a lot of new high-end Windows
laptops as well at least they didn't go
some weird proprietary plug that only
they can make okay another practical
question we know that the iphone can
sync wirelessly to your computer but is
it just curious that you can't
basically unless you have a dongle
connect your phone to your actual laptop
I know people still do that not everyone
but there's still a good amount of
people that just do that add that that
wasn't that that's true and i think i
have a a lightning to USB see dongle
sitting around somewhere because maybe
those will become more commonplace I I
personally don't do the phone to
computer connection it just doesn't you
know and anything for me and iTunes just
gets all weird as it does you know for
everyone yep people are going to
complain about this for a long time and
people are going to complain about not
having a headphone jack in the iphone 7
you know for a long time maybe they'll
retrench maybe they'll add a a regular
USB back but that USB type a that
everybody uses it's it's a great it was
a great invention 20 years ago I think
it's literally just about at its 20th
anniversary I asked last year for cnet
magazine I wrote a story about us bc and
its evolution and I asked Ajay Bhatt
from Intel who is one of the inventors
of the USB spec 20 years ago I said when
you take that plug and you plug it in
what is your lifetime percentage mr.
inventor of USB unplugging that plug in
the right way and not having to go oh I
got to turn it over and and go like this
and he said to me all earnestly says she
said well I guess about fifty percent
and I said that cannot be true I have a
0% lifetime batting average of this
therefore no one even gets close to
fifty percent there's something about it
every time it just goes it just goes the
wrong way god bless us bc there was no
wrong way there is there is no wrong way
with USB see it so overall how do you /
how do you view this laptop you know we
note that the reviews are out now what's
your kind of closing statement about it
who's it for and who it will appeal to I
mean they're awesome laptops they're
definitely a big step forward in terms
of design in terms of power the touch
bar is very cool it's a one it's not I
have I think a lot of people are going
to go for this guy have right here in my
hand the 13 a 13-inch model without the
touch bar so it still got the
traditional function kero and that is
the entry level model in a sense that is
1499 which is still kind of expensive
it's basically the previous entry level
13 inch pro with double the hard drive
storage so that that's why it's 1499 if
you want that touch bar then that jumps
up to seventeen ninety nine which is
bonkers for through concertinas lots of
nice but I you know Wow and then this 15
inch guy this is awesome don't get me
wrong it's got every 15 inch now has
discrete AMD graphics in it it's got
that huge screen again it they all have
the touch bar they all have quad-core 16
Intel Core I processors so you know
awesome stuff all around that 15 inch
starts at 2399 V and look I know you're
saying this right you know what what is
competitive from a price point in the
mark in the landscape of the market you
personally are you able to comment on
what would you actually whether you're
in the market to upgrade or not would
you personally buy this macbook right
now or is the price a little like you
know the thing that really makes people
invest more of these macbooks and i
totally understand this is if i buy this
you know aluminum unibody 1500 our
macbook i could actually get away with
using it for 45 years and it'll still
pretty much work it's tough to say that
about even other brand premium laptops
that you're going to be able to use it
as your work machine for five or more
years so I so I understand that
especially because if you need it
serviced the apple store you know what
they do a pretty good job especially if
you have applecare they're very they're
not gonna leave you're totally in the
lurch I i I've had very good experiences
they are just walking and cold when you
have a premium laptop from another
company you may pay 700 hours less for
go back in three years and try to get
them to service it and like we don't
even make these anymore what is that you
know I think that's a great point that
people don't think about just the
longevity of the machine sometimes
because also some people are in that
brain that mind space of like I'll just
buy it for a year or two and then I'll
sell it on eBay when the next one comes
out right we're around that that quote
unquote tech person is kind of like that
but not everyone is like that right this
is a machine that they want three four
or five years so that's a great point
also one thing that stuck out when I saw
the new macbook pros I honestly you know
when we watched the keynote we couldn't
really tell but there
they're really thin you know compared to
they just look so much thinner do you so
do you feel that Apple really kind of
made more of our priority to make this a
thinner machine as like as one of those
top three flagship tentpole you know
these are the three things that we want
to bring the new macbook pro I feel like
just making it thinner was one of those
things because they're so they're so in
love with the idea of making everything
as thin as possible of of course they
are in design is such a huge choice
because a laptop in particular such a
personal choice you take it with you
places you're seen in public with it you
work on it it's probably the device you
may use most you know often during the
day in terms of actual man-hours on it
now that said I'm going to disagree with
you a tiny bit Brian please this dinner
these are thinner but they are not the
thinnest the 13-inch is still I think
14.9 millimeters that's very thin don't
get me wrong but there are a ton of new
windows oh yeah in 14 inch laptops that
get down to you know 12 millimeters 11
do they get down under 10 millimeters uh
ace who's got the swift seven that's a
13 inch really nice premium 13-inch
laptop you know a roughly comparable to
the to the macbook uh and it's nine
point nine eight millimeters thick
that's insane damn so these things are
you know the thin but you're not going
like oh this is the thinnest laptop ever
and they're still you know 34 pounds so
they still feel kinda they feel kind of
dense but at the same time that means
you feel like you know though they'll
take a beating and that's the one thing
macbooks have always done well as you
can throw them in your bag and knock
them around you make it a little scratch
or dent uh but i I've never beaten one
up in 10 plus years enough that it stops
working yeah overall All Things
Considered where would you rank the new
macbook pro let's say 15 inch amongst
other laptop like do you still feel
there's a certain one or two that are
better than it or they're pretty even
like where do you where do you put in
the pecking order because you look at
everything yeah I mean it's still it's
still the top of the game but is a very
expensive top of the game if you don't
want to spend that much there's other
things you can look at dale's XPS line
is very good their XPS 15 is pretty much
a macbook pro clone uh there are a lot
of other you know cool 13 inch super
thin laptops out there but they're there
they're filler but they're not quite as
powerful I think what
does really well that everyone else has
a hard time getting there wrapping their
hands around is that integration of the
hardware and the operating system and
the software and the user input that
magical trackpad that no one else can
get that feel on that flick your fingers
around it kind of feel the touch bar
it's a nice bonus I I wouldn't I
wouldn't go to too far out of my way for
it but as long as you're getting one of
these it comes with it that's cool and
you'll find it fun you'll find a couple
of you know efficiencies and cool things
to do with it but I think people by
macbooks primarily for the ease of use
and that trackpad and nobody else does
that that's a great point and then
before we wrap up Dan if you could just
talk a little bit about the tetris
effect we want to show you some love
with just you know some of the other
things that you're doing as well but
thank you Brian I wish I had a copy here
I could hold that is my photoshop it in
bro it is the it is the true life non
fiction story of the secret Cold War
history of the most important video game
ever created Tetris created in the
Soviet Union in the 80s and stolen by
western companies Cold War spy high
jinks for real ensue well there you go I
mean you can't tease any better than
that I guess ur and and featured in the
upcoming issue have seen at magazine
excerpt in the winter issue of scenic
sprint magazine keep the plugs come into
Ching to Ching alright Dan hey we just
appreciate your time and your insight
and thank you so much and we will talk
to you soon my friend my pleasure is
always alright thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
