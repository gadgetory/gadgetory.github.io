festive season and celebrating with your
family or sitting in a dark room alone
watching Netflix and ignoring your
family all together yeah family is
terrible here are the TV shows and
movies that we're going to be watching
on the streaming services this month
first off is the Barack Obama biopic
Barry the movie looks back to when Obama
studied at Columbia University in the
80s long before becoming the leader of
the free world
Netflix picked this one up after it's
screened at the Toronto Film Festival
another fun fact Obama is played by Ozzy
Devin Tyrell which is kind of
appropriate for a movie called berry
season one a crazy ex-girlfriend is
coming to Netflix and you were going to
know by the end of the opening credits
if this is one for you the premise is
that a high-powered New York Attorney
packs up and moves across the country to
a small Californian town after she
bumped into a first love on the street
and watches an ad for butter it's a
pretty weird show but it's hilarious
it's really clever it's really sweet and
it happens to be a musical which has me
sold another show that we're really keen
to check out on Netflix is White Rabbit
Project
it's from the producers of Mythbusters
so if you came to see grant Kari and
Tory on your screen again then this show
was made for you think heist
reenactments electric shocks and justing
white rabbit project will be familiar
for Mythbusters fans but it's also
trying some cool new things the entire
first season of preacher was coming to
stand and I'm pretty excited about this
one
based on the comic by Garth Ennis and
Steve Dillon it's a dark supernatural
thriller that follows a Texan preacher
suffering a crisis of faith when he gets
imbued with the voice of God and his
sidekick is a vampire it's a very black
comedy and it's absolutely worth
checking out if you haven't seen any of
it yet and to round out our top 5 picks
for the month the gory and hilarious ash
vs. Evil Dead Ash has been fighting
Deadites for two seasons but he's been
wearing a man girdle while he's been
doing it
there's loads of blood and guts and one
particularly amazing scene where ash
gets sucked up a corpses but it's not
one for the prudes but it's really
awesome those are the shows that we'll
be streaming while we hide from the
December Heat
we'll see you next time really of a
corpses but right up
you're the ribcage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
