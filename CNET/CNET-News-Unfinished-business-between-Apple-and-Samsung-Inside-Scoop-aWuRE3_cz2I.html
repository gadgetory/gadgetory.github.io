I'm cnet's car tsuboi joined by staff
writer Josh Lowensohn and Josh tomorrow
december six we have the hearing the
long scheduled hearing between Apple and
Samsung to discuss how the trial went
that wrapped this summer tell us a
little bit about what we can expect from
this hearing sure I mean this is really
the first time these two sides have come
back together since the judgment that
was pretty much squarely in Apple's
favor yeah so on the docket for tomorrow
are all sorts of things including
whether or not Apple can get some of
these devices band based on what
happened also things like if Samsung can
get a retrial which is a huge issue now
going back to the devices band basically
Apple as claiming that Samsung took some
of its patent infringed some of its
patent rights like that the pinch to
zoom and the scrolling and says that
Samsung is using that technology on 8 of
their devices then exactly so the actual
paperwork that Apple's trying to get
through is a permanent injunction in the
US which would mean that you could not
sell its products so major impact to the
consumer obviously yes and no some of
the products that are in this list are
really old you know they're not it's not
the hottest and newest products that
Samsung selling it's more of a point to
have an impact on what happened and as
far as Samsung's wishes they're hoping
for a retrial and that has to do with a
juror misconduct tell us a little bit
more about that sure so basically
Samsung has kind of thrown out there
that one of the jurors who's actually
the foreman wasn't quite up front about
his involvement with CJ which samsung
owns a piece of and somehow that would
that would temper his decision and
therefore the rest of the jury's
decision so they really tried to whittle
down and try and kind of characterize
that as being problematic to the
judgment interesting so what do you
think could actually come out of
tomorrow's hearing well you know I think
we might see a decision or two but some
of the things are really a chance for
both sides to make their arguments and
then I think judge Koh is really going
to have a couple days to decide and
maybe we'll see something the week after
do you really think we could see a
retrial on this though after this
summer's messy trial I think Rhys ral is
less likely than an appeal obviously I
think Samsung is really going to try
for that and some of these little
motions that they're going for really
good kind of set the stage for that
interesting well you're going to be
covering it you're going to go great we
look forward to hearing what comes out
of it thank you so much yeah Josh
Lowensohn I'm Kara Tsuboi thanks for
