with the Jabra solemate max this is the
jumbo sized version of job rus' sneaker
inspired bluetooth speaker and this is
actually a quite a bit bigger speaker it
has two woofers and two tweeters as well
as a base radiator it's a pretty big
speaker it has decent sound it delivers
a lot of volume and has pretty big bass
the one thing that's a little bit
lacking is the detail this just doesn't
sound like a 400 speaker yes this does
cost 400 at least at the launch but it
does have an excellent design it is
water resistant it has a tread on the
bottom like previous soulmate speakers
that tread is designed to help keep the
speaker in place when you're playing it
at louder volumes it also has a groove
in it that stores a cord that allows you
to play non Bluetooth devices of course
most people will listen to this as a
wireless speaker delivers about 14 hours
of battery life there's a little bit
better suited as an outdoor speaker and
I liked that it had this handle on the
side that allows you to carry it around
with you it's quite heavy for speaker so
it is good that it has that handle also
like the way the buttons were situated
on top of the device with both volume
controls and transport controls skip
tracks for and back a lot of people like
to have a pause play button on the
speaker itself and this has that it also
has a built-in speakerphone and better
yet it has a USB port for charging your
mobile device while you're using the
speaker this does charge with an AC
adapter that's a little bit of a
drawback there is a micro USB port on
the side that appears to be just for
firmware upgrades all I did like this
speaker does have a really nice design
its water resistant has a strong feature
set and also delivers good sound and
battery life alright I don't think the
sound measures up to what a 400 or
speaker should but if it does come down
in price ideally below 300 dollars
you'll start being a better value and
worth considering I'm David karna and
that's the Jabra solemate max portable
bluetooth speaker thanks for watching
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
