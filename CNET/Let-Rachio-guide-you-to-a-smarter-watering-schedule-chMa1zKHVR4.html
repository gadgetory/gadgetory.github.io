just about anything now but the ratio
smart sprinkler controller adds genuine
intelligence to your watering routine
but also come on you can turn your
sprinklers on with an app which I find
fascinating because that ROI
liudmila it replaces the existing
controller for your in-ground sprinklers
and it'll add a ton of convenience to
your life if you're used to messing with
clunky dials and buttons every time it
rents Rocchi has 200 bucks for an 8 zone
controller or 250 for 16 zones the app
nicely walks the line between
ease-of-use and customizable options
both will adapt to the weather on their
own then you can really go into each
zone and fine-tune details precisely if
you'd like you can also tie it into a
larger smart home set up with if or wink
so yeah you can turn the sprinklers on
or off with a nap but Rocchi o makes it
so you don't have to and Rocchi o stacks
up well with other smart controllers too
you can control your sprinklers with
your voice with an Amazon echo or Google
home Alexa a scratchy o2 water zone 1
for 5 minutes ok
zone number 1 is running for 5 minutes
but it's not without flaws Rocchi owes a
little expensive and you have to pay
more for a weatherproof case plus the
voice control skills vary from competent
to hilariously bad Alexa ask ratio to
turn on the sprinklers please tell me
which is owned to run and how long to
run it for all zones 10 minutes
please tell me which is owned to run and
how long to run it for zone one ten
minutes please tell me which is owned to
run in how long to run it for Zone two
ten minutes please tell me which is
owned to run in how long to run it for
what would you like me to say zone three
you can't run multiple zones at once and
the onboard controls are limited if your
internet goes out flaws aside the ratio
is a smart home device that genuinely
feels smart and I recommend it as a way
to add convenience and savings to your
watering routine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
