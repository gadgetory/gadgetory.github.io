initial bats I really like it it's a
very nice design is very slim I really
like this blue color on the back really
love the wraparound screens that's
something they brought up from the s7
edge of the estimate really like the
ability to be able to write with the S
vinegar water pretty cool feature and
look at any problems cited
able to take a few seconds for youtube
video in turn i need to get very quickly
which turns me into sounds like an
absolute 30 i have to say
design of this thing and that's because
from my point of view the note line has
always been the sort of weird bigger
quirkier more experimental cousin to the
galaxy s the flagship and that and the
galaxy s is where Samsung has put all
the real designer but this one it seems
really lovely it borrows the same design
cues it's got that curved screen it
feels like the much more complete more
lovingly built smartphone than notes
previously have been in the past so I'm
excited about design personally
features wise what's interesting is
Samson Adam like a 12 megapixel camera
has that water resistant
in line feature wise for the s7 edge of
course you saw earlier this year
what's interesting though is how much
Sam's going to charge us over the smes
bed makes a lot of cool features but it
was it going to be a couple of dollars
can be worth it people really going to
pay for that s pen where they're going
to say hey there's so many great
features on the s7 edge little cheaper
and lose a little bit so I'm just going
to stick with that so price is going to
be a real
yeah there are so many really good
budget which my phones out there at the
moment I mean this one feels very
powerful
police now
we have to wait and see stay tuned for
the full review say to you seen em</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
