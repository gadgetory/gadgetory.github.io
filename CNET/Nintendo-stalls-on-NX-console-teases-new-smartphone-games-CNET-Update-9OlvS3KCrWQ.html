for another year but you don't have to
wait long for new Nintendo games on your
smartphone I'm Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update well there's no reason
to buy a Wii U this year because
Nintendo just announced that its next
game console codename Nintendo NX is
coming out next year in March 2017 the
company's fiscal year earnings report
indicated that this NX system is going
to be a brand new concept so don't think
of it as a new we we don't know much
about what the new NX is going to be but
there are some clues reports suggest
this is a hybrid concept it might blur
together the portable nintendo DS
concept with a home system so you could
take some games on the go nintendo filed
a patent application last year that
featured this image of a new oval
touchscreen controller Nintendo said it
will not show the NX at the big e 3
videogame conference in June instead it
will reveal details later in the year
now here's something don't have to wait
too long for more Nintendo smartphone
games the company announced animal
crossing and Fire Emblem are coming to
mobile app stores this spring Nintendo
launched the me tomo app last month
which is more of a social thing than a
real game game it gets boring really
quickly but Animal Crossing could
certainly be more addicting as a
time-wasting casual mobile game the
series has been around since 2002 you
live in a little town and collect fruit
and go fishing and build a home and talk
to animals and send them letters it goes
on forever later this year Nintendo is
launching what could be an even bigger
mobile game pokemon go nine minutes of
beta test footage was leaked online by
youtube channel game previews once you
customize your characters look you would
turn on the phone's GPS and roam around
the real world until the app alerts you
of a Pokemon nearby to catch or to
battle it'll use a live feed from your
phone's camera to make it look like
Pokemon are standing in front of you on
the street outside of the gaming world
there's a brand new app that's getting
some buzz for being different but you
can also just be a flop the app is
called talk show and you have these text
message conversations with friends where
anyone can public
observe your conversation I tried it out
a bit I don't really see the appeal to
texting live in public when you could
just do that on Twitter and on Twitter
people can interact with you back on
talk show the only people that can talk
back are the ones you allow to talk to
you so it's a text form of podcasting
its unique but yeah that's all for this
tech news around up you can head to
cnet.com for more from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
