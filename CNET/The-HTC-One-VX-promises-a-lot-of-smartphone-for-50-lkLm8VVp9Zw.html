and today we're taking a first look at
the HTC One V X 480 this handset costs a
very affordable 49 99 and it's available
now for purchase if you're anything like
me you may not expect much smartphone
for under 50 bucks but the HTC one VX
actually offers quite a bit of hardware
and capabilities for not much cash
upfront powering the handset is a
respectably fast 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon processor and decently large
one gigabyte allotment of RAM sure it's
not a blazing quad-core chip you'll find
in more expensive devices it does
however have enough chops to drive the
phones Android for dotto Ice Cream
Sandwich operating system with agility
that's right I said ice cream sandwich
and not Google's latest and greatest
version of Android jelly bean still you
do get HTC's well crafted sense for you
I which sits on top of Android the one
VX may not have as premium a look as
HTC's other handsets either such as the
one x+ or 1s while those phones are
molded from a single piece of
polycarbonate or anodized aluminum the
one VX is chassis is ordinary plastic
even so it doesn't feel cheap is thin
and has an attractive silver and white
color scheme above the 4.5 inch qHD
resolution screen is a VGA front-facing
camera below are three capacitive
buttons for Android functions the right
side holds a long trim volume bar while
up top is a headphone jack and power
button on the back side is the phones 5
megapixel camera and LED flash
underneath the battery cover our slots
for micro SD and SIM cards plus and
embedded 1810 milliamp battery other
features on the one VX include beats
audio processing technology and
connection to 80 s 4G LTE data network
while the HTC One V X is 5 megapixel
camera has a comparatively low
resolution it uses a backside
illuminated sensor shoots pictures
quickly and has plenty of features and
shooting modes such as an HDR mode
panorama continuous shooting and the
ability to snap shots while recording
video
when you add it all up the HTC one VX
seems to offer a lot for its low price

review I'm Brian Bennett and this has
been a first look at the HTC One V X</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
