I'm so excited to be here today and
I'm so privileged to be a part of home
right I love this company so much I love
about me Emma
and they stand for and I'm excited to
show you the gray label and here we go
the first product that we want to show
you is under here and this is absolutely
and completely inspired by this amazing
woman
this is the first-ever pair of
sunglasses that can be worn out to
protect your eyes from the Sun and they
can also take picture
and the and in the picture that has been
taken registers on the outside of the
lands I don't know what the light if
it's possible to see the arms on the app
they're actually not on
this is a prototype so there would be
and we're really exciting the adventure
there they are they're turned on now and
I will now play for you the
demonstration
there we go
so these glasses can be worn in public
to walk around you can take them to a
nightclub you can come to one of my
shows and wear them take pictures of me
while I sing on stage Bobby won't be
there for that he'll be out of Quebec
City but these are something that I
envisioned many years ago for those of
you who have seen me like when I did the
st. Baltimore
I made these glasses out of iPods creams
that I I struck together to create a
blast a second skin movie and I thought
wouldn't it be wonderful of these were
functional so we created the first ever
camera that actually had sunglasses also
it takes pictures it also takes bids out
video and everything registers into a
USB that is essentially the earpiece so
the earpiece comes out and is also the
USB and to be connected either to your
computer to print or if you would like
you can send your pictures and video of
our pictures with Bluetooth capability
to the print
that I was happy to show you
and our next
so I'm really excited about this product
of course the glasses are very exciting
because we're bored changed fashion and
technologies together we're creating
something that's innovative that's also
cultural but this is a the product that
really kind of made everybody angry when
we were indeed the conference room
together they said toggle what is the
camera of the future and I said this is
this is the camera of the teacher I have
tons of fans I have a arena shows every
night with 20,000 little lights flashing
at me as they take pictures on their
cell phones the entire show so I said
how can we bring the cell phone into
Polaroid how can we create something
that's digital billables never gets
prettier to something that is instant so
we created this printer this is a
printer that I actually throw in my
purse all the time and I bring out with
me to bars as a sort of bar magic party
trick and I'm going to show you now how
it works I'm going to do is all to
demonstration for you so right now I'm
going to turn the printer on
it's on right now I'm sorry I'm wearing
sunglasses I could see the light so the
printer is on right now and what I'm
going to do is I'm actually going to
take a photo of all of you with my
camera phone
smile you're so saying that but
oh wait I just took a photo of cannon
let me
there we go so here's the photo right
here and see it for yourself on my phone
and now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to go into if I'll do the full
demonstration now as my phone is already
connected to this printer but what you
will do is you will go to your manage
connections turn your Bluetooth on then
you go to set up bluetooth you search
for the device the devices will come up
and it will read Polaroid zero zero zero
zero zero zero this one is won't be
right here so I'm just I'm connected to
it already so I'm now going to go to my
picture I just did this with Maria
Bartiromo over alright so here's the
photo that I just chucked I am now going
to send using bluetooth
I choose the printer it's searching the
password is
I can't tell you
okay it's pear
violence ending
the file has been transferred and it
will now print for you all to see it
will take about 40 seconds I think this
is really exciting because if you don't
want to take your camera with you you
just throw it in your purse it's really
light and I suppose many of you here are
dirty and then to carry around a mobile
printer with you
I know I will in the the size of the
image that comes out is 3 by 4 and it
can have the Polaroid change s around
the picture are people bleep smile
you're on instant film so I'm really
excited about this because all of my
most embarrassing and exciting photos
are taken and my favorite bar and they
are sitting on my cell phone and on
Taurus well I do a lot of cell phone
photos so this printer is compatible
with all Bluetooth capabilities cell
phones but they are not compatible with
iPhone so
it not because of us it's because I
found just do it so stop because about
so beyond we started with these
incredible glasses continued with the
printer and now the last thing that will
show you that this presentation is under
here and this is the new Polaroid camera
Oh pop it
I'm very excited that with Emma I think
it's a sexy it's sleek and it's hearty
it's not heavy but it feels good in your
hand it takes regular instant Polaroid's
it's also a zinc printer as well as the
petite the printer that I just showed
you they're both printing with no ink
which is better things for the
environment Impuls
ten photos in each film cartridge the
printer holds ten as well and it
registers both digitally
register is both digitally and as a
regular Polaroid camera the version that
were creating now well also there will
be out at Christmas time so you will be
able to send your images you can put
them on your computer or you can print
them out here and in the future we're
working on creating a Polaroid camera
that's also digital that is capable of
sending to Twitter Facebook and other
social media
Polaroid 21st century right now you give
the statue and start a diet we go by
this mannequin you want to kiss the
statue Bobby
he said no he has the real thing
any questions no okay well thank you so
much I love you thank you for coming
today was an honor
we hope you mark the product I love the
products I'm so proud to be here and as
a musician and as an artist I want to
thankful right personally for shooting
me not as a spokesperson and not as face
for the brand but they honored me as a
woman
as a creative director and they really
led me to put my hands in there and
design it myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
