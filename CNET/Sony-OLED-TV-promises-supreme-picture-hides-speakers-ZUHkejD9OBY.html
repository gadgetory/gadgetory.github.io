television the big deal here is that
this is the first time Sony has produced
an oled television for sale to the US
market until now it's been all LG
televisions of course OLED delivers the
best picture quality we have ever tested
we expect this Sony a1e to follow suit
superb picture quality what we could see
here those really great OLED especially
deep black levels the color looks really
good course we'll find out for sure when
we got this TV in the lab a little bit
later this year
sony has not announced pricing
availability yet we do expect them to be
relatively expensive just for reference
LG's currentl LEDs are two thousand
three thousand dollars for the 55 and 65
inch size figure these Sony's will be
maybe a little bit more expensive than
that one of the things that sets Sony
apart is the sound system on this
television if you look at the back it
actually has these four little
transducers on either side that are kind
of arranged of T pattern those serve to
actually vibrate the screen of the TV
itself the effect is that you actually
get the sound coming from the screen so
it's the first time ever that a
television has actually had the screen
itself produce the sound sony says that
that creates a much more immersive
effect so the actors voice for example
comes directly from their mouth on the
screen can't wait to test that Sony's
a1e oullette is available in a 55 65 and
70 seven-inch sides the flat panel
television has all the fixin's including
HDR with HDR 10 and Dolby vision
compatibility again we expect superior
picture quality that's a look at Sony's
a1e
