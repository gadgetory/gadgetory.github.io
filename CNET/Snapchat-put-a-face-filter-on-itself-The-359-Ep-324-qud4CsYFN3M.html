359 podcast I'm BVG in your host today
are alfred Inge and Roger Chang good
morning guys
what up we have a jam-packed show and we
have a little time to waste an tact yeah
we're gonna be talking about snapchats
new design personalized design whether
or not it's actually gonna win people
over I wouldn't talk about a big big
vulnerability in High Sierra Apple's
latest Mac OS and lastly what we're
gonna geek out about the Avengers
infinity war trailer gotta have to gotta
do it gotta watch it if you have it
Brian hasn't seen it so we're probably
know from great spoilers
there are a lot of Avengers there so
they avenge something I think there's
there's lots of avenging going on yes so
without further ado if you have any
comments that if you have questions live
in the comments section Brian we'll get
to the best and we'll try to answer them
in three minutes to 59 seconds hang out
we'll see you in three minutes 59
seconds from 3d to welcome to the 359
I'm dr. Chang I'm Alfred Aang snapchat
veiled its redesigned promising a more
personalized experience that broke up
these social and media aspects of the
service by adding a friends section for
your social circles and updating its
discovery discoverer section for the
media part you know it seems like this
is a bit of a band-aid I mean that they
promised a big redesign what do you
think I mean I don't think it's a
band-aid I think it's a it was a big
problem for people who were trying to
jump on snapchat and I think their
biggest issue was growth right thing as
many users as they could and I think a
big barrier for that was a lot of people
just don't get how snapchat works and
they don't get their lay out or anything
like that I think I don't know if this
these changes are really gonna make
things a lot easier for people to jump
into it I mean that they're still
starting when you launch the app it
still starts with a camera which is a
bit disorienting for new users they say
there's going to be a more explicit
French section and more explicit yeah
cover section I don't know if that's
gonna be enough though I think it will I
think the core of snapchat you know why
got so popular to begin with was people
wanted to share stuff with their friends
and all this discover stuff kind of
crept in it was I hated it I thought it
was really annoying but the problem here
is that it feels like for existing
snapchat users this might be
a better experience but it isn't enough
to get people who are you who haven't
really heard about snapchat or just
trying to figure out what snapchat is is
he let make it easier for them that not
so much I don't think it will I think
that it's they're changing things for
their like menu interface but not so
much on you know how to use the app or
anything like that yeah they also talked
about for 2018 the goal is to make the
discover platform easier for partners to
share the content as well as make money
so to try to get more partners to jump
on to it but again I don't know if that
really just is the core problem of
attracting new users who are familiar
with snapchat all right next up Apple
had a pretty big voter ability come up
with the latest Mac OS hi Sierra
Alfred the details so this isn't even a
technical like vulnerability if you went
to your login and you just typed in root
as the username and just kept pressing
you know enter without a password you
were given system admin access to the
accounts from there you could change all
the passwords on keychain you could
access file vault you could change the
passwords for the other accounts so you
could log in on that as well
Apple put out a statement yesterday
basically saying yeah we're working on
this and we're working on a patch for
this so definitely update your laptops
if you have Mac OS hi Sierra there is a
fix though right you could basically set
a password for yeah one of the some of
the workarounds that they've had the
simplest one is just setting a password
for the root account which it doesn't
have currently by default by Commission
you could also make a root username and
then make it a password for that which
really cool it no yeah it's just one of
those things that really should have
been there by default and it's such a
glaring error on Apple's behalf it's
ridiculous that it took this long to for
them to even find out I need to update
my Tector keys again alright lastly did
you see the Avengers infinity war
trailer yeah that's pretty much what I
did all morning instead of working good
to hear as your boss yeah let's let's
kick out over there I mean so many
different characters so many different
combinations of characters I think
that's what excites me most about this
that the fact that you know you get
these existing franchises you just kind
of mash
all up you're getting different
interactions like a falcon and black
panther it's really cool to finally see
it all coming together you know I like
from the first Iron Man movie we're in
the after the trailers I'm not so after
the credits when my standing out Jackson
shows up and stuff and then you know for
all that to lead up to this it's weird
it's weird that this is only like six
months away I know I know I just it was
uh it was kind of surreal that yeah that
like this has been a combination of
making I do it well note though I I
didn't have a chance to watch the comic
on the footage at Comic Con and it is
different they actually showed a lot
more on terms of the battle between
betas and the Avengers this was clearly
kicking their butts this kind of hits
out of the trailer but it's yeah it's
I'm excited I'm super super stoked for
this alright for more of these stories
check us out and seen it I'm Roger Chang
I'm Alfred a thanks for listening
holy crab apple yeah yeah hey we're
talking like another dumb holy crab
apples I think the entire time I was
writing this story if I just had to take
several pauses like this is so dumb this
is the dumbest I mean like you too can
feel like a hacker by pressing enter
four times it's one of those situations
where it's like you don't need any skill
what is it so if you're just to clear
things up if your back is locked
can you still pull off you just hit root
no cuz you have to change the account
right like out but if it's locked
I can like log out of that oh and log
back in as rooms dad yeah which is just
spat yep and then from there I can
change the password to your account so
then I can
get in on that and then yeah that's it's
all kinds of terrible it's almost
impressively bad right like I'm I'm kind
of in awe of how bad that is
that is like bush-league junior
programming 101 flaw yeah that's why
every time I think about it this is so
stupid it's it's clearly something that
they like didn't anticipate or like just
like just didn't look into or anything
like that but dumb is the how how many
people lose their I do wonder if this is
if this is an omission or if this is one
of those things were like they change
the line of code here and it changed the
mechanics of the line of code yeah I
mean that's usually how bugs work out
every Apple has been kind of it's
obviously or I mean I I doubt they would
yes henshin Lane intentionally or like
or even have a oversight it could have
been one of those things were like they
changed around something with user
interface and that just saying like it
it may not be it's stupid yep but it may
not necessarily be like just the case of
oversight yeah so a big reason why this
is such an issue is like like we've
talked about so many like
vulnerabilities over the last year where
like something like like crack yeah
where you know everyone says oh all
these devices are affected by but then
you can kind of settle down for a bit
after after realizing like the technical
capabilities that you need to be able to
do something like that anyway yeah this
one is not that like we all did it
on like our like lab computer like
yesterday and we just ridiculous how
easy it was I know before we go full-on
geek since I'm still in the dark about
the Avengers trailer
let's floor a couple questions Matthew -
are the - in the chat first of all 2017
the year of the breach nice piece but
it's a terrible subject he wants to
deviate back to a topic from a couple of
days ago and he's discussing the phone
cameras again is there really enough of
a difference between the cameras to get
someone to change ecosystems that's a
great question I don't think so I mean I
think
cameras are very important to the
purchasing decision but if you're locked
into one ecosystem like especially this
year they're very comparable and you
know there are specific needs or
specific cases where one is better than
the other but overall they're they're
not neither are terrible I think I think
there were such a large gap in the past
that like you can make that argument
like I switch to an iPhone like phone
2012 yeah and I switched to it in like
2012 or so and then now though like if I
had to pick it just like all these
cameras are actually pretty damn good so
I might it doesn't really make that much
of a difference and plus I've both
ecosystem so doesn't really yeah it's
interesting to me that that's become
such a high selling point for any you
can't bone is that the camera is like
top to your thing and that's a very I
know I sound like an idiot for even
thinking about that but in a million
years maybe like let's say 15 years ago
did you really think you're gonna have
such a high powered camera in your
pocket no I mean that any instance that
used to be a major selling point for for
like what you want to buy like how good
is the camera but now like when all the
cameras are essentially like the same
I'm starting to wonder like what the
next selling point is gonna become
there's a third fold I want the phone
that folds damnit that's just me I take
a moment to appreciate the the little
things and how we've got ridiculously
powerful cameras in turn oh I so
remember like our features like the the
camera on the razor the original razor
phone and like it it took like a was
like a one megapixel photo or something
like that it was like I looked buff as
hell on those photos though yeah my
complexion was a lot clearer because I
look at all three pixels of yeah
HD flaw exposure yeah a great question
from MP Cody is the Mac issue only on
High Sierra or it's at all previous
versions it's only on High Sierra yep so
at least a little solace in that since a
lot of people have and the thing about
High Sierra was that basically like
hours before it had released a former
NSA hacker who worked for a security
company also showed another bug with
their passwords like on the keychain
that like you could extract all the
passwords from it if you had an app
jeez they patched that too but it was
just one of those things like wow man
passwords are not really safe on this
right and just to refresh and elaborate
for a couple people who have come in
late the problem that we're experiencing
now is if you have high sierra you can
type in root as your username and no
password and admin like yeah it's not
even they don't even make a new account
with like guest features or its litter
when we checked it and then we logged
back out to log back in as root it they
changed the name to system administrator
so it's it's literally system admins
access and you have complete permissions
on everything this is what happens when
you rush stuff some poor soul is gonna
lose his job because to go back at
anything because they put this out to
beta this is the same cycle that they
have every year for a new operating
system like it's just yeah so we are
almost out of time
and I need to learn more about the
Avengers as a tried-and-true
comic book fan I'm just pointing to
myself for not seeing this yet so
they're kind of like the Justice League
I'm aware of that but guy with the
shield is a guy with like some metal
armor like metal man lumina man yeah so
what was your takeaway from the trailer
but just to kind of like bolster me and
I I know that this is gonna be like a
two-part like infinity war supposed to
be two parts so I thought they'd
backpedaled on that no no well it's
infinity war I think it's gonna be its
own like title or whatever but it's
supposed to be like a two-part Avengers
yeah so I'm not completely predicting
like this whole movie they're just
introducing Thanos and just getting
their asses kicked like yeah yeah
imagine things get like really really
terrible who dies I to be continued who
dies probably that's not the vision
vision vision definitely died yeah
nobody cares about vision yeah there is
a produce yeah there's a pretty graphic
but dramatic scene with the vision of
Thanos Thanos mind stone for mine stone
yes definitely dies like there's no way
he doesn't die does it go back to being
Jarvis is to get like demoted pattern
there was
I don't know if I want spoiler for bread
but there was a scene with it's a
trailer alright good then there's a see
what the vision word he wasn't in his
Android makeup he was like it is yeah
but can't see like you use his powers to
know what he looks like
yeah he can totally use his powers to
reject Marsha stone yeah yes I think
that's Paul Bettany just showed up one
morning is I don't want to make up six
hours not end like I'm very it's Mikey
rewrite the script which yeah oh not in
a bit like that was romantic scene so do
we have to do like another sex robot
story at scene that or something like
that
possibly ooh yikes and then Captain
America rocks a beard he probably mother
that's awesome yeah keep it yeah I think
they should all have beards I think
Black Widow should get a beard to Hulk
with the beard like in World War know
with Planet Planet Hulk yeah I don't
know if those are planning okey dokey
definitely under beard uh and it also
happened
old man Logan I believe he had a beard
maybe or no end of the earth
I forget what story it was there's one
where it's like Hulk is a sole survivor
sounds like his kid
yeah he keeps mutating yeah it's awesome
I'm gonna read that no I will say look
again but the Comic Con footage is show
a lot more of the action we got to see
the new spider-man suit just come yeah
iron spider oh yeah iron spider suit
it's kind of cool if you watch did you
watch the spider-man movie the
homecoming yes yeah so he does finally
yes take his offer yep well becomes a
full-blown Avenger all right there's
some sort of weird ring like that
appears in the middle yeah yeah it's
like a giant portal and it like destroys
it's not really clear if it's a portal
or I guess yeah
that's the Infinity Gauntlet for you
doesn't he doesn't stand us like smash a
moon or something like that so it's not
in that trailer but I did see that that
was in the Comic Con footage we that was
as implausible that sounds like he
smashes the moon into the planet
implausible it's a movie about
superheroes you know that can look
really bad and fake oh yes some reason
that works really well like I don't know
why but it by like the way they shot it
the way it was framed I'm like yeah okay
I can see that yeah kind of like the
moon landing yeah I just kind of want to
see him do that indefinitely with
planets and stars like the I crush your
head it's way more realistic all right
we are just about out of time I like the
Josh boy de is predicting the Captain
America is going today I think that's
the most poetic way to get a bounce it's
very much I feel like him Iron Man I
mean the whole like though the legacy
characters like the oh geez yeah I feel
like there's there's a bunch of them are
gonna go right Wow
that's my prediction it's bold they're
expensive they want to be they want
talking about how after the Avengers
movies not this one maybe the four think
of adventures for but they've been
talking about how like the trying to
like changed this could big changes it's
much more they wanted to be legacy they
want to be able to recast and bring a
new character move on much longer than
we know do this stuff I don't want to
see like Avengers like 20 or something
but I think Robert Downey jr. is like
stealth I think that
the point right there gonna get rid of
some of these yeah hundred characters
and I can start fresh with you know
Black Panther and spider-man sir yeah
what do you think what do you think
Stanley's cameo is gonna be maybe
Avengers well he was already a watcher
guys in the galaxy I say put him in like
Slave Leia outfit oh look next to Thanos
is throne yeah they can do that good
Disney owns both of them exactly Oh what
if they put in like that's terrible
like kylo Ren how far away are we from
giant franchise crossover because Disney
owns world I kingdom heart movie with
Star Wars and well you know Disney get
together like Olsen Wolverine we can
just get Wolverine in there that would
just make my day there's still a chance
it's always a chance always a chance we
have a newbie in the chat his name's
