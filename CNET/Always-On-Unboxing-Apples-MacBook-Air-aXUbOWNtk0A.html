unboxing Apple's book air the 13-inch
model that they announced at WWDC there
are hardly any changes on the inside
except for what sounds like a pretty
awesome new battery let's get it out of
the box my sweet new knife from Gerber
thanks guys there's so many things on
here I don't even know where to start
these laptops have always been popular
with students the whole MacBook align
and then of course the air is very
backpack friendly is it so thin in light
ok alrighty there we go the box hasn't
changed either plastic off here
carefully
I mean if I'm being honest they didn't
really need to change the designer this
is a beautiful laptop and so far no
other notebook makers been able to touch
it check it out here
lean black and white packaging as always
I mean I'm sure there's gonna come a
point where we say they gotta change
something about this but that point is
not quite here yet just looks good we
have our power cord
pretty much it
macbook out of here
there we go okay you've all seen a
MacBook Air before let's talk about the
specs as I mentioned there are no
physical changes to the exterior but the
headline on the new MacBook Air is that
it gets Intel's new Haswell chip
it's an i5 1.3 gigahertz configurable up
to a 2.6 gigahertz dual-core chip it's
powered by either 4 gigs or 8 gigs of
internal RAM in terms of graphics you
get an integrated intel HD 5000
processor the best thing about the new
Haswell chip the battery life Apple said
it would be 12 hours when Sina tested it
we got 14 hours and 25 minutes it
exceeds the previous 13-inch model by
about half a day there are some
disappointments you do not get a higher
resolution screen and it's not a
touchscreen which some people had hope
for but the res is very good it's 1440
by 900 there's also a front-facing 720p
camera the MacBook Air is 12 point 8
inches wide and 8.9 four inches deep and
it weighs just under three pounds it has
two USB 3 ports and a Thunderbolt port
but unfortunately it does not get a new
HDMI port it does come with an SD XD
card slot storage is still unfortunately
pretty small it starts at a 128 gig
solid-state drive although you can of
course upgrade but it'll cost you
there's also no optical drive as on the
previous models Wi-Fi is upgraded to 802
11 AC which should play very nicely
across the Apple line and it has
bluetooth 4.0 despite the interior
improvements the price on the MacBook
Air is actually $100 cheaper than the
previous model it starts at $1,099 on
the inside the MacBook Air 13 inch is
doing everything right better battery
life for me Trump's an HDMI port or a
higher resolution screen and this design
is so sleek it should fit in anybody's
backpack plus it's 1,100 bucks this
thing kind of works for everybody of
course that is just my opinion it just
so happens our CNET editors agree with
me head on over and read our full review
for all the details</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
