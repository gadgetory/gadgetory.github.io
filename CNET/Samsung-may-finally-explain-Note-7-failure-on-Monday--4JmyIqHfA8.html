world what went wrong with the Galaxy
Note seven phone you know the phone that
spontaneously catches fire according to
Reuters a news agency in South Korea is
reporting that January 23rd is the day
Samsung plans to release the results of
its investigation on what was causing
the phones to overheat this product
disaster was the largest safety recall
in tech history and consumers are left
wondering how can they trust future
Samsung products experts outside of the
company have a few ideas on what went
wrong it appears there wasn't enough
space around the battery and that puts
stress on the battery when it's well
because all batteries swell a little
when they charge who knows if Samsung
will actually admit what exactly went
wrong but the problem continues to
linger verizon tells Fortune magazine
that thousands of customers are still
using the dangerous note 7 film and not
turning them in even after the carrier
pushed out a software update that was
supposed to render the phone unusable
and unable to charge it seems some
people holding out have found a way to
get around the software update but
verizon isn't stopping their fortune
reports that if a note 7 owner on
verizon calls 911 will be rerouted to
the company's customer service
department I'm Bridget Carey you can
stay on top of the neverending note 7
