walk you through Google's newest mobile
operating system Android KitKat 4.4
arguably one of the most important
features of KitKat is something you
can't even see Google shrunk the size of
the operating system to run on devices
with 512 megabytes of RAM that means
that low-end budget devices can run
KitKat instead of the now outdated 2.3
Gingerbread or Furtado Ice Cream
Sandwich that's a huge step forward from
Google and helping create a universal
Android experience no matter what phone
you buy onto the features that you can
see there's a redesigned home screen
with larger icons and condensed text the
top satisfier is now transparent and
blends with your wallpaper there's a new
home screen menu where you can change
the wallpaper add widgets and access
your Google search settings the app
drawer is also transparent and as you
can see there's no longer a section for
widgets the lockscreen gets a new music
widget in KitKat which shows album art
full screen and places playback controls
at the top if you're watching a video on
a chromecast from your phone you can
also pause and play it from the
lockscreen
there's a new immersive experience in
the OS which shows books movies and
games full screen and fades away the
controls and satisfier Google built a
special launcher for the Nexus 5 that
makes Google now even easier to access
if you unlock your phone you can say ok
Google to activate voice search without
needing to tap anywhere on the screen
also when you turn on Google now you can
swipe all the way to the left to pull it
up those two features are exclusive to
the Nexus 5 at least until further
notice KitKat includes a brand new
dialer which remembers who you call the
most and keep those people front and
center you can now also search for
businesses by keyword or name in the
dialer and start a call by tapping the
result there's no longer a dedicated SMS
app instead you send and receive
messages from hangouts Google's instant
messaging and video chatting app the app
separates your text messaging
conversations and google chat
conversations into individual threads on
the main screen even if you're
communicating with the same contact you
can switch between i.m and SMS
conversations when you're in the message
thread by tapping the person's name at
the top emoji has been available in
earlier versions of an
but they make their official debut in
KitKat those tiny pictures are now part
of the stock keyboard and can be used
almost anywhere you can input text you
can now print photos documents and web
pages from your phone with Google Cloud
Print you'll need to set up your printer
on Google's cloud print service but once
you do just tap the print button in the
gallery app Quick Office or Chrome there
are many more changes that Google
included in this version of Android for
a full list check out my in-depth look
