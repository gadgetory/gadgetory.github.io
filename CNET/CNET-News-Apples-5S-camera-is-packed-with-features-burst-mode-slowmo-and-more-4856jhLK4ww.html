a picture they have the iPhone take a
better picture for us and we have some
huge advancements in technology with
iPhone 5s to do just that first starts
with the hardware a new camera system we
have a new 5 element Apple designed lens
that has a larger F 2.2 aperture let's
more light onto the sensor we have a new
sensor as well that has a 15% larger
active area now our competitors would
just pack more pixels on that make them
ever smaller and cram them closer
together to get some stat on a spec
sheet that's not what we do we know a
secret
we know it's actually bigger pixels that
make a better picture and the pixels on
this sensor a 1.5 microns in size larger
than the iPhone 5 and much larger than
most competitive phones they often have
one point over one point one micron size
pixels for the bigger pixel they let in
more light get a better dynamic range of
color and less noise in the image all to
make a better photograph the new
software in iOS 7 has been designed to
take advantage of this new sensor as
well as the image the image capabilities
of the a7 chip which are remarkable let
me give you example of some of the
things this new camera app is doing
automatically for you when you launch
the camera app before you even take a
picture it's automatically setting white
balance getting the right colors for you
it's automatically setting the exposure
level to get the right brightness level
for the first time it's creating a
dynamic local tone map around the image
so you can get better highlights and
shadows in the image for the first time
it's doing auto focus matrix metering
worth 15 focus zones
this is DSLR level stuff to get a
sharper image and then when you do take
a picture unbeknownst to you it actually
takes multiple photos it instantly
analyzes them in real time 4 which is
the sharpest and that's what you see on
your screen
it is completely automatic and much
smarter and more capable than ever
before it has a new flash as well we
call it the true tone flash
when you take a flash picture I'm sure
many of you know that the ambient light
whether you're outside or in a room
varies in its color temperature for
example a fluorescent light is cooler or
bluer an incandescent light is warmer or
more amber whatever color your Flash is
it's going to clash with the color the
lighting in the room and give you a
photo that doesn't look quite right
especially skin tones because skin is so
reflective for the flash and the iPhone
5s solves for this actually has two LEDs
one a cooler white one and another a
warmer amber one and in real time it
analyzes the scene and can present a
color flash of over a thousand color
variations to give exactly the right
color flash for the room or situation
you're in this is the first time that
has ever been done not just on a phone
but a camera of any kind it's truly a
breakthrough so before using a phone
that has a camera with a single LED you
might get a photo like this you see as a
warm incandescent light the skin tones
don't look right at all the wood table
looks too orange the jeans are too blue
and not right that's really hard to fix
later with editing this is an unreached
photo right off the iPhone 5s in the
same scene see much more natural skin
tones the wood table looks great that's
one of the great new features in the
camera system
here's another for the first time the
iPhone auto image stabilization we've
all run into situations like this in a
room maybe a little bit less ambient
light the subject is moving it needs a
long exposure to get a picture but that
means you're going to blur your photo so
this isn't a keeper you've got to get
rid of this photo but in the iPhone 5s
you get a much sharper image in the same
situation what is it doing and actually
with a single press of the shutter takes
multiple photos is able to combine them
for the right exposure level but select
the parts of the image that could be
sharpest on that short exposure time all
done instantly in real time there's
another great feature this camera system
a fun new burst mode when you go to take
your picture if you hold down on the
shutter button it'll burst a bunch of
photos it can actually take 10 frames a
second
for as long as you hold your finger on
the shutter so it can work like this so
in two seconds we just took 20 photos of
that scene now if every time you did
this you had to go into your camera roll
and sort through all those photos well
the fun would be lost but the team has
done a brilliant job using the a7 chip
in real time as you took those photos it
analyzes them for a number of variables
it checks on exposure sharpness whether
her face is in the scene whether they're
smiling whether they're blinking and
when you go into the camera roll it
presents what it thinks might be your
favorite shot out of all the shots you
don't have to select them you can go
inside and select any of the other ones
you want they're all there but it picks
the best one if it notices a shot like
this one that was an action sequence
it'll pick a couple shots to represent
the major motions in the action so you
have a few photos from that whole series
all done in real time automatically one
more great camera feature I want to tell
you about slo-mo so we have a video
camera you can select in the camera app
we have a second one called a
slow-motion camera you select that one
and then you can create scenes with slow
motion like this the iPhone 5s does in
that situation it's capturing HD video
at 720p at 120 frames a second now
normal video is 30 frames a second and
you can go in and select right on the
screen what part you want to be normal
speed what want to be the slow motion
and instantly create it yet it looks
completely natural and there's no loss
of quality as you move in and out of
normal and slow speed now all of these
great features and technologies are
simply in service of taking a beautiful
picture so we have a few photos I like
to walk through here and show you that
are all taken right off an iPhone 5s not
edited retouched in any way so here are
some examples
just a beautiful macro shot you see a
great dynamic range of color in this
image I still shot see great sharpness
with it's better low-light capabilities
you can get photos in all different
situations that come out even more
beautiful this is
a California ground squirrel or sperm
ophelia beach if you don't know it and
the sharpness and detail is amazing this
is right off the iPhone 5s camera
beautiful skin tones rich deep bronze -
gorgeous photo this one's gorgeous - a
sunset shot incredible white balance
just beautiful glowing tones and even
the great panorama shots we can take our
even better with the iPhone 5s this is
28 megapixel panorama taken with the 5s
and what makes it even better now is we
can adjust the exposure level
automatically as you're painting the
scene so for example this scene is more
sunlight on the right hand side to the
left of the sky the exposure was
adjusted automatically as we pan the
scene so that is the new iSight camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
