whatever the case may be and literally
my own case I I'm in regular touch with
hundreds of people and yet I get it
consolidated down toward a glance I can
really see what's going on and today we
had a chance with Nokia an AT&amp;amp;T to
unveil the Nokia Lumia 900 oh yes it's
really an incredible phone it's blazing
fast on the AT&amp;amp;T network it's got this
4.3 inch AMOLED clear black display and
it will be heavily promoted in all 2400
of AT&amp;amp;T stores here in the US in the
next in the next few months and really
with Windows 8 we've reimagined windows
all the way from the chipset through to
the user experience and it will deliver
a no-compromise experience the best of
the pc and the best of the tablet we
kick that off last year at CES and we're
even more excited this year
so here i am at start in Windows Start
is your home screen it's your starting
point and with Windows 8 we've
reimagined it to be immersive fast fluid
personal and dynamic the tiles they act
as a window into your apps without you
even having to launch them they are
alive and they're always up to date
Windows 8 is designed to work with touch
and with a mouse and mouse and keyboard
so no matter how large or how small your
screen or screens you have what you need
so whether you have a 10-inch screen or
4 30 inch HD screens Windows 8 is going
to bring you that no compromise
experience let me show you the magic of
voice with kinect xbox apps video games

quickly pull up games like gears 3 or
