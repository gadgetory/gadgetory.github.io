large but comfortably designed camera
that delivers a reasonable amount of
shooting flexibility for photographers
who are looking for a lot of controls
and better than point-and-shoot photo
quality the body has a real grip which
makes it nice for one-handed shooting
and there's tons of direct access
buttons and controls for quick operation
those include three slots on the mode
dial for custom settings and a couple of
programmable function buttons while it
offers a lot of straight shooting
features there aren't a lot of other
capabilities not just GPS or Wi-Fi but
there's only a few creative effects and
I'm not really crazy about the ones that
offers for example there's a really
interesting sounding zoom exposure mode
which produces the effect of zooming the
lens towards the subject but it really
only works in dim light some of the
dials tend to be a little easy to move
to and some of the buttons are less
responsive than I'd like for instance I
would occasionally press the shutter and
think I'd gotten the shot only to
discover nope you can't change the
volume of the shutter noise either so
the only way to confirm that you
actually got the shot is to keep that
loud intrusive sound enabled nikon is
also a bit behind the times with its
video controls there's no record button
and though you can control aperture and
shutter speed you can't zoom while
you're shooting and even though the
camera still has its articulated LCD
which canon dropped from the g15 Nikon
jettison the optical viewfinder and it
really should have a built-in lens cover
by now I found the performance a little
sluggish at least when shooting anything
involving RAW processing the images
seems to add a lot of overhead that
delays your ability to change settings
review photos or quickly take another
shot focusing in low lights also just a
little bit slow photo quality and good
light and at low ISO sensitivities is
quite good shots look sharp and colors
are pretty accurate like many of these
mid-range cameras however once you bump
up to about iso 400 edges get mushy in D
focused background
gets dinner II shooting raw improves
your ability to deal with some of the
blown out highlights and desaturation
and mid-range to high ISO shots but the
data is just too noisy to really improve
on the low light quality still it does
deliver better photos than you get with
a typical point and shoot this is a fine
camera that lots of people will like as
long as you don't get too into the pixel
peeping or action shooting I'm Laurie
grinning and this is the nikon coolpix
