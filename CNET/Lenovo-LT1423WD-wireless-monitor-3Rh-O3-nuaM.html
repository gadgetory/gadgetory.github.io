here at CES in Las Vegas taking a look
at the Lenovo mobile touch monitor so
this gadget might look like a tablet but
in fact there's no processing power
going on inside it's only a monitor and
it connects to a laptop or desktop over
Wi-Fi the monitor measures 13.3 inches
on the diagonal and it has a resolution
of 1600 x 900 pixels my first
impressions are that it doesn't look as
amazing as some other tablet displays
I've seen but will need more time with
it to really see how easy on the eye it
actually is the feather is quite compact
means it should be easy to carry around
with you all day but it's not the
slimmest device I've ever seen if you
spent on his side you can see it's a
little bit chunky its prodding the
screen with your meaty digits is who in
precise for your needs then you might
want to check out this optional stylus
which plugs into the corner here this is
a wacom stylus and it has 256 levels of
sensitivity if you're carrying this
thing around with you all day then you
don't really want to get it all
scratched up and looking horrible so the
novos got these two cover options
there's a hardcover and an apple Smart
Cover style folding affair if you want
to make this monitor stand up then
there's a small kickstand on the back
and I'm told with a hard cover case
there's also another kickstand thing
that you can use to prop it up at a more
steep angle if you're using the soft
cover case then just like the iPad it
folds up into a triangle and it rests on
that for support it's quite convenient
to use but it does mean you don't get
much choice when it comes to the angle
with the monitors standing at ER another
downside is that this monitor only works
with windows 8 devices let me know ipad
no Nexus 7 and no older windows kit it's
going to come in wireless and wired
versions Don told the wireless edition
will still connect by our cable as long
as you're using USB 3 the why version is
going to be out in the first few months
of 2013 but you have to wait until june
for the wireless version and let's face
it that's the one you really want as for
pricing this thing isn't going to come
cheap it's going to be three hundred and
forty nine dollars for the wired version
and four hundred and forty nine dollars
for the wireless one it's certainly an
interesting idea let us know if you
think it will catch on I'm the Westway
the cnet and that
the Novo mobile touch monitor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
