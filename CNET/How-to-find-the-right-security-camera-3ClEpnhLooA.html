they existed long before models like
Dropcam emerged on the scene but there
are a lot of new entrants into the
market that can really confuse your
buying options if you look at the
old-school IP security cameras like this
foscam model you will see a huge huge
difference between this more antiquated
style and the more modern day options
available one really big distinction is
the difference between a webcam and a
true security camera a webcam lets you
have a live stream so that you can see
what's happening in your home any time
of day while these webcams can't have
some security features like motion or
sound alerts they aren't complete
security solutions the scam that I
recently reviewed is a great example of
a webcam it has an excellent 1080p live
stream and it has some security features
but not a ton other models like Piper
envy and homeboy have built-in sirens
they have customizable alerts so you
have more control over when and how you
receive your notification and that's
really key when you're considering a
home security camera you want to
approximate real time so that if you're
at your office or away on vacation you
know that something is happening at your
house basically the moment it happens
another important consideration is the
quality of your video feed if you want
live streaming or if you want a really
clear recorded video clip you might want
HD so that's typically 720p or 1080p
obviously 1080 is the highest resolution
so you're more likely to get a clearer
image but if you have kind of a spotty
Wi-Fi connection it could actually eat
up a ton of bandwidth and cause
significant lag times that's where VGA
standard-definition 640 by 480 cameras
come into play
so they usually cost less which is great
but they also require less bandwidth the
downside is that the video quality isn't
as clear but if you're really just
looking to capture a general image or
video stream of what's happening they
can be a really really good option
something else worth considering is
where you want to install your security
camera most options come with a stand so
you can literally just stick them on to
a surface for the most pain free
installation possible this model
actually also has a magnetic base so you
could snap it onto a fridge or a filing
cabinet or any other magnetic surface
and while most models do need a power
adapter to function properly a lot of
newer options are battery-powered so you
can take them anywhere in your home for
a more flexible installation models like
the neck your are low and FLIR FX are
even rated for indoor or outdoor use so
you have even more options when you're
considering where to install them
another important thing to keep in mind
is whether you want to use a cloud
subscription service to store your
footage which usually costs an extra
monthly fee or if you want to store
things locally on a microSD card if you
go the cloud service route which a lot
of these cameras do offer you'll be
getting into some more advanced features
that can give you more control over home
automations one of these new features
that is sort of just emerging on the
scene is facial recognition we've been
talking about it for a long time but
we've observed it now into cameras so
it's kind of on its way although some of
the technology isn't quite refined yet
some other exciting things are
third-party integrations or even
integrations within the same brand
so nest cam for example can work with
Nest Learning Thermostat home boy and
the freemen eating app even have its
channels you can do more complicated
integrations with third-party devices I
have a very in-depth buying guide onto
Netcom that will help you get into more
of the nitty-gritty
and decide exactly what security camera
is right for your needs
