things
I'm your host is act time if you pay
attention to sites like C net you stay
well informed and know what's going on
in the tech world you think you know how
everything will turn out that's not
always the case sometimes the unexpected
happens today we're counting down the
top 5 surprise tech hits at number 5
netbooks remember these things for a
short while netbooks were all the rage
the Isuzu EPC uh sure did in the netbook
age these laptops could do little more
than browse the web hence the name some
had tiny screens the most important
thing about netbooks was the price they
were super cheap sure these computers
couldn't do much but who could complain
when these laptops cost a few hundred
bucks netbooks eventually died out
thanks to better phones and tablets at
number four is the Apple iPod $400 for a
music player you're out of your mind
Apple out of your mind the music player
market was well established in 2001 I'm
not talking about the digital music
player market I'm talking about the
music player market Sony was one of the
leaders in the field digital music
players were using solid-state memory
like your phone does and could hold a
handful of songs Apple used a tiny 1.8
inch spinning hard drive for its five
gigabyte iPod claiming it could hold
about a thousand songs in your pocket
analysts didn't think the iPod could
have legs since it was a Mac only
product at the time eventually Apple
open up the iPod to Windows users and
together with the iTunes music store put
together quite the powerhouse at number
three the Nintendo Wii how often do we
connect Nintendo is down for the count a
lot we thought the same thing back on
the Nintendo Wii was introduced
Microsoft and Sony were running the show
Nintendo decided it wasn't gonna play by
their rules by going with motion control
in the Nintendo Wii the graphics were
less than amazing the specs on the hard
work weren't spectacular but the
gameplay was flat-out funny the Nintendo
Wii was very difficult to purchase at
lunch because it was the it product
these days Nintendo's down for the count
right they can't ever come back right
right at number two the Apple iPad when
the iPad was introduced tablets already
existed
had largely failed why on earth would
have succeed now reaction city iPad's
introduction would mix as well why would
anyone want to use a big ipod touch why
would anyone want to use one of these
things also what about that new name
great questions people the iPad became a
huge hit for Apple iPads outsold Macs
and Apple reinvented the tablet market
larger phones seem to be eaten away
tablet sales but that's probably why
Apple introduced the iPad pro at number
one the Samsung Galaxy Notes when the
original Samsung Galaxy Note was
introduced it was described to have an
absolutely gigantic screen 5.3 inches
that's it insane well it was insane in
2011 that was really unusual it also
included a stylus which seemed like an
odd choice at the time Samsung often
ridiculed as lacking in creativity made
something different with the note it was
unlike all other phones in the market
its large size put it in the space
between phones and tablets so what does
Samsung do it sold 10 million units in
nine months huge phone huge hit and
there you go the top 5 surprise tech
kids what's that I can almost hear you
yelling at the screen first stop this is
innlive I can't really hear you second
