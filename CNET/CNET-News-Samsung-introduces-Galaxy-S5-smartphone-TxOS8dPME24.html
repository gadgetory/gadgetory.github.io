hands a smartphone has never felt better
the back cover is perforated for a
comfortable natural grip the shimmer you
see here is the heart of its modern glam
look a result of this unique perforation
design this is electric blue do you see
how it catches the light the s5 will
also come in a shimmery white a charcoal
black and copper gold so we've refined
the user interface so it's clean vibrant
with a unique geometric pattern inspired
by the prism effect of diamonds do you
see the new unlocking effect here the
overall look is clearly simple and
uncluttered when you toggle the settings
menu here you see a new collection of
icons that are larger more visual and
easier to navigate once your favorite
app right at the tip of your finger our
one touch toolbox is here for you now
let's take a closer look at this
mesmerizing device and the display of
the galaxy s5 which is a 5.1 Super
AMOLED screen with Full HD this delivers
a superior viewing experience ever
brighter than TFT LCDs found in other
smartphones another advanced technology
local contrast enhancement uses a new
algorithm to automatically analyze and
say
to display under changing light
conditions so when you will use your
Galaxy s5 in the Blazing Sun of
Barcelona it will be clearer and easier
to see but we thought about the opposite
situation - you can now make your
display extremely dim more than ever
before so your eyes will feel more
comfortable in the dark or when you
don't want to bother the people around
you last but not least adaptive display
or enhanced display technology analyzes
the incoming light and the content
you're viewing to optimise the screen
and give you the best viewing experience
and to provide this all day long we have
significantly increased a battery
capacity now with our optimized power
management the galaxy s5 boasts 10 hours
of web surfing with an LTE connection
and an even longer 12 hours of video
playback that's a lot of cats videos the
camera is core the galaxy s5 has a new
fast autofocus technology a new HDR mode
for pictures and videos and new other
features like selective focus to help
you take better pictures let me give you
a snapshot of this great camera for the
first time in a smart phone our new
hybrid autofocus combines standard
contrast AF with a technology usually
found in professional DSLRs called phase
detection we put this hybrid AF on a 16
megapixel sensor which is even larger
than the S force along with a new
companion chipset for image processing
so users get increased precision faster
response time and a much more exciting
camera experience
so no matter how quickly your subject
moves be it pigeons circling la Sagrada
fam√≠lia or your kids winning goal you'll
be able to capture the moment in just
0.3 seconds this is the fastest ever or
a focus for a smartphone now let's talk
about high dynamic range what we call
rich tone as you know HDR is a solution
for taking good photos when there is too
little or too much light but to get
satisfactory results you know you have
to remain stable very stable and it
takes precious time to process the
images too so how is our new rich tone
node better well it instantly controls
the light exposure at the moment you
focus to give you in real time a picture
that has the contrast of real life so
what you see is what you get and not
only for still pictures now HDR also
works for videos this is also a
smartphone first now let's say you want
a little more edge to your photography
one of the benefits of using a DSLR
camera is the shallow depth of field
with our new feature called selective
focus you get a similar control of
what's in focus and what isn't allowing
you to apply this kind of out of focus
effect like a pro this is a cool way to
take your pictures to the next level
this is a great camera that our
customers will love as our mobile
experience advances we need the fastest
network to sustain high traffic volume
so galaxy s5 comes with full LTE
coverage supporting category 4 and up to
8 bands in any given region this allows
remarkable data connection with every
carrier beside coverage we all want
faster network speed no more buffering
that's why we've combined the fifth
generation of Wi-Fi with the new memo
technology to nearly double Wi-Fi
connection speeds and this also is a
world first in smartphones but that's
still not all the download booster
marries this enhanced Wi-Fi connection
with LTE and this combination will give
you blazing fast download like never
before
imagine a gigabyte in just 30 seconds
that means your full HD movie is ready
to go before your microwave popcorn has
finished popping now that's speed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
