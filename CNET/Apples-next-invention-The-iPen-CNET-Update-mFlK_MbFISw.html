addiction to draw something and tilt our
heads on the axis I'm Bridget Carey and
this is Jersey head update yahoo has
launched a new way for you to search the
web with Yahoo axis it's not a browser
but rather it's a plugin that attaches
to your browser for the desktop and it's
also a standalone app for Apple devices
so why use it well it's supposed to be a
faster way to search start typing in
your search term and a horizontal bar
will showcase thumbnail previews of
websites you can jump to also your
searches and bookmarks are saved across
all devices that use access but it seems
Yahoo just launched this quickly without
smoothing out all the details for one a
security hole was found in the browser
add-on and that desktop version can be
irritating to use it attaches itself to
the bottom left corner and blocks
anything in that space I couldn't use a
Google Doc spreadsheet because of it but
regardless of the fixes needed
this is Yahoo's attempt to stand out as
an innovator I mean just check out this
advertisement
bro I just head-butted the internet and
got glass shards in my eye
I was totally awesome in other news were
watching Apple has filed a patent for
something called the eye pen it would be
a stylus that gives feedback with
vibration and it would feel different
depending on how the pen was pressed or
how quickly it moved across the screen
the website patently Apple was first to
uncover this but remember Apple often
files patents for products that never
become real the idea was originally
filed with the Patent Office at the end
of 2010 but it was made public Thursday
after a month the case of Oracle versus
Google is at its end the jury found that
Google did not infringe on two of
Oracle's patents Oracle has been
claiming that Google should have paid up
for using Java language as the backbone
of the Android operating system
the jury was dismissed now the judge has
to make a final call on another question
whether api's can be copyrighted if the
judge says no that's another win for
Google the trial starts back up on
Tuesday to address that question the
updated Google Plus app is now available
for Android users aside from the snazzy
new look it also lets users edit posts
from the app and start a video chat
hangout using an Android phone or tablet
hangout requests can also ring on the
phone like an incoming phone call and
today we're keeping our eye on the app
Draw Something it was once a really
popular pictionary like game for Apple
devices within the first two weeks it
hit 10 million downloads and everyone
was addicted and ever since Zynga bought
it the number of monthly users has
drastically dropped but Zynga told The
Wall Street Journal that this game isn't
dead it's still got growth ahead also
it's throwing you more advertisements in
the game to boost revenue that's your
