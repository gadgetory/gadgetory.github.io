big desktop replacement models we
usually see are becoming less expensive
I've got a new one right here I'm van
Ackerman and this is the main gear pulse
14 now unlike a lot of the big desktop
replacement laptops that have gaming
components in them and a 14-inch you're
probably not to get the highest end
graphics card this does have one of
Nvidia's new 800 series cards in this
case it's a geforce 850 which is a good
opera drange card it's not it's not the
fastest card possible you can find but
you probably couldn't fit that into such
a small chassis now the plastic body on
the pulse 14 is a little generic looking
that's because a lot of boutique PC
makers get kind of off the self chassis
and then they customize them they put in
their own components they find to numb
they usually add like a little logo or a
back panel over here this is the main
gear logo but other than that you're not
dealing with the fanciest looking most
sort of you know Apple constructed from
a single block of aluminum type laptop
around that said it's pretty inoffensive
even though it's you know kind of
plastic 8 the main selling point here is
for about thirteen hundred dollars you
get a full 1080p screen you get a fast
core i7 CPU you have a decent geforce
850 video card you don't however get a
touchscreen something I still think
gaming laptops need and that's a big
disappointment especially considering
some other smaller gaming laptops like
the new razor blade 14 have touchscreens
and even higher resolution screens and
of course clue or designs they are
however a lot more expensive so if you
want to gets portable and game worthy
but doesn't cost a fortune then you have
to accept a few trade-offs I'm van
Ackerman and that's the main gear pulse
