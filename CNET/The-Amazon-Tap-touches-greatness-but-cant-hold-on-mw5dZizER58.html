same powers as its big sister the Amazon
echo but it's smaller cheaper and
battery power the tap is a hundred and
thirty dollars so the echo is 180 just
like with the echo you can use the tap
as a Bluetooth speaker a Wi-Fi streamer
it can be a personal assistant a smart
home control hub before you can just use
it for fun big difference between the
echo and the tap is that this guy's
battery-powered so because you don't
need to keep it plugged in can you take
it with you so we can keep your company
when you're working in the garage doing
dishes in the kitchen or even playing
fetch with pepper in the park
the catch is without Wi-Fi it's pretty
much just a Bluetooth speaker you won't
even have voice controls without a
connection but it does work with mobile
hotspots if you want to use your phone
to keep it in it and the trailer for the
battery-powered tap is that it's not
always listening like the echo anytime
you want to talk to it you have to hit
this button even when it's not it's a
charging station it still sometimes find
myself calling this thing Alexa which is
the echos wake word even though this one
doesn't have one on its own you hit a
button you don't need a wake work so
it's less useful as a smart home hub
since it's not always listening and you
need to keep it with as a compact
bluetooth speaker in its own right it's
pretty good it's just not great you're
gonna hear voices clearly which is nice
but the base is a little bit thin and
it's gonna distort at high values so the
tap can do a whole lot so if you want
the power of echo the power of Alexa and
you really value portability or you just
want a blue to
speaker that can do a lot more it's
certainly worth a look that said it's
also a master of none so if you want a
device that really specializes in one of
those talents you'll want to look out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
