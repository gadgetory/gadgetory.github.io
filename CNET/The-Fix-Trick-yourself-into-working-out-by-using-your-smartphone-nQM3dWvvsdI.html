have new and improved features that
track your every step and all your
calories burned my problem is I need
more than numbers and charts actually
motivate me out of my chair if you need
more than achievements and milestones
help get you motivated I'm gonna show
you two apps that put the fun in front
of the fitness first up we have an app
called the walk it's 299 and you can
find it for both iOS and Android and
it's basically like an audiobook
thriller where you advance through the
story by walking each story has its own
fictional map and as you walk you come
across a little audio clips that advance
the story along and keep you entertained
as you go the stories are all very
cloak-and-dagger you're a spy saving the
world from a terrorist plot and it sucks
you in pretty quickly and keeps you
going because you want to know what
happens next to drop their Walker if you
don't mind walking together we might be
able to pull that same trick any other
check when we come to I've got the
device yes I'll put it on the table
under your papers you'll pick it up
after a few moments and slip it into
your pocket
good find a private place to open it
before you arrive I'm sure you've been
briefed the same as I have I have to see
you on to that train ticket umbra then
you're on your own so underneath it all
you're still getting all the same
benefits of a fitness app is tracking
your steps it's giving you goals and
achievements as you progress you're
gonna get more goals and more story and
that's gonna get you hooked we're just
hoping we can get you out of here in
time come on before they spot you I see
you've got I like the whole system and I
like that all of a civ you is to walk no
running no jogging no shame in walking
at a leisurely pace now on the downside
the little bits of the story that get
doled out can be frustratingly brief
sometimes I'm tempted to just download a
Tom Clancy audiobook and cut to the
chase just assuming that looks pretty
aerial by itself for something a little
more intense there's zombies run 399 for
this one also available for iOS and
Android and a lot of people love this
app if you want to move what's more
motivating than the thought of a horde
of zombies chasing you now the story
here is that you're in the midst of a
zombie apocalypse in your running to
pick up supplies for your town again the
map is fictional so you can be running
around your neighborhood or running
around a treadmill it doesn't really
matter all that matters is that you're
moving the audio story here is just as
good as the one on the walk plus it has
zombies and also this app gives you a
farmville style town that you can
upgrade and add on to what the supplies
you bring back but if you start slacking
your town can get raided by zombies and
then you've let all your virtual people
down
now the downsides of this app is that it
can be fairly demanding physically the
best place for it's probably I'm like a
treadmill or someplace where you can run
like crazy when the zombies attack and
not run to the street like an idiot
we've spoken to Mullins the base you
came from and they're not willing to
send down another helo until we know who
fired that rocket launcher at you what I
like most about this app though is that
the gaming element can get addictive and
you want that also you can load up music
playlists in the app and just have your
zombie run goals drop in periodically
I've been taking you on a quick tour
around the perimeter of the base today
and show you the main routes into the
city should be a quick easy run so if
you're feeling the need to get
physically fit but charts and graphs
aren't enough to get you going try one
of these apps I mean a personal trainer
would be great but sometimes it takes a
zombie or a secret agent or two to
really keep things interesting
