standing beside the GE Profile series
French door refrigerator model p ft28 RS
HSS now this is a high-end GE model it
costs $3,100 one of the most expensive
fridges that they sell and they justify
the cost with a very nice slate of
features you've got the LCD touchscreen
front and center here to help you
control the water dispenser and the
icemaker and it's actually a dual
Lysimachus or of the fridge another
separate one in the freezer to give you
a little extra ice and also you get this
temperature controlled flex drawer down
at the bottom of the fridge this drawer
has different presets for meat beverage
and deli so if you have cheese or
something delicate you want to keep down
there to nice steady temperature it'll
do that but it's really that water
dispenser that's the key feature here is
surprising usually the water dispenser
is pretty low on the list of notable
features in a fridge not with the
profile series this thing has some very
cool tricks up its sleeve primarily the
precise fill and autofill functions you
see there on the right precise fill lets
you select an exact amount of water that
you want it to dispense out so if you've
got a mac and cheese recipe that needs
four cups of water just set up to four
cups and hit go autofill is even cooler
in my opinion you set any pot any glass
any pitcher down below the dispenser you
can pull this drawer out for big stuff
and it'll automatically fill it up till
it's just about full and then stop so
you can set a pot down hit auto fill
walk away start cooking something else
and come back and your pops ready for
you with a full amount of water that's a
very cool feature something that I would
use all the time
still the profile series isn't perfect
has some performance quirks that I found
it was a little bit spiky with the
defrost and very steep defrost cycles
that brought the temperature up higher
than I'd like both in the top shelf of
the freezer and the top shelf of the
fridge nothing that disqualifies it
though nothing that is a deal breaker
here it's just not quite as good as you
might want at the price also the
usability was a little bit cramped I had
a tough time getting our test groceries
in and fitting in the bulky stress test
items that we test with and moving those
shelves around was a real pain there was
some of the hardest to move around
without actually breaking them that I've
ever
tested all that said if you want a
high-end model that's got a very nice
set of features you really can't go
wrong with the profile series it's got a
lot of bang for the buck with those
bells and whistles and that water
dispenser is about as cool as a fridge
feature comes thanks for watching check
