put it to the test
I'm Bridget Carey this is your CNET
update many retailers dream of crushing
Amazon but there's a brand new shopping
website that's actually taking on the
challenge jet comm launched Tuesday it
says it can not only beat Amazon's
prices but it's scanning the web to
offer the lowest prices from any site
jet is a shopping Club you have to pay
$50 a year to use the site and that's
where it makes all its money Jets hole
pitch is that the more you shop the more
you save on some items the idea is that
if the items are coming from the same
warehouse it's cheaper to ship it
together with your other items so it'll
shave some money off your total you can
also knock off a few cents of the total
by waiving your right to return the item
now to see if it was really cheaper than
Amazon I took it for a spin all right
let's see how this whole discount thing
works let's do a little shopping well go
in here I need some household items
let's pick up some Clorox
all right I'm saving 59 cents keep going
let's get some swiffers adding that to
cart oh okay getting some interesting
savings alerts just keep it going um you
know what I need some Dixie Cups for the
bathroom let's see okay I'll grab one of
these add to cart oh I feel like I'm at
a casino here it just keeps a roll in
the numbers I don't know what this even
means all right so far I'm saving four
dollars and 53 cents keep it going you
know what I need some socks
oh no sucks
available at all okay so I continued on
my journey and picked up a shower
curtain my total price came to about 31
dollars which was cheaper than picking
out the exact same items from Amazon so
yes jet was cheaper but there are a few
other things you have to keep in mind
jets membership only gives you free
delivery when you spend 35 dollars or
more and delivery for many household
items is one or two days but some things
could take five days I remember how it
didn't sell any socks the site has an
answer for that called jet anywhere if
you use jet as a portal to another web
site like Macy's
and then go shopping on there you can
earn points to spend later on gedcom but
to get the points you have to forward an
order confirmation email back to Jett
it's a huge hassle but it's part of the
startups awkward growing phase and it's
gonna be a long awkward phase in fact
it's losing money with some orders
because it doesn't actually carry many
items yet so its employees are buying
them on your behalf from other stores
like wal-mart and JCPenney and then
shipping it to you that's the plan until
it can secure more retail partners the
founder and CEO mark lower said in
interviews that it won't be profitable
until it gets about fifteen million
members which may happen in five years
but you might as well check it out now
to see how it works it's free to try for
the first three months that's it for
