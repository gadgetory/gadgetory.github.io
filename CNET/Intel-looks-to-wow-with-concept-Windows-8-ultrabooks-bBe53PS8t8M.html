touchscreen and how it's done and two
things if you believe me say wow and if
you don't believe me go later on to this
notebook try it touch it and then tell
me wow what do we have over here because
I believe this is something that we
actually we stretch it another level
right sure so this again is the same
Intel concept our ultrabook this one
actually running windows 8 and it also
has sensors everyone's used to sense
your last letter although I didn't
practice it ok so now I'll let you pick
it up and do it so we've got a sensors
that we added to the Ultrabook so first
of all when you need to speak a location
it will not ask you where you are and
you need to put your drift your address
it will be done automatically but more
than that if I take it and I believe
this google as i can navigate it and use
all the great compute power that you've
got an i5 and I core and I'm not sure
that many other thing will be able to
deliver such an application either the
same time enjoy both worlds so we can
see over here and again if you'll be
able to try it later on how the sensors
are working with these ultrabooks and I
can see already people asking cynical
yes but it's a clamshell so let me
promise you two things first of all it's
very comfortable to do it with a
clamshell it's beautiful but some of the
systems are going to be clam shells like
this it's an based but if you would like
to do it you'll have it as a tablet
thank you guys by the way this section
did you hear what they just said but
what you can see over here is the way
that you'll see many of those we call it
sliders or convertibles we just open it
we took it and then we can take the
compute power that we've got in a core
processor and use all the great days
that we can do on a pc but if you want
to do it as a tablet you can have your
tablet with you and then you can have
the touch that you have seen you can
have the sensors although my personal
belief is that people will use
touchscreen with their ultrabook
even in a clamshell and people will use
the sensors and after few weeks that you
use it you'll be surprised you will not
be able to do anything without it so
what you see over here is the ultrabooks
and we've got it on Microsoft Windows 8
that you all have seen the tiles and it
will run even better so the first
example was an ultrabook as windows 7
and once we are working with microsoft
windows 8 will be able to get even
better experience and having the tile
experience with the rest of the
applications the other thing i would
like to share with you is the Nikiski
Nikiski sounds like a very strange name
I agree this was a concept that the guys
in our guy elad thought about and I
disclosed it in computex and what I show
this this is Nikiski this is how it
looks like let me go on stage so people
be able to see and the idea was the
following it's an ultrabook that you can
type everything on a normal way but over
here we've got a touch pad that you can
move the mouth using the touchpad but
the interesting thing is that when you
are on the go you can close the kiski
the touchpad is transparent let me show
you how it's transparent can you see my
finger yeah it's transparent and you can
see the data that you no need what is my
next meeting did I get an email and when
you've got something urgent you don't
need to go immediately to your phone or
to eat a bit to another device you'll
have it on the go so you'll be able to
enjoy both world a very powerful
notebook but when you're on the go
you'll have all your data with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
