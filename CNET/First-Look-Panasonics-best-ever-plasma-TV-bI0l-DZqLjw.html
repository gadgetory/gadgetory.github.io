sitting next to the Panasonic TCP VT 50
series this is a 65 inch plasma this
series is also available in a 55 inch
size this review will apply to both
sizes this is Panasonic's best
television for 2012 and in my opinion
the best plasma TV the company has ever
made and the second best ever after the
legendary pioneer Kuro that's long
discontinued TVs picture quality is its
real strength we'll get to that in a
little bit but let's take a look first
at its design this is a nicest looking
Panasonic Plasma when seen from the
outside with a picture turned off - it's
got the company's signature full pane of
glass that fronts both the bezel and the
screen for a really smooth integrated
look there's also a relatively thin
bezel on this TV and the seen from the
side it's about 2 inches deep even if
it's 65 inch size so it's a thin TV
overall all told one of the nicer
looking plasma TVs I've ever seen and
that's saying something it's a little
bit better than the LG and Samsung
designs from this year the one downside
of the design is this two-tone stand
here that fades from a silver to a black
but just gives you another excuse to
wall mount the television as Panasonic's
flagship the set includes all the bells
and whistles you'd expect it as a 2 thx
modes a 96 Hertz setting for 1080p 24
and a bunch of other things to adjust
picture quality improvements TV also has
a little bit better screen filter than
it stepped down linemates we'll get to
that one of the more visible step ups is
this remote control it's actually a
little touch pad designed for use with a
thumb it's actually a little bit better
than the touch pad found on Samsung's
TVs it's a lot more responsive and you
can whizz through at things like Netflix
and Vudu thumbnails really easily
of course TV has a built-in web browser
the remote is designed to work with that
too but we really didn't find the web
browser all that compelling one of the
downsides of this remote of course is
that if you have a universal remote you
have to add the second one your coffee
table if you want to use it
Panasonic VIERA CAST online features
have plenty of content including Vudu
and a whole bunch of other video
streaming services not quite as much
audio but again it's pretty darn good
this VT 50 also has a dual core
processor so things are a little bit
snappier when you move around the
internet services there's also a little
multitasking going on here you can flip
a button and pop up to see the last few
used apps that you have I also like the
fact that you can customize the app home
screens with the app
you want and not the ones that the
manufacturer wants you to look at one
downside is TVs app suite has built in
advertising so there is a little banner
that pops up when you first turn on the
TV however you can disable that so I'd
recommend you do so around back the set
has plenty of inputs including four HDMI
USB and a component video input if you
have a breakout cable there's also a SD
card slot so you can look at photos
really quickly from digital cameras one
downside of the feature set is Panasonic
doesn't include 3d glasses with this TV
you're going to have to buy them they're
about 65 bucks apiece you can however
opt for the Samsung glasses there are
$20 and third-party glasses coming out
in the future we'll probably even be
lower priced the VT 50 also has the
ability to adjust the picture more ways
than I've seen on any other TV there's a
two point and a ten point grayscale full
color management system as well as a
full gamma control system these controls
didn't work quite as well as we've seen
on some Samsung and LG TVs however
that's really not that big of a deal
though because the thx modes are
excellent out of the box you get a
bright room and a cinema setting that
according to our measures performed
extremely well speak and performance the
V 250 is the best looking plasma TV I've
tested this year and I don't expect any
other plasma perform better it's going
to be right up there with the OLED and
the elite sharp tv coming out a little
bit later in this year but both of those
LED and the sharp are going to be a lot
more expensive than this set so this is
a very high-end TV but the picture
quality is superb the butene 50 also has
a brand new screen filter for this year
which means that it rejects ambient
light better than any other plasma TV
I've seen it keeps those black levels
regardless of how bright the overhead
lighting is which is a real plus anyway
that's a quick look at Panasonic's tcp
VT 50 series again the best performing
plasma TV I've seen this year I'm David
