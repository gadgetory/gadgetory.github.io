brought back from the dead and o8 but
left it in the grave for us here in the
US thanks for that we get a few days the
whole forum afterlife experience let's
drive this 2014 Scirocco are no still
not coming to the US and check the tech
now I loved the first generation car one
of the best things Giorgetto Giugiaro
ever did here is the new Scirocco very
different there's hardly a corner on the
whole thing and notice the wrist
strength this car has most little cars
when they want to get sporty get really
gaudy they really try hard this one
doesn't care if you notice it very
subtle but a design you don't see a lot
in the US sort of the short but long low
sleek hatchback kind of cars we just
don't buy here very often maybe that's
why they don't bring it here now well
the Scirocco looks real different on the
outside it doesn't look unfamiliar at
all on the inside you've seen this VW
design language in just about all of
their cars especially on the golf a
couple of nice crisp gauges up there
just being a Euro Car it's kilometers
only you've got these VW controllers on
the wheel for volume and changing some
of the displays in the center of the
dash head unit this is I think the top
of the line model right here it's got
navigation optical disc SD card the way
you do your portables is via one of
these MD eyes they call it a
multi-device interface I'm not crazy
about it because I'd rather have USB
they'd have to go by proprietary
pigtails all the time and you know I
hate the fact that you can't actually
put your portable in there and close the
door but what really matters in this car
is the driving hardware starts up here
with a comfort normal or sports selector
for your suspension this is an adaptive
suspension you've got in this vehicle
called the
and have a chassis control it runs
independently of your drive modes this
is a dual clutch DSG gearbox in Europe
it's also available with a 6-speed
manual back for drive one more detent
for sport up and over it gets you into a
manual gate that holds to redline and
this is gonna be a key part of this
vehicle's personality especially when
you've got a small turbocharged motor
your gearbox has to be really good
because the engine can't just grunt its
way through any situation now notice I
put this guy in Reverse all I hear is a
bunch of beeping because we've got an
optical sensor system in the back
interesting lis the our model does not
seem to be available with a rear camera
I think others sure ACOs are it's a
weird little omission but that kind of
gets us to the thenot this vehicle has
very little in the way of driver
assistance there's no blind spot
detection there's no lane departure
there's no adaptive cruise there's just
cruise control this is actually a very
simple car even loaded I was tuning
around the radio here and it just races
through all the frequencies because it
uses a bunch of odd numbers so when I
tried to get to 740 KCBS here in San
Francisco the best I could do was 738
station list there is no station list to
the am band available she would beat
your ass over a school bench if you said
the wrong thing to her love that
now under the very low snoot on this car
you've got a very nice little motor
compact yes 2 litre inline-four sitting
sidesaddle TSI it is a turbocharged
motor direct injection brings valve
timing of course all the usual modern
tricks of motoring the numbers 261 horse
258 foot-pounds of torque
nice torque number because of that turbo
in there you're sitting sidesaddle and
driving the front wheels only a big
differentiator from a Golf R here in the
US which would have all-wheel drive this
guy does not come that way 5.8 0 to 60
for a car that weighs about 30 170
pounds don't have a really good
translation of mpg from Euro standards
to us but a Golf R for example gets
about 1927 with a similar layout do what
happens when I drive this car I hate it
because it reminds me what we don't get
in this country really sharp European
cars that are not sports cars but are
more sporting than a lot of sports cars
if you know what I mean three things you
come away from in this vehicle first of
all best implementation of a turbo I
think I have ever driven secondly when
you're in sport mode on this DSG at
least for my taste it shifts exactly as
I would shift and the linearity of the
steering I find real good I'm not sure
if it's variable or how its mapped all I
know is it feels right in every part of
the clock on just about every radius of
turn I really enjoy driving these fun
okay it's a little hard to price the car
they don't sell here but let me give it
to you in pound sterling and don't just
do a currency conversion it doesn't work
that way with cars twenty-eight thousand
pounds for the Scirocco are with a
manual 6-speed gearbox that Maps roughly
to where a Golf R is in the US market so
we're in the rough ballpark it's held
back only by its lack of four-wheel
drive for today's modern purist but this
is a vehicle I would buy if they brought
it here me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
