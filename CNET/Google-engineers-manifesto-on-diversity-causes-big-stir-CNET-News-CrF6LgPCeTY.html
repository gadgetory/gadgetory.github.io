causing controversy according to
motherboard a document entitled Google's
ideological echo chamber has been
circulating within the company the 10
page document was written by a Google
software engineer and it is the personal
opinion of that engineer Gizmodo
published a post in its entirety in the
memo the author says women are
underrepresented in technology partially
due to biological reasons quote I'm
simply stating that the distribution of
preferences and abilities of men and
women differ in parts due to biological
causes and these differences may explain
why we don't see equal representation of
women in tech and leadership the
document went on to say we also need to
stop assuming that gender gaps imply
sexism reports say the memo was met with
negative feedback by a majority of the
employees who've seen it Google is
currently being investigated by the US
Department of Labor for systematically
paying its female employees less than it
pays men the company also issued an
internal response to the memo which was
obtained by motherboard the response was
written by Google's vice president of
diversity integrity and governance
danielle brown in it she says part of
building an open inclusive environment
means fostering a culture in which those
with alternative views including
different political views feel safe
sharing their opinions but that
discourse needs to work alongside the
principles of equal employment found in
our code of conduct policies and
anti-discrimination laws for more
