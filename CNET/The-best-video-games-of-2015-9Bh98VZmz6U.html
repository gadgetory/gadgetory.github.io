terms of quality releases but I couldn't
possibly play them all but of the ones I
did these are my top video games of the
year course keep in mind that these are
no specific order so be sure you stick
around to make sure your favorite game
made my list Ori and the blind forest is
a gorgeous open-world platforming
adventure game that I adored from way
back in March you love those old-school
Metroid and Castlevania games that play
style or it is for you up next is
blood-borne this game had it all a
horrific atmosphere terrifying enemies
and a difficulty that may or may not
have made me cry myself to sleep
blood-borne is not for the timid but
it's easily one of 2015's best back in
June Rocksteady Studios finished their
Arkham trilogy with batman arkham knight
sure the pc version of this game was
kind of a hot mess but the console
versions fared much better he game
introduced the Batmobile and was one of
the best looking titles of the year if
you didn't play the witcher 3 wild hunt
you need to do that right now this
massive open world action role-playing
game was a joy to roam and explore and
is probably the largest game terms of
scale and scope that you'll ever play so
I had a rocket League addiction for
three months straight from seemingly out
of nowhere the game became one of the
year's most addictive online titles the
rules are simple two teams of cars have
to bounce a ball into the other team's
goal but it's frenetic pace in action
made this a competitive gamers dream and
solidified it as an esports instant
classic and one single release nintendo
was able to unlock the dreams of a
generation with super mario maker giving
wii u owners access to a legacy of super
mario brothers assets spanning across
multiple generations endless potential
and an infinite amount of downloadable
levels makes it one of 2015's most
impressive releases the wii u also had
one of the year's best online shooters
platoons third
person team-based multiplayer proved to
be a winning formula out of the gate
with players competing to cover a map
with their team's paint all while
battling it out with paint based weapons
and abilities 2015 also saw the return
of snake in Metal Gear Solid 5 the
phantom pain this game delivered on
nearly every level weaving an intricate
and bizarre story into the Metal Gear
universe stealth and action gameplay
were all top notch the game introduced
new play styles as well to the series I
had a blast this year with until dawn
this ps4 exclusive put you in control of
a winter cabin teen horror story now I'm
sure you've played these butterfly
effect games before but until dawn
actually pulled it off in thrilling
fashion
we went back to the wasteland this year
and fallout for the worst kept secret in
gaming sure it played a lot like fallout
3 and new vegas but exploring the
Commonwealth building settlements and
looting the world never felt so good
rise of the Tomb Raider seem to improve
on the 2013 reboot in multiple
categories including my personal
favorite more tombs rise of the Tomb
Raider featured gorgeous environments
jaw-dropping action sequence and like I
don't know like 30 fights with bears
2015 was another stellar year for indie
games and undertail might be the year's
best it's an endlessly clever and at
times flat-out hilarious RPG with a
unique combat system and totally
memorable storyline I also loved axiom
verge another throwback title with a
retro art style carved from that
Metroidvania age we all grew up playing
but the way axiom verge combined old and
new school gaming tropes is what made it
shine and kept me glued to my seat
kerbal space program really surprised me
this year proving itself as a really
compelling if totally silly space
simulator this one had endless replay
value as you attempt to launch tiny
kerbals into space without accidentally
killing them all finally on my list is
life is strange I'm narrative-driven
tale that thrives on the woes of being a
teenager I've heard this one described
as Donnie Darko meets my so-called life
and if that's not enough to get you
interested well I don't know what is
so there you have it these are my
favorite games of 2015 like I sit at the
top couldn't possibly play everything
the year had to offer so be sure to
sound off on Twitter let me know what
you loved in 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
