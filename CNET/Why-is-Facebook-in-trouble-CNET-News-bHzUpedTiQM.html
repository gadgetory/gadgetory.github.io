its data a researcher appears to have
taken more than 50 million people's
profiles and handed it over to a data
analytics company which then turned
around and used it for political
advertising both in the brexit campaign
and in the 2016 election so what we're
learning is that Facebook hasn't been
able to keep control of our data very
well and it didn't do much in between to
make sure it was safe once they found
out it was it was taken out
Cambridge analytic is a data analytics
company that worked with a University
researcher who created an app that
ostensibly gave you a personality quiz
but actually was designed to take your
information and that of your friends
from Facebook and then hand it over to
this research company this data
analytics company which turned around
and used it for political advertising
this company by the way says that it has
information on 230 million American
voters that's pretty much all of us so
that is what they are using to work with
political campaigns Cambridge analytic
Oh received this information from the
researcher and that's where this gets
bad so the university researcher created
this app people wanted to use the app
they login they give him access to their
information so far everything is above
board that's totally normal for Facebook
where it gets bad is that he then handed
that information over to another person
without asking any of us and that is
where it's against Facebook's rules
facebook says app developers can receive
information about you whatever doesn't
matter
but once they hand it over to someone
else that's where they're breaking the
rules
Christopher Wiley is one of the
researchers who actually worked with
Cambridge analytic and is now the
whistleblower who has basically blown
the lid off this whole thing Donald
Trump's campaign actually worked with
Cambridge analytic afore well Steve
Bannon his chief strategist in the White
House was an advisor for them the Mercer
family who helped fund his campaign was
also involved with Cambridge analytics
so there's a wat involved here the White
House tells CBS News that the Trump
campaign did not use Cambridge
analytical during the general election
but during the primaries the company
helped Trump figure out what kind of
messaging to use where to go and how to
do advertising at the end of the day
your data is being accessed by all sorts
of different people app developers
researchers all sorts of things
the problem is Facebook doesn't always
tell us and in this case Facebook found
out three years ago that this company
had supposedly broken its rules and
taken 50 million peoples profiles and
when they told them to delete it the New
York Times reporting says that they lied
so there's a problem here Facebook isn't
being fully on forthright with all of us
and it turns out that possibly a huge
leak of information happened that none
of us are comfortable with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
