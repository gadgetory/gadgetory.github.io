hands very soon and if you're curious
what's inside the box
this is an iPhone 10 and we're gonna
unbox it and show you what's inside the
packaging now from the outside the 10 is
in a pretty iPhone familiar box white
box graphic on the front you know the
drill
we'll open it up and show you what comes
inside so so far just like another
iPhone that you may have gotten before a
recent iPhone the little packet here
with the instructions or the micro
instructions
you've got stickers you've got the fine
print here's the 10 on top now this is
the the silver model so both iPhones
have black fronts but the color changes
depending on the back and it's like a
nice nice heft to it steel sides and
we're gonna take that plastic off the
thing so now now the iPhone 10 is out in
the open
there it is and below it you've got
similar to other iPhones the standard
power adapter right here and we've also
got Lightning headphones with the dongle
which has been standard since the iPhone
7 which comes included and of course
these headphones have have lightning and
underneath here you've got your
lightning cable and that's it that's
what's inside the iPhone 10 package so
it really does feel packaging wise like
the iPhone 8 like the iPhone 8 plus
similar design inside the phone does
feel a lot like an iPhone 7 or an iPhone
8 it feels denser it's a little bit
thicker um as a nice feel it's glossy
and turn on for a sec
turning on notice a no home button of
course the camera placement shifted so
now it's vertical and we'll see what
happens when it comes up the iPhone 10
its key features are of course the true
depth camera on front which takes over a
part of the otherwise full screen and
it's an OLED display this time also this
has a slightly different camera inside
this as a an improved telephoto with
optical image stabilization so that's
another big feature
so basically display that camera which
can do 3d depth sensing and takes over
the biometrics face ID which replaces
touch ID and that's it so you basically
can see the display here it feels bigger
but it's also longer and so it's
slightly different screen dimensions
than the 8 plus or the 7 plus so that's
a look at what's inside the box with the
iPhone 10 I'm Scott Stein here at C net
stay tuned for a lot more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
