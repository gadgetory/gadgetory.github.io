the KitchenAid electric freestanding
range
architects series 2 model number ke rs30
3b SS so this one thousand three hundred
and forty nine dollar range is kind of
in the mid price range it has most of
the basic features it has broil
convection traditional modes but it also
has a few special extras on the cooktop
I like that you can adjust the burners
it has five different burners the four
on the outside are for regular cooking
the one in the middle back is for
warming the left front burner can adjust
to six nine or twelve inches to
accommodate pretty much any style pot
and the wattage will adjust accordingly
the right front burner has an extra high
wattage output so it can go from ultra
low to ultra high and the rear left
burner has a melt feature so there's
really a lot of customization built in
to this range one design element I
really like about this range is that it
combines knobs and the display buttons a
lot of the newer ranges have just a
large panel display buttons that kind of
get cluttered and I think the knobs add
a little bit of that professional chef
style element to this making it seem a
little bit higher end than it actually
is as far as the oven itself it has a
6.2 cubic foot capacity that's pretty
huge so while all that stuff sounds good
on paper it didn't really translate to
outstanding performance so the most
obvious thing we noticed during testing
was how long it takes to cook stuff
especially in the oven
we roasted whole chickens in three
different comparable ovens and this one
took so much longer the other two
averaged you know around an hour and 15
to an hour and 30 minutes this one took
almost two hours I really think this
type of appliance should be designed for
convenience
you shouldn't have to sit around and
wait any longer than you expect to and
this one was really unpredictable
this would be particularly annoying if
you're the kind of person who likes to
stick to a recipe this just isn't that
predictable I mean you know it's gonna
take longer but you don't always know
exactly how long so overall it has you
know solid features it looks pretty nice
but particularly the nine hundred and
forty nine dollar Whirlpool wfe five
zero
or h0 AAS we tested that in a batch with
this one and it performed much faster
much more consistently and produced
great results so it might depend on your
personality whether or not you think
this is a deal breaker but for me I
would stick with another model Pristina
and I'm Megan bulletin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
