taking a look at the Toshiba cosmo x 75
now it may look to you like this
particular laptop has fallen through a
time vortex of some kind from I don't
know the mid 2000 so before it's big its
bulky it's got crazy red accents it's
completely the opposite of the sort of
aesthetic minimalism that we see from
most laptops today where everything is
very thin very light almost very
featureless really throwing the focus on
in a lot of cases a big touchscreen now
in this case of course because this is a
big cosmic gaming laptop like a lot of
other systems like this even today in
the Windows 8 era
there's no touchscreen even though again
it's Windows 8 tile based kind of hard
to use with the with the touch pattern
even with an external Mouse but if
you're the typical cost me a customer
hopefully that won't bother you too much
because this is intended primarily as a
gaming laptop with a healthy dose of
multimedia on the side maybe less of a
pure gaming laptop than something you
might get from Alienware Origin PC
because this particular model has a
rewritable blu-ray drive and of course a
big 1080p screen so they figure you're
doing games and you're you know doing
multimedia movie watching movie night in
the dorm room that kind of stuff now
what I really love about the newest
version of the Cosmo is they have
updated it with the very latest in Intel
fourth generation Core iSeries
processors also known as Haswell and
it's also got one of the brand new
Nvidia 700 series graphics cards in this
case these 770 m this particular version
is a little bit more expensive at $17.99
but you get 16 gigs of ram for that you
get the blu-ray drive to get that CPU
and GPU combo and you get a combo
solid-state and traditional platter
giant hard drive if you wanted to you
could cut out some of the bells and
whistles and get this down to about 1199
and still keep that same processor and
the same graphics card to me that's a
really great that that's a really great
deal in any in any version of the X 75
you get fantastic performance I cannot
complain about the value for money in
terms of the components of what you get
at all however the big body even though
it's mostly a little bit and it still
feels kind of plan
sticky the keyboard is kind of clack e
again no touchscreen none of the other
modern things you might see like
Thunderball door or a an NFC antenna or
anything like that it's really an
old-school laptop with new-school
components in it if you're cool with
that if that's gonna fit in with your
dorm room aesthetic well then you've got
a great bargain here I'm Dan Ackman and
that is the Toshiba kasnia X 75</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
