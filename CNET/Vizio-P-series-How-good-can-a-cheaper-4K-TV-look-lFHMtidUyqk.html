standing in front of one of the most
highly anticipated TVs of the year this
is a Vizio P series 70 inch TV behind me
the P series was announced at CES with a
kind of blockbuster pricing for a 4k
television starting at $9.99 up to
around $2,400 for the largest TV runs
from 50 to 70 inches those prices really
cut the bottom out of the market for the
4k pricing the Samsung and Sony's of the
world's our price a lot more expensive
and Vizio is also talking about their
improved specs compared to those
manufacturers so one of the big bonuses
here is the local dimming on the full
array back light of this television
local dimming provides improved contrast
if he's better picture quality than a
lot of the edgelet TVs we've tested we
checked out an M series TV earlier this
year and it really did have that extra
punch in great black levels so we expect
great things out of the P Series in
terms of picture quality of course it
hits all the 4k buttons this year that
includes hdcp 2.2 and compatibility with
streaming 4k services including Netflix
and Amazon a little bit later in the
year the other nice thing about this TV
is the styling it does look a lot like
the M series around the edge it's got a
very thin bezel and again it looks
pretty much like all picture of course
the headline here is the pricing on the
P series the set is available now
shipping in September and we're going to
take a look at it as seen it in the near
future that's a quick look at videos P
series 4k TV I'm David Katz mark cocina</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
