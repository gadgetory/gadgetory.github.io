to spend 250 dollars on the lenovo smart
display it's not a tablet you can't
download apps you can talk to Google
assistant but you can do that on this
$50 puck if you want visuals use Google
assistant on your phone we have the same
issues and questions with a similar
Amazon echo show like the show the
lenovo smart display combines a simple
touch screen with the functionality of a
smart speaker you just plug it in and go
and you can fully control it with your
voice or with simple intuitive gestures
but what's the point you know what let
me show you by the way if you have a
Google home you might want to pause the
video here and mute it otherwise I'm
gonna be triggering that a lot hey
Google show me recipes for chicken tikka
masala
sure here are some recipes the lenovo
smart display is a great kitchen
assistant you can scroll through recipes
here you can find recipes on your phone
and send them to the display pick one
you want Google will give you an
overview with the ingredients the steps
you can start cooking it'll show you a
list of the ingredients there are 24
ingredients that you can then scroll
through once you skip to the
instructions then it really gets good
there's 14 steps so it'll read them out
loud you can scroll through them with a
touch or with your voice you can scroll
through the ingredients over here I'm
not much of a cook but these
instructions are so clear and helpful
that I think I could even make this
myself and then let's say you get to a
step where you don't know what to do hey
Google how do i saute onions ginger and
garlic and the website still did a comm
see it'll pull up instructions from
another recipe or maybe play a video on
youtube and that's so clear that not
even I could screw that up well maybe I
could screw that up but then it's just
gonna go right back to the recipe and
you can multitask while you cook so the
lenovo smart display is a great cooking
assistant but is it actually better than
the amazon echo sure time for a
lightning round
both smart displays sound great but the
show speakers are a little bit louder
point Amazon the Lenovo smart display
actually gives you a physical interface
to control smart home devices point
Lenovo the Amazon echo show will display
song lyrics while it plays music point
Amazon Lenovo has access to YouTube
point Lenovo the mics on the show are
just a little bit better point Amazon
the Lenovo smart display doesn't look
like it's a TV from 20 years ago point
Lenovo the show has more gains that take
advantage of the screen point Amazon
Lenovo will actually automatically send
you driving directions when you're
searching for a place point Lenovo I'm
adding its high breaking point for that
detailed recipe assistance which the
show can't match because it truly does
make a big difference both devices can
make video calls pull up the weather and
search the web both devices are fun and
competent but the echo show isn't great
at anything and the smart display is
game set and match
the Lenovo smart display is a better
device than the Amazon echo show if you
want a visual assistant in the kitchen
that can also entertain while you cook
it's worth the price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
