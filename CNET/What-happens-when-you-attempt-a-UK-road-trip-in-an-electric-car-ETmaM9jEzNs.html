getting ridiculous
we can't park that we can't regard again
owning and operating an electric car in
a big city like London is pretty
straightforward when there are charging
points on almost every street corner but
what happens when you take an electric
car out of the city and into the
countryside where places to charge are
few and far between that's what we're
here to test with the drive that takes
this electric vehicle around some of the
most beautiful parts of the nation the
atmosphere is electric too let's charge
up and hit the road our car of choice
for the trip is Vanessa and Leif
currently the most popular all-electric
car in Britain boosting a theoretical
range of up to around a hundred miles on
a single charge
our 500-mile route will take us through
ancient university towns through
national parks and even into the
beautiful hills of Wales stopping along
the way to recharge the car at slow
medium or fast charging points the
slowest will take up to eight hours to
recharge the car while the most powerful
will get 80% charge in only half an hour
it's these that we'll have to rely on if
we hope to complete our trip in the two
days we have driving as eco as possible
our range has gone up a few miles to 49
I've also got the regenerative braking
active which is it's kind of like engine
braking except there when it does it
it's actually restoring power back to
the battery we would soon be relying on
that regenerative braking very heavily
indeed but for now an easy drive led us
into scenic Cambridge
ok so leg 1 is done we're in scenic
beautiful Cambridge Andy what have you
found so far I found that I like the
cars Weist move to drive but really
you've got to be so careful in how
you're driving this thing you put your
foot down of accelerator you'll see the
range of the battery drop dramatically
how far is it's the next stop it's about
70 miles I think what's the range of the
car roughly about 80 to 90 so pushing it
but we should be ok
and okay we were wending our merry way
up to a nearby Nissan dealer
our first charging points the drive was
enjoyable the noise of the electric
engine still a novelty keep going
taking the fuel filler cap off but
there's no fuel said about this thing
which looks like a space weapon it is
working well apparently we'll see we've
got 47% at the moment and yeah 48 oh go
I'm not leaving till I 100 chart an
electric car is slower than filling up
with petrol however so getting to a
hundred percent in this instance gives
us a little time to kill because we're
doing this in an all-electric car but
you wanted something with a bit more
bite the sun's GTR is their top-end
petrol sports car B honestly would you
rather Road in a road trip in it yes the
next stop is Grantham 71 miles away in
theory it's well within the cars range
but when we enter the details into the
GPS you might not be able to reach
destination mm oh well onwards and
upwards a first time driving an electric
car at the eerie silence you're used to
because of hybrids but what I wasn't
used to was how smooth sort of take off
and driving away is it's really really
fun to drive 17 miles to Grantham and
we've currently got 38 miles
of range remaining it looks I would end
pretty well thanks to my efficient feet
and the brain we have made it
we're in Grantham services and so this
was interesting because the car said
that we're not we all grow have enough
range to make it from Cambridge to
Grantham and we've done it with probably
about 20 miles to spare yep
so that's good we're at another rapid
charge point so we've got roughly an
hour to kill and kill it we did
we are well and truly in the countryside
now look at all this green we've left
the gray and the smoke of London behind
we've done from Grantham to Bakewell and
we've got about 37 miles remaining which
is more than enough then to get as on to
Buxton how far are we right now from
nearest charging point what is this err
part of the country like for charging
they're basically non in a big district
we're hoping that the next one we visit
is in working order
yes I'm told on good authority that is
brilliant officially that's good
authority is a local bed-and-breakfast
owner in Buxton who's kindly agreed to
let us use their medium grade charge
point after we load up on bakewell's
most famous food it's all very pleasant
but back on the road things suddenly get
tense so what's happened Andy well we
were at the bottom of this hill at about
28 miles of range it's now gone to 12 in
only about maybe 3 minutes of driving Oh
I'm hoping that's just because we've
been going up hills I've had to keep my
foot on the accelerator
now we're going downhill a bit it's
gonna hopefully extend that range a
little come on so close Oh guys I don't
know where this guy's charging point is
is there and there are cars in it no I
don't know what do we do we can't park
there
we can't we can't plug in except we
could because as the B&amp;amp;Bs proprietor
helpfully explains our cable was long
enough to perch behind the other guests
and suck down some much-needed power a
near-miss but we left the leaf charging
again feeling that at last we've got the
hang of this whole electricity thing we
are technology experts after all so as
it turns out plugging the car into the
outlet isn't the whole story you
actually have to turn the power on
lesson learned what that does mean is
that the hour and a half we just gave it
uncharged it actually hasn't given the
car any more range so what we've done is
popped it on charge again yeah it's only
going to get about 10 15 minutes charge
so we're not going to have the same
we would have had before so we have got
to alter our plans a little bit this is
getting ridiculous
we left the B&amp;amp;B with about 21 miles of
range we've come about a mile and it
NASA's 16 miles of range because we've
had to go uphill quite a lot luckily
though we're about to go down into
what's called Goit valley all downhill
fingers crossed fingers fingers and toes
crossed across everything Lou because
this is because we are I don't know that
a a comes out here Andy
18 miles of range we are racking up the
miles now we're getting it back yes give
me more power so we definitely made it
to the countryside in an electric car
yeah we have whether we make it out is a
much more pertinent question right now
because we only got 14 miles of range
which is going to be just enough to get
us to our overnight location at a push
so we're very close to a next charging
point that we've out but we've
encountered an unusual obstacle this is
one of the benefits of living in the
country you don't so much get like
traffic jams you get dairy jams cattle
proved no obstacle however and with a
close eye on our regenerative braking we
let the leaf carry us to our final stop
of the day it's been tense but
ultimately successful and as we pull up
we really feel we've cracked the code to
rural electric automobiling
careful driving and a lot of planning at
the end indeed we're so sure we've got
it down we even recorded an outro for
this video thinking there probably won't
be much to say on day two stay tuned to
see no calm we are idiots
a few hours into day two we're already
dancing with danger the 75 mile drive
from Buxton to our first stop a service
station in oswestry is pushing a fully
charged leaf to its limits as we
approach the charge point the range
indicator isn't looking too happy we're
half a mile away from services we're so
close to getting more power but we have
scissors which has been on zero for one
about a mile now with with flatlining
but we were close take the pod exit
absolutely nothing oh that was close but
there's a problem the service station
soul charging point isn't working with a
screen and responsive and no power
flowing after prodding ineffectually of
a display we call the support number on
the front of the charge points 8:30 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m. a fellow leaf driver pulls
up behind us but our combined efforts
aren't enough to get the charger
rebooted which a little google searching
suggests is what we need to do doesn't
do anything it's not Sundy have you
encountered this before ever have
encountered charges down with not
charges shall we say so far in the
wilderness right now
oh I'm going to have to go and look at
my map and try and work out what plan B
is have you been a happy leaf owner
generally oh yeah yeah love the car
absolutely superb car beautiful to drive
the Eco tricity networks great
unfortunately they went from 24/7
customer service to Monday to Friday
office hours right it was a time you
could phone him anytime day when I
thought he fired him somebody be on the
other end and they could do a reboot
have you had to do that before no I
haven't but I've met people that have
right things break down and things don't
work all the time you know it happens
petrol pumps important to a petrol
station petrol pumps are out all the
time but in that situation there are
many many more so I've had to call for a
tow the annoying thing is that they are
going to have to come and tow the car
you're only towing it just a few miles
down the road into the town center into
where there is a mistimed dealership
which has a charger it's just that we
arrived with such a little amount of
power left we just can't risk driving it
ourselves could they give an ETA within
the hour
okay that's the wasps nest before cabin
fever can truly take hold it's time to
get towed
it's not a great feeling but at least
we're moving even if it's not under our
own steam at the closest charge point in
nearby Nissan dealer we meet another
intrepid leaf owner whose family holiday
has been disturbed by charging issues
few problems are some of the charges but
this one is the most serious problem
without now which is me we can stay
overnight and premarin I mean would you
would you still recommend electric cars
described yes definitely yes the cars it
selves are great but we need more money
spent on infrastructure to make sure
there are never charging points and
maintain properly good news or bad news
good news for Islam what are the bad
news yeah this one's out of a lot of tea
on the tow truck again this time headed
to an Asda in Shrewsbury where there's a
medium strength charger with our names
on it
third time's a charm now I've been chart
towed rather to fifth Asda to charge
here problem with that is that none of
the cards we have are valid with this
charging service apparently this is a
different service and the ones that
we've been using already we didn't know
that and now we can't access the plugs
so again no way of charging the car and
the tow truck has gone oh my god it's
pay-as-you-go if you know please I just
had to download an app and I put money
on the app and I work and now this thing
look good then is it charged Please
Please Please Please Please Please
Please Please Please Please Please
Please Please Please the light-blue Andy
the cars charging right now with the car
sucking down power we could get on the
road again but our mission to drive a
cross country route in an all-electric
car could only be called a failure we
would soon make tracks for home but not
before shooting a real app shot and here
it is
so Andy electric cars on long drives in
the UK what's the verdict well it
doesn't look too good to be honest we
plant our route and charging points down
to the mile and we drove extremely
economically yet still because of only
one charging point being out of order we
had to rely on a tow truck to get us out
of trouble now these long drives are
possible it just takes a hell of a lot
of planning and a certain amount of luck
yeah I think May
surprisingly this experience hasn't
really put us off electric cars I mean
we have a really good time driving this
one but the supports just not there I
mean this technology has so much
potential but it needs that
infrastructure to really push it forward
electric driving definitely is the
future it just has a long way to go yet
but do let us know what you think about
electric cars and whether you would
consider buying one yourself and make
sure to stay tuned to see net then we
nailed it yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
