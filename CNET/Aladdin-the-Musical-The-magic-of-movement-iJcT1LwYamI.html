moves that we have in the show some of
these buildings operate by cables under
the stage pulling the buildings and some
of the buildings have wireless control
inside and they operate via battery and
that's how they turn and close down in
us like this and up there those
buildings also move by a cable that are
into the deck I am Steve stack Oh
I work as the deck automation operator
at Aladdin which means I operate all of
the stage machinery from stage level on
down into the trap room below the stage
this particular show would not be
possible without technology when I first
started working in automation we tried
to move three or four things at the same
time they didn't move they didn't start
there and stopped together this show we
have 20 things that might move together
and they all start and stop at the same
time these buildings here some of them
have to turn next to each other and get
within inches of each other that would
not be possible any other way all of the
machines are connected to motor drives
that I'll have to communicate back with
the main computer at all times we have
about 45 machines that run over a
network about 30 of them are in a wired
network and about 15 or in a wireless
network immediately right behind a wall
is my home in here is the area where I
operate the show every night the left
hand side all of the position
information for each piece of scenery is
stored at the right hand computer each
number represents one controlled motor
the first 18 are the tracks in the stage
from here down to about here are the
various elevators in the stage and
everything that is blue right now are
the wireless buildings and I operate
just this tiny little console here very
simple has a green button it starts the
scenery moving and a red button that
stops it in general I do not ever have
to hit the red button it is only if I
see something bad happening or somebody
tells me to stop that we hit the stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
