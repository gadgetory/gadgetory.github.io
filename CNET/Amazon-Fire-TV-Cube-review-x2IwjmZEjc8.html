Meyer here at scene it's TV test lab and
what you're about to see is worth the
wait there's a little box here that's
gonna turn on the TV an AV receiver and
get ready to pretty much except my other
voice commands completely hands-free
this is the Amazon fire TV cube the
first Alexa device designed specifically
for the living room it plugs into your
TV to stream TV shows and movies from
Netflix Hulu Amazon and the rest and
includes the same voice remote as other
fire TV gear but it also controls your
gear hands-free here's a rack full of AV
equipment I set up to demonstrate
including a big vizio tv and a Marantz
AV receiver check it out Alexa switch to
Apple TV okay
I'll still need to use the original
device remote to actually control it but
the fire TV cube handles of switching
itself the little box has built-in
infrared emitters as well as an included
IR blaster once you tell it what gear
you own during the setup process it
shoots out signals to reach your gear in
this case switching inputs on the AV
receiver if you don't use a receiver the
cube can switch inputs on your TV and
can also control a sound bar and my test
setup volume is controlled by the
receiver
although the cube has its own built-in
speaker most of the sound including
Alexa's voice music and audio from your
TV shows and movies comes through the
system speakers I found the cube very
responsive to the Alexa Wake word even
when music was blasting once it hears
the word it mutes automatically to
listen for the rest of your command
Alexa volume up the system can also
control cable and satellite boxes you
don't get DVR controls but you can
change channels by naming them tuned to
PBS
as a fire TV streamer the little box
also allows voice control of sources
like Netflix and YouTube launch Netflix
here's Netflix Alexa show me world cup
videos on YouTube
amazon has also refreshed the fire TV
menu system to make it more streamlined
for voice for example by adding numbers
next to selections although the fire TV
cube worked well most the time in my
testing it failed to recognize some
commands some devices work better than
others and many apps lack voiced support
for search and other functions the
biggest issue however is that you need
to keep your regular remotes around if
you want to perform more than just the
basic functions the included clicker
can't even control volume or mute owners
a harmony and other universal remotes
don't throw those clickers away yet even
with those issues the fire TV cube takes
living your voice control further than
any other device I've seen and that's
Amazon fire TV cube I'm David Katz meier
foreseen it Alexa turn off the TV okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
