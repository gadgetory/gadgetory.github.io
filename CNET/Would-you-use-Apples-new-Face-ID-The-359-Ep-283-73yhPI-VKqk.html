it's time for episode two eighty three
of the 359 podcast I'm BBG and I push
the buttons and in the house we got
Alfred Inge and Ben Fox Reuben morning
we're still standing I'm sure nobody can
steal my face ID I'm very smart
Alfred is my spirit animal right now
yesterday was a long day good day been a
long day so obviously we're gonna keep
it going on Apple coverage because
yesterday was such a big day today we
want to focus especially on face ID and
what it means for you so send it in as
many of your questions as possible about
face ID versus touch ID
whether you're comfortable about using
it all that other stuff and at some
point alfred is gonna stop freaking me
out with the cycleops look we also
wanted to mention a new startup called
bodega which is planning on killing off
the corner store so we're gonna get to
that shadows yeah and but you know to
just kind of change it up from the
rampant and constant apple coverage so
that's that's about it for the start of
the show let's get to the podcast and
yeah send in your questions and we'll
get back to you in four minutes giving a
quick shout out to our San Francisco
team mister maestro Tong Lexi Beecham
and the whole crew doing such a kick-ass
job yesterday and giving us such a good
fruitful content to pick up from and
continue on this morning as we keep
driving the Apple stake deeper and
deeper for Apple news alright hang out
everybody we'll see you in the chat
three minutes and 59 seconds from 3:00 -
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Alfred Inge so a big topic percolating
out of Apple's new iPhones launches
yesterday is the new biometric system
called face ID it takes the place of the
fingerprint sensor in the new iPhone X
face ID uses dot projection got a dot
projector infrared camera and something
called a flood illuminator it's created
it's a list okay to create 30,000
invisible infrared dots
on your face to map it even in the dark
even if you grow a beard and even if you
get wrinkles so Alfred is this better or
similar to what we already have out
there from Samsung and some of the other
folks
it's like measures better than what
samsung has been offering with its
facial recognition so with Samsung's
facial recognition and other facial
recognition on Android devices a lot of
it is just using your front-facing
camera and then it like takes a look at
your face and pinpoints like several
points on it so like the distance
between your eyes you know how long your
nose is like the cheek to cheek that
kind of thing with this one it uses
infrared it also uses like 3d scanning
so it's not like a 2d like represents a
representation it's not just taking a
photo of you it's also you know taking a
look at like the curves on your face and
then it's using infrared so it's not
about the image it's more about like the
the dots itself like the dot scanner
that you were talking about right which
makes it harder to actually confuse the
system yes because especially with
Samsung system ii they announced that
they showed that you you could basically
trick it with just a picture of
something yeah and this one's uh very
different because it uses the plotting
and it uses it has a def sensor so it
knows you know it kind of has a more
overall scan as opposed to like just
your face so the other thing that I
wanted to get to was that there is a lot
of concern about the idea of normalizing
facial recognition technology but we do
know a mention of people that this kind
of thing isn't actually that new yeah I
think it's gonna be normalizing you know
active facial recognition where you
constantly use it you know on your own
volition and in consumer device yes but
as far as like facial recognition
technology I'm pretty sure that's
already been normalized you know on a
passive way where you know there's speed
cameras out there now that have facial
recognition on it the NYPD uses
something similar something I have for
years yeah you as you see it at airports
there was a story that I think came out
last month about Walmart that was
developing a camera system that would
actually be able to use facial
recognition or like shoplifters and
things like that it was actually to find
out if customers were unhappy or
displeased whether they're in the yeah
they had one previously
or shoplifters like facial recognition
technology on that yeah so it's always
been there in the background but now
it's like it's now in your hand now and
people actively participating in it
Edward Snowden tweeted out that he said
that look this is a technology that is
sure to get abused at some point do you
think that people are going to be
comfortable using this or is this gonna
continue to build as far as people
feeling uncomfortable about it I think
they're gonna be comfortable using it on
Apple's products because Apple kind of
has a lot of these you know guarantees
with theirs you know they have secure
Enclave on it so the data stored on
there in the same way that fingerprint
sensors you know despite people using it
on their phones all that's on their
iPhones all the time it's not like you
know on their laptops that offer
fingerprint readers which a lot do you
know they're not using that to unlock
their devices so I think it'll lead to
to you know a lot of mass adoption for
like facial recognition but I don't know
how much on other devices we also wanted
to get to one other story from Fast
Company that came out it's about two
former Googlers who want to kill off the
corner store with a concept called
bodega which is pretty much a pantry
filled with non-perishable items
according to the story quote an apple
allow you to unlock of the box and
cameras power a computer version sorry
and cameras powered with computer vision
will register what you've picked up
automatically charging your credit card
this is a brilliant idea is I hate this
so much they are absolutely the worst
first of all you're never gonna kill a
bodega okay like with the name bodega
and it's just it's absurd it's basically
a vending machine this is right and also
CBS has developed a vending machine
which I actually like this idea where
you can get like beauty products
toiletries over-the-counter medicine so
there is in areas for development with
this but maybe bodega isn't exactly the
best way to go now anyway if you want to
read more about these stories check us
out on CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm alfred
hang thanks for listening
I don't think they're gonna be able to
kill the bodega everything is in concept
maybe it could work in more rural areas
or it could get actually kind of
supplement in where there aren't as
common corner stores but think about
that it's not what I wish I was not
gonna happen here you are gonna happen a
major man more time to talk smack about
this on the show cuz like there were
maybe only like 30 seconds left on the
clock when yeah when you brought it up
and I was like there's so many things
wrong with this concept the whole the
idea of putting in a rural area doesn't
even make sense because it's only
non-perishable so it basically does
nothing to contribute to ending food
deserts they were areas that they want
to focus on our apartment buildings and
dorms and they think that they can you
know all you have to go down is to the
like the first floor or the lobby to
like actually yeah think about the
things that the stuff that you need is
all like non-perishable stuff so things
like I don't know like a bag of chips or
pretzels or a Gatorade a soda you know
what else has that already vending
machine so we don't need this like crap
box and it's not pretty big - and the
thing is like to say that it's gonna
replace a bodega with vending machine
goods are you kidding me
yeah I mean I I think that the way that
they're marketing it to say that we want
to kill off the corner store or we want
to do better is also not a great way to
actually came out if they came out
saying like oh we're gonna build like a
smart vending machine sure go ahead
that's your little venture I don't care
much for vending machines but to go
after something that's like a you know
at a heart of a community and a beloved
institution of every city out there it's
like nah dude you're not Shalford a I
hate them get on that soapbox anyway
protect bodegas at all costs let's get
hashtag we love bodegas let's get to the
questions let's see if we got some face
ID stuff also or if people want to trash
bodega by all means all right jumping in
first our buddy Michael Brown shout out
hey Michael Brown so quickly answer the
question of the headline of this video
yes I would definitely use the face ID
and I'm going to predict that it will be
loved once all of the reviews are out
Michael has very much been a very vocal
apple supporter he's got a lot of great
fantastic input and
critiques of the Apple products
definitely curious to see who else in
the chat is really anticipating good
things out of face ID like we said touch
ID kind of set a new standard maybe face
ID could be the same thing it's too
early to tell here's the thing about
face ID though is that it's really only
going to be on Apple on the iPhone 10
and you know I don't think everybody who
buys the new iPhone is gonna get the
iPhone 10 no because it's not even it's
super expensive so I really feel like
it'll just be like on a high like you
know very on a very high level of like
iPhone users of people buying it and
sure they'll use it but like I don't
think it's gonna be like a widespread
adoption thing yet and the other the
other thing that I kind of had was
interested about is how much of your
face or what angle doesn't need to be at
to unlock you know because with touch ID
you know I'm able to just put my finger
on the on the home button and then like
I can look at it like underneath the
desk while pretending to pay attention
at meetings yes but like with like face
facial recognition you know I I feel
like I'd have to make like a much more
obvious like they in their demos it's
unlocked in their demos they make it
look fairly natural the other thing that
going going back to what Michael was
talking about there's the fact that
there's gonna be no home button that's
that's a primary reason why they created
face idea in the first place it means
that anybody that does get the iPhone 10
is going to have to figure out exactly
it's it's gonna be a new learning
process how to actually use that because
anybody that does have an iPhone presses
that home button pretty regularly to
swap between abs to just basically yeah
I mean a lot of people talk about that
like learning curve without the home
button i I really don't think it'll be
that hard it's really it's getting a new
device it's yeah it's you know if I if I
switch to enjoy probably take a couple
days I just realized to that I think
during the podcast I said iPhone acts
didn't I what again
you might as well whatever all right
back into the chat Jay Goodwin I just
wanted to bring up this quote today I
present to you an overpriced iPhone that
will break steal both of your kidneys
you're right led
and huge portion of your soul only for a
measly sacrifice if your future more
kids just that was pretty good writing
wow that's pretty that's pretty solid
here's a real question no Danny Green
shout out Danny Green they did not
mention being able to use more than one
face say if I want my spouse to have
quick access to the device with face ID
they did not mention that
so with touch ID obviously you can use a
variety of fingers yes it's possible
face ID would allow for such a thing
just got a carrier we have to find out
first you know once we got our hands on
I get the test it a bit more but I don't
know if you're able to register more
than one face so when we get a phone in
I'll register to me and I'll list you as
my spouse yeah
okay so we'll be married to this iPhone
the other way to consider it is that
your spouse would just use the pin which
obviously right people would if they're
shelling out a thousand dollars they
want to use the war or don't give your
spouse your phone passwords you're not
married disclosure Alfred's not married
just to think though I mean yeah your
phone and you deserve your privacy it's
whatever my wife knows my pin but she
isn't logged in with like a touch ID
fingerprint so that's that's what we do
right now by I think that it might be a
bit of a letdown for people if they do
spend that much money and realize they
can only use one face for that
particular you don't have to use face ID
with it just because it doesn't have the
right touch ID anymore it doesn't mean
they didn't have to use touch ID yeah
exactly so you know I don't think I'm
gonna be using face ID but I also don't
think I'm spending a thousand dollars on
an iPhone I'm just gonna make paper
masks of everybody in the office so I
can steal all your phones nice just to
think though a facial recognition as we
said it's not new but this face ID is
and we're already thinking like what
could they do next with it I would like
to see in a future iPhone that they
would bring back touch ID I just think
people are so used to it after so many
years of having it why you don't
integrate it into the back of the phone
to the Google pixel or the Samsung
Galaxy phones I don't know I I was
hoping they would do that but well
there's the idea that you know if
they're putting it on their phones you
know it it's probably gonna end up on a
future I've had at some point and
somebody suggested that you know oh
maybe you know they can do that for mac
books also we're like you just lift the
lid up its I think it's a lot more
practical to put it on our laptop then
it would be on a phone but and then they
start rolling out the clones once they
have all of our likenesses yeah it's and
I think that it is good to like talk
about this it's interesting to see in
the tech world how quickly everybody had
a knee-jerk reaction to the concept of
facial recognition software in a
consumer device and how this could be
abused how your information could be
stolen
I think that's healthy to a certain
extent but it is good to avoid being too
paranoid in realizing that there's a ton
of facial recognition software that
exists when you go to the airport when
you go to the mall when you drive down
the highway so let's not ignore the fact
that this isn't brand new by any stretch
it's also good to know that you can turn
yourself into a poop emoji when
necessary right Watson says guys can you
give a minute of silence for UK
customers it's okay for you in America
doing the podcast to say it's an
expensive phone at $1,000 but it works
out to one thousand three hundred twenty
seven dollars conversion rate for UK
yikes yeah sorry and hey Watson they
want snack yeah it is an expensive phone
there's no two ways about it
but at the same time yikes on bikes
Apple has created you know their their
premium tier company and they are
pushing up the price of what people can
expect for a phone but they did that
with the first how long do you think
it'll be before they announce a price
drop for it very very long time from now
really because it's gonna be super
limited for such a long time that they
could basically price whatever the hell
they want probably gonna be a half
market yeah that too
a year and a half the secondary market
on eBay I feel pretty confident we'll
probably push up the price even more so
you know if you do if you are one of the
lucky ones that gets early
line on one of these things if you want
to flip it on eBay and sell it for a
couple hundred bucks more I I feel like
that's probably pretty likely
black-market iPhone Jessie gateman says
what is bodega for international viewers
of the guy because it's a commonality
slang it's a convenience store typically
used in the New York area as a term so
thank you very much for the question
yeah it's also used a lot in LA so I
mean they're not uncommon in any major
urban area right I mean like but it's
just a convenience store these are
typically smaller and yeah just on the
corner kind of situation and usually a
mom-and-pop as opposed to like you
wouldn't typically call like a CVS or
rite-aid or a Walgreens about daga right
yes or like I said don't go gas station
or anything like that they don't count
it's just yeah little and go there get
your hot examiner Barbasol if you watch
the latest spider-man movie he goes and
gets sandwiches from there all the time
that's a perfect representation in major
film and everybody that watches this
show watches spider-man I'm sure so yeah
staying on the same topic imagine soggy
says it's not even a bodega you can't
get hot food from this pantry yes
exactly
not gonna be run again an egg and cheese
sandwich at 3:00 a.m. there yo know that
okay first generally they figure out the
tech for that I am on board no you do
not want vending machine eggs okay
that's true but that's everyone's point
is it's just a vending machine ending
mission it's nothing that special it's
not going to replace I mean yeah you're
getting weirder stuff but you look at
just do me a favor everybody go go back
on YouTube after the show and just
Google Japanese vending machines
it's an insane yeah mark I have no
problem with stuffing it's spaghetti
yeah I have no problem with cooler
vending machines I really don't I my is
not gonna replace it could be my issue
lies that they're going after bodegas
are you kidding me of that I don't
disagree with you I I for some
additional context Amazon in many ways
has been working to not kill off the
corner store but at least
wounded or steal a little bit more if
it's market share two of the things that
it came out with more recently where the
Amazon go store where you basically just
show up pick up what you want and leave
without actually having to go to a
cashier and the other one that they
mentioned this was announced I think
last month it's called Amazon Instant
pickup where you can order something on
your phone and then pick it up in as
little as a couple minutes yeah like an
Amazon lockers location you know what
they didn't say when they you know
announce those that they're gonna kill
off mom-and-pop shops correct yeah
because like everyone is smart enough to
realize that everybody already looks at
them as the big bad wolf and saying
something like that would be so bad but
this startup by 2x Googlers maybe they
need a little bit help with marketing
switching gears real quick yo jazz hey
awesome name right now did you get to
try the Apple watch Series three how was
the call and text features they
showcased the watch without headphones
during the event we have a couple of
videos Scott's Ty and got his hands on
the device we here in New York I've not
seen it it will be here soon yeah we do
have some info from Scott on Sina comm
about his own initial hands-on
impressions with the watch my initial
impressions are it looks a lot like the
series 1 in the series 2 except for like
the red dot on the side yeah and you
know the cellular functionality is is
really what what's the big difference
there yeah which is nice but nothing
earth-shattering in my opinion it's it's
what it's people that are in that market
are really interested in that sale like
they'll probably be able to sell those
for for folks that are on the market for
them all right Josh boy uh do you think
that from now on the iPhone design will
follow the 8 or the 10 great question I
was wondering that myself I don't know I
feel like standard and I feel like you
know for them to not follow that in
future phones it's gonna be going
backwards back to the rounded so Tim
Cook on stage even said he was like look
this is the revolutionary phone that's
going to set the pace for the next 10
years in phone designs so at the very
would it make any sense if they had a
phone saying if they said you know this
phone is gonna set the pace for the for
future phones and then not follow it on
their own
Isis yeah however there is a possibility
that they would just branch off into two
different design direction so let's
phone with you 911
yo back up back up dude
no but I look I think that there is
going to continue to be a market for the
iPhone 6 iPhone 6s iphone 7 iphone 8 and
I don't think that they're gonna kill
off that entire grouping next year at
least but maybe in future years they're
gonna move closer to the iPhone 10 look
I think only by next year but we got a
whole year to find out yeah
all right coming down getting short on
time here but we can squeeze a couple
more questions in I sky high I love this
when do y'all think Apple will introduce
a projector inside it's inevitable I say
a small laser projector set it down
airplay the sound turn off the lights
and let's go party aren't those mines be
back to iPhone those but don't those
mods exist on like the Moto phones yes
put it in the iPhone Johnny I would
never allow I mean it sounds like a lot
of fun but I don't know a lot of people
that use the projector for the Moto mod
already so it's it's not something that
I think a lot can there's an app on the
iPhone on the to strobe the flash I
can't even imagine Tim Cook like going
around like trying to pitch that pitch
like projector it's called the boots and
cats okay I mean I would say either get
a moto phone or the essential phone
might end up having that as a mod at
some point down the line but doesn't
seem likely than enough than an iPhone
would have that yeah all right couple
more here
I'm Prodigy says as time progresses do
you think Apple will take breaks excuse
me we'll take break downs right take
breaks down the line when releasing
iPhones example not releasing 2018 until
2019 because every year the price will
keep going up I really do hope they do
that I hope it turns into like a
two-year cycle as opposed to every year
but you know I think they're gonna have
to keep it up to keep up with
competition because Samsung's not gonna
stop anytime soon
but I do hope that they they
distance out the the releases cuz then
that gives people you know at least two
years to save eight thousand dollars for
a phone Michael Brown is on the same
page or he's asking if it's going to be
a two-year phone or if they're gonna
update it already next year it might
make more sense for the super premium
iPhone ten to be on a two-year cycle but
at the same time as they get as they
increase production on those phones as
they get more of them out in the public
and people see them and really want them
I think that they are gonna find ways to
continue to improve them and have next
year be like the iPhone 10.1 or whatever
the hell they want to call it yeah
Phoenix got one more question here why
does wireless charging require
third-party companies I myself as a
little surprised by that that doesn't
seem very appellee but then again in the
past they have worked with Belkin a lot
but I was kind of surprised that they
didn't make it super hairy because
that's their mo because she is pretty
much in every wireless charging thing
out there right now if they wanted to go
and add like their own wireless charging
thing they would effectively be shutting
themselves out of everything that's out
there already
although wireless charging at airports
our bodies
you know the IKEA is little like bedside
stand wireless charging thing that's
inside the furniture so it's not a
little whatever yeah that's all she'd
like she liked it so they're just
hopping on the train yeah it's awesome
it's a consortium that came to an
agreement on what the standard would be
and there were three separate
consortiums not that long ago and it
looks like she won out
so Apple in many ways had no other
choice but to go with this one and
unlike lightning cables where they could
set the standard for themselves with
wireless charging this was this was a
direction that they had to go in I think
it's some are I'm happy to see that
rather than I'm trying to do that all
the time Starbucks where it's like okay
this is only for like qi wireless
charging and this is for Apple Wireless
like this smoking non-smoking section
you know they would even have like a
velvet like a phase that would have to
like replace like their cheese in like
put like new spots just for like Apple a
who's replacing cheese no the
the argument would be that they would
have to because it's out if Apple I
thought that was given us free cheese no
apples Apple sizes and cheese at
Syracuse Ramon so before we go let's go
over a couple places where she is going
to be available
McDonald's is one Starbucks is another
where where else you think we're going
to see this there are already a bunch of
places but are we going to see an
increase do we think that anybody else
is going to hop on to their bathrooms
yes Lane the channel paper holder like
the little box you like see that's not a
terrible idea that's not a bad idea in
general when Apple jumps on board with
these kind of things it does end up you
know giving it a fresh boost that did
happen with mobile payments with Apple
pay so I would expect it to happen again
because you can't really see wireless
charging in that many places these days
so here's hoping that Apple does help
make it a little bit more mainstream
than it is right now I would love to see
that I hate wires which is exactly why I
became a studio engineer yeah we we hate
why alright that's a perfect place I'll
and it for today yeah been a solid week
so far been you want to bring us home
all right the 359 podcast is available

course cnn.com Unicom thanks everybody
