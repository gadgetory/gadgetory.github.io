on Apple's new campus Apple Park is the
new billions and billions of dollar
facilities that Apple built to house its
employees
it'll have about 12,000 people here when
everybody finally moves in but the
public can now come and visit the
visitor center there's a new cafe where
you can buy coffee there's an area to
buy devices like the iPhone 10 you can
buy t-shirts baseball hats you can also
look at what the campus looks like
inside using the special AR iPad table
contraption to see areas that we won't
actually get to see let's go take a look
one of the new features of Apple parks
new visitor center is cafe Mac so people
who work at Apple's get their coffee at
cafe Mac's all over campus you're able
to order food and drinks using an iPad
they can text you when your drink is
ready you go pay for it there are tables
set up for people to just relax it's
kind of open to the outside it's really
a place where Apple wants the public and
its neighbors to come and just hang out
one of the things that's really unique
to the new Apple visitor center at Apple
Park is all of this special swag you
can't get anywhere else
they have little onesies tote bag that
say Apple Park
there's playing cards I guess if you're
trying to kill time postcards and also
some special baseball caps they're
missing the little button at the top
which they said is so you can wear your
beats headphones on top and they fit
more smoothly Apple's had its shot on
iphone campaign for a couple years to
show what kind of images you can gather
with its devices here it has a special
area where you can see glamour shots of
this new campus shot on an iPhone
another thing that's unique is these
Apple Park t-shirts they'll set you back
a nice forty dollars if you want to show
people that you were actually at the
campus you can't get them anywhere else
Apple's new visitor center is pretty
recognizable for people who've been in
any of the redesign Apple stores except
for the schwag and this exhibition space
that has this aluminum model of the
campus it weighs about 11,000 pounds so
I don't think they're gonna be moving it
anywhere anytime soon you can lift up
the roof on the campus to actually see
inside so here you can see different
work tables trees inside then you can
zoom in to actually see closer what it
is go is going on there's little people
in here when Apple's industrial
designers told us that they had people
hanging off the roof of the buildings
using 360-degree cameras to capture
footage they also use drones to really
capture the lighting you can switch in
between times of day and see what it
looks like you know it midnight when the
sun's rising when the Sun setting to get
a really different view of what the
campus is like along with actually
looking at the spaceship itself where
people are gonna be working we can see a
little peek inside the Visitor Center
where we actually are Apple also lets
you look inside its fitness center
there's parking garages basically
anything you want to explore on campus
Apple lets you check out
last stop on our tour of Apple's new
visitor center at Apple Park is the
rooftop terrace so here are their table
setup so if you looking fit and hang out
there's also a nice view of the
spaceship from here probably the closest
that most of us will ever get to it
aside from the AR table downstairs
it's just they tried to design this so
it's seamless between feeling like
you're part of the environment versus
feeling like you're in the building and
you can tell that downstairs as well
with the clear glass windows this
building just kind of seems to almost
hover in the air I hope you enjoyed our
tour of the new Apple perk visitor
center it's now open to the public so if
you're in Cupertino California you can
stop by and check it out for yourself
I'm sure I chicken with Sienna</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
