outlook and schedule some appointments
for me it's the blue with the circle the
idea there is Cortana's now in Outlook
and she's looking at my email and my
calendar with my permission and helping
me get things done stay on top of things
a good example this week I was
exchanging a bunch of email with our
Microsoft travel service trying to
figure out the best time to get home on
Friday
Cortana was able to understand that
conversation without me doing anything I
didn't create an appointment she
automatically put all that flight
information on my counter to make it
really easy for me to track she applies
the same conversational intelligence to
help me stay on top of commitments and
email I get a ton of email which makes
it easy for me to forget things I said I
would do
so here Cortana's flagged something I
said I'd send my manager today I was
actually gonna get ahead of this on the
plane but the siren song of that flight
infotainment system got me again
no problem Cortana is there and she
knows the last time I made an update she
knows where the document is I can ask
her to go take care of this for me
Sen Chuck the PowerPoint that I worked
on last night sure thing
I found this PowerPoint document is this
it and I can go ahead and get that sent
since Cortana's not bound a specific
device thank you thank you
now since Cortana is not bound a
specific device she helps me keep track
of notifications that are happening
right here on my Android phone while I'm
doing work on my PC so here I've got a
notification a text message that came in
from my friend Ben he's here in the bay
area I can go ahead and respond right
here for my pc port anna knows that i'm
talking about meeting with ben she
offers to add this to my calendar and
then she tells me you got a couple of
other things there can I help you move
these let's see banner some work-related
stuff I choose Ben and what she did
there is appointments from noon on
Wednesday automatically shift to the
appointment the free block of time I had
there on Thursday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
