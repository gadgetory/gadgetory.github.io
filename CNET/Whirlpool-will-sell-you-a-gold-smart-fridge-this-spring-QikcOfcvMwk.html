new smart fridges at CES and this year
we've got a new one from whirlpool it's
the whirlpool WR fa9 4c ihn and it's got
this kind of gold tint to it called
sunset bronze it's a new color across
some of the new whirlpool appliances
that kind of Guild's your kitchen a bit
it's interesting it's subtle but it's
kind of neat that you can tell this for
just Mar just by looking at the water
dispenser here where you've got a tiny
little touchscreen sitting up on top of
it it's only a couple inches wide and it
doesn't do all the different types of
things that other smart fridges with
gigantic touch screens have done doesn't
have a web browser or web stream Spotify
songs won't browse recipes on all
recipes but what it does do is focus in
on some purpose-driven
kitchen tasks things like cleaning your
fridge or hosting a party or loading
groceries in it's got a couple of neat
dedicated modes that make it easier to
do things like that and it also features
an integration with Amazon - that lets
you put virtual - button is right there
on your fridge they don't cost anything
and they work just like normal - buttons
you press a button and all of a sudden
you've ordered more coffee fantastic
inside you've got a 23 point 8 cubic
foot capacity and a nice kind of sturdy
shelf design with this shelf that slides
back to make room for tall items and
this platter that pulls out down below
you also get a couple of popular
features like a door within door
compartment and this nice water
dispenser the lets you dish out the
exact amount of water you need for
whatever you're making
whirlpools new smart fridge will retail
for forty four hundred dollars when it
arrives this spring we'll try and test
it out let you know what we think of it
when it arrives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
