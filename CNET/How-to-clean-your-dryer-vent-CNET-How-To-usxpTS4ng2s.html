fryer won't work well if it's hooked up
to a dirty vent worse all that lint and
debris inside your vent is a serious
fire hazard
why not eliminate a potentially
dangerous situation and increase your
drives performance all at the same time
that's right it's time to clean your
dryer vent before you clean it you need
to know where your dryer vent is in most
cases your home dryer vent sits in the
laundry room in the basement
an exhaust pipe connects to ductwork
that travels up and exits your house at
ground level now disconnect your dryer
if your appliance is electrically
powered unplug this cord from the wall
next carefully pull the dryer way from
the wall duct this will give you more
room to work some dryers run on natural
gas if that's the case with you then be
very careful not to disturb the gas line
the same goes for any water lines for
steam cycles clean any dust or debris
around the back of the dryer then grab a
handy dryer vent cleaning kit from your
local hardware store and get to work
some like this one have a brush on one
end and an adapter to fit into power
drills insert the brush into one end of
the duct and spin clockwise as you push
the whole assembly through hopefully
you'll come out at the other end without
much trouble if it's been a while since
your last cleaning you're probably going
to see a heck of a lot of junk coming
out of your ductwork grab a vacuum broom
and dustpan just in case now reconnect
everything back the way it was once it's
hooked up to a clean vent you should see
and feel improved airflow from the
appliance expect your dryer to run safer
and power through wet loads in less time
too
