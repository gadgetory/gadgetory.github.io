half desktop and half laptop I'm Dan
Ackerman and we are here with the origin
PC
Aeon 15 X now this looks a little bit
thicker and chunkier than your average
gaming laptop even a big one from Origin
PC where they usually have these you
know gigantic chassis is filled with
very high-end components they're out
hand tuned and tested that's because
this X series from Origen combines
mobile parts like a mobile graphics card
in this case Nvidia 980m
with wait for it and desktop CPU so it's
a little bit thicker and heavier it's
got these big fan vents in the back so
we can handle that more powerful
processor so what you have is
essentially something that's mostly a
laptop but maybe with 25% of a desktops
DNA now if you're super hardcore gamer
maybe you'd want desktop graphics cards
like the new Titan X cards if you need
something like that you have to trade up
to a big gigantic boxing desktop but for
a mobile system this is not as powerful
as you're going to get we got very good
gaming frame rates on this even hooking
up through one of the display outputs
there's two display ports and one HDMI
to a 4k television and we could crank
new games like Grand Theft Auto 5 on the
PC up to reasonably high levels at 4k
and get a very good experience you know
or you could just play locally the
screen down here is a 1920 by 1080
screen there's actually a higher
resolution upgrade you can now get for
these although I don't think any of them
are our touch screens that's still
something that most gaming laptops
outside of a few very kind of high
design boutique e ones just don't offer
yet what we found was performance was
about on par with other gaming laptops
with the same graphics card but
application performance an on gaming
test was actually a good deal faster and
that's the benefit of having the desktop
CPU in there this particular combination
only cost about $2,500 which is a lot
don't get me wrong but for a high-end
gaming laptop it's about what you'd
expect to pay anyway so the fact that
you get the desktop CPU and better
performance out of it and it's not that
that much bigger makes me think this is
actually a pretty interesting hybrid of
those two types of computer I'm Dan
Ackerman
that is the origin TCE on 15x</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
