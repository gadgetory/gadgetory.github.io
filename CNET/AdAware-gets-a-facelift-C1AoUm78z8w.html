today we're taking a first look at at
aware 10 ad-aware used to be a great
name in Windows computer security and
then just didn't go anywhere for a long
time now it's back it's got a completely
new look the new interface for ad-aware
looks a lot like its competitors and
that's a good thing unlike its old UI
which was sort of complicated in
cumbersome is very hard to navigate the
new one is actually very simple the
layout is clean and because it's easier
to understand it's actually easier to
use cnet labs system performance
benchmarks show that ad-aware 10
actually has a slightly lighter than
average impact on your computer's
performance than its competitors which
is a very good thing the AV engine the
antivirus engine is provided by GFI
Viper which is a well-renowned security
suite it's a good one it's not the best
out there but for providing into virus
in a situation where otherwise they
would have to build their own engine
this is actually a good thing that it
has it and it will help keep you secure
unfortunately because there haven't been
any into virus benchmarks performed on
adaware 10 we're not really quite sure
how secure it will keep you we know it
will help you it's better than not
having anything but until those
benchmarks come out in a few months it's
still an open question it is recommended
if you trust ad-aware go ahead keep
using it but for right now it's more
about the fact that ad-aware 10 is in a
position to compete for the first time
in a really long time where for years it
was sort of dying off and that was
really unfortunate for the first look at
ad-aware 10-4 cnet i'm seth rosenblatt
