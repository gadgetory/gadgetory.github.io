hack and LG SmartWatch it's a new design
I am Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update if you had trouble logging into
Sony's PlayStation Network over the
weekend it looks like prankster hackers
could be to blame a group or individual
calling itself the lizard squad boasted
on Twitter that it caused an
interruption in service for several
online video game networks along with
PlayStation there were also
interruptions with EVE Online League of
Legends and blizzards battlenet now Sony
says the hackers did not access personal
data of the members rather this was a
distributed denial-of-service attack
which causes chaos by flooding the
networks with more requests than it can
handle
so people are blocked from logging in
Sony and other networks are back online
now these types of denial of service
attacks are common but the account took
the trolling to an alarming level by
tweeting that there may be a bomb on the
plane that was carrying the president of
Sony Online Entertainment there was no
bomb the plane was diverted and there
were no explosives found on board
switching gears to the world of
smartwatches there's another round
Android powered watch coming soon
LG's square G watch has only been out
for two months but LG is coming out with
yet another model this time with a
rounded face LG posted a teaser video
online and more details will come next
week at the IFA trade show in Berlin in
other gadget news if your iPhone 5 has a
short battery life or if it needs to be
charged frequently Apple may replace
your battery for free Apple has a page
online that lists the serial numbers of
the iPhone 5 models that may have
defective batteries which were sold
between September 2012 and January of
2013 Microsoft may be trying to clear
out inventory of the surface 2 tablet
because it just cut the price by $100
Microsoft says the pricing is good until
September 27th or while supplies last
and we've seen fitness trackers for the
wrist but Ralph Lauren has put trackers
in a high tech shirt if you're watching
the US Open tennis
tournament you may notice some ball boy
is wearing the polo Tech shirt which
features sensors knitted in to read
biometrics although for now most folks
will probably stick with the fitness
bracelets job on maker of the up24 band
shared some interesting data from its
users when an earthquake hit Northern
California on Sunday morning jawbone
says it's almost all up owners living in
the nearby area wake up during the quake
and many users stayed up for the rest of
the night so what can we learn from this
data that jawbone knows where you live
and is watching you sleep
that's your tech news update you can

studios in new york I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
