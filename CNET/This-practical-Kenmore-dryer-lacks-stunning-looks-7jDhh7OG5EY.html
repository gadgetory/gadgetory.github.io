just say this can wear dryers looks
won't exactly blow you away but for its
1050 price it does offer a compelling
mix of features and performance first of
all this dryer has different ways to
handle many different types of garments
you also have very easy-to-use controls
that are intuitive and you can find
anything you want to it's very easy to
understand quickly this dryer has
steamed oats too which comes in handy
for refreshing clothes but you do have
to use a manual steam feeder essentially
it's a little reservoir that you fill
with water by hand instead of hooking
the machine up to a dedicated water line
as far as capacity goes this dryer is a
bit on the small side of things you only
have seven point four cubic feet of
capacity most dryers now come in eight
or even nine cubic feet like I said this
dryer just does not look very exciting
it doesn't have any high-end components
or materials there's no glass or lots of
Steel or or even shiny paint jobs or
anything like that it's very generic
looking so don't expect to be thrilled
by the looks of this machine so if you
buy this dryer you won't be disappointed
but you won't be thrilled either if you
want a little more attitude you're gonna
have to go with something from LG or
Electrolux</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
