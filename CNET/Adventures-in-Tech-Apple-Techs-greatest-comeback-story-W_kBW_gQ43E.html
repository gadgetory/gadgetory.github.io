save the business it established a
template for success that would propel
the company into the stratosphere sit
back and relax this is Tech's greatest
comeback story
the mid-90s Apple was as good as
finished hemorrhaging cash and dallying
with weird side projects even as its key
product the Mac was sliced into dozens
of dull gray variants that became almost
impossible to tell apart in 1996 Apple
lost eight hundred and sixteen million
dollars then over a billion a year later
desperate the board turned to co-founder
Steve Jobs who'd been kicked out a
decade earlier but was now back as a
consultant Apple having bought his other
computer company next back in the
driving seat Jobs was ready to forge a
comeback the getting Apple shipshape
again would prove a messy business in
his first year back jobs fired over
3,000 people wiping out projects and
products left right and center apples
Pippin platform which had been turned
into a games console by Bandai was axed
as was the Newton PDA and style writer
printers jobs also put a stop to Mac
clones a scheme that had seen the Mac OS
licensed out in a bid to make it more
widely used and sorted out the Mac
lineup pairing the strategy down to a
simple grid of four computers for at
home or on-the-go for personal or
business use cuss so simple we should do
that for more stuff as a majority of
Delegates agree there are simply too
many animals the UN proposes a new
taxonomy it hopes will be less confusing
Apple had cleared its decks but
confidence in the company was low jobs
proved his determination however
revealing a partnership with Microsoft
at Macworld in 1997 the two companies
had been warring over patents for years
but agreed to squash the dispute forging
a deal that saw Microsoft invest a
hundred and fifty million dollars for a
stake in Apple and to keep making office
software for Mac in return Jobs made
Internet Explorer the default browser on
Apple computers you can hear how well
that went down
decided to make Internet Explorer its
default browser on the Macintosh
almost as well as deploying a giant
video feed of Bill Gates looming over
everyone an on-stage gaffe that called
to mind a futuristic dystopia in which
Microsoft rules the world
the tie-up worked giving Apple breathing
room to create the products that would
define its comeback and wash away the
memory of those boring beige computers
having killed off the performer range
Apple needed something new to sell to
families the colorful iMac fit the bill
with a futuristic translucent blue
curved casing that cost three times as
much to build as a regular computer case
but proved it's worth when it was
unveiled wowing onlookers and bringing
to the forefront a plucky designer
called Jonathan Ive who later admitted
he'd been on the verge of quitting
before Jobs returned the iMac was the
public face of Apple's comeback and it
worked like a charm
Apple sold 800 thousand before the end
of 1998 and began raking in profits
Apple's comeback strategy didn't just
save it from financial ruin it
established a template that worked and
over the next decade a focus on fewer
better products strong design and
powerful marketing would turn Apple from
a company on the brink of destruction to
one of the most powerful on the planet

comeback and how do you feel about Apple
