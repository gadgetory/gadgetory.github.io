I'm Meghan Willerton for CNET here today
to talk about the nest cam that is nests
$200 replacement of the Dropcam Pro at a
glance there is a lot that's different
about this model visually it still has a
black finish you can still remove the
camera from the stand to mount it
somewhere but there are a few tweaks
that make it slightly more appealing for
starters it has a magnetic base and it
has a rotating stand so you can actually
get that optimal angle a lot more easy
than the last version this version also
text on 1080p so it has double the
megapixels of the 1 megapixel 720p
Dropcam Pro the thing is even though the
1080p is noticeably better the Dropcam
pro 720p was so good that the
differences are kind of minimal if you
already own the Dropcam pro so I
wouldn't say that a Dropcam Pro user
should run out and buy an S cam today
even so it isn't upgrade so folks that
are looking to get into DIY webcams and
security cameras for the first time will
be really pleased with this product set
up was really really simple this camera
has a small QR code on the back you
basically scan that enter your local
Wi-Fi information name it and you're
done and the thing I really love is that
nest also announced a new app along with
this new camera so you can consolidate
your nest thermostat your old Dropcam
Pro and your new nest cam all into one
space so you can access them side by
side the one thing that I really really
don't like about this camera it isn't
really a security camera so it does
issue motion and sound alerts but you
can only get one motion or sound alert
every 30 minutes so if I happen to
trigger a motion or sound alert when I'm
heading out the door for work for a full
day and someone breaks in 10 minutes
later and is out the door in another 10
minutes I won't be receiving any alerts
I would literally have to be watching
the live stream watching the activity
log to see that something had taken
place that's really really limited as
far as security capabilities so if
you're looking for something that is a
real security camera that provides
robust features like a siren arm and
disarm functionality that kind of stuff
this really really isn't the camera for
you for more check out my full review at
