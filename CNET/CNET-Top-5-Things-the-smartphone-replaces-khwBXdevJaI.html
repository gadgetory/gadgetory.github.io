sure you know who's still carrying
around some dumb flip phone telling you
I don't need a smartphone I just want to
make calls okay that's a little harsh
but smartphones aren't really even about
being phones anymore
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five
things the smartphone replaces not even
including your home phone line based on
a survey done in June 2011 by prosper
mobile insights see how many of these
ring a bell with you number five is the
mp3 player 37 percent of us don't use
one of those once we get a smartphone
you see simple phones were generally
crap or non-functional as iPods but
smart phones are usually at least okay
with their big colour screens touch
interfaces plenty of and often
expandable storage oh and they are
connected so they can stream stuff like
Pandora and Spotify at last.fm now you
may find a smart phone a little too
bulky or delicate to sweat all over as
your gym music device but aside from
that you can see why the iPod is rapidly
becoming quaint tip number four is the
personal planner 41.6% of us ah thank
you smart phone for jamming a stake in
the heart of those horrible old Franklin
Covey day planners with their bad
pleather jackets that match your bad
tassel loafers of course syncing
calendars across various web services to
various smart phones can give you a
stress-related disease but at least you
won't die clutching a day book number
three is the digital point shoot camera
about 44% of us said goodbye I don't
recall the last time I used my
point-and-shoot digital not even sure
where it is to be honest for many people
there just is no longer a gap between
the smartphone on one end of photography
and the DSLR on the high-end smartphones
now take high-res photos off an HD video
they share the stuff because they're
connected they can GPS stamp things all
in one little stealthy device that
doesn't say I'm a tourist oh by the way
if you want a great camera phone check
out my other recent top 5 best camera
phones at top 5 cnet.com
okay the number two thing the smartphone
kills is the GPS portable navigation
device 52% of us don't use those once we
get a smartphone now there's decent -
excellent turn-by-turn navigation
they'll say yeah too many compromises
the screen size is a little too small
the power usage means I might not be
able to make a call multitasking can be
kind of clumsy but you know most of us
don't use and have that often once in a
while like I bet you know how to get to
work and back so GPS navigator business
can you guess what it is here are some
other things that is knocked off from a
little further down the list including a
disturbing one 24% of us say we got rid
of our computer because we got a
smartphone let's not go overboard here
okay the number one thing people say
their smartphone put in the box to sell
on eBay is their alarm clock right I
don't even know how to set my alarm
clock anymore your phone is your
appointment travel to do and home alarm
device why would you have a separate one
on the nightstand that does nothing but
just wake you up for more top fives like
this go to top-5 cnet.com i'm brian
coulis thanks for watching
