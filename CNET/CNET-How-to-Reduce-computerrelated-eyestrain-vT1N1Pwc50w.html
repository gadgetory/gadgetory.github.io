day is making your eyes burn your neck
ache and your vision blurry you might
have a common problem known as eye
strain in medical terms it's called
computer vision syndrome and today I'll
give you five tips that will hopefully
make it all go away sometimes a simple
tweak to your monitor setup will do the
trick
so your monitor should be twenty to
thirty inches away from your eyes if
it's too far or too close adjust
accordingly also the top of your monitor
should be at eye level because you
should be looking down at your work not
up so if you need to adjust the height
of your monitor up or down if you need
extra height you can use risers like
these or hardcover books if you have
them around there is a chance your eye
strain is caused by too much artificial
or natural light so if you can turn off
any harsh fluorescent lights instead use
a floor lamp or a desk lamp and position
it so that it's giving off indirect
light on either side of your computer
one simple way to offset long hours at
the computer is to use the 20-20-20 rule
every 20 minutes you find an object 20
feet away and stare at it for 20 seconds
doing so will exercise your eyes plus
it'll give you a little relief from
staring at a bright white screen all day
if you need reminders to take these
breaks consider a program like break
taker for PC or timeout for Mac in an
office or even at home you might have a
lot of light around your desk natural
light coming from a window and worst of
all the backlight of your monitor all of
these things are really harsh on your
eyes and cause fatigue so one solution
is Gunnar's glasses they're tinted
yellow to offset the cool blue light
that your monitor produces in my
experience they've been a big help but
they do take some getting used to and
you've got to look like this
if your keyboard is over here and you're
reading materials are over there and
your computer screen is up here you're
forcing your eyes to constantly readjust
to those various distances which causes
eye fatigue and headaches and so on and
so forth instead your keyboard should be
directly in front of your computer
screen and your reading materials should
be adjacent to them an easy way to do
this is to use something called a copy
holder which holds your papers in place
while you type with all these tips in
place hopefully you'll see a lot less
stress on your eyes but if you're still
suffering it's just getting an eye exam
you might find that all you need is a
pair of reading glasses if you have any
tips or questions hit me up on Twitter
