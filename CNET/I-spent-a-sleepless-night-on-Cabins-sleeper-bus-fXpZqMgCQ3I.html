I can't see that's me inside cabins a
new way to travel between San Francisco
and Los Angeles it's a bus with 24
sleeper pods that travels overnight for
115 dollars you're probably thinking
that taking a flight is cheaper and yes
it usually is LA to SF give the second
busiest passenger air route in the US
with nourish shortage of seats so why
take a bus for eight hours when you
could fly it in an hour so we tried to
design is the most comfortable way where
you don't burn any of your high-utility
day while being transported cabin wants
you to think of this as a hotel on
wheels rather than a bus Jade sustains
when they put on the bed there are fancy
amenities in the bathroom Wi-Fi
throughout and power outlets inside each
bunk drivers take this smoothest route
not the fastest to help you get
displayed we used all kinds of apps
accelerometers etc to really judge the
bumpiness of different roads the speed
limit of different roads how curvy it is
but we're really optimizing for is
comfortable I climb on board and meet
Jason who's making his second cabin trip
and it's a lot more convenient than
going to the airport especially like LAX
and SFO flights are very often delayed
which is super frustrating
there's definitely no delays or tsa
lines here you jump on board roll into a
bed and pull the blackout curtains shut
hopefully with a little more grace than
me but I actually have some room to
stretch out and as someone who's almost
six feet tall this is a novelty sleeping
clean a lot of water in front of course
with the Wi-Fi password a reading light
this stuff called dream which contains
Hydra
the hydroxy triptych Nana
pays like dreams
while I'm waiting for the dream water to
take effect I head to the lounge area to
see how fast the Wi-Fi actually is and
it's very respectable averaging 24
megabits per second buck speeds along
the route very because it's using a
hotspot so go ahead and YouTube you're
hot out but no Netflix and chill cuz
there's a strict one person per bed rule
we're currently on the 280 heading south
and then so the worst thing just
happened he started to feel really
Martian sick sorry should I put the
earplugs in for the best
in the end I didn't end up getting a
full night's sleep but I have to say the
beds were actually really comfortable
and the Wi-Fi was great so I could
listen to music during the journey maybe
next time I'll need to double up on that
dream water</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
