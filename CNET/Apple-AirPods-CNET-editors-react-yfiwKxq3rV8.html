the new Apple audio wireless solution
yep
this presents a bit of a challenge for
me because generally under aqueous I'm
yeah generally not averse to progress I
think that Apple has had a lot of
success in the past but being very
ruthless when it comes to scrapping or
technology yeah and you know now the
headphone port was gone and there as
well Dave their solution there like this
is the thing you can use instead the
airport I'm not sold on it it's the
design what do you think yeah I mean I'm
kind of on board with the idea of it I
have to say like there was all this talk
about Apple getting rid of the 3.5 ml
headphones they were just gonna have a
lightning connection and then they they
ditch their headphone jack and then they
put a little adapter in the box what a
cop-out like you know as if you call
that courage well as if as if you know
Steve Jobs would never have gone like
well let's put one extra thing in the
box he was all about taste about the Box
video and so the actual I really like
the idea of what a wise head well I'm a
reveille recent convert to wireless
headphones okay I love it you can get up
you can go to the bathroom you know
let's take them off you don't talk to
anybody on the way it's fantastic I'm
less keen on the fact is that these are
Apple earbuds and the Apple earbuds are
awful they just don't fit I don't know
anybody who like they don't fit in your
ears you know in-ear headphones there's
those different types of in ear
headphones that loads of choice and then
different you know different ones to fit
there's the ones that have like the
little thing that loop over your ear if
the supports and there's you know
there's every single set of it of ear
in-ear headphones comes with like
different rubber shaped things to you
know four different shapes of it with
that with exclusive purpose of keeping
them sealed inside you're keeping them
sealed in at least when you drop a pair
of wireless headphones like if they if
one falls out of your ear because it's
not very comfortable it pop Falls that
really pops down hearing okay you stick
it back in again it's no problem at all
sure but with with these things
I mean apples ear buds they're just like
trying to put a clenched fist in your
ear like they never stay in your ear
with the white cable so I don't know how
this is going to work with that with
these things that are hugely expensive
yet held into your onto your head in any
other way what I thought was a little
unusual was how yet again since the
acquisition this was another Apple event
where we saw beats fairly sideline
and I thought this would be the point
where they would really shine they
weren't so beats branded as odd the
beats I mean as far as we can tell
didn't have anything to do with the
engineering this is really whatever you
think of Bateson is a divisive company
amongst audio fans because some people
don't like the sound just don't like the
sound they make I mean they do know how
to actually make things that stick in
your ear and they are an audio company
that's that's kind of their expertise
what do you think of the little dental
floss charging box yeah I mean you see
yourself carrying that around I'm not
sure about that I think someone someone
is probably four already working on a
case that you can just stick the earbuds
in the back of the phone but so going
back to what you said about Beats so
that you think it's fair to say that
they forgot about Dre there we go I
think we'd better wrap up there so I
mean we're yet to be convinced but we
have to try them we're trying to keep an
open mind we've got to try them and who
knows maybe apples nailed it and this is
in any year's time we'll be walking
around with the little toothbrush like
your due process I'll be on my fifth
pair by that you'll be oh yeah
definitely they'll be a plenty if you
need to be littering the street yes when
you go to visit friends instead of going
like oh java charge you'll just push
down the back of their sofa and you'll
be able to pull up like fistfuls of air
pods anyway that's what we think but let
us know what you think guys and stay
tuned
