2012 I am Jeff Bakalar from cnet com and
it's time to get loaded now don't call
it a scandal just yet reports of the new
iPad getting hotter than its predecessor
during use they are widespread so our
own Eric Franklin did a little
investigating of his own and in his
testing he was able to get an iPad up to
94 degrees it's actually not too bad
especially considering some laptops can
get up to 115 degrees and Consumer
Reports says that they've gotten their
iPad up to a hundred and sixteen degrees
regardless of how hot you can get your
iPad it's most likely due to the iPads
LED backlight so here's a great story
for the next time someone tells you
you're spending too much time on reddit
like my wife frequent redditor James
Irwin has parlayed a response he gave to
a reddit question into a gig as a
full-time professional screenwriter he
answered the question of whether or not
a modern-day infantry battalion could
take out the Roman Empire Irwin
fashioned his answer into a short story
and other redditors demanded more of
that story long story short he now works
as a full-time screenwriter that is
pretty awesome is 60 milliseconds worth
1.5 billion dollars well that is how
much it's going to cost to lay down
fiber to reduce the latency between
London and Tokyo starting this summer a
convoy of icebreakers will start the
unprecedented project that will connect
the two cities just a little quicker
think that's not so well get a load of
this nokia has filed a patent for a
tattoo that vibrates when you get a call
that's right you heard correctly the
tattoo would generate a perceivable
impulse to your skin whenever someone is
calling using something called Ferro
magnetic ink each tattoo would be unique
because we can't just have
vibrating tattoo going off at the same
time when everyone gets a call and
finally hot off the runaway success of
Louis CK's digital-only comedy special
star of parks and recreation Aziz Ansari
is attempting to follow suit with his
own five dollar drm free digital show to
be sold exclusively online Louis CK's
experiment pulled in over 1 million
dollars so it will definitely be
interesting to see if an sorry can match
it those are your headlines for today my
name is Jeff Bakalar for cnet.com and
you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
