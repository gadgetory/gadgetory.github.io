bought an iPad maybe you want to outfit
it with a keyboard because you wanted to
be kind of like a laptop
well the logitech fabric skin keyboard
folio is one of several options that you
have out there how do you know which one
to buy well we just reviewed the
ultra-thin keyboard cover which is also
made by Logitech and just acts as a
cover for your iPad but had a really
great keyboard now what is this one this
is a full case and the idea behind the
fabric skin is that it is splash
resistant this whole thing here is
covered in a a fabric material that can
resist splashes it almost feels kind of
like a like a rubberized cover but
that's the way the keyboard actually is
designed and this whole rubberized
design wraps around your iPad so you
could drop it maybe I don't want to do
that too many times and it feels pretty
sturdy it's expensive though it's $150
the advantage to this keyboard case
besides its splash resistant design is
that it Auto connects to if you snap it
right in here magnetically it actually
knows that it's connected and turns on
in pairs that's great because if you
want to close this and turn it off it
won't keep bluetooth on and drain the
battery of the keyboard or if you flip
it like this in a tablet mode which you
can do it keeps these keys non connected
so you won't accidentally press anything
and now you can work on your iPad as you
normally would there are a few cases out
there that already do that like the
Belkin ultimate keyboard case that I've
also looked at this keyboard layout here
I'm not as big a fan of it's big it's a
little weird
the keys are compressed you have to
share tab and share caps lock with the a
key of the tab with the Q key there are
some keys missing and the keys are big
but they're almost too widely spaced I
prefer the Logitech keyboard cover but
you know take a look at it and see how
you feel if you want one however that
feels pretty kid-proof that feels
compact
pretty sturdy and don't mind paying up
maybe you want to get the fabric skin I
feel like for myself as a traveler it's
not the one I gravitate to oh and it's
got a cute little stylus loop if you
like styling I'm Scott Stein and that's
a look at the Logitech fabric skin
keyboard cover for
the iPad air</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
