and we're taking a look at the JBL SB
300 is a premium price sound bar selling
for about $500 and it has a very
distinctive design the sound bar itself
has sharp angles with a plastic cabinet
that kind of looks cut away to reveal
the speaker grille the subwoofer is
Wireless and not only is a pretty huge
it kind of looks like Darth Vader's
helmet both of these components really
draw attention to themselves so if
you're someone that wants their home
theater to blend into your living room
rather than stand out this probably
isn't the right system for you the
system comes with the remote which is
decent but it's nice at JBL includes one
at all since a lot of sound bar systems
don't come with the remote when you make
adjustments with the remote you'll
notice there's no front panel display on
the JBL so you're not going to get any
visual feedback as to how loud the
system is playing or what input you're
on around back is the connectivity and
there's not much just a single analog
input and an optical digital audio input
that means you're going to end up
connecting all your components directly
to your TV first then connect the TV's
audio output directly to the sound bar
that arrangement should work pretty well
and allows you to use more than just two
devices with the SP 300 there also
aren't any extra features on the JBL
like bluetooth streaming or airplay
which would have been nice at this price
level sound quality is excellent this is
the jumbo size system and that makes a
difference as the S be 300 pounds bigger
when you're listening to music and
movies movie sound particularly powerful
and you're really going to feel the
difference between the JBL and a smaller
system on say loud action movies like
with most sound bars music doesn't sound
great but the JBL does a better job than
a lot of the other competitors overall
the JBL SB 307 SB 16 and it does that
for $100 less so it's a good value if
you're looking for a high performance
sound bar our main hang-up is the style
but if you can get past the SB 300 looks
it's a pretty nice home theater system
I'm Matthew moscovia and this is the JBL
