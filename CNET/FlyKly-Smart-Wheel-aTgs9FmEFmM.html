at stage coming to you live from CES
2015 today right now we're checking out
the fly cly smart wheel with Niko the
co-founder and CEO of the company tell
us about what this device does
apparently it turns any traditional
bicycle into an electric bike how does
that work
yeah first thank you for having me of
course yeah so if you want to write a
bike to school or work and don't be
sweaty right that's what we want to do I
have I sweat a lot so I have a lot of
apathy empathy with that rather yeah
explain how I won't sweat with this yeah
so you have your own bike already we
just take off the wheel yeah you put our
wheel on and this we call it a smart
wheel right and it's a pedal assist so
whenever you start pedaling it helps you
so this is it
so you pedal it helps you and if you
want to stop just pedal backwards this
way it will stop you and also recharge
the battery so how does that work it
whatever the mechanism inside here
generates electricity how yeah so inside
here we have motor battery old
electronics bluetooth all the sensors
everything is inside here
sure so it just when you start pedaling
the sensors now give you the boost
whenever they they know that you want to
stop they just start braking wow that's
very cool so there's a lot of different
bike sizes wheel sizes
how many variations is available yeah so
we're launching it today so it's
available to purchase on our website fly
glidecam and it comes in four sizes you
can buy just a hub and build your own
wheel you can buy a 20 inch wheel 26
inch and 28 inch wheel and it also comes
in white and silver color Wow
so that's stylish I respect that now
what about actually getting this on my
bike what kind of process is involved
with that yeah it's actually very simple
so you just take off your rear wheel
okay and you put our wheel on you put
the chain on you screw the nuts and
you're ready yeah I think we got some
video of how that works
you just have to be in a white room and
then all of a sudden you get yourself a
an electrical bike so now what are we
talking about in terms of costs because
this feels and looks expensive what are
we dealing with here yeah so if you want
to buy the whole wheel it costs 1,100
okay and just a hub it's $1,000 and also
we partner up with to buy companies from
united states right and if you want to
buy a whole bike with a smart wheel it
starts around 1500 so that's the move
right there
it's going that way instead of
retrofitting your bike right what do you
think well it really depends a lot of
people actually like their own bikes
right so they just buy the rear wheel
and that's it you're telling me before
that you know you didn't want to remove
the sort of organic feeling of peddling
right how is that taken into
consideration yeah exactly so I didn't
want to make a moped or motorcycle right
out of a bicycle sure so that's why it's
a pedal assist so whenever you pedaling
it just gives you that boost and it
helps you pedal right so you actually a
lot of people that try that said they
feel stronger with this right yeah very
cool
is this something that can fit any
single bike out there there's no
restrictions there's not you know not
compatible with you know a specific kind
or is this universal yeah it's actually
universal it fits on any bike from
mountain bike road bike city bike to
foldable bike riding tricycles very cool
um there's an app that complements the
whole experience right can you show us
what goes on with the app and what's
available yeah just pop it into that
camera no sort of narrow right there for
you so the app connects through
bluetooth we have an Android and on the
app you can actually see how fast it
going the duration in the distance the
battery level and also one of the great
thing is that you can lock the wheel
with the app you can lock it you can
lock it so nobody can ride right away
really can you lock it while someone's
riding it no that'd be a lot of fun
all right so what about there's like GPS
functionality on ax - exactly so we have
a map here so it tracks where you're
riding so for example last week I was in
Amsterdam so we go here okay sorry
the next one you kept driving in circles
in Amsterdam what's that about which one
oh this one let me stir it right here so
this one that's cool
yeah in the tracks very right and this
is really passionate about is that we
collect this data and if you want to
share it with us right - by city
officials and so they know where to put
the bicycle lanes so you're sort of like
crowdsourcing transportation routes and
whatnot exactly so this way we can make
cities more bicycle-friendly very cool
very cool there you go all right very
cool
so what is the next iteration what do
you guys sort of see in the future once
there's like a good insulation base
weirdy I mean is there like a life span
for something like this how does that
work yeah so I mean we did a Kickstarter
last year so we really started it sure
this year we set up the production and
everything today we're launching it and
but yeah I see in the future I really
want to make the bicycle more friendly
to people and really that everybody will
write bicycles in the cities great and
then you can also get an $80.00
complimentary sort of device that works
in tandem with the charger as well yes
exactly so we also develop a smart light
and the smart light is three-in-one
where it's a light for your bicycle it's
a holder for your phone but you also
charges your phone while you're riding
actually it collects the electricity
from the front wheel excellent all right
well there you have it the fly Kleist
smart wheel it's available right now
coming up at the bottom of the hour
seeing its next big thing supersession
the topic is new realities we'll take an
in-depth look at virtual reality
augmented reality featuring the top
minds from oculus VR technical illusions
