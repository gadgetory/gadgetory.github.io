$1100 Frigidaire Professional dishwasher
looks great and it's actually really
good at scraping away tough soils in all
corners of the machine but it has a
tendency to put loose foods right back
onto your plates and spoons with a
squared handle and smudge proof
stainless steel this $1100 machine looks
the part of that professional moniker
it also has tines and racks that are
easy to use you can raise and lower the
upper rack just by lifting it into place
I particularly like the stem holders for
wine glasses and these fold-out jets
that spray directly into tall items like
water bottles are pretty cool it's also
pretty quiet at 47 decimals but at this
price I wish it had a countdown timer I
wish it had a third rack for silverware
in small items and I wish it had a few
more cycle options the Jets that spray
water in here are pretty well designed
this blue circle thingy at the bottom is
called the orbit power wash tech and
that combined with the spray arms under
the top rack and one at the top of the
dishwasher do a good job of spreading
water over every inch but we found
little pieces of spinach chili and mac
and cheese all over the plates and bowls
so this dishwashers filter couldn't keep
up with the bulky stuff we threw in
there and again this thing costs $1,100
for the same price we've tested a GE
model with a lot more features that
performs better and an LG model that a
star performance tests so this
Frigidaire Professional dishwasher isn't
a bad machine rinse your dishes and
it'll do a good job for you and it looks
nice but I wouldn't recommend it at its
lofty price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
