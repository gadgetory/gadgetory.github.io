second year and has a new design and
while too ambitious it's still not
enough of what I need especially for its
250 dollar price what do you need to get
healthy I need a live I need motivation
i need coaching anything to bug me all
the time help me microsoft the new band
is a lot like microsoft's old band which
you can still get for as low as hundred
twenty-five dollars it has the same two
day battery life tracks heart rate steps
sleep and can show phone notifications
like a SmartWatch on its color screen
the new band is a bit comfier and it has
a curved larger OLED display that's
easier to touch it also has a barometer
for step counting and better heart rate
sensors but you still need to press side
buttons to look at your stats unless
you're working out in the time to
exercise and it's still big it's bigger
than the Fitbit charge HR or the draw
bone up 3 it's not far off the size of
an apple watch it lasts 48 hours on a
charge but if you use GPS tracking
you're going to need to charge a lot
sooner than that steps calorie burn
heart rate distance sleep stair climbing
the Microsoft band tracks just about
everything you need and it syncs it with
Microsoft's cloud based health app which
has a decent phone app and a far better
web dashboard you can set goals and sync
with a small collection of third-party
apps like MyFitnessPal runkeeper and
strava and you can also track a run bike
rider a day on the links with a golf
tracker you can also load in workouts
they give you buzzes and record your
stats for each session but they don't do
what I would like them to do which is to
tell you how to do these workouts or
encourage you to create a workout plan
based on your needs it doesn't do it
well enough you can check messages see
incoming phone calls look at the weather
or your calendar use a special app to
pay at starbucks using a bar code it's
basically a Microsoft SmartWatch
microsoft stores a lot of your data in
the cloud which is great and it draws
some interesting observations on your
behavior over time by comparing your
statistics to the norm in your age group
much like jawbone does but it buries
this data instead of giving you insight
on your phone or your band I want
motivation encouragement I've warned the
band for weeks and it never asked me if
I wanted to try gym workouts or show me
how to set that
microsoft has all the pieces in place to
do some great things of health but so
far they're not all showing up in the
Microsoft band if you're interested in
everything that I just said you could
try it out you can also get last year's
band in a steep discount and pretty much
get all those features to the Microsoft
band in its price just a little bit too
much to ask and doesn't give enough for
me in return i'm scott stein at Cena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
