portable Bluetooth speaker with so many
of these guys on the market we sometimes
end up being tardy covering certain
models we should have reviewed sooner
such as the case for the TDK life on
record 8:33 wireless weatherproof
speaker which has been on the market for
a while and received mostly favorable
reviews from consumers the first thing
you notice about it when you take it out
of the box is that it's got some heft to
it it weighs around 2.8 pounds which
makes it more of a mid-sized wireless
speaker than a true mini bluetooth
speaker if you're looking for something
really portable this is an it but the
exercise at least in this case means
better sound well that's a pretty
straightforward boxy design I liked it
it's got clean lines and the buttons on
top of the unit are nicely indented and
clearly labeled with LED lighting there
are volume controls on the unit but no
pause play button or transport controls
so you'll have to control playback
through your smartphone tablet or other
Bluetooth enabled device the speaker is
equipped with 21.5 inch drivers plus a
2.5 inch subwoofer on the front and two
rear three inch passive radiators on the
back its splash proof has speakerphone
capabilities and its ports are covered
by a removable rubber door that keeps
moisture and dust out behind that rubber
cover you'll find an audio input for non
bluetooth devices a USB charging port
for charging your smartphone from the
speaker's internal battery a power
on/off switch and a 12-volt DC in
charging port I last liked some of these
more powerful compact speakers you have
to charge the unit with a separate AC
adapter and not with a standard microUSB
cable all of these smaller bluetooth
speakers have their sound limitations
and the 8:33 is no different but it did
acquit itself better than a lot of other
speakers in our tests it had some punch
to it space offer decent clarity played
loud firt size and sounded fairly
natural it was able to handle most of
today's simpler pop and techno music
without distorting and had a pleasant
enough vibe to it with relatively
well-balanced sound how it fell down a
little bit with certain tunes for
instance with Nirvana's all apologies
there was a little background buzzing
and it became apparent
speakers simply lack the dynamic range
to be able to handle more nuanced tracks
gracefully as I said the a33 fared
better in our tests than many speakers
in its price range and higher in the end
while it has a few small shortcomings
including only average battery life at 6
hours
it delivers very good sound for its size
and $150 price tag combine that with an
elegant splash proof design as well as
speakerphone capabilities and this
becomes a very solid speaker for the
money
it may not be a steal but it is a good
value I'm David Connolly and that's the
TDK life on record 8:33 wireless
weatherproof speaker thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
