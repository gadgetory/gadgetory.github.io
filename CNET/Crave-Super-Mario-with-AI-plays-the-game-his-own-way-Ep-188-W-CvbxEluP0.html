is back for season three so let's see
what's happening this week on that's
crazy the restaurant in China is
offering free meals to the 50 most
attractive diners the restaurant is
trying to promote itself as a place
where healthy people can go to eat so
each day customers are evaluated by a
panel of local plastic surgeons who make
the call whether or not you pay for your
food that day based on a digital scan of
your face the Jeju Island restaurant a
Korean eatery in the Chinese city of
Xing xao was made popular when someone
outraged by the promotion tweeted about
it along with photos helping to spread
the word about the plastic policies as
the cuteness of your cute puppy worn off
then traded in with puppy swap for a
brand new shiny and forever cute
replacement puppy sounds like a good
evil idea right exactly puppy swap dot
CA is an ironic website launched by the
Toronto Humane Society to highlight the
sad fact that each year thousands of
dogs are turned into shelters by people
who simply don't have the humanity in
them to keep a pet long term for some
folks dogs are just a fashion statement
which is above it the site looks like
legit site but when you click on the
sign up button a recorded message says
puppy swap isn't real
unfortunately pet abandonment is over
180,000 animals enter Canadian shelters
each year 40 percent will never leave
spread the word pet ownership is for
life last week's super entrepreneur Elon
Musk tweeted his plans to move forward
with building a prototype Hyperloop
track for testing in 2013 musk made
headlines when he released his plans to
the public on how to build a Hyperloop
high-speed tube transport that would
connect Los Angeles and San Francisco he
just put the plans out there to the
world and said if you build it they will
come and then silence
well on January 15th musk ended that
silence tweeting we'll be building a
Hyperloop test track for companies and
student teams to test out their pods
most likely in Texas the Hyperloop track
would be able to propel passengers via
personal pods up to speeds of 800 miles
per hour faster than the speed of sound
it is estimated to cost roughly 10
million dollars per 400 miles of
Hyperloop track
a team of researchers at the University
of Tuebingen in Germany have given Super
Mario awareness and now he knows that he
is a Goomba killer by programming AI
into Nintendo's Super Mario advanced
players of the game are able to speak
commands to Mario who will respond based
on emotions and experiences he is
encountered within the game Mario how do
you feel I feel a big load the program
uses Carnegie Mellon speech recognition
toolkit so Mario can understand spoken
language mario has a range of possible
actions he can take based on what he has
learned for example Mario does not know
that jumping on a Goomba will destroy it
until he has been told this piece of
information where if you tell him to
simply find an enemy he will seek out
the nearest moving soul and kill it on
his own afterwards Mario will think
about what has just happened and figure
out that jumping on a Goomba will
certainly kill it it sounds kind of sad
but that's real life sometimes a Mario
how I feel let's hop it
Mario can act according to how he feels
at any given time when he is hungry he
will collect coins when he is curious he
will explore his environment
autonomously but the most impressive
aspect of this experiment for me is that
Mario will learn the ability to reach
difficult locations in the game by pre
calculating how many jumps he needs to
make how high and in which direction
