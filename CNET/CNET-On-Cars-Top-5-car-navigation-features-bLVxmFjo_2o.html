to in-car navigation these days is your
smartphone will you use what's in the
dash or just pull out what's in your
pocket fiddle with it and drive into me
in the process
I'm Brian Cooley with my top 5 car
navigation features it will keep you
using what's built into your dash number
5 is traffic it's actually a
tripleheader your system should have
traffic
duhhh automatically reroute you around
traffic problems when you're under
guidance and third even alert you to
major traffic ahead when you're not
under guidance I'm actually less
concerned with the traffic data source
because they all seem pretty good these
days
number four is it fast some incarnate
systems move like there's a little man
inside reading a map a little man you
want to strangle look for lightning-fast
operation to reduce distraction and your
frustration
this will hinge on both things like
touch screen response as well as
internal processing number three natural
voice the best nav systems today let you
dictate an address by voice as one
string like being able to say 235 second
Street San Francisco instead of separate
tedious operations like 235 then 2nd
Street then push the button again and
say San Francisco like you're talking to
a moron number 2 does it work while it's
moving we'd all like to think drivers
are conscientious enough to pull over to
enter a destination we all know they're
not gonna do that they're gonna reach
for their smartphone if they have to
which is even worse
rolling destination entry also
acknowledges that your passenger could
be the one entering the address wall
under way and of course this also ties
back to good voice command before we get
to our number one car nav feature here
are a few I can live without 3d
buildings I'm not a bird rooftops mean
nothing to me
photorealism I like Street View but
satellite view slows down the current
systems more than it's worth and most
points of interest they usually have no
context or rating I'm not gonna pick a
restaurant from my car the exception
here is for gas stations and ATMs
because they're generic my number one
favorite in-car navigation feature is
connectivity
connected car navigation system
especially powered by Google
fundamentally transforms it into that
same great experience you have online
not that weird stilted one you have in
most cars now a few cars offer this
today more will do so every model year
demand it to stay on top of the latest
in navigation all the other technologies
in cars today go to see net on cars calm
I'm Brian Cooley thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
