member in Ultimate Ears line of popular
Bluetooth speakers available in six
color options the Wonder boom looks a
lot like the ue boom
two shorter fatter sibling and like that
model is fully waterproof it carries a
list price of $100 the idea behind this
product was to create a very compact
speaker that produced big sound with a
good amount of bass that's what a lot of
small speakers promised but the Wonder
boom actually does sound very good for
its small size and it's added girth
helps with the low end performance alas
while it floats it's not designed to
play music while hanging out in your
pool but at least it won't sink if it
falls into the water and it has an
integrated loop to attach the speaker to
anything that loop can fit around
sadly no carabiner is included in the
box but you could pick one up for a few
bucks as for buttons the ue button on
the top of the speaker lets you play
pause skip tracks and double up with a
second wander boom speaker to augment
the sound however you can't turn to
under booms into left/right stereo pairs
there's also no integrated microphone so
no speakerphone capabilities battery
life is rated at 10 hours which is
decent for speaker this size it's
shock-resistant and rated to be dropped
from up to five feet and has an extended
wireless range of up to 100 feet under
the right conditions while the wonder
boom does have its sound limitations for
example it does distort with certain
bass frequencies at higher volumes it is
one of the better sounding micro
Bluetooth speakers you'll come across
there's among a handful of easily
recommendable Bluetooth speakers
hopefully it will come down in price to
75 dollars or less because the UE boom 2
is being discounted and is still the
better performing speaker and JBL's flip
4 also offers stiff competition at this
price point I'm David Carr noise for
cnet.com thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
