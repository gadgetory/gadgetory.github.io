category is not exactly taking the
automotive world by storm nor is it a
halo car cut that far up in their line
so what is the point let's delve into
that as we drive this 2013 x6 xdrive35i
and check the tech the x6 is based on
the x5 but with a four-door coupe UV
body that hasn't worked for anyone else
acura killed off their ZDX which was one
of the few direct competitors but that
doesn't mean that BMW sells a ton of
these alright some numbers first BMW
sold about 6,800 of these guys in
calendar 2012 in the US that puts it
down pretty much near the bottom with
the z4 and the 6 Series Coupe two and a
half percent or so of their US sales but
that's part of the story they kind of
don't want you to see one of these next
to you at every stoplight because this
vehicle is as much about exclusivity as
practicality
inside nothing too unfamiliar BMW has
about the most consistent cabins I think
of any car maker out there so you'll
recognize just about everything
including our wide ish though not the
largest BMW display screen right there
this is the iDrive system you've seen
many times I'll make a couple of notes
about it it's a little messy in terms of
getting around all the media choices I
haven't talked about this in a couple of
years and they haven't fixed it either
so I'm back on it under CD and
multimedia you'll find your optical
drive your music collection that's the
internal hard drive that you're never
going to use and then another submenu
takes you to external devices where you
find your iPod bluetooth streaming and
the aux Jack's here in the console
why are those on separate menus and all
of its separate from radio which is just
another audio choice to me I want to
figure out there are more media choices
under connected drive then down to BMW
apps and then you can access web radio
why isn't that with radio further
fragmentation occurs this way the apps
that are on my iPhone here in the
console which are these web apps I'm
showing you Facebook Twitter web radio
those get their connection from the
phone or in this case my ipod touch
going through my droid hotspot that's a
detail but many of the services under
BMW online like Facebook Twitter Yelp
but not the apps that are on the iPhone
see what I'm talking about get their
connection from the car it's not
consistent to know when or when you
don't have a connection for your online
experiences as for that navigation
system BMW is generally excellent I'm
not a big fan of a little 3d SimCity
thing but you may like that a lot you
can take care of that view by changing
to a different one but this ribbon on
the Left still annoys me it's the other
thing I want to see BMW do something
better out this is a cryptic toolbar and
I shouldn't need to dive into it select
this thing just to zoom in and out that
is an intuitive thing that should always
be available on the knob in some way I
won't even dignify this ancient rear
seat entertainment rig other than to say
2005 called
and it doesn't want its tech back
okay xdrive35i on the butt tells you a
lot about what's in the front three
litre inline-six
direct injection completely variable
valve train in terms of timing and LIF
it's a BMW thing called Valvetronic and
twin power turbo means not two turbos in
a six they do that with their v8 but a
single two-stage turbo that's meant to
spool up quickly at low rpms to reduce
lag but also be optimized differently
with a separate internal scroll for
higher rpm efficiency as well the
numbers 300 horsepower 300 foot pounds
of torque easy to remember makes my job
simpler you're going to get to 60 in
about 6.3 seconds which is kind of
impressive because this guy weighs
almost 4,800 pounds before you even get
in it this is a big boy in terms of
weight and your mileage isn't bad its
1623 now let's compare this briefly to
the same power plant in a 335 X Drive
the sedan or coupe 3-series same power
but you get significantly better mpg
1926 and a 1 second faster 0 to 60
sprint but that car weighs 1,000 pounds
less than this one big difference same
motor
I can sum up driving the x6 real quickly
for you I don't like it I don't know
what it is about this combination of
what is called BMWs n55 engine with this
vehicle but I don't recall driving a BMW
with this engine that is this laggy some
of it feels like turbo lag which is kind
of unusual for them and I also feel like
the weight of the vehicle is perhaps too
much for this engine regardless of what
the numbers are on paper I'm in sport
mode I've gone over here to manual mode
I've run the gears manually on the
paddles at no point am I getting what I
would call responsive driving although I
am getting powerful power output but
that's not what I'm looking for
the car just feels heavy all the time
secondly the handling I find to be a
porpoise II ride I'm getting nose and
butt doing this and it feels tippy I
know we've got a sporty vehicle here but
I don't know it doesn't feel well
planted to me like there's a lot of
counts in the ride like right there so
this is not my favorite BMW even though
it has an M package an M Sport package
and has a sporty look I found to be a
chore to drive how this price this guy a
2013 x6 xdrive35i is going to run about
sixty thousand seven delivered one of
the biggest option packages you can grab
is dynamic handling 4,300 bucks we've
got it on this one but I wasn't all that
impressed with the driving so I might
skip it might not be much worse and
you'd save 4,000 or more the package you
do want is premium $3,300 that brings in
almost all the CNET tech toys including
navigation rear camera with top view the
online services quad zone climate
control and more and BMW apps 250 bucks
don't be cheap you want that but it only
works with your iPhone as of this date
all n-word around the mid $68,000 range
CNET style kind of pricey but also kind
of a value because this car is exclusive
it's very stylish and it's actually kind
of efficient given its bulk its heft
than its size
does a lot for your ends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
