the bear dynamic t51p one of the best on
ear headphones we've tested recently
made in Germany the t51p is a dead
ringer for the company's earlier t-50
but the new model has upgraded innards
and sound it doesn't have a hinged
headband but the ear cups fold flat for
easy storage and included carrying case
which is nicely designed the headphone
lacks a mic or inline controls marking
it as design intended for the serious
audiophile who doesn't want to ever lose
focus on the music impedances rated at a
highest 60 ohms the t51p sounded great
plugged in both mobile devices and a
headphone amp at home the ear cups are
padded with memory foam and they sit on
your ears snugly without applying too
much pressure and overall I thought the
headphones were quite comfortable
particularly for an on ear model some
people may find the metal design a
little cold but the headphones do seem
well-constructed and come with a
two-year warranty the sound balance is
slightly warmer than neutral but detail
and resolution are excellent we thought
it sounded good with all genres of music
and for such a compact headphone its
base is surprisingly robust it's not
overdone or thick but if you crave a
rich low-end the t51p won't disappoint
you put it up against Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins
similarly priced p5 another comfortable
and highly rated on ear model and the
t51p came out the winner
it was simply more present and immediate
sounding it didn't quite measure up to
Sennheiser's over the year momentum
which cost $60 more the momentum is a
little warmer headphone that offers a
bit bigger soundstage it's cord is also
detachable and comes with a second cable
that has an integrated remote /
microphone some minor shortcomings aside
I came away really liking this headphone
and so did Steve Guttenberg who
contributed his thoughts in our full
text review of the product it's fairly
pricey at $289 but if you're looking for
a great sounding on your headphone
that's well-built and comfortable I
highly recommend it I'm David Carr noise
