tablets I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update samsung cooked up two
new tablet flavors the newest model is
the galaxy tab s and it comes in 8.4
inches and 10.5 inches it shares much in
common with the galaxy s5 smartphone
there's a bright and vivid screen
display and a fingerprint scanner it's
located at the bottom of the screen you
can bet it won't be long before Apple
unleashes iPads with fingerprint
security the new tab s models come in
two colors titanium bronze and white and
although they are a bit larger than
apples iPads they are the same price the
smaller is four hundred dollars and the
larger is five hundred dollars these
will go on sale in the US in July there
are special covers to go with the
tablets some are soft but there's also a
hard keyboard docking case now if you
feel like it's difficult to keep up with
Samsung's tablet line well your feelings
are justified this year Samsung has
introduced nearly a dozen different
versions of its tablets and that's only
counting different brand names and
screen sizes there were three models of
the tab for a tab 3 light 3 Tab pros a
galaxy notepro and a galaxy tab for nook
Apple keeps it simple but Samsung just
floods the market with so many sizes and
names that all consumers are left
remembering is the word galaxy but these
galaxy tab s models are said to be the
company's main flagship tablet at least
for now the facebook Messenger app has
been updated to include video sharing
messenger is Facebook's separate app for
private chats the network has been very
pushy and trying to get users to
download this extra app to add incentive
there are features and messenger that
you can't find in the main Facebook
service also in this app update you can
tap and hold the thumbs up to send a
bigger like so like a super like and
finally you may have seen the new xbox
one commercial that stars Aaron Paul
from the show Breaking Bad
and in the commercial the actor shows
off the voice commands of the game
system and how you can turn it on by
saying Xbox on xbox on while some gamers
have noticed that his voice from the
commercial is turning on their sets the
connects microphone is hearing the
commercial and thinking it's the owners
voice commands but if you're watching
this show now on your TV maybe I just
turned on your xbox yo that's your tech
news update but there's always more at
cnet com and you can stay updated by
following along on Twitter from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
