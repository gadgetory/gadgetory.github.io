appliances and we are at GES first build
micro factory in Louisville Kentucky
taking a first look at the new opal ice
maker essentially what the opal nugget
ice maker does is it will take six cups
of water and within three hours it will
convert that into three pounds of ice so
that's pretty fast and you don't have to
go get in the car and drive to your
nearest sonic to grab a whole bucket of
this stuff you can just have it right on
your counter the first thing you'll
probably notice about the nugget ice
maker from opal is that it is very
sophisticated looking it has a stainless
steel design it's very compact so it can
fit on your kitchen countertop or
wherever you want to put it pretty
easily it also has a really nifty button
on the front that will change color
depending on what mode it's in say if
it's making ice or it'll also you know
basically react to what is happening on
the inside of the machine so while
you're waiting to get your hands on the
opal nugget ice maker you can go over to
nugget ice calm to learn more about the
machine you can also put a pre-order in
at indiegogo.com
where they have units that will be
available on July 28th of 2015 for a
significant discount off of the $500
price for the machine I'm Brian Bennett
for CNET appliances we've just taken a
first look at the opal nugget ice maker
