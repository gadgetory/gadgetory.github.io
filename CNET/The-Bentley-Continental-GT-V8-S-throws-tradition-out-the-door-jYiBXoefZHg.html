I've always admired the way that Bentley
does performance it takes a giant engine
it shoves it in a comfy squidgy
beautifully made car and send it off
into the world some of them have even
topped 200 miles an hour but I've never
viewed of Bentley as a supercar they're
more a stunningly made armchair with a
giant v8 or w12 under the cushion a
Bentley is speedy craftsmanship the
Bentley then is a car for the driver who
cares not for a verte show but for
understated go mostly because this
Bentley isn't like its siblings it's a
v8 s and the S adds a little edge one
that might upset those of a traditional
sensibility the regular VA Continental
GT is a fine machine is 500 horses offer
more power than you could possibly know
what to do with and its exhaust is just
the right side of anti-social it's a
concession to hooliganism if ever there
was one the S then is it sangria sibling
the one that was picked on in school so
feels like it has a little bit more to
prove to make its point it's 10
millimeters lower than the regular car
has stiffer Springs adjusted damping and
fiddled with roll bar it's got the
option to have some truly massive
ceramic brakes and it's got an angry
front splitter sills and rear diffuser
its steering is now well suited to some
very unbent liest driving as well
there's more power here 521 horsepower
that's 21 more than you get in the
regular VA there's also more talk not
that you need it there's now 502
pound-feet its 8-speed ZF gearbox has
been fiddled with as well so now it'll
cling onto gears for longer
the extra power and twiki means naught
to 60 takes 4.3 seconds in its top speed
is 192 miles an hour and it does that
despite way 2295 kilos that kind of
thing doesn't really add up in your head
it's like doing the hundred meters in
less than ten seconds with a hippo
strapped to each knee odd but very
impressive there is one more party
please lurking within the v8s that's the
fact that it will apparently do 26.7
miles to the gallon really and it emits
246 g/km of carbon dioxide now for a car
this fast and this big that's quite
impressive that's all download to its
engine it's a 4 litre turbocharged in it
the same one you'll find in the audi rs6
for example and that's got a neat thing
in it it's got cylinder shut off so when
you're cruising it will turn off four of
its cylinders until of course you plant
your foot and then all eight of them
spring into life and you use all of the
fuel but still it's smart so far this
Bentley appears to be distinctly unbent
Li but at the same time it harks back to
its DNA images of the Bentley boys
ragging their cars to the very limits to
Bentley's new gt3 racer spanking around
a racetrack all fit here the VA s
appears to be just that little bit more
than the other cars in the range allow
me to explain every other Bentley I've
driven has been punishingly fast the v8
made a very nice noise but they've
always felt very much like a Bentley and
what that means is that
everything has been very soft very
squishy very comfortable very geared
towards relaxation having a calm
luxurious drive but when you want to you
can just twitch your right foot and
you'll fire yourself off into the
distance whereas here there's just a
little bit extra there's more going on
you don't feel like you're hefting
around too much you're not wrestling
with this giant beast it dances with you
it plays with you it it indulges you as
you'd hope it would I said at the
beginning I don't really think of
Bentley as a supercar I'm going to stick
to that I do think it is a beautifully
upholstered way of going incredibly
quickly however this feels more like a
sports car than any Bentley I've ever
driven this is the closest link you can
get to their racing car the gt3 the
mental thing that's been kicking ass all
over the world but is this a grand
tourer with some sports car bits on it
or is this now a sports car with some
grand tourer uses its found that middle
ground that balance between being really
good fun but also you don't have to turn
it off you have to press any buttons for
it to be the relaxing GT you want a
Bentley to be you're just simply treated
as such I like the regular v8 its noise
power and loveliness made me go all
tingly but i did find its drive
incongruous where it had the pace of
something pretty mental even in the
hardest suspension setting it felt a
little soft great for most people but
I'm so awkward it put me off it a bit
this though
this is a fantastic bit of kick the S
here doesn't simply mean have a bit more
power and away you go no it means you
get a better drive still very much a
Bentley drive but a more engaging
sharper one until the inevitable super
sports appears this is the best handling
Bentley you can throw money at and as
usual for a Bentley a beautifully made
one of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
