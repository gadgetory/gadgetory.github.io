internet of things and jumping straight
to 4G to do it think of it as the car
having a guardian angel driving with you
very responsive touchscreens rich
graphics you can watch your Netflix
movies in the back you're drawing upon
things in the cloud it happens very
quickly now you may have noticed that
cars have been connected for a while but
typically today it's through a kludgy
tether to a smartphone and even then
running on the older 3G network the big
trend that I'm talking about is
integrating that wireless connectivity
right into the car no phone involved and
doing it on the much more capable 4G
network technology you have screens in
the car that really need to catch up to
what the consumer expects from their
phone and tablet today things like
Google Maps in the car even Google Earth
with satellite imagery really enhancing
that driving experience it also gives
that persistent connection to the
vehicles so they can always be online
and always have availability to connect
to services whether you're doing
searches whether you're trying to get
real-time data for traffic or for
parking I think we'll start to see
taking place from the car as well before
you see things like fully autonomous
Drive these things really can't happen
without a real robust connectivity now
4G in cars nails three things from a
technology point of view the first is
persistence you get in the car you turn
on the key and that connections there
every time tethered data phone
connections tend to be more tenuous not
every driver has a smart phone that
every driver pairs them not every driver
has the apps that connect with the head
unit it's a kludgy mess the built-in 4G
and built-in apps in the dash are a much
cleaner robust solution the next step is
speed 4G and cars should be
transformative ly faster than the 3G in
most phones still and not just
evolutionarily so it's a real deal
changer and this is also going to be a
sort of a late mover leg up for cars
because they're going straight to 4G for
the most part as opposed to darling with
built-in 3G and finally there's
integration a built in for
gee connection can tap into more of the
cars actual sensors and systems than a
tethered phone is allowed to that means
things like vehicle location vehicle
health status of various systems all
that can be brought into the connected
car experience which your phone just
can't deal with now the fruits of these
technology integrations are many my
favorite is cloud based navigation among
the features here are being able to have
photorealistic maps that arrive quickly
being able to look at a street view
image and pan through it smoothly and
being able to do rapid cloud based
search for what you're looking for as
opposed to old tired address and Pio I
based search next up is streaming media
with that constant always their
connection consumer and driver habits
will change and start to count on
streaming medium or almost as reliably
as radio or CD usage and this also means
4G can give us reliable video streaming
to the second row no more of those few
DVDs your kids are sick of then there's
integrated calling right now most of us
pair our phone and that's how we get our
calling done and that works well but
going forward with the integrated 4G the
car will be one of the first platforms
to have what's called HD voice that
means you will get much higher fidelity
in your calls which helps in that noisy
environment and something called duplex
calling where when you talk at the same
time with someone else you won't step on
each other it'll be more like a landline
where you can talk at the same time
that's a nice innovation in car hotspots
now these have been around for a while
but with 4G they'll finally be able to
credibly support several devices
connected all at one time through the
cars hotspot in the past that was
basically a pipe dream I'm still not so
sold on this as I think car makers want
to push to the world of you using the
in-dash services which have much more
rich data for them than just providing a
dumb pipe for you to connect your iPad
from the backseat finally there are
over-the-air updates a constant 4G
connection will encourage car makers to
start doing these like you get on your
smartphone or tablet once or twice a
year look at what Tesla's done with
these sorts of things they've rolled out
new updates over-the-air that have
changed infotainment services that have
allowed the sunroof to operate
differently they even added a new drive
feature the creep function when you lift
off the brake like most automatic
transmissions they added that to the car
with a software update over-the-air with
integrated Wireless now where does it
stand in the real
okay the 2015 Audi a3 sedan is generally
credited as being the first mainstream
car in showrooms that offers built-in 4G
and at a low-end model notice not a
high-end move to Chevrolet next which is
about to put 4G availability in most of
its 2015 cars from large to small that
will go along with Siri eyes free for
example to start to move things toward a
much more smartphone like cabin and then
in a few years most GM brands will have
4G available across most of their models
IHS automotive currently forecasts a
rather modest 1.2 million cars with
built-in 4G on the road globally by the
end of 2015
but look at just two years later in 2017
that's 16 million cars analysis Mason
projects half of all cars on the road
will have built-in connectivity by 2024
and nearly 90 percent of new cars
selling by that year will have it as
well now the biggest hurdle I hear from
consumers is often privacy and data
harvesting tracking they often say this
should map very much to the way other
devices have been used as data probes in
our lives and let's face it our phones
are doing that already but monitor
carefully what's happening with a
different set of regulations here
because automakers are more highly
regulated than most mobile device
manufacturers secondly there's an
additional data plan right now it's 15
to 20 bucks a month give or take after
an initial trial period for you to have
this 4G lit up in an Audi or a General
Motors car other car makers may change
that a bit but that's kind of where we
are right now in the future I think that
will trend towards zero the data there
is so valuable to the car maker and they
want to get a major uptake of this
technology that it would make sense to
knock down any cost hurdles additionally
they are more than likely to sell or
share the data from your car in the
aggregate with third-party partners to
again rub down the price for them so
they can get it to you for nothing but
consumers don't want another wireless
account and fee that much is clear so
there could also be a bundling strategy
because many of the major carriers are
also the ones who are sort of silently
powering this connectivity in vehicles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
