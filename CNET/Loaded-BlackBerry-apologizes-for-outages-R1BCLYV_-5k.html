Bridget Carey on sina com and it's time
to get loaded blackberry users will find
service back to normal today after three
days of worldwide data disruptions
Research In Motion CEO Mike Lazar EDS
said in the Thursday morning press
conference that the network has been
fixed and apologized for the service
issues the problems began when one data
center failure caused a domino effect of
outages throughout Europe and North
America the company said it is now
looking into compensations for affected
customers al was pushing the idea to
investors that it should merge with
Yahoo according to a report from Reuters
AOL CEO Tim Armstrong believes selling
itself to Yahoo will save the company's
1.5 billion by combining resources and
there would be stronger kind of like a
dynamic duo rather than each struggling
alone ebay will be integrating facebook
into its global commerce system which
includes services like PayPal and
shopping site builder Magento by adding
Facebook's new Open Graph function it
means customers don't just click like
for an item but they will be able to
click buy own want recommend or even
review the idea is that it'll be a big
boost for online word-of-mouth marketing
engineers at Stanford University have
developed a tablet app for the blind the
touch screen Braille writer software
creates buttons based on the location of
the fingers it's a similar concept to
how a traditional Braille keyboard works
but of course there are no physical
buttons the thought here is that it can
shake up the expensive market for
Braille devices if it can be as simple
as a nap those who are blind don't have
to pay thousands of dollars for machines
that do the same thing for example one
upcoming android-based Braille display
device costs nearly four thousand
dollars Siri the voice control task
assistant for the iphone 4s has been
discovered to have some pretty
interesting responses to unusual
questions tech website this is my next
posted several gems like if you ask
Syria that you need to hide a body it
offers a few helpful location
suggestions it also answers to who's
your daddy and has some thoughts on the
meaning of life but we all know that
answer already those are your headlines
for today I'm Bridget Carey frisina calm
and you just been loaded
