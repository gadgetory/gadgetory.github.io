netflix with new subscription plans but
the math doesn't always add up I'm
Bridget Carey this is you're seen that
update
amazon is now selling its prime
memberships in new monthly packages but
it's not gonna save you any money in the
long run let's start by breaking down
the prices you can still get the
standard one year of prime for $100 and
it comes with all the perks but if you
don't want to commit to a full year
there's a monthly plan for about $11 a
month and if you just want video
streaming you can now buy that
separately for $9 a month but over the
course of a year
both of these are more expensive than
just getting the normal full year of
prime for $100 it only makes sense to
get these other options if you just want
a few months of access but here's what
makes the options interesting that video
only choice for $9 a month is a dollar
cheaper then Netflix is standard service
Amazon is taking the battle against
Netflix pretty seriously as it also
invests in more original shows Amazon's
also making updates to the Amazon echo
smart speaker it continuously adds new
support for different apps such as
letting you give it voice commands to
control different smart home appliances
or control music on Spotify or even book
an uber car but now the speaker can
answer questions a parent may have about
their child's health like what they
should do if there's a fever how much
medication is safe to give the echo also
works with the home advisor app so you
can talk to the speaker to hire a
plumber or another handyman service and
just a few quick updates to mention
before we wrap Microsoft Skype video
calls now work without needing to
download any plug-in that is if you're
using the Microsoft edge browser folks
on Chrome Safari Firefox and old
internet explorer so you download a
plug-in to do a chat over the website
and LinkedIn just launched a new app for
college students it's simply called
LinkedIn students it helps connect
students with alumni and resources to
help in the job search it even shows you
what other graduates at your school are
doing with their degrees now so things
are looking depressing you could still
change course before it's too late
that's all for this tech news roundup
and you can head to cnet.com for the
latest from our studios in New York I'm
