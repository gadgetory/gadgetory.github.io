you're watching the Apple byte extra
crunchy podcast with your host mr. brian
tom hola yo soy Chino me llamo s Bryant
on Chino I'm serious yo soy Chino you
know what that is look it up it's pretty
it's not too hard to figure it out
what's up everybody welcome to the show
is the alibi extra crunchy episode yet
ready for this 97 bro 98 a nice nice
Spanglish right there this is the Apple
byte extra crunchy all things Apple
going on inside the world of Apple a
complimentary piece to our video podcast
that comes out weekly but really just
all the in-depth good stuff this is a
show all for you all we have tons of
great calls again you guys are like
stepping up your game and I love it
1-800-695-1418 where it stands and what
happened because that was just the big
news in the tech world but we want to
jump off today from the start with a
story from Bloomberg that pretty much
dropped just about an hour ago before we
came up with our buddy mark gurmann and
the headline here Apple is planning a 4k
upgrade for its TV box now we've heard a
lot of rumors that maybe the 4k Apple TV
would show up at Apple's keynote that's
coming out sometime
this September according to Mark Garmin
and company at Bloomberg
their plan to unveil this new 4k Apple
TV with an upgraded set-top box
obviously that can stream 4k
and highlight television content such as
news and sports so this is kind of
changing or evolving how the even the
software will be the updated box will be
revealed alongside the new iPhone and
Apple watch according to them their
sources would not did not want to be
identified but it also says it will be
running a faster processor capable of
streaming 4k content so we could be
talking about an a-10 processor
potentially inside of this new Apple
Apple 4k TV also not only will it
support higher than 1080p video the goal
here is they're testing a version of
their TV app right now the one that
launched back in 2016 that can now also
aggregate programming from apps that
already offer live streaming yeah so
remember when Apple TV first came out
was really app based and then it kind of
evolved into a lot of different TVs TV
stations networks content creators
offering their own versions of apps
where you can watch their programs then
Apple TV created the non confusing named
TV app which then was kind of a place
that showed and kind of collected all
these apps and places to watch stuff in
one place and then the biggest part
about it is that it saved where you left
off on a TV show or a movie whether it
was through the apps or through stuff
you purchase on iTunes from an Apple TV
to other other Apple products but this
is all being folded into what they hope
for this new 4k based Apple TV we know
that Apple teas and some of their
earnings reports that we'd see more from
TV OS by the end of this year that was
actually Tim Cook who's - that
specifically but we also talked about
last year about content and really what
is Apple TV need to be a success mr.
Beecham needs good content
it needs the goodie to draw us in draw
me and take me in they also need a if
they're gonna show off live content on
this Apple TV app I think in a holler at
us or what
oh yeah holler at us man we can we can
eat our own Channel Apple we can
actually start just saying good things
all the time and then that would be
difficult that's a tall order
they'll definitely put us on it we do
that maybe we'll get invited back to
back to
ants and stuff but again this is one of
those things we expect to see but a 4k
upgrade TV this is a report now by
Bloomberg and they're just really on top
of their stuff that's that's pretty much
a confirmation in my mind now we also
want to talk about before we jump into
other things we're talking about the
Apple TV this story dropped after last
week's show I think around Friday or so
but let me just pose this question you
first beat him yes or beat you know we
got we got beach and town going on here
and tell me what you think about this
now there is a story initially started
by Bloomberg that said Apple and Comcast
were in talks with movie studios to
enable them to create a new video
on-demand service that would allow you
to watch movies maybe within 7 10 17
days after their actual theatrical
release so let's talk about it something
like thor ragnarok black panther justice
league what if you could watch those
movies 17 days after they were in a
theater from your home for $50 per movie
see that I'm like on the fence about
this because $50 is a lot but I took my
kids to see Lightning McQueen a couple
of weeks ago right and it and I don't
wind up spending that actual title that
movie is car 3 I wanted a well actually
well actually you their cars triple yes
I wound up spending probably like 70
bucks in the end you know like tickets
food partying it added up and my kids
were like in the seat and they're like
moving around they're like oh they're
like ready to get out of there because
they're like five years old three years
old right so I mean if we could have
watched it at home then this might this
might be good but the problem with this
is that it couldn't mean the end of
movie theaters well here's the thing
though right I think this is I thought
this is great because what has happened
and people don't realize a lot of people
say why why would they do this and
what's happening is because of how much
better our home theater systems are
getting in general because people are
always on the go because of this
on-demand nature and for people that are
watching and listening if you guys can
write your comments right now we'll jump
in and kind of throw some of those out
what do you think about this whole
service but because of the nature of
changing of how things are becoming
or how our lives are evolving around
movie theaters and things are getting so
much better at home right we have like
65 inch screens that are like 4k now
surround sound systems they need to
figure other ways to make money in these
different windows typically you have a
theatrical release and then it goes it's
available for you know VOD on-demand
right and then right so then and then
you like maybe a year later or you know
even on Netflix after let's say six
months seven months you're starting to
see them on Netflix like things like
civil war and all that stuff from marble
so they want to create a new window a
lot of people when they first when I
first posted this story reacted
negatively at their like $15 no way no
way I would never do that you know what
I think there's a group of people that
are like that single young people that
don't want to pay $50 to rent a movie
and this is not even a purchase as a
rental but this is exactly what someone
with a family with four four to five
five five girls right right
three-year-olds
look I know we have a lot of young
listeners I have nieces and nephews I
don't have kids yet but a three-year-old
is a handle two-year-old three at a
movie theater it's yeah I've I didn't
know what I was getting into you see how
long he just blinked you saw how long
you closed your eyes
I felt that so I think it's look this is
great just to even have as an option
just have it as an option to you doesn't
mean everyone has to do this just have
it as an option you want to read you
some real time real cash aleem these are
comments from a YouTube channel another
subscription a posture you know
exclamation it's a resolution on
subscription bro that's really expensive
Oxshott Kumar says this would be the end
of theaters laughing my ass off I love
theaters too much they should be low
this should be lower to $25 a bag of
popcorns almost $10 now so you know a
lot of people feel like right right off
the bat their first feeling was like
it's too expensive they don't want
another subscription and to the point
here harpy two three one on the
periscopes just said for some people
it's about the experience that's why I
go to movies yes yeah but again it
depends on where you fall in this some
people it's the experience some people
it's a hassle to go to movie but you do
because you wanted to share an
experience with your family but if you
just share an experience with the
country as a whole new big movies coming
out oh my god like or even when
sometimes when you see like a movie and
like the laughs are louder and the UH
the oh my god are louder so when
everyone in the room is like doing it
it's like there's something about that
guess what there's something about going
outside and interacting the people like
complete strangers this is like a novel
thing so this is in the works
Amazon jumped on board with this now
initially the pitch was fifty dollars
after 17 days a new number that is being
thrown around is $30 for a rental 30 to
45 days it's Apple Amazon and Comcast
who are in discussions with movie
studios about this the other aspect that
isn't talked about this is the movie
theaters themselves they have a stake in
this right oh you share profits so one
of the proposals is that the movie
theaters the physical movie theaters
would be able to get a cut of these
rentals they wanted a deal that lasted
ten years yes and so that's right they
want to lock in security for themselves
because they don't really don't know how
this is going to affect them no neither
neither do you know Apple and Comcast
one offer I think for people like Apple
can cost Comcast and Amazon it's easy
for them because they can build this
service and just have it there we don't
know if it's gonna people are gonna
really flock to watching at home or not
but again the movie theaters need to
protect themselves they offered a 10
year contract under certain terms but
then the tech companies were like that's
a little too long we don't want to get
locked into giving you this this profit
and margin well we don't even know how
this is gonna figure itself out so I
think ultimately this is an an evolution
where things were going for people that
don't remember the founder of Napster I
can't remember Sean Parker yeah he
actually proposed a service like this a
few years ago but it was poo pooed you
know he comes from a background of
Napster was used for ripping content
music yeah right still recovering right
and he wasn't really their friend no and
never has been so when he tries to pitch
something a legitimate service or a
great idea because of his history with
how he how his beginnings in in
edia came it's like they don't want to
hear him he's kind of a lightning rod
yeah yeah so I think you got to give
props for him for even pushing this idea
out and then which the main companies
going after it just when this article
came out last week though it's it
mentions that you know stock market and
a bunch of these giant cinema chains
dropped by like 8% like their stock
dropped just with the mention of this
article so they're saying these theaters
just need to come out and be firm and
just say no we're not gonna do this
they're asking for 10 years yeah they'll
get 10 years but then what happens after
that then it probably I think it just
conveys it out over 10 years who knows
so uh it's this big stakes here I mean
movie theaters are giant business in
this country you know and I'm still I'm
on this I'm on team I love going the
movies
Dolby cinemas significally not even I'm
not trying to pimp that it's just
amazing you know people that have seen
some other stuff they know how much I'm
in love with that but I still like
enjoyed experience there's nothing that
can replicate it there's nothing that
can replicate a guy with the nervous
shaky leg shaking your chair of the
entire movie yeah
shaky like doing the half turn like oh
my gosh shaky leg guy at the movie
theater are you kidding me I hate that
guy
talking people - yeah I've sometimes
been I'm not gonna be too harsh on that
so anyways love to hear for people that
listen to our show again you guys can
guys and gals can call us
and they're both 12 megapixel cameras it
has a school ability to not only change
the depth of field with shots you take
before right blurring out the background
you can do it after you've taken the
photo the camera right now bottom line
is better than the iPhone 7 + S camera
and guess what it should be because it's
basically about a year difference but
they did this hilarious demo where they
showed like Oh our optical image
stabilization versus the iPhone 7 plus
again yeah it's in that first clip you
had maybe like halfway down it and they
showed someone like on a dock and they
showed the iPhone 7 plus literally being
like shaken like it was on a roller
coaster and I have never I I mean come
on
no I've never seen an iPhone camera
shake that much sure the Galaxy Note 8
has dual optical image stabilization on
both lens but it was such like I'm like
this is BS man this is B as soon as I
saw it - I was like that is silly I
think I found Ariel I'm silly like
someone is literally there's no way
shaking the camera round on purpose
because every iPhone video I've ever
taken is is very you know like you
you'll be you'll notice yourself
that you're shaking like I'm having
around but don't we watch the video and
the finished product it's very stable so
like this is very a child a child
doesn't shake even the child's messaging
shake a camera that much so either way
the note is is really you know they
played it safe because they had the
whole debacle with the note 7 and I'm
not gonna make any more fire exploding
jokes because I've said this before like
if we all it's not only to play it out
if we all love technology
we should we want to see other companies
succeed we want to see them push the bar
we want to see them encourage Apple to
innovate as well in or at least catch up
depending on how you see it so the notes
that the note 8 looks like a solid
competitor but the main point that they
want that they were really trying to
show off is that their camera was better
but then again it's like we're gonna see
a new iPhone like in a few more weeks so
it might be better now like hold on to
that right now but uh the dizzily pretty
awesome man it does look nice yeah
alright should we take a break and show
some love to the people that keep us in
business let me get some music happy to
be in that mood bro we're and there's my
iTunes it justice
running a little slower than yuge I'm
not even worried God all right check
this out ladies and gentlemen boys and
girls our sponsor this week is ero the
single router Wi-Fi model it just
doesn't work for our increasingly high
bandwidth world so what you need is a
distributed system it's zero that's EE
ro
now whatever your Wi-Fi needs are it has
the power to seamlessly blanket your
home in fast reliable Wi-Fi it has not
only kind of this base station but it
has these other wall outlets that allow
you to earn you know like nodes that
allow you to expand the coverage into
any room think of it as a mesh network
not to mention the addition of a third 5
gigahertz radio inside these
second-generation arrows it's now a
tribe an ryoute er twice as fast as its
predecessor it also has a new radio band
to talk to smart home devices as well
the thread radio band so that's gonna be
cool it hasn't really been optimized yet
across the industry but it's ready and
future proof also these beacons
they're half the size are more powerful
than the original ear oh I didn't want
to talk about the fact that my parents
they have like this three level house
and I only at the time had an airport
Wireless an old one cuz they don't
really need that much internet but it
didn't get the best signal so basically
I just gave it a shot right arrow sent
us a package to see does it deliver on
the goods and the setup was really easy
and it was really cool so all I'm saying
is that we used it in my parents house
they have better coverage now because of
it I am going to return the ear I did
not get a Paola I'm just saying this
wants you to try out the product you
just want me to try it out successful so
it's really great again when you have a
distributed network it's going to be
better and also with people's homes I
can't tell you how many people the
number one thing with their wireless
connectivity is like I don't get in this
room how do I do it right this is one of
those ways to do it so check it out
we're giving you what the Apple buy
thanks to ero free overnight shipping to
the US or Canada all you have to do is
visit eurocom that's EE ro comm select
overnight as the shipping option and
enter Apple bite at the checkout that's
eurocom code apple bite holla thanks
y'all
sweet I guess we can keep on doing the
show cuz we saw have a sponsor right
yeah we have a sponsor they're
continuing to sponsor
like like like they should alright check
this out let's jump over we we know
there's tons of iPhone 8 news we always
have iPhone 8 news for you but we want
to keep on giving it to you this is the
latest and this makes sense if you guys
are wondering on your calendar where
exactly is Apple going to announce the
new iPhone 8 and some of these other
products we've heard about the series 3
Apple watch and the new 4k Apple TV
according to Mac forever they believe
based on top it's a European website so
if you pull up the link you won't be
able to translate it and immediately
you'll need the help of Google to do
that but they basically said based on
talking to their phone carrier contacts
those phone carrier contacts have been
told to prepare for September the 12th
as the announcement date for the new
iPhone 8 to prepare for marketing
materials inventory as well that is the
date that has been targeted that is a
Tuesday
typically Apple has done their September
iPhone keynote in the first two weeks of
September
sometimes it's fallen on the 9th
sometimes fallen I think like the 10th
or 11th but it's typically been in that
sweet spot this would really align with
that and then the other part of that is
later on after they put out that first
piece of news they also then kind of dug
deep and there are also now claiming
that September the 22nd will be the
official launch date of the actual new
iPhone yeah put on your so that means
I'm coming back out here bro to see you
oh yes which is nice I mean I I like
when you see my face I like it a lot so
a September 12th potential for the
announcement September 22nd potential
this is not confirmed Apple's not spoken
on the shed
typically we at CNET get invites to
these events like the Thursday the week
before the actual event so we didn't
hear anything this week that means it's
not happening next week we'll keep you
posted with everything there I like this
little breakdown of dates from iPhone 5
iPhone 5s
you know the different launch codes yes
oh yeah it kind of lines up here it
totally lines up in that time frame so
we've had for example the iPhone 6s or
started a lot yeah the iPhone 6s was
announced September 9th released
September 25th the iPhone 7 was
announced September 7th
September 16th so Dave typically in 12
12 10 9 somewhere around there so we'll
see all right also just a quick thing
about the Apple iPhone 8 it was a real
quick kind of little blur bench in the
Korea Herald everyone's we get a lot of
questions about how exactly is the face
ID or the face unlock facial recognition
system for the iPhone going to really
work
again we don't 100% know we can only
pull what we learned from the home pod
firmware that claimed things like it'll
be able to see us in the dark it'll be
able to see you while the phone is
resting on a table at different angles
it'll be a depth sensing the facial
recognition that'll be one of the
aspects it didn't really outlay if iris
scanning is part of it as well those
were some of the rumors but according to
the Korea Herald everyone's talked about
how much better will this be will I miss
the touch ID bun they say that the
iPhone 8 will be able to unlock your
face within millionths of a second nice
one that's what we want immunity in
seconds cuz right now it takes like what
like an a second and a half to do with
your finger you know well that's all
that's on the older that's on the older
touch ID oh yeah yeah you know like mine
if you're not if not with the times even
Beecham it's gonna take like a second
and hours behind I'm on split second I'm
not millionths of a second but I'm on a
split second nice be on millions man
millions is coming yeah you're gonna
you're gonna get it I know you're
alright I'm pretty sure you are I'm the
same I'm saving my dollars are you gonna
have to save like around $1,000 thank
you if you want to talk about that's
which is funny it leads right in our
next story the New York Times just
recently claimed again everyone has been
throwing these numbers around but they
believe this is just actually now the
more that I read this headline this is
just click bait because we know this
stuff in the Apple world Apple the price
premium iPhone at around $9.99 $9.99 but
we've heard this already
it didn't add actually any new
information so I'm not giving them
credit for that that that's lame but the
next story I thought was really cool to
kind of talk about this psychological
barrier of $9.99 I think there was a lot
of people that are gonna completely
ignore it they won't care because
they're just gonna spread that money out
over payments there was a survey
recently by Barclays that claimed only
one in five iPhone owners would be
willing to pay the rumored
1,000 dollar price point for this iPhone
ADA has been floating around that was
according to one of their own surveys
you know Barclays based on their survey
was they thought that people might
defect the Samsung well guess what the
note 8 is starting around 950 $960 but
then a survey by fluent basically says
you know what kind of but that's not
exactly true they surveyed more than
2000 US customers that said only 5% of
iPhone owners would expect to buy a
Samsung the next time they also showed
that yes this makes sense iPhone owners
have the highest loyalty of any
smartphone brand with 79% intending to
buy another iPhone model as their next
phone I'm gonna be curious how this
shakes out because ultimately Apple's
gonna have three models of phone so
whether the thousand dollar iPhone is a
barrier or not I don't I don't think
they really care unless as long as you
buy an iPhone yeah great they don't care
like long as you're still in the
ecosystem he's still using all their
apps all their stuff price discourages
someone fine buy a different form factor
model iPhone and some people have said
oh are they gonna still stick with these
three models or multiple size models
ever since Tim Cook came on board that
was one of the things he pushed for that
was not a Steve Jobs thing it was
definitely a Tim Cook thing and guess
what their profits have reaped the
benefits because of that strategy and I
don't think that they're gonna change
that anytime soon now this is working
for him yeah part of who they are and
they they took that model from Samsung
quite honestly with different sizes of
phones and they don't they're not
worried about it being too confusing or
if it if it bothers the customers in
other iPhone news this was kind of
hinted at in a I don't want to call it a
slip of the tongue but I guess you could
a while back at one of the earnings
calls Tim Cook had actually said talked
about like the Apple pencil specifically
and he said that if this is what he said
this is one of his quotes if you've ever
seen what can be created with that
pencil on an iPad or an iPhone it's
really unbelievable wait wait iPhone do
you see it here if you really if you've
ever seen what can be created with that
pencil on an iPad
or an iPhone guess what that that hasn't
come that hasn't come to fruition
they're like I can't use an Apple pencil
on an iPhone
yet now patently Apple pulled up a
couple new patents that specifically
talked about an Apple pencil
deliberately being referred to as being
used with an iPhone and an iPad at this
numbers won't matter to you but patent
application two zero one seven zero two
two four two four nine nine
it's called noise correction for a
stylish touch device it's deliberately
calls out and clarifies that a
smartphone and tablet are indeed part of
using this stylus with touch to clean
that up
so you think we're gonna see a smaller
stylus then and in the near future maybe
I don't I don't know I it's gonna be you
know it's funny because if Apple did a
their own note product yeah and then you
know I don't think we'll see it this
year but if they did it would just be
like the ultimate like holy crap guys
like how much more do you want to just
take another page from Samsung you know
I just yeah I mean like we've all heard
the soundbite of Steve Jobs saying how
much he hates styluses styli or whatever
you call him so it would almost be like
sacrilegious for Apple to do that ever
phone you know and you know we've seen
that this is the thing again and I want
to clarify this we're not making fun of
them people in the tech world like
innovation we know that Apple is a
perfectionist they might they are not
always the innovators sometimes they
have been like the iPhone was like well
there are already phones out there but
at least the way you used it an
interface was that was like that was a
game-changer right but apples philosophy
has always been like best but not first
and best is in their minds for the
record right but they're they've lived
by this rule of best not first and other
companies like get it out there and be
the best that you can at that point in
time right so Samsung has rolled out
with a lot of this stuff wireless
charging you know OLED screens and
they've been fine you know we had the
note 7 debacle that's fine
but they're getting out the new
technology faster apples like well not
only do we
want to make sure the technology is
mature we want to perfect it with our
platform we want to optimize it and so
guess what the iPhone 8 or iPhone future
or iPhone 10th anniversary is gonna be
an amazing phone specifically for iPhone
users which there are a lot of that just
haven't been exposed to this but it's in
a weird way I know because I'm speaking
for myself it's probably gonna feel so
nice and Samsung users and Android users
will be laughing but when you're part of
this large group once you get something
you haven't had on a daily basis it's
gonna feel brand new to you oh yeah it's
gonna feel like and they're like yeah we
had that I'm like yeah that's fine and
then Apple II was like yeah we we got
iOS where we got whatever we got our we
have our ecosystem it's it's just one of
those things 3d touch is was I was well
there was another um I don't know if
it's the huawei phone there's another
smaller smaller coming that actually
technically launched 3d touch before the
iPhone but the iPhone was the first one
to market with 3d touch but you haven't
seen people really copy that feature and
at the same time it's disappointed me
because I felt like that was a peach of
the Apple should have leveraged a lot
more yeah yeah it's there
but it's not like everyone's like I love
3d touch on my phone some people do some
people don't even know it's there I know
cuz it's it's a new behavior we have to
learn you know and I've talked about
that before like we're kind of tired of
learning new behaviors to unlock things
and write and use our phones so use your
face you know yeah if I can just go like
this and my phone unlocks that's cool
well if it's within millionths of a
second it would already be unlocked by
the time you held it in front of you oh
yeah the unlocking as I'm bringing it to
my face it would be right it would be um
let's just jump over to some iPhone 7s
news I'm just gonna take this top story
so we can get to the calls because we
don't want to linger on this stuff too
long but Benjamin Gaskin one of the
ultimate leakers in the Twittersphere it
has a lot of good stuff he showed off a
photo of what appears to be the bare
logic boards for the potential iPhone 7
plus but the two things to note here
specifically called out in the picture
here that he posted up is a spot for an
A 11 chip processor and an Intel based
modem these are two things that have
been rumored like let's be real an
iPhone always gets a new a new processor
so an A 11 chip makes
complete sense right the fastest one on
the market right now is the 8nx
which is in my iPad pro humble brag but
uh also an Intel based chip which is
interesting because we know that Apple
and Qualcomm have this ongoing
back-and-forth beef we know that last
year's phone the iPhone 7 the Intel
modem performs significantly differently
than the Qualcomm modem that was better
and so sure until it's had time to
Qualcomm that is Qualcomm's expertise ok
so I'm I'm also curious fine if we have
an Intel modem and there are all Intel
modems will the perform will we notice
the difference in the performance will
it bother us I think would it be
interesting to see as if an iPhone 7
with a Qualcomm modem if it outperforms
an iPhone 8 with an Intel modem I think
people will be pretty pissed off it'll
it'll kind of bring bring that little
that group of people that likes to be
vocal and just complain about everything
not me look do you think you'd be able
to notice it in like real-world
environment because I know like we do
like testing here we have a lab and we
test all the numbers right it's all data
driven but if you're like out in the
real world it's like a normal person
gonna notice the thing is so a lot of
times when we do these like speed tests
like they even do tests like launching
apps right and they launch like 30 apps
in row and there's like thirty or forty
second difference and people like oh my
god yeah oh my god but then it's if you
actually just open one app on its own
it's not really that's like if it's us
that's right million split when you're
adding all those split seconds over time
then it adds up and then you're like I
lost 40 seconds of my life launching
apps for the last two weeks yeah bro
first rule problems it's true it's true
I mean again we're so lucky that we got
to be able to just goof around with this
stuff so we'll see how it plays out but
I think with downloading files you can
definitely get a clear distinction in
speed testing if how which one is really
that much better because that I think
you'll feel the speed there versus just
launching an app definitely also when
you're trying to stream video stream
music you know you're gonna run into
some stuff exactly things of that nature
the last story here we want to talk
about just kind of
the Apple watch we know that the series
is Series three is coming out really the
main feature of this bad boy is going to
be the LTE addition to the iPhone or
start to the my brain is scrambled to
the Apple watch not much is gonna change
form factor it looks like it'll be the
same
quite honestly battery life will most
likely be about the same if not a little
less they're not gonna really be able to
pack a larger battery but maybe they can
optimize watch OS a little better
that'll that'll be remains to be seen
because it'll now have GPS it'll now
have LTE in there at the same time
that's gonna use more battery so we'll
see if they've really optimized this it
was rumored they were gonna try and put
it in last year's Apple watch but this
cool survey from NPD data came out to
really kind of exhibit how people use
their Apple watch you know in a day to
day basis and you know mine is powered
on half the time oh it's actually
working today so that's good
sometime right because like I think it's
like the first time on the show I've
seen but let's just look at the survey
it was a survey with I believe roughly
5,000 consumers that have SmartWatch
what do they actually use them for okay
so percentage of SmartWatch users the
number one thing 50% of 54% of these
people the number one thing they use it
for is notifications and text the number
two thing they use it for is activity
tracking that makes total sense yeah
this one stuck out to me and I was
surprised then number four at 26% of all
the different things smartwatches are
actually used for what percentage
percentage of SmartWatch owners use this
function daily that was the condition
daily 26% of them use them for phone
calls that's us
yeah like I that one surprised me then
yeah I mean it is surprising cuz I don't
see I mean I see people with Bluetooth
headsets and yeah but I've never seen
anyone talking into their watch not not
yet I have not seen it if you dude that
that's like if you don't think I like
people taking pictures with iPads yeah
hey bro it's kind of cool it looks cool
it looks cool really yeah
yeah it does look cool no it done
but anyways 26 percent we're phone calls
and we're it that that took me by
surprise that that many people do that
on a daily basis but I think what's
really cool is that actually lens is a
good sign for an LTE Apple watch to be
lucrative and appealing to people you
know I'm shocking that the remote
control for music is so low on that list
cuz you think that would be something to
use it for a lot and also watching
videos and photos I'm surprised how big
that number Oh a 21% yeah like that's
quite a bit at the same time sometimes
when I look at this survey I didn't even
realize it was a response of what they
do daily I bet you some people are like
what do you do with your Smart Watch
daily and they just read it as what do
you do with your Smart Watch they just
check all the boxes you know that type
of stuff happens all the time yeah
interesting stuff coming out for the oh
I almost burped in right directly into
the in the mic absolutely normal
remarkably healthy and normal my bad
alright should we jump in the phone
calls let's do it man all right cool
thank you guys for calling we got a lot
of good phone calls today here's the
first one hey bitchin Tong this is Lucas
from Cedar Rapids Iowa I just wanted to
call and leave some of my feedback on
the Apple TV content or the lack thereof
the first thing I want to say is that it
it doesn't matter
Apple can spend you know $1 1 billion
dollars it doesn't really matter how
much money they spend if the content is
good people will come if the contents
not good people won't come the second
thing I want to say is that their
current content is just completely
lacking I am currently an apple music
subscriber I have been for just a little
over a year now and I haven't watched
the shows that they have available
because they're just not compelling
enough they're what they have is not not
anything that I'm all that interested in
watching I like to carpool karaoke when
it was James
quartern on The Late Late Show and I
would look those up on YouTube and watch
them but they were like 5 or 70 minute
clips and now it's like a whole 20
minute deal like I don't want to watch
that they like completely ruined the
show and I just I have no interest in it
anymore so mostly just my two points I
love the show give good work Thanks
yeah yeah that's a great point he's
echoing what we said and then he's you
know it's like you're watching Apple
commercials almost yeah and even I love
the point of because I don't have it I
also thought what might be freshmen is
on YouTube they released like seven or
eight minute clips of the carpool
karaoke
Oh real on animals YouTube channel for
free and it's just like what
cannibalizing themself yeah and not only
their cannibalizing yeah I get it
they're trying to be like hey get Apple
music but to me it's it's even more like
oh yeah well this isn't really that
great or that exclusive of stuff so
we're just gonna put out on YouTube baby
that's right yeah totally like okay sir
but yeah great stuff great point it's
content like I said we'll say this as
long as we have the show
content is king it always is alright
next call okay I'll just cut a question
for you guys uh I would like you guys to
predict the next gate you know antenna
gate Ben gate for the next iPhone should
be interesting to hear yeah you had a
prediction I don't really have one in my
head right now but sort of but what was
your prediction I think if anything
typically gate comes from new designs
and new features right it's something
that they haven't been able to perfect
as much as they thought I'm gonna go
with I'm gonna go with you know you
would hope that they figured this out
but I'm gonna go with skin gate skin
game I'm gonna be curious if this facial
recognition and this even in this depth
sensor is going to really be able to
work effectively with people of all
different backgrounds that's what I was
gonna say to Brian seriously totally
have this way did you call it skin gate
though or what you guys I don't know
what I was gonna call it actually round
game I was gonna call it like facial
unlock a door something it has to be one
word gate okay there have been that
problem with other apps like not
recognizing people of color yeah and my
you know just doing weird things to
their to their skin or you know that
they are studs so there are issues with
that so I'm curious how Apple's gonna
get around that so you know what I love
that question and I want to open it up
to you the listeners and viewers call us
at 1-866-376-8255 II of a reviewer as
you are just curious how you got your
start
thanks very much love the show been
watching for bands seems like forever
all right have a good one guys
bye you know why it seems like it might
seem like forever but I've been told
that I look about the same from when I
started to you totally so I got
something for y'all agent don't raisin
asian don't raisin you use that you can
use that with your friends next time if
you have Asian friends or if your agent
yourself are you a vampire you like baby
yeah Tom Cruise to to his question um
would I be I think I look if you work
for an FBI any time in your life you
work for
Apple retail stores because you were fan
before like that it actually didn't
enhance it anymore I was already at that
time I was already like I was
intravenously getting kool-aid with the
Apple logo pumped into my veins before I
walked into the Apple store I think as
you as you grow up some and you see how
Apple operates not only there behind the
scenes how they actually interact with
tech journalists you start seeing a lot
of let's just call it shaping the story
or I don't want to outright manipulate a
lot of spin that's that's the right word
yeah a lot of spin and then also this
arrogance that is completely unnecessary
and that is remained throughout so I
think what it has given me is more
perspective maybe more ability to speak
from also seen how Apple used to be in
its heyday versus how it is now and
again they are still financially they
have never been better so they are at
their heyday they're at their peak
financially right now but are they after
peak in innovation wise I would say no
and that's ok but I still I serve so
many products I criticize them because
if they claim they are the best and I
want the best tech then they should
deliver on that promise instead of act
like they're the best we've we've said
this plenty of times so that's why I've
got nothing but love for technology as a
whole like my parents were both teachers
I grew up around it and I'm just a fan
of tech and I love it
do I have a do I lean a little more
towards Apple yeah but then I'm also the
same guy that people say why do you hate
Apple so much like why don't do the
aquaboy Apple don't do the Apple boy get
a new host if they want you to just be
like everything that Apple does is just
wonderful and perfect you see some of
the videos out there on the youtubes and
I'm like holy crap like your nose is
literally brown like your nostrils are
deep with Apple doodoo right now it's so
embarrassing I've actually seen some of
those people who were like diehard Apple
people on YouTube or whatever and
they've actually like slowly turned the
last couple of years you know what I
mean like they're getting burnt out on
it too there yeah it's like what I told
you about people just want to hear what
they want to hear so I say stuff that's
like real people don't want to hear it
they get mad at me I'm like what I don't
hate them
it's like life is bigger than an iPhone
believe it or not true but anyways yeah
I'm a big fan of tech I love it and
thanks for listening all this time yeah
man that's dope alright number call
number four hello my name is andre
taylor and my question is do you think
that the air pods will become easier to
get now that they've gone from four week
coming to six weeks to four weeks thank
you for your time I didn't want to be
too long
hope y'all have a nice day keep doing
y'all bang and I'm from Richmond so
barrier represent Harry and well I could
tell you right now there'll be two weeks
easier to get two weeks yeah I you know
I think he's just hoping in general will
they pop up in stores there a lot of
people here's the best strategy to get
air pods in the store if you want them
you call them around like 12:00 p.m.
that's when your local time that's when
they get shipments and something they
don't they don't even know exactly when
they're getting stuff all the time when
it comes to limited quantity like that
so just call around 11:30 12:00 they'll
know if they have them then you just go
if you don't have a job hover around ya
then just go to store and you can scoop
some up that's how most people are
getting them other than that if you
still want them and for people that
think I hate the product they're wrong I
say it's a very very very good product I
just don't think it's a great product
yet and I do use them don't even get me
wrong I do use them so that means that's
that means I do like them if I didn't
use them it means I don't like them so
yeah I would say they're two weeks
faster yeah and get well keek to sneak
out of rich oh my gosh water rich yeah
he was badly hurt recently all bad
um area baby I'm looking at the comments
and a lot of people are saying expensive
gate that's gonna be the next point
dollar sign gate yeah $1,000 gate
colligate delegate delegate okay we have
one more call here we go BPD bheegi
bheegi what's up Anthony Fontana
California a couple things number one
the watch can be used as a as a phone
but TZ sorry bro you got to get off your
high horse about the air pod man they're
a perfect companion seamless transition
you're not talking into your wrist and
iOS 11s actually making them a little
more effective
the other thing exclusive content for
Apple music I think that they should do
maybe a documentary or maybe even a
miniseries about some of the products
that Apple had that made it what it was
the iPad the iPhone the iPod the eight
when it comes out home pong when it
comes out you know talk to the people
that actually had a hand in making these
things and maybe a little about the
inspiration behind it
you guys mentioned that article about
the Apple Campus that was really
interesting you guys also showed
forestalls interview that was really
cool to watch so I think that'd be some
good exclusive content and beachy bro
Trump talked about these Foxconn
factories before him even said anything
makes him a leaker man I can't believe
you he's an Asian leaker but he also
came out and kind of lied was like
Apple's building a bunch of that's not
Apple Foxconn but let's get back to what
he was saying about oh he was seeing the
content the content the making yes you
were you at you you were excited about
the documentary about about them making
products or something well I think you
know there's a lot of when you go back
in the history or the archives of Apple
there's a lot of joy honestly like one
of the things that I think has been
missing and that's okay but the joy of
design in Apple products yeah like there
was no there's no joint design of that
Apple battery case no no like like for
example the original remember let's
let's recall back to the iMac that had
the moveable neck yeah that kind of
looked like the wall-e lamp the
inspiration behind that was a sunflower
like that's right Steve Jobs saw a
sunflower and then asked Johnny I've to
make a computer design like that that
was functional that's an amazing story
and to watch to see how they came up
with the different concepts and ideas
and that that neck and that that's cool
to watch something like the power at the
Power Mac g4 cube one of the most
controversial Apple products ever for
those youngins that don't know look at
the g4 cube okay it was at the time had
the power of a desktop workstation it
was this amazing beautiful piece of
architecture it had limited expansion
because it was the size of a cube but
also it was kind of a learning
experience for Apple and how they kind
of evolved the Mac Mini
I bought one of those years ago I don't
even know how much they're on eBay now
because I loved the design of it you you
those are the types of great stories I
think Anthony I don't know Anthony got
me juiced when he was talking about the
show ideas Apple should hire him and be
like yeah what other ideas you got
because that would be great that would
speak to the audience right we're
timeout content that we care about
yeah but then again like what I was
saying earlier was like it's almost like
another commercial for Apple now that's
a commercial I'm willing to watch I mean
it does sound cool but I don't know if
you know that's gonna be like premium
content people are gonna want to come
and watch okay fine
you're you I'll give you that but it
would be something that if I bought
Apple music and I was getting content
and if that was on the tier of tier one
being like Game of Thrones level type
stuff that was tier 3 content
programming Apple documentaries on how
they made products I'm so down with that
I would even be cool yeah like real
in-depth stuff I think the problem is
talking to some these people that have
left not only they're not they're not
actually in general allowed to talk
about you know some of do they sign an
NDA yeah like you know why haven't we
heard a single thing from from Ruby
former VP of hardware John Rubinstein
ever since it left Apple
well the Scott for something was really
and yeah like juicy stuff out of it and
some of them don't want to bring
attention because they're trying to do
other things in their career but you
know let's be on about Apple that's why
we're lucky enough to have jobs to talk
about this stuff like seriously yeah so
when people hammer us a dude
where you hit on Apple like we are
thankful week yet if Apple didn't exist
I'd be selling pencils on the corner of
a street man be sitting on my desk right
now doing something not as fun I don't
know you might be doing something that's
great and also to reply I'm not on a
high horse about the air pods I've told
people like they're good they're just
not great damn yeah I have I bought them
I live if I pay money for a product that
means I am behind it yeah and it can be
better so is that we got it man we're
done you know we this is why we talked
about earlier while we like these calls
because there was like some thoughtful
opinion and just great ideas inside
there so keep that type of stuff up as
well as ask questions but did you say
you had a guy had like a eight-minute
call yeah he was talking about the end
of the world yeah don't do that fire and
brimstone
I don't know if that that's this is not
the right show you're not gonna make us
repent buddy this is the apple pie extra
crunchy not live bites you monkey life
bites munchies yeah okay we good to go
that's a man here let me get some
backgrounds like segue out of this thing
yeah all right everybody get out of it
again to be a part of the show be in the
show call us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
