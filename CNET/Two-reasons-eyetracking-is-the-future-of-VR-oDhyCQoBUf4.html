explain a couple of reasons why I
tracking in VR could change the face of
VR completely ok so the eye tracking
we're looking at at the moment is modded
into an oculus rift here it's been put
together by a company called the I tribe
now the first reason this is really
exciting technology is that inside of
games it's going to give you a lot more
playing options so for example here I
can look around all these different
buildings you just by moving my eyes
without having to move my head
completely something else that's really
cool is if I focus on this Viking chap
here for a few seconds he spins around
and he gets very angry and it's a little
bit crude at the moment that you can
imagine further down the line the amount
of options and playability that's going
to get you in video games with things
like maintaining eye contact with other
characters and how immersive that could
potentially make playing games on VR
reason number 2 immersive gaming and new
techniques and stuff is all well and
good but game developers care a lot
about resolutions and power and
technical limitations and there are
advantages that come from eye tracking
there as well so what we're looking at
here is something called foliated
rendering now what this basically does
is wherever I happen to be looking in
the frame that spot is rendered with
huge clarity with very high resolution
and everything else can become a little
bit more blurry so in terms of
processing that means that you're able
to make the stuff that you're actually
focusing on in the game look really good
while everything else can take the slack
a little bit so it's early days for this
technology and for VR in general but I
really think that eye tracking could do
a lot to boost VRS usability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
