scoop and I was sitting here chatting
with John Falcone executive editor who
wrote a comprehensive overview of all
the different readers and tablets and
which one's the good bang for your buck
we have some of the best reviewed ones
here including the new Nexus 7 tablet
there's also been some talk of new
tablets coming new e-readers coming the
ipad mini amazon could have a new line
what's in store for us right the whole
thing is we don't know any specifics
whatsoever but there's a couple good
guess as we can make we think apple's
going to have an event in early
September where they are announced new
iphone it's quite possible they could
also announced a smaller iPad at that
time in addition to Apple we've got we
were also pretty sure we're going to see
events from amazon probably a new line
of Kindles and a kindle fire to and
probably also barnes and noble
announcing a new product this fall so we
have some of the best ones right now
right here but my advice was basically
wait a few more weeks because the whole
selection could get completely
overturned so wait until
september-october i think so i think you
want at least wait until mid-september
to see what apple's going to do and i
would also hold out for amazon which we
think is going to be pretty soon so in
the next line where's the technology
heading where is there room for
improvement so the eating creators are
kind of a pretty mature product line now
I don't see much change there same with
the large tablets the ipad kind of
dominates that space the real battle is
going to be for this 7-inch $200 ish
tablet so Google Nexus is the king right
now the kindle fire too and the next
Nook Tablet are going to be gunning for
the same space but how they're going to
distinguish themselves in terms of
pricing or offerings is kind of up in
the air right now so if I'm making a
decision how big of a factor does the
ebook store play in my decision making
it's a huge factor that's what we call
the ecosystem basically so when these
guys make their own hardware like Barnes
and Noble and Amazon you can only get
their books
and in the case of Amazon their TV and
music store as well on their own device
but what's interesting about the ipad is
it has all of those stores basically a
kindle nook and Apple's own I books and
iTunes Store so open android tablets
like the Nexus 7 and the iPad actually
give you a choice of all those stores
for you to choose your books on but each
of them has special things on their own
hardware that is unique to that like on
the kindle fire and kindle readers
that's the only place where you can get
access to amazon's prime service which
is seventy nine dollars a month and
gives you at least one free book a month
including the harry potter at hunger
games series mm-hmm alright thanks John
looking forward to seeing how the
competition shapes up this fall thanks
for watching with your inside scoop I'm
