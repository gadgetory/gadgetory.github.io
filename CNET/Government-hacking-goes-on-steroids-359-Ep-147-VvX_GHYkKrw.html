idiot and I don't know how simple audio
routing works welcome back to episode
147 of the 359 podcast my name is brian
and i am here once again with Ben Fox
Rubin and Alfred Inge sorry I screwed
everything up ever guys I quit this
feels very familiar we've done this
before am I here not gonna do that again
and thanks for being patient in the chat
and I formally fall on my own sword here
and I it's okay oh man it's been it's
been a day already you would think that
we did that on purpose because today
we're going to be talking about hacks
and things that go wrong that's it I was
hacked yes i am a hack so we've got two
hacks that we're talking about or one of
them with the government being able to
hack us and then also a google hack that
happened yesterday and that they
continue happening and also we're going
to end with some unfortunate pneus on
reddit so send in your questions and
comments we'll get to them at the end of
the show hopefully don't screw those up
too well you'll be just fine alright
let's do it all right we'll start the
recording of the podcast in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Rubin &amp;amp;
I'm Alfred bang all right let me try to
get through this quickly a new rule went
into effect today that makes it much
easier for federal agents to hack into
millions of Americans computers under
previous rules if the FBI wanted to
investigate a big cyberattack would have
to get warrants from local magistrates
all over the country now they can go to
just one judge and access all the
computers they need so law enforcement
officials say that this change is
important so they can respond to botnet
attacks which as we know are all growing
but privacy advocates obviously don't
like these new powers Alfred do you
think that this is something that could
be significantly abused I think it's a
bit of a gray area I think they do need
it the FBI does need a tool like this
you know because of botnet attacks where
people can master IP addresses so you
know even though the computer is
somewhere in Kansas you know the IP
address might be able to say there you
know all the way in California or
something like that so I do think that's
a little bit nessa there
although i will say there is a major
privacy concern when it comes to that
total to the fact that you know now
these agents don't have to go to a judge
where it has your local laws and local
restrictions and things like that can
and can do kind just like a sweeping it
says it's a big sweeping tool that they
can use and it raises a lot of privacy
concerns google made a good point where
it was essentially why are we making it
easier for people who got hacked all
ready to get hacked again right by
government mess up their devices yeah so
according to the rules the government is
going to try to at least make a
reasonable effort to tell you that
they're hacking into your devices if
they are investigating a botnet attack
but I am a little surprised that this
came through as easily as it did or as
quickly as it did in the post Snowden
world so maybe things are changing back
to what I think people are much more
willing to give up their you know
privacy for you know this idea of safety
maybe I don't know we'll see how it goes
and we'll see what ends up happening
with it next up over a million Google
accounts were hit by a malicious
software called cool again hooligan
which downloads onto Android devices by
posing as a legitimate app the malware
can steal personal info from google
accounts but google said yesterday found
no evidence that user data was accessed
so I've judge of a problem is this this
is kind of a problem there there's you
know so many Android devices out there
and the thing is that this only affects
you know if you're running on Android 4
or 5 mm but the thing is is that you
know because android doesn't dish out
updates to all its devices like Apple
does it's kind of an issue where if
you're not on the latest you know
Android software the new minor been
hacked you should go on a checkpoint to
see if your accounts were was breached
and if it was then you should
immediately like delete everything on
that device which witch is which sucks
but that's what you have to do
unfortunately either that or risk your
google account and lost all right last
with the last minute we have reddit CEO
said the social site is working to heal
after he got embroiled in a comment
editing scandal he edited posts on a
subreddit for Donald Trump supporters
replacing negative mentions of his name
with the names of the forums leaders now
reddit plans to cut down on abusive
behavior I mean that's III get it you
got attacked online you didn't like that
but it just doesn't seem like the right
moment it's such a dumb way to like to
frame it where it's like we're trying to
heal it's like shooting yourself in the
foot and then saying you know I'm we're
gonna try to do better next time it's
yeah that's at the time it was not
exactly right i get the toxic things
happen online but you don't seem down to
that level you know especially as the
CEO of the website yeah I I wouldn't
disagree with you that with that one if
you want to read more about these
stories check us out on cnet I'm Ben Fox
Rubin I'm Alfred Aang thanks for
listening okay and we made it yeah do
all the I heard my mic all of a sudden
my throat well my my favorite comment so
far as hacking black hack in black you
know like the ac/dc song okay all right
I am NOT cool you are not I've never
never professed to that's not even like
like that's like a pretty recent ac/dc
song compared to like if you want to
talk about Arn be okay I can dig it this
is like this is like somebody saying
like oh I love greenday and it's just
like american idiot or something I like
that song all right any what are some of
our question we had like a minute to get
through that really complicated reddit
thing one of the things I thought was
interesting was that they're planning on
really cutting down an abusive behavior
they found a bunch of accounts that they
said are the quote-unquote most toxic
but they're either going to like Warren
or outright ban I do know that they've
tried to purge the site of some of the
most negative aspects in the past so I
do wonder it is this time going to be
any different who knows now good luck
with that reddit I i think the entire
internet has a trolling problem I mean
Twitter obviously the which is a
publicly traded companies you know the
marginally more mainstream yeah I think
it'll be
these companies you know reddit and
Twitter and Facebook I have all these
mantras or like we're built on free
speech that's why people flock to these
websites where it's like we don't like
censorship or anything like that but
then now they have to deal with this
dilemma nowhere well is this protected
free speech because it's guys you know
saying all this awful stuff mm-hmm or
you know the more troublesome stuff is
more directed attacks at specific people
or specific groups it's also relates to
First Amendment rights but we have
somebody that's more problematic it
happens on a lot of websites where you
can build your own small individual
communities where you can find other
like-minded people that I in a perfect
world it would be you know for you know
positive things and stuff like that but
you know people are looking for other
people that are like them that hate the
same things that they do and then when
you have that and it just all Fester's
up together and everyone's just like is
feeding off of each other's like
negativity just I mean it happen that's
why i'm on twitter you have things you
know you have for us we have like media
Twitter sports Twitter but then there is
you know racist Twitter that like we're
not on but yes it builds on that what is
my crew of the internet yes uh one
Reddit i am disappoint as an avid lurker
i am very sad to hear about this to do
you think we're ever going to outgrow
this trolling phase i mean are we just
in the terrible twos right now as far as
Internet age goes and it's a very
interesting theory I don't know I think
we grew into it if anything I think it
sure walled for sure I think like it's
easy to hide behind anonymity and shit
we've all had terrible thoughts and now
it's easier to put them on paper quoting
digital paper per se and fields almost
no consequences for kind of thing you
know that's just that's the kind of
terrible human nature the bubbles with
all of us and some of us have better
ways to hold it in i guess i don't know
i think people have always been awful
though now it's just like you know with
all these forums it's like easier to you
know voice it out there and like you
said with this like and a minima t it's
essentially you know oh I can be a
terrible person and no one will judge me
for it I guess so but aren't people also
terrible to each other on facebook where
you actually like there's a lot of
bullying yeah but like the different
kind of terrible it is by forgot sorrow
it's always with strangers like when you
see people being awful to each other
it's not like it's not like I see my
aunts like profile picture where it's
really bad I'm like you're like I hate
years I like that it's not like it's
it's like if you see like a comment from
somebody who happen to comment on like
your relatives facebook page and he says
something like you know that you didn't
get it just all right I'm gonna rail on
this person or something like that it's
it's like you need a little bit
different yeah i would i would agree
with you but i don't want to give
Facebook a free pass oh absolutely not
yeah I got nothing to do with the media
I mean has everything and nothing to do
with the medium at the same time what
you said ultimately the end of the day
we're terrible species we should all be
sorry Michael Brown dad Michael Brown
thinks you should change your name to
Ben Fox kickass Ruben by the way if wow
that's so nice and you know I really
don't deserve that praise but I'll take
it anyway I mean I got called dude with
beard in chat so I'll take that dude
with beard is also just great I just
make a I'm gonna make myself a chyron
for the video so this is dude with your
dad could get here yeah I guess yeah and
I have Michael Brown also says what's
aggravating is that people are so quick
to point fingers at Google for menu for
manufacturers not updating the phones to
the latest version of Android obviously
this is going back to me yeah yeah I'm
the game hooligan when Google posts a
software so early and that's a good
point we're going back to the whole
queue 8th or not QA but quality
assurance thing yeah QA thank you
similar to what Samsung went through I
would point out I wasn't pointing my
finger at Google per se more so that
it's just that that's just a fact that
is all that is how and replaced yeah
clearly you know you never know like
what update you're gonna get or what
when it's gonna cut out for you you know
when you're gonna be like make sorry
everybody knows that going into the
Android ecosystem that Android is
generally a little bit more vulnerable
than iOS iOS has its own hack issues I
think earlier this year it had a
particularly bad one that they had to
push out an update really quickly
because it was a particularly nasty one
so well that impede the vulnerabilities
yes but that also you know because
Android dominates like the smartphone
market that like people are developing
you know malware for that as opposed to
I totally good point totally let's clear
something up is ghoul again of a play on
Gilligan and the skin
or hooligan I being a tuille I think
it's really into yeah I like hooligan
more but I didn't even think of hooligan
I thought it was Gilligan Yeah right yep
I mean what does it have to do with
Gilligan though like the that's a good
question like the matically if I like
let's talk about the pros of hacks right
yeah so one thing that we didn't get to
in the podcast was that apparently this
is like a like a blackmailing effort
where they hack your information to
convince you to download specific apps
so as part of an advertising fraud
campaign so they they make like hundreds
of thousands of dollars by getting
people to download these specific apps
after blackmailing them so it's so I
guess they don't want your personal
information the same way other hacks do
but it doesn't change the fact that it's
also you know not unfriendly and not fun
to deal with so yeah props to the guy
who recognized my shirt in the chat
Mitch let's go thrash some time do you
think the government should get should
step on trolling bullying and etc is
tricky for a question that's a really
good mansion again though that's like
the same I I don't think the government
should do it because again there is this
whole idea of like free speech I think
website should do it because they're
private companies that you know make
money but when you get the government
involved I don't think that I mean like
you know school officials do it but it's
more of like a direct relatable yang
yeah I think and the school's handle
cyber bullying among their students to
so that that is government related I
don't think you know the head of the FBI
should be there out there you know
looking for trolls I think so it is it
is important to at least consider where
the government might be useful in
getting involved I think general
trolling is one thing but directed
harassment at a specific person does
that potentially break any less yeah is
that is that is a complete is it hate
speech is it harassment those types of
things you would wonder if it actually
makes sense for the government to get
more involved if I'm not saying whether
they should or they shouldn't I'm just
if it doesn't do if it delves into a
crime then of course yeah the government
should get him yeah like how much of it
monitor
how much of that monitoring I don't even
should be monitoring for it I I think
like you know if somebody reports that
they've been the victim of you know
online harassment that you know a police
department should take that seriously
but as we all know Melania Trump's big
you know push as first lady is going to
be fighting a cyber bullying so let's
see how that goes see how that I mean
it's a relevant thing it should be at
the top of the list right now sadly it
should be a top list right now because
like really grow up yeah I guess so I'm
kind of glad to see that that is a go
where goes from here it you know time
will tell but I get it that really is a
but yeah these websites that manage like
all this stuff like should have better
tools to fight it you know like how the
fact that like Twitter couldn't be sold
to like Disney and Salesforce because
like cyber bullying and it's like just
like the toxic community on it was such
a major concern that they were turned
off from buying it yes that gives
Twitter a lot of reasons to try to clean
up its act yeah or yeah I as a
counterpoint I would like to say though
that I think it's an important thing to
protect the First Amendment and to
protect unpleasant speech as unpleasant
as it is sometimes well yeah that's why
I don't think the government should get
involved again that these this is
Twitter though being like a private
company that can do whatever the hell I
want right or reddit yeah read it had
you know what is it the the Donald
subreddit which was a very active
subreddit but apparently had a lot of
visceral in it misdirected also at the
CEO so obviously i don't think
personally I don't think that his
response with editing comments was a
particularly intelligent one but you
know when you are getting attacked like
that when there is that much toxicity it
gets under your skin after sometimes so
i understand it from a personal level
that maybe he felt the need to respond
somehow and with that let's close it out
for the week oh really okay alright so
let's let's end on a positive note i
guess yeah that was positive no no it
was nothing it's a really this is gonna
get all right let me let me tell maybe
an Alexa joke that i remember what do
you call a dog magician al abracadabra
doodle
alright that didn't work anyway the 359
