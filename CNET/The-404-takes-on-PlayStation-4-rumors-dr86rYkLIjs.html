next PlayStation his for ps4 whatever
the hell they're going to call it a lot
of rumors hitting the internet yesterday
uh kotaku got their hands on a leak
quote unquote I'm just sorry I've become
so numb and desensitized to all these
next-generation console rumors it's
tough to take any of them seriously but
again this one comes out says that the
next PlayStation will hit the market in
2013 I don't think that'll happen
personally supposedly it's named Orbis
codename Orbis which just doesn't mean
anything to anybody either because it's
going to be co playstation 4 whatever
but the real details are what sort of uh
I guess you know making people talk it
will supposedly only lock games into a
single PlayStation Network account there
will be no backwards compatibility so
any PlayStation 3 game that you have on
a disc doesn't sound like it'll be able
to be played on the PlayStation 4 and
the most shocking of all it will have
some sort of technology built into it
that will prevent you from playing a
used video game ok so the ramifications
of that final detail are endless not
only does it in one fell swoop just
completely eliminate things like gamefly
yeah and things like a gamestop you ever
hear that multi-billion dollar chain so
I don't know I think what I what do you
think and there what do you think that
this is really sort of I don't know
knows if it's all confirmed or true
Sony's not confirming or denying well
what do you think this sort of means for
the future of gaming I mean I think the
reason behind it goes to the
conversation we're having for is largely
because you know Sony is always like a
leader in terms of DRM yeah you know
they have the most prolific blu-ray
player would share his three implements
Navy amongst other things first when the
ps3 was hacked i think that that you
know that scared them and that's why
that they with the ps4 with these
particular rumors they want to make it
as lockdown as possible but i think the
rama
asians are you know it's it's really
really bad it's getting to the point
where it's so much more strict than what
we would consider you know with movies
or blu rays and they've always sort of
been on par you know when blockbuster
you know when going to the store and
renting a movie was probably you always
go and you know rent a game yeah and do
that now you're at the point where well
you can rent movies or you can do this
or do that but you can't do that with
games of course so I think I think
that's a concern yeah especially with
the cost of games because it you know a
movie is cheaper you know you might be
able to see in the theater first or do
some of it when you buy game and the
reason think investing is like gamefly
it's a big investment you want to be
able to play it exactly if you like it
and it's not like necessarily a movie
where you watch it once you if you
really like it you might watch it a
couple times but the game has a ton of
replay value to or sure so it's not like
by allowing people to rent games you
know people are not going to then go and
buy it it's a totally different dynamic
don't you think that by preventing and
pretty much ending all kinds of used
games and sharing and stuff like that I
mean I don't think I think they are
severely under estimating how much of an
impact this will have on people's
decision to buy games at all if I'm
buying a sixty-dollar game a part of me
is saying hey worst case scenario
finally like this thing i'm just going
to trade it back in and get half my
money back at the very least or sell it
on ebay maybe get back ninety percent of
my money that mentality is such a
contributing factor to somebody buying a
video game from the Gecko that i feel
like that you know decision workflow has
not been considered by the people
potentially making these decisions to
the point where tons of it yeah it's it
the best advertising for the game is
renting it I mean that's you get to
basically try it you you'd play it for a
couple days then you get to figure out
if you want to buy it right same thing
you're saying in terms of resale value
or selling there's a lot of little
markets or lots of little things that
people do before they buy game that
you're completely eliminating and
price-wise I mean you know with with iOS
or Android you know you can buy games
for significantly cheaper granted it's
not like on a console right but that I
think that
moves you know people's mentality on
what the dollar value of game should be
for sure seeing it a little bit with
like Vita too obvious so lockdown well
in terms of price and the price those
games versus I'll go to the App Store
buy this for this price so it's
interesting I bring that up with the
lockdown think as the Vita is super
lockdown transferring a movie file from
the computer to it is brain surgery I
mean it's easy enough but it's just
tedious and the workflow takes a lot of
time arm but also think about it like
growing up right when you were playing
Nintendo or say or say whatever it was
and you're like okay dude i'll come over
and i'll bring them a copy of sonico
plate like that is a huge part of your
you're growing up and your childhood
with gaming like this sort of sees that
coming to an end yeah you know like
that's a big deal like I'm sure you were
you did stuff like that growing up like
hey man bring over your copy of jet
motor will race to be sick but you know
you gotta be able to do that I know you
know you know you want to bring your
game over to some know it there's only
work in the player that yet does it
because that's technically a used game
is to basically matches I guess with one
particular console little like solidify
I don't know I don't know your console
oh there's also over or maybe they'll
have some sort of thing where you can
sign in on someone else's console and
then you know pop that out yeah maybe
that'll work i just appear i mean do you
really think they'll just eliminate that
you know pure sort of experience of
sharing against i mean i think that the
bigger question and we're talking about
this a little bit before is why why are
they doing this is it is it do they feel
like it's going to generate more revenue
in terms of that or is it strictly you
know a means to further lock it down
because i don't want it to be hacked I
think it's the latter because as we've
discussed you don't generate more
revenue this way it what yeah and that's
that's the perplexing thing about it's
like why are why are they doing it can't
be there they've clearly cannot think
they cannot rationally think that this
will equal more money they can't think
that way I just I can't see that
happening well yeah and I thinking
because even with used games and stuff
right the way it's set up now if i buy a
used game from gamestop and I go home
and I want
play online and it's a used game that's
like an EA game that requires a pass to
play online I gotta pay another ten
bucks that's money money being generated
right there dlc stuff like that i don't
think that you know piracy is definitely
a problem but i think it's much more so
in terms of music and movies and games
it's out there but you the level of
sophistication you need in order to be
able to do that is much greater so I
can't imagine that that's particularly
hurting Sony in the video game
developers enough to you know limit
ordinary consumers into kind of doing
some of the behaviors we discuss yeah
it's really scary i feel like the second
and it's not just games its books it's
movies it's it's music I don't know what
it was like the second when that you
were able to buy something that wasn't
tangible that wasn't in your hand right
the second like this CD is gone and it's
just zeros and ones on a drive somewhere
we lost of right we lost like a
possession alike it's all rented now and
it's all sort of virtual at me
personally I think the future of games
right now is like subscription-based
stuff I think like what call of duty
does how they have like the elite
membership where it's like 50 bucks a
year and you're a call of duty player
for 50 bucks a year you're gonna get all
this continued follow up digital content
you're going to get all that but it's
for a price of a year and that sort of
just eliminates use games because no one
like wants to give away game once they
remember right you know I feel like
that's where we're going whether or not
that's the right way you know I mean
what do you think about that I don't
think that's completely unreasonable
actually the worst thing especially if
you're you're you're signing up with the
expectation that you're going to get new
content it's going to be in hand it's
going to be in maps for sure I think
that I think that subscription sort of
thing that's probably the lesser of two
evils yeah I mean there's development
time that has to go into making those
model for sure so I don't have a problem
with that especially if you could sign
in on your home console or and then go
to a friend's house and be able to do it
there yeah i mean that's reasonable it's
interesting tell us what you think 866
