to Google issues for everything Google
you can think of Google i/o is going to
be here before you know it on May the
8th but a new report from Bloomberg is
revealing some of the goodies we can
expect from Android P with internal
codename pistachio ice cream mmm that's
my favorite Bloomberg says Android P
will bring support for more unique
display types to accommodate things like
iPhone 10s notches as some Android
phones are expected to move in that
direction we've seen it with the
essential phones knotch
and Android P will also offer support
for unique form factors like ZTE s Aksum
M other visual changes include what they
call a dramatic redesign to Google's
mobile OS with the hopes of using the
aesthetic to persuade more iPhone users
to switch to Android P devices now
there's been rumblings of material
design too and it could be the new
Android P look but a leak from a now
pooled chromium commit showed some of
the subtle changes in coloring that you
may or may not be able to tell from
these images the shades of grey look a
little cooler and not as warm and the
Reds are slightly darker and intense
it's expected to be more than just a
color palette swap now Bloomberg also
says that Google will be pushing for
even tighter google assistant
integration in android pete the report
says they'll be opening it up even more
for third-party developers to integrate
the assistant into their own apps
alright the latest numbers from IDC
research found that Google doubled their
shipments of pixel smart phones in 2017
into a total of 3.9 million that's
double and that's a good thing now put
that in perspective and in just the
fourth quarter of 2017
IDC estimates Apple shipped seventy
seven point three million phones and
Samsung shipped seventy four point 1
million phone so you know Google is
making a great phone but they have a
long long way to catch up and it's not
really even just catching up just make
steady growth year by year and they have
the capital to support it alright we're
just about a week away from unveiling
the new Samsung Galaxy s 9 but new
details and rumors they keep rolling in
ET news reports the new S 9 will finally
be bringing stereo speakers with a
bottom firing speaker at the top and the
bottom of the new flagship phone thank
you
this one probably won't come as a
surprise but surprise Samsung is
bringing their own type of an emojis
Allah Apple now the name has not been
leaked yet but Samsung's 3d emojis will
make their debut with an actual name
during the reveal and they are
reportedly even more advanced compared
to apples now let's just place bets
right now I'm going with Sam oh jeez
because it sounds like something
horrible they would do and I'm sorry but
when we're trying to one-up each other
with our an emoji game that tells me
phones are running out of things to do
come on some all right you know I will
admit though the only time I've ever
used them is with my nephews and when
they send them they're like so cute it
just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy
inside all right
Samsung's official announcement will
happen on February the 25th and we'll be
there with CNET's live coverage
throughout the keynote if some news that
might let you down
after LG decided they would stop
releasing new phones yearly they will
now focus on new variants of the LG the
30 at Mobile World Congress this year
LG officially announced that the 2018
version of the LG b 30 will feature the
debut of their new artificial
intelligence tech now some of the key
improvements thanks to this new AI
system will be vision AI for their next
gen image recognition that will analyze
a picture as it's being taken and offer
you the best settings their voice a I
will bring exclusive LG voice commands
including new ones for taking specific
types of photos like a food photo or
slow motion video now LG's AI features
will expand to not only their new phones
they released in 2018 but also to some
pre-existing ones as well and the story
that turned some heads this week
Consumer Reports said that in their
audio testing the home pod sounds good
but other smart speakers sound better
now this is what they said the home pods
base was a bit booming overemphasized
and the mid-range tones were somewhat
hazy meaning that some of the nuance and
vocals guitars and horns was lost these
elements of the music couldn't be heard
as distinctly as in more highly rated
speakers treble sounds like cymbals were
under emphasize but the home pod played
reasonably loudly in a midsize room the
bottom line
overall the sound of the home pod was a
bit muddy compared with what the Sonos
won and google home max delivered you
know what honestly I 100% agree
with their assessment it's what I heard
when I compared them straight up with
the home acts as well you know great
boom but the vocals weren't very clear
on the home pod compared to the Google
home max now speaker sound quality will
also really sound different to you
depending on the genres of music that
you personally like to listen to so
listen for yourself because I'm not in
Consumer Reports isn't the expert for
your ears all right that's gonna do it
for this week you can email me at Google
issues at cnet.com or tweet me at brian
tom thanks so much for watching we'll
catch y'all next time for some more of
that Google issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
