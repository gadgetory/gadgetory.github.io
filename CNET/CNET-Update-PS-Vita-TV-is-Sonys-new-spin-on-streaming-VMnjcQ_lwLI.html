hang tight for a few weeks
Microsoft is announcing new versions of
the surface tablet on the morning of

the age of the Internet connected
kitchen and laundry room but many
smaller appliances are also going
high-tech like thermostats that learn
your habits and door locks you can

things may sound cool but we're here to
make sense of it all and make sure you
