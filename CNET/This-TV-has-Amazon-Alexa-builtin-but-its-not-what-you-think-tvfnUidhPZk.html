Alexa voice control built-in but there's
one big catch
Alexa launch Netflix you have to talk
into the remote while holding down a
button launch Netflix
even if you have an Amazon echo or dot
in the same room
I just finished reviewing Amazon's first
Alexa powered TV and there's a lot of
things about it that I liked it as a
sleek easy to use interface that the
same as Amazon's other fire TV devices
like the $40 fire TV stick there are
thousands of apps and games to choose
from and the interface puts streaming
front and center putting app tiles for
Netflix and all your favorites right on
the home page next to the inputs one
downside of the interface however
especially compared to competing Roku
TVs is the prominent advertising for
Amazon's own TV shows and movies
although other apps like Netflix get
rows of tiles to Amazon itself always
seems to take precedence on this TV go
figure
boys control on this TV worked very well
allowing me to search for content switch
inputs and channels and even do Smart
Home stuff like control lights just like
an Amazon echo or dot turn on the light
as I used it however I kept wishing I
didn't have to pick up the remote to
issue commands sure this TV has Alexa
but without the always-on always
listening feature found on the echo it
just didn't feel the same people using
over-the-air antenna to watch TV however
might really appreciate this set your
local broadcasts appear with full
information and thumbnails right on the
home page there's a 14-day grid style
program guide you can search for shows
and change channels with voice commands
and you can even pause live TV the
element has 4k resolution but at my test
image quality was just okay and worse
than similarly priced local dimming and
HD are capable TVs from Vizio and TCL
black levels were light leading to lower
contrast and video processing and screen
uniformity fell short of competitors all
told I still prefer Roku TVs to this
Amazon powered model but if you really
like Alexa and don't mind talking into
your remote it's worth a closer look
