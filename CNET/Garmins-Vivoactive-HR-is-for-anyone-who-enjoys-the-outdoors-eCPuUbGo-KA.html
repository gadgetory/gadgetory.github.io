garments other products it's not just
for athletes but rather anyone who loves
the outdoors and being active that's
because it's not designed for a specific
sport the $250 watch seems to have it
all it can track all the activities like
steps floors climbed and sleep
there's also smartphone notifications
when connected to an iPhone or Android
device plus it has an optical heart rate
sensor on the back and GPS for measuring
just about every activity you could
imagine it can track more than 14 sports
that includes running cycling golfing
swimming skiing growing and even
paddleboarding and it does all of this
without having to be charged every night
you can expect up to eight days of
battery life or up to 13 hours with an
active GPS signal so overall it's pretty
clear that I'm a fan of the watch but
there are some things that need to be
pointed out like the design it's big and
bulky and won't appeal to everyone
although the watch is waterproof up to
50 meters which I do like the heart rate
sensor is also good but it's not perfect
and can fluctuate when doing fast
interval workouts I also experienced
occasional hiccups with syncing and
Bluetooth connection to my Android phone
the connection problems weren't as
frequent as with the original vivoactive
but it's still an area where Garmin
needs to improve so who would I
recommend this watch for pretty much any
active consumer the waterproof design
long battery life and multiple sport
profiles also make it a better value
than the Fitbit surge and while it is
fully capable of tracking running
cycling and swimming I wouldn't
recommend it for dedicated runners and
triathletes because it is missing some
more advanced features but for the
casual Walker Runner hiker golfer
swimmer biker or just about anyone else
the vivoactive HR is a solid Buy for
