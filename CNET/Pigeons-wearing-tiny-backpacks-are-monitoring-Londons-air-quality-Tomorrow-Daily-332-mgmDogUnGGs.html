welcome to tomorrow daily the best speak
talk show in the known universe I'm
ashley Esqueda jeff cannata is up at GDC
checking out all the newest latest best
things happening in video gaming so for
now let's hit some rapid-fire headlines
scientists over at the Mayo Clinic are
testing an idea that could someday
change the way spinal tumors are treated
the concept reminds us a little bit of
those capsules that expand into spongy
dinosaurs and stuff when you drop them
into water they consist of hydrogel bone
grafts made of a special polymer that
expands into a custom shape once it's
put in place the graphs are
biodegradable and meant to close gaps
caused by spinal tumor removal in cancer
patients the researchers feel confident
that they have the best composition of
material for the graphs and will likely
begin cadaver trial soon if the cadaver
trials go well and the graphs proved to
be able to hold the weight of a human
body researchers think that they can
move on to human clinical trials within
the next few years our next story is
about air quality if you live in London
and you're wondering what the air
quality is for the next few days you
might be able to find out from a few
pigeons this is the pigeon air patrol a
10 bird strong crew of domesticated
racing pigeons their current mission is
to fly around the neighborhoods in
London equipped with tiny adorable
backpacks that monitor the quality of
air Londoners are breathing they'll be
spending the next few days flapping
around town and the idea is to make air
pollution problems more apparent to
Londoners who might not be aware of how
it impacts the city you can actually
follow the pigeons air quality checks on
Twitter over at Pigeon air the next plan
study involves giving devices that
measure air quality to do 100 people to
carry around London but honestly i think
i like the pigeon idea a little bit
better so we're going to talk about the
pigeon idea on tomorrow's deep dive when
Jeff returns triumphantly from GDC so if
you want to get in on that conversation
please feel free to jump in on twitter
and use the hashtag hey TV talk about
the show and all of the topics we're
discussing and if we like your tweet we
will include it in our long-form episode
tomorrow all that being said let's check
out our phone tog refer the day our

said caught this hilarious picture of my
English Bulldog yawning I took it with
my brand new Galaxy s7 edge and would
love if y'all put it on the show so that
