imaging with CNN up here at CES with the
camera that Pentax just announced it's
the MX one and it's Texas first digital
entry into the amateur enthusiast
compact market which you think Pentax
would have been in it a long time ago
given that they're all about the
advanced enthusiast market segment and
they came
honestly in terms of specs the camera
seems kind of me too it's very similar
in design to the Fujifilm X 20 and you
know that that type of retro feeling
camera this one happens to be all black
but they have another model that is
black with brass and that's that's
actually a little more interesting
looking and they designed it with the
brass so that it would age and get a
patina and sort of you know show the
wear and tear as a mark of the fact that
you're a photographer which is a very
pent axion thing to do and I think it's
actually kind of clever of them that
said the sensor unfortunately they went
with a backside illuminated sensor which
to me isn't really a great you know
enthusiast sensor it does well in low
light and tends to not be so great in
good light but the camera itself is
nicely designed it feels solid has a
interesting looking pop-up flash but it
doesn't tilt back the way I've been
emphasizing that I like it also has a
tilt display tilts up 90 degrees and
down 45 which I do like it's great for
off angle shots
the AUSA the other thing about it is
that the buttons seem kind of small
given that the camera itself isn't that
small still it's about the same size as
models like the Panasonic LX 7 and the
Fujifilm X 20 and so on and given that
it's pen taxes first camera in that
segment I'm looking forward to trying it
it's about five hundred dollars and
should be shipping in a month or so I'm
Laura grinning and this is the syntax
