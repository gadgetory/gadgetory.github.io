Blizzcon every year is the swag bag and
this year's show I'm sure will be no
different which is why we have a first
look at what's inside the Blizzcon 2015
swag bag so why am I still talking let's
open the box previously you had to
attend a Blizzcon in person in Anaheim
to get a swag bag this year Blizzard is
doing things a little bit different and
allowing virtual ticket holders to add
on the swag bag to their ticket so
anybody can get a swag bag now and
that's pretty exciting
so the swag bag this year is it's an
actual bag its a messenger bag of let's
con messenger bag with all the icons
from blizzards franchises you got
Warcraft Diablo Starcraft hearthstone
heroes of the storm and overwatch let's
check out what's inside the messenger
bag though because I'm sure that'll be
pretty fun sales alright so we got a
blind box heroes of the storm vinyl
figure you can get different variations
so there's actually a ghost Nova she's
clear it's kind of fun so here's the
storm blind box what else we got in here
we have oh I see a side blade you can go
ahead and blow these up and I'm sure
these are gonna be boom sticks for the
actual Starcraft 2 finals which will be
happening at Blizzcon so everyone will
be using those to make a lot of noise we
have a hearthstone luggage tag and we
also have a delightful Diablo keychain
which is adorable if not something I
will probably lose and then what else we
have ah got an overwatch emblem here
looks like you'll be able to stick that
on something potentially and then we
also have oh my gosh it is mer kiloton
is one of the pets you're gonna be able
to get in World of Warcraft Legion but
now you may have him in pin form if you
get this swag bag so that's it that's
what's inside this year's Blizzcon 2015
swag bag definitely the coolest thing in
here the messenger bag I mean this is
awesome
I love the luggage tag but really not a
traveler like stay home like to play
like play heroes of the storm so and I'm
sure you do too if you're watching this
video but yeah that's what
inside the swag bag this year you can
check out all of our coverage of
Blizzcon and other games on CNET comm
and of course on our sister site
GameSpot comm but until next time I'm
Ashley together and I will see you in
the Nexus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
