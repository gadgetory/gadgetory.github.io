Android phone is always exciting but
what do you do with your old Android
phone well if you didn't have to trade
it in with your carrier you may want to
try reselling it Donal Bell and today
I'm going to show you the steps involved
in getting your old Android phone ready
for resale before we put your old phone
up on eBay or Craigslist we're going to
move all of your important and personal
data off of this thing and then reformat
it like it just came out of the box and
it needs the Samsung Galaxy s3 is my
example let's start with what you don't
need to worry about you don't have to
worry about your apps google has a
record of all the Android apps you've
purchased so long as you're going to
another Android device you can download
them all to your new phone at no charge
you also really shouldn't have to worry
about your email aren't a lot of
situations where an email would land on
your phone and not also be backed up to
your email host especially common ones
like Gmail or Yahoo now if you're not
certain about it it's an easy problem to
test just find an important email on
your phone and then use your computer to
look up that same email you can go back
and forth until you feel satisfied and
then you can move on really the most
important thing you should backup before
we hand over your phone is your contacts
fortunately Android makes these really
easy to backup my best advice is to
backup everything to Google contacts
especially if you're sticking with
Android Google contacts will follow you
everywhere now to sync everything up
open up contacts on your phone tap the
Menu key and hit merge with Google tap
ok and all of your contacts will be
sucked into your Google account to check
to make sure they all made the trip all
right find the computer and log into
contacts Google comm with your Google
account
everything should be there and if you
see some doubles check out my how-to on
how to get rid of duplicates once your
contacts are merged they're just waiting
for your new phone to pull them back
down but to be extra cautious you can
use that same contacts menu to export
the list of your SD card or a SIM card
another piece of precious data you may
want to backup are your photos and
videos there's a couple ways to do this
but the fastest and most effective is to
connect your phone to your computer
using the USB
cable that came with your phone on a PC
it should pop right up as a USB Drive
Mac users may need to install a small
google app called android file transfer
to get the same result all of your
phone's photos and videos should be
located in that folder called DCIM now
you can just copy that folder over to
your computer or if you have the room
why not just copy the entire contents of
your phone over to a backup folder just
in case now what about all the stuff
you're probably not thinking of your
text messages call logs alarms
dictionaries music playlists browser
bookmarks to transfer these and there's
one last sweep of your data
I recommend installing a backup app for
$5 an app like my backup pro will gather
up all this stuff back it up to the
cloud or to your memory card and allow
you to sync it back over to your new
phone it's money well spent so now that
you've backed everything up the next
step is to leave all of your personal
stuff from this phone but before you do
that you'll want to remove the memory
card and the SIM card so that they don't
get erased and so that you don't
accidentally send them to the next
person now first let's get the memory
card out which is probably either on the
side of the phone or in the battery
compartment on the s3 you'll find the
microSD memory card and the SIM card
back here under the cover some phones
might not have a memory card slot or
they won't have memory cards installed
but if you do find a memory card make
sure the phone is powered down and then
take the memory card out if you have
Wi-Fi access you can take out the SIM
card too otherwise you'll need it for
one last step and then you can remove it
at the very end so here's the moment
where you get to feel like a secret
agent or maybe get to experience panic
attack but we're going to erase the
phone full factory reset so we're going
to boot it back up go into settings and
then back up and reset some Android
devices we'll have this under security
or storage so look around if you don't
see it right away at the top here you'll
see some options for backing up some
Android data and settings to your Google
account make sure they're checked on and
that you have a backup account selected
it may trigger a brief backup but
chances are if these settings are
already on that Android has been backing
up these settings in the background all
along after that the final stop is this
button down here for factory data reset
the
we'll reset the phone back to its
original state and delete all the data
on the device tap it and you'll see a
warning of some kind but just remember
it's not deleting your accounts it's
just deleting any trace of you from the
phone you really don't want the next
person you give this phone to to have
access to your personal accounts and
information when you feel confident hit
reset device the phone will now reformat
itself and restart when it turns on
again you should see that same welcome
to Android screen that was there the
first time you got the phone all right
it's finally time to say goodbye so go
ahead and shut it down one last time
remove the SIM card if you haven't
already clean the phone with a nice dry
cloth gather up any cables or chargers
that came with the phone and if you
still have the original box that can
help the resale value if you're selling
this thing online so there you go that's
my best advice for preparing your old
Android phone before switching over to a
new one
