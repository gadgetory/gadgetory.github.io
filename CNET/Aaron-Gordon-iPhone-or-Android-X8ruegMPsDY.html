Orlando Magic and in my opinion a co
slam dunk champion how about I let you
like I mean I feel like you guys both
really earned that yeah it's okay no
more victories from yellow video send
the trophy this way none of this moral
victories maybe I could redeem myself
okay so are you saying you might throw
your hat back in for next year may maybe
well yeah okay right on we just saw you
kind of here in a motion capture session
for GK 17 just from your experience what
was that like is the first time you've
done anything like this yeah I mean it's
not the first time I've been on like the
motion sensors but for a video game yeah
for sure
yeah I've been playing 2k since I was a
little kid so I had the chance to come
out here and put motion sensors on to be
more authentic towards the game I jumped
for joy it's fun super fun we come from
a tech background CNET and everything
and we always like to ask athletes you
know what is your favorite phone are you
an Android guy are you an iPhone guy on
my phone iPhone guy what do you like
about it the most the accessibility you
know it's very user friendly it's easy
you know you see like toddlers being
able to play on iPads and iPhones now so
it's just easy for me it's simple
obviously seen a lot of phones get
bigger screens mhm like you're you're a
big dude you know yeah I've a brick
would you help yes it's like the biggest
iPhone possible yeah you lacerate exact
but it but it feels good for you right
you like the big screen view it's great
you know there's a beautiful screen and
then are there any other apps whether
they're fun games or something like you
know like you know mental main are there
any other ones that like you really like
to get into your psyche I used to play
clash of clans I use like but then it
was just taking over my entire life so I
had to delete it there like um we need
you to get into workout sessions I hold
on one second dragons are coming okay
here's another thing social media we
know is a big deal it obviously just
exploded when you and Zach were going
out at the dunk fest what are your
thoughts on social media like how
involved are you personally in it
um a little bit you know I try not to
spend too much time on social media
because I like to live my life oh hey I
see people all the time like just in the
middle of a conversation face down and
Twitter Instagram but you know check it
maybe once or twice a day all right and
then just finally if I know I'm kind of
putting on the spot here if you could
think of maybe one thing your phone
could do for you that it doesn't do
today my iPhone yeah yeah Wireless
charge if there was a wireless charge
for an iPhone sign me up
I think you'll see that in a year so all
right I'm all right everyone Sarah
