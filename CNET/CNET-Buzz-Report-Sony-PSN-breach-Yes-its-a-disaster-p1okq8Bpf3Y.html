buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
Sony and Apple come clean but we all
still feel really dirty YouTube runs
right into the movie rights wall and we
are not talking to the aliens anymore
let's get right to the news shall we
early this week after a six-day outage
of the PlayStation Network sony revealed
that the outage was actually a massive
hacker attack and the culprit had stolen
tons of personal data on the roughly 77
million people who use the sony service
so that was a bad day the company said
the hacker stole names complete
addresses email addresses birth dates
your playstation network password and
login and online ID and the hacker might
have gotten your entire profile
information including your purchase
history your password security answers
and even your credit card information
security analysts say this breach is one
of the top five in history identity
theft is a serious concern and you
should pretty much not trust any email
that you receive from anyone for I don't
know like the rest of your life
especially after the whole epsilon thing
a couple of weeks ago oh and no as usual
there's really nothing you can do here
except sue as part of a massive class
action lawsuit and then six years from
now you'll get a check for about three
dollars sometimes the cloud kind of
sucks in other news this week the Apple
location-tracking scandal continue to
grow until finally Apple actually
responded the company insisted in a
press release that Apple is not tracking
your iPhone your iPhone is only
collecting the locations of nearby Wi-Fi
hotspots and cell towers the fact that
the unencrypted cache of location
information is more than a year's worth
of data is actually just a bug and so is
the part where the phone collects
location information even if location
services are on just once the company
promised to release iOS tweaks soon to
fix those two bugs and also to encrypt
any location data in a future major iOS
update so see no big deal at all just
bugs all better
I feel better don't you no no me neither
YouTube is set to launch a new on-demand
movie rental service and has Warner
Brothers Universal and Sony on board but
Fox and paramount won't sign on which is
apparently holding up the launch those
two holdouts say they don't want their
movies on YouTube because they're still
pirated material on YouTube and you can
still find pirate sites on Google yeah I
really think that continuing to prevent
people from having legal alternative
sounds like the smart way to handle that
friendster announced it will delete all
its users profile data on May 31st so
you should go download whatever you have
in there before then now most people
initially assume that Friendster is
actually killing the site off for good
but instead it's pulling on myspace it's
going to relaunch and go more
entertainment focused and use Facebook
Connect so yeah killing off the site for
good and finally the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence is over at
least for now the SETI Institute is
powering down its array of 42 alien
hunting satellites because they just
don't have the money to keep them up and
running SETI researchers say it's the
worst possible time now that we've
discovered more than a thousand new
planets some of them potentially
habitable or if you ask Stephen Hawking
he'll tell you it's the best possible
time because have you seen battle Los
Angeles we do not want them to know that
we are here Shh and that's the buzz
report for this week everyone I'm Molly
wood and thank you for watching
you know I think that we should pour out
a little bit for our fallen homies
friendster and steady guys we hardly
knew you now a little for me oh that is
actually quite delicious Onew</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
