we're going to take a look at the Boston
Acoustics TV model 25 this is a pretty
basic sound bar with a street price of
three hundred and fifty dollars and as
you can see it's not exactly the most
stylish device on the market the sound
bar has a matte gray finish and there's
a small wireless subwoofer included and
there's not much else to it aside from a
few front panel buttons on the right
it's not a thick device overall but
compared to some of the thinner sound
bars coming out these days it does look
a little chunky now the Boston actually
doesn't come with a remote instead it
relies on you to program the sound bar
to respond to commands from your TV's
remote which doesn't exactly work
flawlessly in every setup the manual
also tells you to disable the TV's
internal speaker and the TV I used for
testing would show a message that said
not available every time I adjusted the
volume it's an annoying court that
happens with a lot of sound bars that
lack a dedicated remote so you may want
to check if your TV displays a similar
message before buying the Boston around
back you'll see there's an analogue
audio input and optical digital audio
input and mini-jack input that's not
much connectivity overall but the model
25 is counting on you to connect all
your devices right to your TV and then
connect the output of your TV right to
the sound bar that means you'll be using
your TV to switch between devices and as
long as your TV has an audio output it
should work pretty well sound quality is
actually pretty good for a sound bar
this size especially since the sub is so
small the subwoofer blends nicely with
the sound bar and while larger systems
will deliver a bigger impact on say
action movies the model 25 generally
handles movies pretty well like most
sound bars music doesn't sound great so
if you plan on listening to a lot of
music you're better off with a more
traditional stereo or home theater
system aside from its design flaws the
main issue with the model 25 is the
price three hundred and fifty dollars is
a lot to ask for a sound bar these days
and there's really nothing about the TV
to warrant the extra cost if you can get
it at a discount the bus and acoustics
TV model 25 sounds good for its size but
otherwise you'll get a better value from
some of our other top sound bar picks
