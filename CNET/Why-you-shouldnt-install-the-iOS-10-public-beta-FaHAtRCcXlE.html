wait here are a few reasons why you
should not install it yet first up it's
not that big a change
this isn't like when iOS 7 completely
changed up the face of iOS the
lockscreen looks a little different but
that's not much your battery life might
also suffer with the public beta you're
a tester for Apple you're not the
customer in this case Apple wants to get
all the new features working but
something's off you report it to Apple
when you sign up as a beta tester for
Apple you also agree that Apple can
contact you for feedback when iOS 10 is
fully baked all things should be good
but you're screaming at the screen what
about all the cool new series stuff it
will integrate with all kinds of apps
there's no need to scream nor a need to
upgrade to the iOS 10 public beta for
that feature there should not be any new
apps that can hook into Siri until the
fall with the official release of iOS 10
beta and of course is always the chance
a new version of iOS could break your
device some official iOS releases iOS
9.3 I'm looking at you have caused iPads
that just stopped working if you
absolutely must have the latest iOS I
suggest installing it on a secondary
device if you use your iOS device for
anything critical you probably don't
want it to get all buggy experimental
way safely use an old iPhone you have
laying around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
