well it's Friday it's July fifteenth
you've made a lot of good decisions in
your life Jeff shut up and just shut up
no it's an abra here Allah there's an
abra in our studio right now an abra and
abra cadabra no just an abra don't get
crazy here it's not a tears it's like a
Deborah is it on right here on the desk
what the what is it it's very rare how
many thank you pokemon it's got four
well arms two legs it's very rare and
the CP is pretty high so I think we
should probably take a break from the
show for a minute and watch me catch
this Abra I hate you the world has been
taken over Jeff we live in a different
world than we did last week it is a
world of Pokemon why are you doing this
to me it is a world of Pokemon uh the
game had actually been out when I think
we recorded last week but the servers
were completely bored yeah we we talked
about it you said you're like ah this
sucks it doesn't work right exactly a
week has changed not only me but the
entire world for the better hard to say
see certainly people are step spending
more time outside for no reason it's the
summer I think I think polka mangos
working cuz it's the summertime yeah but
even in your people have to like get to
work and like be outside I agree with
you that like launching the summer was a
smart idea but you know I don't know
well I can see this hanging around let's
talk about this why it why sure it isn't
the perfect storm um do you know how
Pokemon how this came about how light
the background works all that stuff so I
know me antic the developer did a Google
fit like an Android AR game yep called
ingress ingress called ingress that's
what it was it was like that actors last
name I don't know who you're talking
who's the guy from Pacific Rim uh I
don't know the guy from Sons of Anarchy
guy no that's that's Charlie Hunnam I'm
talking about Mark Ingram nope i'm
talking about this is fascinating radio
right here well
well where the hell is you okay god
dammit what's up guys name no one cares
anyway it's the game is called ingress
you can research that if you want while
I talk about it and basically launched
several years ago it allowed people to
walk around it tracked your GPS location
it like earned you points as you were
walking around and in certain areas what
was it Idris Elba yeah really close you
know that is that yes I know who did you
suppose he's the man he is awesome yeah
um so in this gaming rescue would walk
around and for popular spots where a lot
of people were walking they'd have these
like hubs and you'd pick a team and
you'd fight over those spots all right
you'd sort if i don't really i haven't
played a lot of ingress i downloaded it
just like try it out in the sea people
say it's better technically than pokey
probably is but it's also very
intimidating and speaking of someone
that plays video games for a living I
like was really overwhelmed and had no
idea what was going on ingress right so
you had basically this baseline were
millions of people I think they had like
two million active users or something
okay um four years we're adding all this
data to this system and then they flip a
switch and suddenly it's a Pokemon mommy
an ingress to exist but now they have
this pokemon game using all that data
that all those people quite like the
same engine it's the same back end so so
where there's a jit effectively where
there's a gym in ingress there's a gym
in Pokemon they're not kind of gems
inning respite yeah so explain to people
what a gym is I mean me explain look at
people I want to say people quotes in
the air sure me so there's two things
with two spots in Pokemon there are poke
a spots and there are gyms poke eight
spots are like minor things that you
might see on the street might seem like
a cool mural that someone took a photo
of and marked it in ingress and was like
hey this is a cool spot and it becomes a
poke a spot and at those points you can
collect pokeballs and collect healing
items there like around the neighborhood
what's a pokeball you capture Pokemon
and you waste them you but so when you
see a pokey poke man yeah you gotta
throw pokeballs at it yeah and you only
have a certain amount of pokeball yes
you can run out but if you stop at all
the pro-gay stops it's fine
everyone everyone you got I sound cool
right you sound very cool what's
interesting I think Jeff is that the
difference between our ages is not very
great you're 22 years is it yeah you're
32 I thought you were like 44 love what
I'm 48 48 I know no to you yes two years
but that those to you I was in the sweet
spot for pokemon I was because it came
out well that's what I'm saying I was 12
years I was a guillotine but you were
starting to get the high school and
Affleck you're in high school and you're
playing pokemon you're kind of a loser
but rewind two years in middle school
you know you're the you're the coolest
coolest definitely no I mean you were so
the nerd table but there was like a lot
more nerds with you playing pokemon wait
do you go you end you go to like sleep
away camp yes were you are you the
indoor kid no I went out I did hiking
and stuff you were everyone I realize I
realized my mom seems to think of them
the most indoor kid ever what I got
really do outdoor stuff uh yeah we're
sort of jumping around on topics here
we'll get back yeah bad we'll get back
to that in a second well it was funny
because I was asking about I was talking
to someone had seen it yesterday on the
way to this Sony event workout last
night and we're talking about Superboy
camp and how like I'm sure Pokemon goes
like the game of the summer camp world
maybe I don't know how much ingress up
people played at like camp sites right
but but but that conversation evolved to
us talking about how this guy was like
the indoor kid oh yeah but you can play
basketball and pink but he's like no I
kind of just like got lost in the forest
a hat I'm like why didn't really let us
go off and like you're I mean we'd have
free period but like for the most part
like you have a very set schedules best
part about a summer camp and if you
didn't go there you're probably not in
northeastern Jew well the best part is
uh Stacey never went yeah she's filled
with this endless regret really yeah did
she have a choice chance to go I think
the parents just did more yeah uh which
was a thing I would totally send my kids
summer camp my god it's like a win for
both of us oh I can't wait I can't wait
till he's like I don't know once the
earliest you could send them I was seven
years old and I wouldn't wear two months
sleep way
now that as a super my brother was going
there so he was 10 so if that helped a
little bit yeah but still like seven
super early my first year I was like 11
yeah uh they actually held me back in my
bunk another year cuz I was so young
they're like this keep this kids he
can't even brush all my friends that I
made moved on all that's and I I was
very upset yeah uh so yeah she's filled
with all this regret sure because she
never went and I always all I wrote an
adult summer camp did you hit today they
do yeah for people who can't afford to
like not go to psych swingers yeah we're
cash yes it's called like Garden of Eden
yeah something like that anyway back to
the poking back to Pokemon I you know
that I would say if you don't know how
it works it's very very competent but
it's surprisingly complicated but the
basics are pokemon are running around
the more popular in area is like if you
go into times square there's pokemon
everywhere like you are surrounded by
posso what generates them like how does
a show sure so it's generated by by how
popular in areas based on gps signals so
if there's a lot of GPS signals in that
area that means that pokemon are going
to show up and mass if you're in the
middle of nowhere they'll still show up
but it less frequently okay and the
official Russ fresh dick review I mean
as a game I don't think it's the best
game ever says it's kind of it's
kind of not a great game but as a social
event it is unlike anything I've ever
seen happen like do you think it's more
the gimmick of a our net worth a
nostalgia circle so I think part of it
started as the gimmick of AR it helped
for like a social growth thing because
people okay there's someone took a
Pokemon picture of Pikachu in front of
whatever the herald square or something
but what it had since become is it's
less about the AR and more about the
fact that you have to be outside in
populated areas so you'll be in a park
and you'll see a crowd of people and
some little shout like jiggly puff and
everyone loses their goddamn minds like
is that rare yeah so like yes so yeah
for some people i'm sure it's not but
you know if you shout it out
Pokemon people will lose their minds and
like just look at their phones and check
around and suddenly it's a social event
in Japan I get it this has been going on
for many many years not for Pokemon
specifically but like everyone has this
culture of like playing multiplayer
games with other people in hot spots and
stuff like that so it's always happening
always happening it never really
happened here I think cuz there just
weren't games that really took off that
required multiplayer like we're also a
way bigger country real estate yeah but
even in times square u it's there or
what at New York City you right where it
would happen closer to you but here
because everyone has a phone everyone
has this popular game it's obvious when
people are playing it because they like
are like standing in the middle of
random spaces with her phone out so it
just jets generated this crazy zeitgeist
moment we're like I like I walk down the
street and I see oh that person is
playing at that one yeah the dude in the
Delhi yesterday was like what team are
you on oh and you pic with you yeah you
have to pick one of three teams so I'm
on Team mystic and you that's how you
battle over gym so a gym gets assigned
to one team and you could take it from
that team what is this doing to us you
think I think it's I think it's cool and
it's good insofar as its introducing
gaming to more people and in a positive
light and so far as like people are
interacting with each other in ways that
like the typical image of gaming is like
I'm sitting at a computer alone playing
my game or on my couch it's redefining
redefining what you could do now the
problem is all these game companies
right now are probably like how do we
have more Pokemon government but they
can't because the ingress existed for
years and years that was their beta test
and no one has Pokemon right so the only
game that I think could come close to
this insanity is animal crossing and
that's also Nintendo right but i think
there's there are other universes out
there like there's Disney characters
there's I don't can I I think you can do
like moulton Disney or marvel like
imagine you did like a superhero spot or
thing like but spotting is not the same
as capturing and owning so you call it's
the same thing you carbon and also they
don't have the back end so it could do
five years before we seem right this is
all built on the ingress back unless
Google swings at it as like hey you can
use our entire in
mation database or you know who telling
it wasn't Yelp doing it yelp was doing a
our stuff with the location alia where
retail stores okay restaurants yeah you
would like use the Germans on your
camera to look around be like oh there's
a there's Dunkin Donuts six blocks that
way yeah yeah I don't know even with
Star Wars and Marvel I don't know that
it would be like this because there's
this Universal weird appeal to pokemon
that just I I I just an end the idea
that you feel like you're catching
things is like it's not like hey I guess
my record I get it I make fun of it a
great very bizarre nothing but media
hits are ya Monday and Tuesday like I
was all over the place I act like I
don't know what it is but I am familiar
with what's going on but I think like ah
yeah I I realized like I have no excuse
like I can't say I'm generationally
detached from the from the you know sure
the whole sort of excitement about it
cuz I'm not cuz i know people older than
me who are over the moon about as stacy
buyin know we are we were a pokemon go
free home yes um Dylan knows when he
walks in the door yeah enough already
deleted from your point it it's gotten
all the average that you caught her
toast we did a great game on be sketch
yesterday was is this a pokemon or
prescription drug oh I would have
crushed that game you would not I would
have cried would harsh that game I'm
sorry I can't even say it like Busey on
it was like whew xeon what's that's
that's a prescription drug it was but
like it's great i know i do i would say
i know i'd certainly all of the 151
pokemon original you sure do you think
you could name them no way i could I
could kick name how I can name a lot of
them when I would be in boring meetings
many years ago as a thing to like fill
my time during a boring meeting I would
literally try to write down as many as I
could and I got to like 133 one time oh
my god cuz it's like ingrained in you
like I don't need to see I can see the
image of whatever it is on the screen I
don't need to see a name and I know
instantly what the name of that Pokemon
is now further up to 100 570 or whatever
they up to
now I can't name all of the new ones you
realize like you're opening a door here
look you're letting a skeleton out knows
I'm not you I did I like Pokemon you do
you more than like it I really like
Pokemon you aren't denying it you're at
a point where it's not it's not it's not
a problem mmm but it's the thing with
you it it's a thing yeah I'd agree with
that I'm surprised no one said anything
about Pokemon at your wedding good segue
look at that although i'm sure some
pokemon go was happening at you i know
for a hundred percent sure cuz my good
buddy chris plante took a photo of our
ceremony while he was catching a pokemon
during the ceremony okay that's not that
that's not there was a rattata sitting
on some Rattata you and your Rattata
Hale and Klaus yeah okay sure cool rat a
little ratty there yeah that makes sense
uh it was your wedding was lovely thank
you so much it was uh it was a
picturesque yes we lucked out on the
weather day man that is a stressful once
it started thinking it just ran and went
very quickly but for a year you know
I've talked about it like for a year
I've just been like a stress monster
about it and I hate having people over
my apartment because I get very stressed
about I like having people there yeah
but the lead up to it is ado I have an
adult ships and this is that times
whatever and you know it wasn't even
like over it wasn't like an over-the-top
thing was over really hearts and stuff
like that yeah I think so I said this to
you yesterday and I'll say it again
because I want other people to hear cuz
I thought it was met see you if you want
to get a good visual for what russ was
like the day of his wedding yeah for the
17 seconds I talked to him during his uh
his beautiful wet uh the scene in the
scenes in Roger Rabbit where they give
him alcohol yeah and he just like start
steaming like a a whistle and his bowtie
spinning and he's lifted off the ground
and he's going crazy non-stop doubt that
you're saying it looked like
cocaine yeah it looked like you did
cocaine laced with like adderall sure
and speed yeah it's an adrenaline rush
man I'm telling you you were he was man
it looked like you were sort of like
vibrating etta at an octave that the
human brain couldn't comprehend it
natively I just have this mentality of
like trying to be a host and being very
aware of like hey you know have I like
seeing everybody and talk to everybody
and like everyone's having a good time
etc so to have that many people relying
on you even though they're probably not
but in my brain that's the way I think
all i can do is like it's just like it's
like a eradicate running and I it was K
wheel it was great though I'm super
happy for you you everyone looked great
it was a lovely affair yeah super classy
yeah it's nice real real nice setup
thank you yeah everything looked good
yeah very earthy you know we were in
hurry in the park uh we had the ceremony
outside which was cool it was a place in
the bronx where like I didn't even
realize existed yeah it's the new york
botanical gardens in the bronx um and
it's like an immaculate sort of park
gorgeous its enormous like you it what I
think it's it's considerably larger than
Central Park it's very very large and
it's just sprawling and if you ever get
the chance very easy to get to from
pretty much anywhere in the city you can
take a train right yeah really recommend
it a really cool way to spend a day and
they do a really cool train show and a
model train show oh that's right I
remember your sampler in the winter
there was a babbling brook behind your
way well that was the Bronx River right
behind us bronx river yeah and not a lot
of bodies in it no surprisingly only six
usually these two rivers for the bodies
right and hudson and that's yep yeah
well very good stuff we got to take a
break that's right sponsor this week
exciting and the rest of the month so
stick around after a word from our
sponsor we'll be right back

this is episode 16 69 if you're keeping
score at home I am that's 1669 it's
crazy it's a lot of episodes done a lot
yeah we've done a lot um it's it's a
weird sort of thing when you've like I
don't know I it's I don't know does it
make you feel how does that make you
feel are you proud are you surprised are
you definitely surprised yes without it
you can't like fathom that you've done
this that many times well don't forget
we were doing it daily for like six
shores so sure five years yeah so that
was significant yeah it like that was a
big part of our of our everyday yeah uh
yeah I don't know I think now it's like
much more of a um just like a
complementary sort of thing okay I don't
know I don't know what we're going to
turn this into yeah I mean you've
experienced them more than most you've
been yeah I don't know it's weird uh you
know it's kind of like at the point now
where we still have still have more
viewers than I thought we would by now
listeners rather and you know I'm always
sort of like surprised that that and
obviously very grateful and the fact
that we're still able to do it and you
know you just heard an advertisement
like yeah people still want to put hands
on the show because I'm pretty cool and
yeah you know it's just read I don't
know how long it'll go for I don't know
uh you know what the future holds but
it's I think it's a very therapeutic
welcoming something I still look forward
to doing once a week especially with you
sharks which is the same way it is it is
a nice i think it's very relaxing and
enjoyable and i like that people still
listen and enjoy us yeah those good
stuff is pretty rad alright moving along
would you get on amazon prime day would
you do so now i feel like we talked
about this last year has it been a year
since I've been on the show it were
around the the anniversary god I'm she
was we gotta look at that now we'll take
a look yeah because I do remember
talking about I think it was amazon
prime day last year and it was a total
disaster cost yeah i might have been
guesting or something but the yeah it
was a total bust terrible things were on
sale that no one wanted and everyone
sort of made fun amazon for a while
right because it was also like and they
kind of still did this this year but
they did these freaking flash sales yeah
where you were saving 48 cents on
something yeah and there's there is this
scam thing that I know happens on steam
as well where companies will increase
their base price before before a flash
sale happens then looks like yeah oh
you're getting fifty percent off this
thing but normally it's much cheaper
this can of tennis balls shall never
been $33 yeah so I think that happens to
a certain extent but obviously there are
deals to be had um I you know this was a
couple days after I got married and I
there wasn't you know I went on there i
was thinking like well what am I gonna
find that I'm like desperately gonna
want and the first thing I saw was a
crap ton of detergent I was like huh
that's might be a good idea to have like
a bunch of detergent so that was my like
personally my clothes first adult
thought that I didn't actually act on I
didn't buy a bunch of detergent but it
was pretty cheap what I did end up
getting initially and I don't even know
if they were flashed shells but it was
stuff that I've been meaning to get was
a bunch of lightning cables for my
iphone and a bagel slicer oh those are
the two things i bought people by the
most mundane boring stuff on at prime
day is what I've like my in unscientific
for a survey I found that to be the case
yeah well i bought a bomb
brother kindle as a best man gift and i
bought the so by like seven o'clock at
night i was thinking like should i buy
an amazon echo oh wow and i went through
a very weird process in my brain so how
much does it usually cost so it's
usually 175 I believe okay and it was
down to like 120 or what's pretty good
so it was a pretty yeah 179 and it was I
think down to 125 it's pretty good 120
and so pretty significant decrease and I
um there was a moment I'm like very
weird about that sort of stun who are
very weird because I don't buy a lot of
things for myself mostly because the
Vice that i have is video games and I
get a lot of them from work so I don't
really have a lot of vices that I spend
money on I don't care about clothes I
don't do a lot of drinking so like I'm
just like very weirdly careful about how
I spend my money which I guess space it
follows a certain clichés but in this
case I was like you know I like did a
little bit of research I'm like when I
listen to Spotify at home it's a little
bit of a bit of a production because I
have to turn on the ps4 and I have to
turn on the right input on my TV and
just the idea of being like hey Alexa
play Billy Joel and having that music
play seems wicked and that's only like
you know dan ackerman yesterday was
talking about like he has his home
hooked up to smart home stuff so he can
be like turn on light too and it does
that and that's I mean pretty cool like
it never occurred to me that those were
things I wanted to do but um yeah so I
ended up that was that that was my kind
of silly gift from amazon prime day that
didn't really have any real necessity in
my life but I think I'm gonna like it
there's a few iterations of it which is
kind of interesting kind of confusing
yeah I do have I'm starting to get a
maybe a tiny tiny bit of regret that you
can get it they didn't get it oh why
don't I think you had one August an was
saying he had one yeah I know I guess I
wouldn't get that when I would probably
get the dot
yes so the dot is just the hockey puck
right at the hockey book and that plugs
into an AV receiver right but I don't
see it here I'm gonna leave me see ziana
no Danny I it that's the book on how to
use it what happens if you search for
the dot as I just did I was on that
we're so maybe they're sold out or
something I called the dot be sure on
something else I don't know but yeah the
dot effectively is just the brains of
the Amazon echo that you can plug in I
think it has a tiny speaker in it but it
does all the voice controls and
everything like the echo does but it
doesn't have like the giant speaker on
it so you would then plug it into an
input device the reason I didn't go that
route is weird i don't know why it's not
sure that's not so much on me land sold
out or something cuz the echo showing up
I mean that's not gonna be in stock for
another two weekend yeah I'm not getting
mine until the 27 to give you an idea um
the yeah the echo is pretty cool I the
reason I didn't go that route is because
I didn't want to have to like it my
whole purpose was like ease of use and
constant availability and plugging it
into an AV receiver kind of kills that
because it's like you have to be on the
right employee and then you right it's
not this always it is always on but the
audio you're not going to hear coming
out of it as though it is right and
always being yeah but it so I mean I
don't know I I will too i will report
back not gonna get it from other two
weeks what else you gonna use it for
though i'm gonna use it to check whether
check out whether in the morning Alex
every single day is like what's the
weather gonna be and I have to pull them
I a pit oh my god like an and-one like
where's alexic getting uh there's
information from what do you mean
they're hooked into like a weather
service so what if it's not like the
most accurate weather what if it's like
we just gobs well I and whether it's
gonna rain that's essentially all we
need dude it's all about weather
underground I use on my phone I use it
an app called stormy skies or something
dark sky it's called what is we
excellent yeah weather app I like it a
lot all right let my phone darks um and
it's much more detailed than the crappy
built-in iphone out all right but I mean
I'm gonna use it for that apparently you
can have it like read news stories to
you can have it load up podcasts that's
pretty cool I feel like I would also use
it to
the Spotify thing is the most appealing
thing we can tell to play anything on
Spotify yes that's anything else by or
Amazon Prime music if you use that or
Pandora does pandora as well the it also
will do the stuff where it's like
instant buy stuff on amazon which is
helpful I think for stuff like oh we're
at a detergent or I'm very focused on
detergent dish soap and you can be like
an alexa order us more dish soap and it
knows what dish soap you order and will
instantly order that for you I think
down the line the smart home stuff is
really gonna take off and already is
like dan told you about the lights you
don't like that I don't know if I'm
maybe took totally ready for it but but
you've started yet like you know using
voice controls is just like kind of that
that's what it is like your kind of
there and you can't use that what is it
a nest or something for your nose that
dumb camera thing oh all right yeah we
do hate it though how you hate it's the
worst what's what is this is drop it was
originally a drop camping now nest up on
it yeah okay I just put that out there I
love I've talked about that enough have
oh no not really I hate drop can ok I
hate that nest camera it's a sucks it's
not good can't see anything no or any of
the I think though the quality sucks
okay um it's maybe seven feet away from
my router and the quality is is it
better when you get closer to router
know and can it be wired it up maybe
yeah who the hell's gonna do that I mean
quality is like how detailed do you
need it to be I need to be able to see
my kid while he's sleeping you can't
tell i'm i just asked where it's just
like oh i guess that pixel is his hand
you know yeah and for me it's less the
quality and more the rate of dropout
like yeah i'll be watching it so you
know we'll have him sleeping in the room
here his room and you know we close the
door and look air-conditioning's on a
lot of things are on in the house now so
you can't hear him crying okay I'm sure
so I so we have usually method right we
have we have usually like a tab open
yeah with what the volume jacked up so
we can hear him cry for prize or it's on
our phone or an iPad
and it's constantly dropping in and out
yeah it's like what's going on why isn't
this working it's not your neck
connection no did I have great internet
in the house yeah that's really bizarre
so I mean I don't know maybe it's just
me it's not a is it a service that you
pay for every month no okay you can do
that you can pay the premium and what do
you get you get a suite of monitoring
you know there's floor it's like Oh
record any time there's movement yeah
that's more of like the security camera
sure thing i also have a canary okay uh
cuz canary sponsor the show yeah once
and they sent me one okay and I use that
a lot what is that that is um it's a
whole monitoring thing it looks like an
echo it's like a tennis share a ball can
yeah oh it sits in the corner and I use
that just like peek in on the apartment
every now and then so why would you have
both well I'm not gonna have that to
look at Dillon why cuz it's not it's
also for like the temperature in the
room air quality I can it can it can do
a siren to like ward off you know okay
undesirables or just scare Stacey when
she's home oh I would never do that so
mean apparently it's like is it really
last ultrasonic portal thing yeah that's
like supposed to scare someone crap i
think it actually forces the victim to
poop themselves oh cool like a brown
note yet the brand-new very great yep
you clearly have a smart phone a smart
home thing going on then you have like
way more devices than I do maybe I do
maybe I should have got one oh you're
disappointed I screwed up I mean
whatever you treat yourself as love
addicts but it's not that bad I want to
get I think I want the puck though yeah
I don't know how I would make it work
with the mic is you're worried the sound
quality will be not good yeah cuz you're
an audiophile well yeah yeah and i think
the the sound quality on the echo I
heard I heard good acceptable acceptable
which is really all i need i'm not picky
I need good i need like oh this sounds
good I do i do want to mention one other
thing that I realized over the last few
weeks is well over the last couple
really this week if you are a person
that just got married people will bend
over backwards to help you out uh what
do you mean so we stayed at a hotel the
night we got married a
this is okay I'm sorry I understand
where you go yes good and we um you know
checked in and they were lovely it was
the I'll give them a plug because i
thought the hotel was really hope this i
would Casey nice that over here Gramercy
Park Hotel Gramercy Park Hotel which is
very nice I paid for in my own room they
haven't give me any money but you know
they hooked us up with an upgrade to the
room I mean we were staying on a Sunday
night so like I'm sure the demand was
not super high but they gave us like a
230 p.m. check out the next day which is
very late for a hotel check out that is
very late and it is very generous and it
was just great I mean the second we said
like oh yeah we're getting you know
we're gonna be there we're getting
married people on the phone would be
like oh oh oh we will do anything like
they literally just went head over heels
nuts yeah for it to help us out I'm glad
they could yeah it helps when your
friend Jeff makes a call yeah clearly
pulling some strings also is funny cuz
alex lost her hanger for her wedding
dress know is I think she left at the
venue is a special hunger well I mean I
guess you need like special hooks Stacey
on a hanger that said mrs. bakal yeah
yeah I know it wasn't one of those okay
it was just a generic hanger that sounds
pretty lame right yes super lame okay um
but the so she just wore her wedding
dress home the next day we takin over
home and she just like prada issues like
I'll just wear it so there's a photo my
Instagram of her catching a Pokemon in
her wedding dress cuz ruber wasn't in
the year ver be up get into the yuba car
is really pretty funny and I I
appreciate that she was cool with just
wearing it yeah she's pretty
down-to-earth lady acts chick um I could
just see getting into the uber and uh uh
he actually I'm 30 you guys had a night
huh he didn't say anything they were my
dog seen it all on the street and stuff
they were good congrats and all that
stuff that's pretty cool yeah so you
were in like plain clothes and she was
in I was in shorts a t-shirt that's like
some night you guys sides dead kid just
like the end of mrs. Robbins a recent
graduate the graduate right where he
breaks in and steals the wedding at that
bride yeah we also the end of wayne's
world 2 no um d Frank on Twitter ok
rights in from what is this a day ago ok
at Jeff Bakalar catching up on 404
episodes excuse the time machine comment
but you are right and your colleagues
are wrong about Casey and I says videos
are awesome they're about the adventure
of the moment he makes the day-to-day
exciting to watch I mean I'm sure he
does a lot of people d Frank did two
tweets oh my convey that message ok d
Frank in parentheses Casey nice that
nope no mo same guy I get that there are
people that really really love him and
insofar as there are also people that
really love pewdiepie and love all the
other people on youtube not for me and
that also does not discount the fact
that most of it is probably sponsored so
that's okay I say about that we will I
know I'm sorry we don't disagree on that
I i do believe a lot of his stuff is
sponsored as well yes I just think he is
uh although he is not entertaining he is
not if it is sponsored I don't think
he's indicating it in the description
well anywhere in the video so he might
get into some hot water well with the
FTC if sponsored perhaps i would also
say i would also get to this product
placement spa need to be disclosed yes
it does yes you cares that disclosed in
like TV shows uh I'm not making excuses
i'm just showing where it's a good
question jeffrey i don't actually know
the answer to that because i was in
movies to like you'll see people
drinking coke in you're like oh there's
the coke probably paid for that but
there's no indication unless it because
i did a product placement considered the
same thing as a regular commercial I
don't know it may be may be that it
might be the credits like furnished by
but that to me is such a lame sort of
footnote that nobody will pay if you are
listening to this and you know the
answer this how product placement is
treated by the FTC and whether it's
allowed without indication let us know
Kylie really curious and an email post
on the 44 reddit I'm really really
curious
good question could work if ya pulled
that one out detective Jeff yep on the
FTC be ok let's move things along um we
have one more disco know we have two
things to talk about first things first
uh the nes is coming back yeah this is
pretty cool so Nintendo is releasing a
palm-sized nintendo entertainment system
that's the original intent yes they're
calling it the classic edition yes and
it's coming preloaded with 30 classic
nes key good games they're not like the
not meet games like you know yeah real
solid stuff stuff that's like not even
in the virtual console as far as I'm oh
well I think most of it probably most of
it is but I think some of them a few are
you talking the original Zelda you're
saying Castlevania Mario Brothers one
two and three although in super contras
there but not regular con that is an
interesting choice although super contra
is quite good superb yeah I didn't play
super seas they do have punch out but is
not mike tyson's punch-out it's nice to
dream which is like he looks so would
it's like Mike Tyson well that was after
the rain cebull situation oh right hold
on let's pause for the Giant Bomb guys
are getting very excited you hear this
 yeah they what are they playing
over there I don't know Wow okay uh so
yeah if you want to go through it up
there's a video I put up yesterday on
cnet and also a little write up that
tells you all the games are gonna hit it
you're getting all three original Mario
Brothers it's gonna be Mario Brothers
Mary brothers this is I think going to
sell like gang it's coming out in the
holiday and it's gonna be I think a gang
busters how anything it's maybe it's a
little too pricey for a stocking stuffer
but late hours which is like that's a
good gift for like who's not friend and
you would like at this and here's the
thing is guys know it's gonna sell out
really well uh sell out really well well
sure that's English I think this will do
extraordinarily well like you said I
think a lot of people have a tough time
dealing with their fragmented Virtual
Console stuff too yeah it's a two point
where like a people can't keep track of
where all their stuff all I've donkey
kong on my wii but i have mario 3 on my
dns it's a disaster yeah this
consolidates the whole thing not to
mention the people who are too
intimidated even
gimme a mess with Virtual Console sup
we'll see a lot of value here paying two
dollars a game 4 30 classic titles you
get an adorable little uh NES thing
which i call it like has some sort of
nostalgic air blowing mechanic I don't
like I don't know that it yeah you lift
up little fella just like an ashtray or
something like that I do I wasn't sure
if it comes with a controller or not it
does it does we want to control okay and
the interface that it plugs into is the
same thing that's on the bottom of a wii
remote oh so you could plug in I don't
know if you can plug in a wii remote
although you probably can but you can
plug in like the pro controller yeah
yeah the other way that's cool you can
do that but it's probably not wireless
no don't wanna this is all wired ditch
I'm fine with that yeah I'm finally that
too I guess this is like a very portable
thing it has hdmi I think a lot of
people are gonna pick this up people
that like haven't touched gaming in ages
ryk I'll have this next to my TV just
makes so much sense and like they show
you a photo of the size of this horrible
it's literally the size of shams hand
it's hard to say it could be I have huge
hands I'm thinking it's the size of like
what what would you call that what's the
side it looks like it's probably like
six by six would be yes that's a fair
I'm sure they've released the stats on
how big it is I think it's brilliant
Nintendo who knew suddenly what a
quarter like like Moltres the legendary
fire pokemon has risen from the ashes
about that if i was a pokemon which
pokemon would i be uh as you know
tons in that's true which one would i be
fraggin zoos well my gut like brings to
mind Snorlax brain or lie yeah the lazy
Pokemon what the why am I just one
that takes naps wish that resolved
hahaha that's kind of cute no x is great
you as well loved well a family like
Wesley image for today okay whistles
whistles yeah um I am not snore like
trying to think of like a lazy dick he's
not doing anything I'm staying trying to
think of a sweaty Pokemon species it's a
species colon sleeping how's that is a
sleeping type poke abilities immunity
and one of his abilities is thick factor
that's maybe Jeff from a few
how's Monica slim oh that's the baby
version of its not like are those
considered two separate ones yeah two
separate pokémon y so munchlax evolves
into snoring like cuz you eat so much
she falls asleep yeah hard to say I
don't actually hard to say oh and his
hidden ability gluttony yeah you're a
dick what else is there uh let's see so
who would Jeff be i would say i mean i
will give me some identifying
characteristics how you know me very
well it's true so you like hockey
there's obviously not a hockey poker
there is not although they have run out
of ideas so they're really scraping the
barrel um puck dung i would how about
this much hit a mutt oh my chop spell ma
CH 0 p how about that let's see if that
looks like jeff all right there he is oh
and he evolved into a super strong
Pokemon later on I mean he's not there
yet he's so much oak yeah my joke is
much stronger and then there's Machamp
which is even stronger than that means
well why is Machop me I don't know just
like a charming demeanor uh you know he
wants to be strong but he's not quite
there yet did and they don't speak well
they say their names how does machop's a
mature I think he's much ha like that
but like Pikachu goes pika and you've
got snow relaxes snore oddish is like
oddish this is all perfect
representations hold on this is the
child if you only see if I can hear this
so this music is not from the show I
don't think but he is fighting primeape
there
and down to dig this song togepi's in
the crowd there watching him much chop
and what was great about this the
cartoon which we're watching now is that
unlike dragon ball z stuff happened
every episode with its own story it
wasn't like you were waiting nine
episodes for an energy ball to be
charged up there was constant movement
constant Pokemon here's my job this is
probably no that's in game that's ink
damn it I want real life Machop magician
in a cartoon yeah it's hard to say um
yeah I wouldn't say that the perfect
representation of Jeff but that's what
sprung to mind thanks bud what about me
who would you say oh you don't know any
Pokemon so it'd be difficult is there
like a praying mantis one there is what
I don't think it looks like me scyther
yes sir SC no it's SC why s-sorry you
know the type yeah site sir they're in
kokomo that's like a praying mantis uh
oh there you are there's a very skinny
plant is there one that looks like Jack
Skellington is there any skeleton
Pokemon now they're ghost pokemon ooh
but they don't look like me what's the
coolest looking ghost pokemon i like
gengar hangers my favorite goes gen2 are
there he is uh he's not very surprising
he just looks like yeah mostly ghost
pokemon just look like that this like
weird source or ghost pokemon dead it's
unclear uh it's unclear Jeff there is
scholars maintain so that's weird cuz
it's like so what's the deal like all
the pokemon just died and they turn into
these four ghost pokemon oh there's only
four yeah there's very few ghost pokemon
it's not like does it go spoke much for
every normal pokemon I mean there's one
for like outrageous puberty and yeah
senior citizenship there's sure there
are old and middle um yeah this does a
few ghost pokemon I like gasoline yes
ladies another type of ghost police he's
basically like Baltimore mom Mario
Brothers um haunter is another ghost
pokemon hunter involves evolves into
gengar i like how Haunter doesn't have
attached hands yeah Oh cubone is one of
my favorite Pokemon a weeping a
bellsprout was actually the pokemon i
was gonna compare myself to oh my god
you are bells from
but you bones cool cuz he wears like a
mask so oh man no the fascinating thing
about cubone is that when he was first
introduced his backstory in the game was
the skull that he wears is actually the
skull of his dead mother oh my
thats dark he the tears on the skull or
his tears that he's crying oh well why
is he wearing his mom's skull if since
changed it to be less dark and he they
don't really talk about the origin of
the skull but that's the backstory so my
whole thing went so so when pokemon came
out I like i said was 14 yeah gave it
not the time of day and then when I was
like 16 I started up I was a camp
counselor okay and all my kids had
pokemon cards no I get the cards in the
game goes I never quit and I was like oh
I should totally get into this cuz
you're cute and I'm kind of i love
japanese stuff yeah uh but then like i
found that it was like a throne basting
it is like through this yeah like if it
wasn't turn-based and it was more like
action II there are more action in
pokemon games but they're not very good
yeah that's a bummer yeah i like i like
cuz i was always into like Marvel card
collector so i thought like oh pokemon
cards baby up my alley yeah you were too
old by that stool yeah i guess so but
the games i would say are very very good
RPG like very well designed very
interesting a lot of variety I i think
the games are quite good and this weird
there's a new one coming out in the fall
it's tough for me to like really I get
it yeah I understand ok finally before
we say goodbye yeah I wanted to talk
about bloomingdale's as a store you it
might surprise you to learn that I have
not stepped foot Bloomingdale's in
probably 10 years so here's the thing
find me someone our age who had I don't
think that they exist I mean there might
be like son of like oil baron person it
is a very elite store it's and it's
weird so I so I got a gift um uh uh you
know I got a few gifts and one of the
gifts you know was something that like
we didn't necessarily register for but
it's a very generous nice gift and we
but we just don't have a place for it or
a need for it so we went and this
morning actually I went and returned it
to bloomingdales for the store credit
we're gonna put a bug I'll get
yeah so i haven't stepped foot in
bloomingdales i went it was like 1030 in
the morning on a weekday so it was empty
okay and there were countless people
working there a staggering it'd be like
walking to a best buy and there were
people every six feet in the best buy
wearing blue shirts you have you been to
a best buy that's my point no it's
theirs either empty yeah they're like
hardly any people working they are kind
you say yeah they are something they are
the saddest ours is super sad day on you
mentally said and like well it's bad I
got said going to bloomingdales though
because it's like same vibe but with way
more people doing nothing but everything
they sell is like forty thousand dollars
yeah okay so so I went in and you walk
through and there's like it's a
department store there's a reason why
that actually that term exists is
because it has departments that so I'll
get wide variety of random stuff so you
go yeah clothing kitchen we're betting
whatever and it's an old barn ways it's
like Bed Bath you gone but everything is
like way over priced and kind of crazy
what was what kind of brands are in
there it's like I mean I don't recognize
any of these gucci problems I like they
have a whole section of like polo and
it's all but like the like the polo that
has like the giant horsham feds lately
suspense when you walking down the
street like oh that guy's from Europe
because he's wearing the giant horse
shirt and his collars also flipped yeah
exactly so like stuff like that that
normal people I really don't think go
and buy and ensure that but if you have
infinite amounts of money that's where
you go right and it just made like how
long distort functionally has not been
affected in hundred it seemingly a
hundred years like it worked at the same
way a hundred years there's only one of
them in the city no I think there's a
two may be okay right how is it not been
affected how how does it still exist and
I realized is probably a big mark up on
these stores but the the Real Estate's
got to be outrageous it's so much space
and I just like don't know how like like
they're selling like the polo shirts
grow up this is this polo shirt it's
just like a normal like with a little
collar and slow short sleeves
and well actually it's not the worst
that's actually not bad oh the burberry
I want is I 150 now 75 down swim is
fifty dollars the one on the left is
fifty dollars that's on sale yeah the
bright so you're gonna spend $175 in a
polo shirt like what kind of maniac are
you um but I guess people just like like
the atmosphere Harrods is the same thing
in London it's like the atmosphere of it
but how many I mean I guess you're going
in and like spending a tonic scratch but
I I don't know I'd be curious to see how
they've done over the years and whether
they're still doing okay it's okay so
like it's a weird thing it's just such a
huge expense to keep these stores
running and staffed and all that stuff
it's just I think there's only very few
months they can be other in malls to
like the mall that I where's that not
sure not a lot of blooming are there a
lot of Bloomingdale's middle America I
think there at all there at our mall
somewhere yeah probably oh yeah I mean
they carry from the caring fred perry
which is a pretty high I like fred perry
but I'm where garbage close yeah so yeah
I know business my land what like the
days like they're like sir hope you're
wearing shorts so picture it I had a box
that was like three feet tall by two
feet wide I mean shorts and a t-shirt
and I've got a backpack on they one
hundred percent that I either I was a
drug dealer or a real girl that yeah or
I stole it I no one was super friendly
about getting me to the place I needed
to get to yeah um cuz they currently
thought I was not there to bunt which is
true I was not there by anything now I
have a bunch of credit at this store get
some fred perry stuff i'm gonna maybe
I'm gonna look and see if they have
outdoor stuff so I can buy for my
honeymoon i can buy like a like an
outdoor jacket like a wind slicker or
something for an outrageous amount of
money ok but i did take a picture they
had a 3x sighs Swan inflatable toy for
the pool but like--imagine a normal Swan
and expand that by three I know which
was that I think it was like 18 hours
hey you got some high-end stuff in there
man so somewhat there's high-end people
who need high-end inflatable swans
it's just so much money your store it's
the adobe have ever been in one it goes
back to what I was saying in the
beginning of the show which is like it's
so the antithesis of me which is like
I'm very thoughtful about when I spend
money and I have a like I've research
and think about it and like is this
something that's the best thing but also
like is it reasonably priced right and
this is like the total opposite of that
it's just like oh here's my checkbook I
don't know how much is in my checking
account balance here you go let's go
nuts and it just it's just water people
look some people live a different life
yeah and so hopefully that makes them
happy you know I bet people looking at
your wedding to go this is a
Bloomingdale's guy yeah that's a nice
wedding yeah uh we got to get out of
