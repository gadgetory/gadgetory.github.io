Missile Command I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your scene that update microsoft
published a video showing an unboxing of
the day one edition of the xbox one
which doesn't come out for another three
months the video says the new Kinect
will feature a 1080p camera a for
microphone array and I are blasting
functionality so you can use it to
control your other electronic devices
the controller doesn't need batteries if
you switch to Wired mode the headset can
work on either ear and it has a bendable
rotating boom mic check quality has
three times the sampling rate than it
did on the xbox 360 the mute and volume
buttons are connected to the controller
and Microsoft is including an HDMI cable
in the box finally but some people are
not too pleased with how the xbox one
will require an xbox live subscription
to access several of its new features
Microsoft always required Xbox Live to
play online with others and to access
apps like Netflix but the new system
also requires live for recording and
sharing gameplay footage making skype
video calls using the one guide to
recommend TV shows and for smart match
which finds online opponents with
similar skills Xbox Live costs sixty
dollars a year and as a contrast the
playstation 4 system will not require
its fifty dollar a year PlayStation Plus
subscription to record clips of gameplay
or access Netflix but it will be
required to play online with others for
those of you with Android phones the new
Google tool for tracking the location of
your lost phone is now available it's
called Android device manager and you
can find it on your Android device in
the Google settings app here it gives
you the option to wipe data from the
phone remotely in case you can't get the
phone back find your devices at android
com / device manager and here's a brand
new app to keep your eye on it's called
mix bit it's a video editing app from
the creators of YouTube the twist is
that mixbit licious stitched together
clips of very short videos but they
don't even have to be your videos you
can stitch many video clips together to
make a
video that's as long as one hour it's
free on iOS and coming to android by the
end of September that's your tech news
update but before we go be sure to try
out YouTube's new easter egg trick if
you're watching seen it update from
YouTube on the Chrome browser type in
1980 after the video begins to play and
you'll activate a missile command game
it's part of YouTube's geek week but
please do try to not let my video get
destroyed I'm Bridget Carey good luck
