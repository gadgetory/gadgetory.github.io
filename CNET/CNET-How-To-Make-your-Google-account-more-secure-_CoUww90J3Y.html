Google account but for some extra peace
of mind I set up google's 2-step
verification that means any time I try
to log into Google or gmail from new
computer phone or tablet whether it's
mine or someone else's I'll have to
enter a second unique password that
Google will text my phone makes things a
little inconvenient but a lot more
secure here's how to do it first log in
to your account at Google calm your
email address on the right corner and
then select account from this page
select security in the left menu you'll
see a setting for 2-step verification to
switch it on click the edit button and
log in again with your password on this
page you'll see a link for turning on
2-step verification click it and you'll
be walk through the process of adding
your mobile phone number you'll receive
an SMS message with a test code on your
phone you enter that code into the box
shown on your computer and click verify
from here you'll get an opportunity to
make the computer that you're currently
using a trusted computer this means that
you won't be inconvenienced with the
2-step process every time you use it
now that 2-step verification is turned
on you'll probably find that nothing
works anymore if you have Gmail or
Google Calendar running on your phone or
Google music manager on your computer
you'll need to take a minute to
reauthorize it from this same page click
the link for managing
application-specific passwords enter
your password again and then scroll down
to the bottom section for your own
reference type in the name of the thing
that you're making a password for and
then click the generate button you'll
get a random password that you'll use
instead of your standard password for
whatever app that you're trying to
authorize for example to get Gmail on
this iPod touch here I would go into my
mail settings edit my gmail account and
then type in the generated password it's
long but security doesn't come easy now
you're going to have to repeat that
process for all of your other devices
since these passwords are app and device
specific the upshot here is that if I
lost my ipod I could use the same
account page to revoke that password and
cut off its access to my account without
having to change the passwords on all of
my devices finally if you find yourself
bouncing between computers or bouncing
around the globe
google has an app called Authenticator
for both iOS and Android and it can
provide you with your 2-step
authorization code even if you're out of
cell phone range so there you go that's
how to lock down your Google account
with some serious security it's a bit of
a pain but you'll rest a little easier
