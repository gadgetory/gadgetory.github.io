welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
on this Thanksgiving week here in the US
now it's a short week but there's still
enough things to talk about now last
week we mentioned the charging issue
that has put iPad pros to sleep and
requires a hard restart well in an
update Apple has responded to those
complaints and said they are aware of
the issue and investigating it so I will
keep waiting now the Apple pencil is
still not an easy grab we're still
waiting even if you're someone who
pre-ordered it five minutes
after it went on sale me now the Apple
pencil in the surface pen have been
compared side-by-side and showcased in
many videos the big takeaways are that
the Apple pencil really excels with more
finite details and pressure sensitivity
the surface pen is no chump
it's just that apple's pen does certain
things better while the eraser on the
end is also really sick now I've been
able to use CNET's pencil to make some
really great portraits right so so
check out this poor champion iPad Nocera
Branca Desi Ghee Murdock Aris in intent
a link to brand nada be sure yeah it's
good see I told you they were awesome
and if you'd like me to make a portrait
of you or your pet just sent me a
picture by Twitter or email and I'll
post some of them on next week's show
seriously so what's the magic inside the
Apple pencil that allows me to create
amazing works of art and is also the
reason a pencil cost 99 bucks
well I fix it torn apart and remove the
outer plastic casing to reveal the inner
metal cylinder the pencil includes two
emitters that determine the nibs angle
an orientation relative to the display
it also includes a folded logic board
with more than five components but it
weighs just a gram there's an antenna
battery and lightning connector but
iFixit awarded it the lowest repair
ability score with a 1 out of 10 because
once the battery inside dies you can't
replace it now it can be fun to get a
look inside but until the iPad pro gets
truly killer apps designed specifically
for the platform and the pencil from the
ground up it still seems half-baked as a
creative tool now Apple themselves
didn't even have a Final Cut Pro or
logic to give users
a sense of how to use this product to
its fullest potential I love it as a big
media consumption device and that's what
I bought it for a bigger iPad for travel
but really it needs to be more than that
now Apple had a people say stupid things
moment this past week by Jimmy Iovine
who joined Apple with their beats
acquisition it's hard to find the right
music on CBS this morning he was talking
about the thinking behind the recent
Apple music ad and said women find it
difficult at times some women to find
music yeah so he kept going with I just
thought of a problem you know girls are
sitting around you know talking about
boys or complaining about boys you know
when they're heartbroken or whatever and
they need music for that right so it's
hard to find the right music clearly
this only applies to women right because
every guy knows exactly what to listen
to after a breakup
make the
is display
don't do it baby
okay Apple watch two rumors from China
points the next-gen watch coming
sometime in the second or third quarter
of 2016
development is reportedly underway for a
slimmer form factor with similar battery
life and possible smart band accessories
rumors say Apple is looking for a second
manufacturer alongside quanta but weaker
profits on the Apple watch has made
other partners more hesitant due to
sales numbers that Apple still won't
officially report and Square has
launched its new NFC reader for local
businesses that's now compatible with
Apple pay the reader is 49 bucks and it
also has the option to accept chip card
payments merchants can go check out
squares website to reserve theirs today
and we know by the time you end up
watching this my Golden State Warriors
will have broken the record for the most
wins in NBA history to start the season
after defeating which team is oh yeah
the Los Angeles Lakers making them 69 oh
it feels so good so to share my joy I'm
doing a giveaway for my sports game of
the year NBA 2k16 one copy for the Xbox
one
one for the ps4 and I will also make out
with your copy now all you have to do is
tell me what's my secret to staying in
shape that I told you from last week's
show and we'll announce the winners next
time you can send me your responses to
the Apple byte Etsy Netcom or tweet me
at brian tong you can also send me your
picture if you'd like a personal
portrait from btz alright that's going
to do it for this week's show thanks so

Apple
