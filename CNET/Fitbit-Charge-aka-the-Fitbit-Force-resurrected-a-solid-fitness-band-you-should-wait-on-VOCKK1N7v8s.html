Fitbit charge keep up I'm Scott Stein
and this is the Fitbit charge it's here
on my wrist
it's $130 fitness tracker now last year
we love the Fitbit force it was one of
our favorite fitness bands of the entire
year and then it disappeared it was
pulled off the market because of band
irritation on people's wrists that was
recalled and now all of a sudden it's
back and it's been reinvented as the
Fitbit charge basically it's exactly the
same in terms of a feel for the most
part but it has some improvements the
band actually has a better clasp so
clips on your wrist and holds on much
tighter than before I lost the last one
so it's nice to have uses the same
charger as the Fitbit force and if it's
got the same type of OLED display here
so it's going to show you step count
miles estimated calories and stairs
climbed it has a barometer to a few
features that we were waiting for on the
force that never arrived during its run
when it was out our call notifications
and automatic sleep tracking both of
which are available here and they work
as you'd expect if a phone call comes in
it buzzes on your wrist and if you go to
sleep yes it will know when you go to
sleep for the most part and show you how
many hours it works pretty well but what
this doesn't have this heart rate
tracking keep in mind early 2015 there
will be a Fitbit charge HR for $20 more
that will have heart rate tracking built
in you probably would want to wait for
that and $130 is a lot to pay for a
basic fitness band that's really looking
at how many steps you walk you can get
more for less via other competitors I'm
Scott Stein and as the Fitbit charge
works well just not spectacular as it
used to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
