to the cnet mailbag the show where we
tell you about the new things we're
doing take your complaints about the old
things and get crazy snail mail as a
bonus let's start with your snail mail I
got this letter from Malta and when I
shake it a little glitter comes out so I
didn't want to open it in my office but
let's open it here in the studio Charlie
won't mind right charlie I don't think
so okay maybe I'll open it in the
kitchen I'll let you know what it says
in other snail mail this letter just
kind of terrified me it turned out to be
a really confusing tech support request
but I don't really do that so but thank
you for writing Nolan sent me this
letter saying it had occurred to me that
you never answer my emails that I send
you so I have decided to send my
questions via snail mail and here is
this summary of these important
questions is Tom Merritt a Doug Adams
fan why is Brian Cooley on screen on top
of a gas pump at my local holiday and
can you do a how-to on Adblock Plus also
he sent this as a possible lame prize
for top 5 a wiring diagram for a USB
cable written on a broken half of a
floppy disk with silver sharpie okay
Nolan here we go yes I don't know and
we'll look into it and this prize might
be too lame even for Tom but I will pass
it on ok on to cnet TV updates TB says
just notice you guys now do a car tech
live podcast love it keep up the good
work yes we do it's on fridays at
two-thirty Pacific 5 30 eastern and you
can watch it in all of our other cnet
live streams at cnet com flash life we
also launched a new series called cnet
conversations which is hosted by me and
rotating news or reviews or other scenic
colleagues the first one posted last
week and it was an interview with us CTO
and east Chopra well Matthew writes to
say cnet conversations was a great show
but I the studio that it is in is very
bland and boring also please add it to
the CNN TV menu and onto itunes /
podcast at cnet com thanks Molly
anything to make you happy Matthew did
you like the interview
at all all right speaking of things you
don't like Oh braid cow says over the
last days the only adds in between the
videos are for symantec norton Dakin
Kimball slice the ads are really stupid
oh and highly annoying and just make me
want to do two things one get to another
website to never never never never ever
buy anything from symantec again what
dork create such annoying ads for online
they might be okay when viewed once but
after that they're just annoying get rid
of these okay maybe the repetition is
the problem noted but dude I think that
ad with the chicken and Dakin is like
the funniest thing ever huh I actually
do we crack myself up just thinking
about it okay sorry haha oh crap don't
put that in the show all right we
haven't done an auto incorrect segment
in a while so let's do a slew of them
shall we JP says I was sending a text
message to my friend who was sick in bed
with the flu he was really sick my
iphone kindly corrected my advice to
make sure you get plenty of liquor I now
have a drunk sick friend in bed with the
flu thanks apple and Bruce G rights I
was chatting with a friend via text I am
messaging and I meant to type oh how

too and quite proud of myself the other
day I texted my girlfriend to proclaim

looking for would be sodomy I am now the
