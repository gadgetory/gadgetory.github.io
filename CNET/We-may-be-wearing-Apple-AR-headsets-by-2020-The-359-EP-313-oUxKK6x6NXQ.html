it's time for episode three 13 of the
359 podcast where the mics going hot
mean nothing to Ben Fox River my name is
BBG and also in the house is Roger Chang
hello good morning thanks going hot
let's do it I was like the one high
energy Bobo you've had all morning a
little slightly under the weather all
right let's get to it what I'm talking
about
Apple's a big they are push obviously
they've talked about er a lot this year
but at least if you read this if you
believe this Bloomberg report 2020 could
be an even bigger year with an actual
our headset we'll talk about that will
talk about obviously Twitter doubling
our our allowance or character allowance
yay I don't know we'll talk about that
and and snap having just a miserable
quarter on so many levels so as always
if you have any questions on these
topics leave in the comments section
Brian will get the best and we'll try to
answer them in 3 minutes and 59 seconds
from 3 to welcome to the 359 I'm Roger
chan I'm Ben Fox ribbon apples push into
augmented reality is just beginning
a report from Bloomberg has the company
working on an AR headset to debut in
2020 the company dipped into AR for the
first time this year with AR kit as well
as a number of experiences that you can
try on your phone but this thing this
takes things to a new level right oh
absolutely
what what actual AR headsets are readily
available for anybody right now that's
really the question that mean is
hololens there's a other that's like a
Developer Kit yeah Lauren actually using
it and if you've ever actually tried out
hololens it's still very clunky it's
nothing great your control screen is
surprisingly small for such a big big
right but at the same time there's so
much that could change by 2020 in the
tech world so it's interesting that this
Bloomberg report comes out when it does
because there's just this could this
could never actually make it to market
there's a there's a clear potential that
that might actually happen I mean like
we did hear about Apple developing a car
at one point yeah I was going to be
years away and that never came to light
either
look I did a lot people were looking at
Google Glasses sort of that at first
kind of for a day or obviously did not
work out the tech wasn't there yet but
you can imagine by 2020
the tech could get ready it could get
good enough to the point where it fits
into headsets or glasses or something
that's actually usable right that mean
right now the headsets are mostly VR
headsets and they're all kind of being
clunky I think there's a couple windows
mixed reality headsets are out there as
well
those are also be they're not exactly
things you can wear on the street right
look all the tech companies obviously
realize that the potential for VR and
especially AR could be huge I mean like
I've been wearing glasses since I was
five years old
to actually integrate some sort of
technology into a piece of something
that I wear on my face all the time
yep could be a significant change but at
the same time is it actually gonna
happen are people really gonna want it
well I mean I think if people see the
benefits they'll definitely want it I
mean I can imagine the scenario of like
marrying that Google lens capability
with a pair of glasses like who wouldn't
want that I don't know it goes back to
like the privacy versus convenience
thing I don't know always harping about
privacy all right snapchat reported it's
sorry I'm Chad all right snapchat
reports third quarter results last night
and boy were they dismal it only grew 3%
from the second quarter but more
concerning is the fact that
MSP gold CEO admitted that their clunky
user interface which they've kind of
chatted is sort of cool it's really cool
and exclusive is actually a pretty large
liability and they're working to
redesign the whole app to make it easier
for people to use I thought the whole
point was to make it like more difficult
for olds like you and I to actually get
used to being yourself I'm cool hey ed
yeah
tubular so and and they also they
readily admitted though like we don't
really know how the user base is gonna
respond to this whole thing if we
actually redesigned the app and make it
easier for people to use I mean like all
this kind of overshadow the the other
fact that they basically confirmed that
spectacles is a flop that took a 40
million dollar charge on unsold
inventory then
even admit on the call that you know
they got really optimistic after that
first of that initial service man
ordered a whole bunch of new spectacles
it just couldn't sell any of them it's
bad it's it's luck they they also got
like a big investment from 10 cents so
it's not like they're going away anytime
soon but I think a big picture thing to
think about with this is is that it's
really hard to break into the Google and
Facebook advertising especially if
you're Facebook and you want to crush a
company like snapchat mm-hmm you've got
Instagram it's it shows like it's pretty
easy lastly we want to talk about
Twitter giving us little bit more space
to express ourselves doubling the amount
of characters we could use to 280 bed
well as our first super-sized tweet I
didn't use it yeah everybody else was
like making all these like silly
comments including you about like oh my
god I have all this additional room I
don't know what to do I don't know what
to do this everybody was filibustering
they were all just trying to prove the
point that they could do to 80
characters that's exactly what there is
a lot to be said about sticking to 140
and maintaining that level of brevity
but nobody listens to me alright for
those stories and more check us out in
CNET I'm Roger J I'm Ben Fox Rubin
thanks real sting I made my first 280
tweet last night ooh what was it I
counted to 135 Mazel Tov that's hashtag
worth it it's like I think that it could
actually significantly change the way
people use Twitter oh yeah for the worse
I mean there were a lot of people that
were actually doing you know like dot
entered entered enter you just basically
take over your entire feed and then have
a punch line at the very end sorry about
that
that's so annoying you know and the
whole point of Twitter is them supposed
to you're supposed to have brevity yes I
don't like the idea of having to add
typos or punctuation errors in into a
tweet to actually get it to go under 140
yeah yeah at the same time I like
actually liked having the 140 limit
because it forced me to be creative
about how
reword things to make it fit because I'm
yes the the misspellings and breviary
for me so I'd like to try to keep words
kind of correctly spelled and that
forces you to like think a little bit
more concisely right it's kind of nice
but that's what we do is journalists but
you know having the 280 is it's nice
because there are there are times when I
don't need 280 but it would be great to
have like 160 write a few extra words
here and there and according to Twitter
while they were beta testing this with
people that are much more important than
you or I we time when I've been using
284 for 3 years now yeah most most
people did not go straight to 280 a lot
of folks were just getting very excited
about the potential for 280 so they're
just kind of tested it out yesterday but
hopefully it doesn't result in everybody
just writing these long paragraphs
whatever that's what Twitter is just a
bunch of lies about everything
yeah it's true we're on Twitter right
now we're on the Twitter tweets on
periscope we'd love our periscope
audience obviously hi guys hey all right
questions Brian sure let's go ahead and
take a look at the chat so far first off
we set headset in the headline which
confused a lot of people throw you're
talking about headphones or earbuds is
there a more like no catchy lingo slang
term we've been calling them VR I guess
that's that's Google got that Google
Goggles no I don't think there's a
better understand I'm more kind of
surprised that the industry hasn't like
come up with a catchy slang for it or
something like that I probably should
have added like pods or buds
you know correct a ours in the deck I
know I should add an AR that might have
helped clarify
give it time I'm just I think maybe
someday sooner or later we'll get some
new what do you think it'll be called
Apple my face I'm Apple face
guess it would be apples that's the new
naming convention right they use apples
something's Apple I Apple eyeball oh
yeah what they just flip it
it'll be like Apple I but like you know
like with leather i but you're supposed
to say one because jerks no you're
supposed to say one alright so first and
foremost we got a wish happy birthday to
one of our regular viewers a little
beefy tech hey happy birthday
HPD and in the questions he actually is
asking will the headsets start with a
thousand dollar price tag - even more
probably I don't know easily more you
think yeah always sees what the market
price is like so expected we don't
really have a good price range for
headsets cuz as you pointed out there
aren't that many in the market yet its
way 20 is a little bit of ways that's
about three or low at this point like a
little bit more than two years you can
imagine
I guess thousand dollars actually is
pretty reasonable think about it not
reasonable but like it's like plausible
I just say plausible how much was Google
glass Google glass yeah so if if they do
get to somewhere around it that was
really early and that was really and
that was also clunky yeah yeah yeah I
mean they yeah but like well user
interface okay so snapchat spectacles
are another one of these glasses but
they're not actually a yard look they're
not analyst okay it's a camera it's a
camera into a person that you then add a
our filters into later all it does is
send pictures to your phone to your
snapchat account okay you can add filter
design it's not it's not a you know so
like the expectation from Apple would be
that you put on a headset and you know
you do a lot of the stuff that you can
potentially do with a depend on what the
heads that's gonna look like if it's
gonna be like sleek like Google glass or
is it gonna be like this
all-encompassing thing like hololens is
which is pretty clunky and that's
something i want to wear outside of the
office so i don't know that the price
range could be all over the place yeah
this is actually one of the few things
that Apple has been dropping breadcrumbs
about for along yeah Tim Cook keeps
talking oh he loves a
yeah but like why do you think he's
doing that are they just trying to like
show that they are in the game with this
whole thing because usually they're
super secretive this time around they're
like we love it I mean it's a big deal
part of the problem is there there is no
AR market I think that's why they're
talking it out because they need to they
need to seed interest in developers and
people to actually buy into AR because
that's not a guaranteed thing right now
I think that's why err Apple like every
other company understands they need to
build a hype because they need to get
people aboard to actually support AR or
else is just not gonna work truth
alright back into the chat for questions
stellar tech Apple headsets or mainly
are mainly mobile use or at home usage
what about actual Apple television panel
displays like Samsung wouldn't that be
more attractive commercially what would
make more sense I don't know if I
understand Apple TV displays that
wouldn't really be a are at all
unless you slap the TV that's a good
point
wait is he talking about Apple TV like
in the living room or Apple's displays
I'm talking about just the displays as
manufactured even though it's
technically Samsung yeah I mean I think
well it I guess it depends on who
manufactures don't land the lens isn't
really that big of a deal for reality
headsets a detail that we're not gonna
really get to until very yeah later
like much later I mean like it's it's a
reasonable question to ask when
something like this is closer to
actually being available I'm really
curious if it's gonna be an all-aluminum
you just start swinging but it looks
really cool cuz Johnny it does have to
look cool and at this point hololens
does not look cool right and if i
remember correctly it's like it wasn't
intel also working on a mixture yeah
yeah kallu so yeah this is there's no
guarantee again going back to my
previous point there's no guarantee that
this thing actually makes it to me right
and even the Bloomberg report kind of
hedges on timing they say that 20/20
might be an aggressive timeline it could
go it could fall back and you know they
the article makes a point that you know
the reason why it's so far off it's
because all the experiences right now
are like not great right well which is
like which is a fair point VR is still
an
right and it's interesting that our
course notes that that they're using VR
like oculus gear VR headsets and vive VR
headsets to test some of the AR apps
they're not gonna be I think they're did
they actually I think they're gonna
start developing an internal on that
they won't sell but they are they are
kind of looking into VR internally yep
not surprised interesting let's take
some more comments and questions I like
that Noelle his back does backed us up
says to me a headset is earphones with a
microphone these are goggles
maybe that will actually good job but I
mean like Google's trademark that
haven't they well you know yeah Google
Goggles is something else
what is Google God it was a I think it
was kind of the early version of Google
right yeah
listener nice oh me out here I missed
that one no this was like early early
days with that with Android they had
Google Goggles like you could
theoretically like it wasn't quite as
good as like lens but like if you
snapped a photo and I think would
recognize what Brian was yeah I'm
thinking maybe I'm in favor of this only
because when you're a our VR lenses quit
you get a an excuse for an entire league
of people to go the goggles they do
nothing and I can squeeze the Simpsons
joke in whenever I can there you go all
right well done Pele explain how the
hololens a for example makes it so you
can see things that are so close to your
eyes while you while you also can need
to see things far away in your
environment well some things be blurry
so how does that actually translate your
actual sure visual receipts a good right
yeah yes for a very short amount of time
basically with hololens it's it's a
sheet it's a display like out in front
of your eyes it's not right on top of
them and it's it's it's like glass or
it's like a like a dark glass material
or something so you could actually look
through it and it it wasn't things
weren't blurry it was more than it was
just a buggy process yeah I mean I've
tried it too and what the trick is
basically the it's where your eyes focus
upon if your eyes focus on the center
you'll be on the screen that's kind of
superimposed in front of you like I
watched a football game or a soccer game
being played and it was
pretty clear wasn't like super sharp but
if you wanted to see also the lens you
actually wanted to see the real world
you just you just have to shift your
gaze up or to the side and you can sort
of see things and your eyes readjust
it's not I didn't find that confusing or
disorienting mhm it's not like VR VR is
totally disorienting when you like go on
or take it off yeah and I've spent much
more time in VR and usually if you're
playing like a like a video game in VR
you're always you always assume your
friends are like recording you looking
at it I was I was doing that yeah we've
done it to each other yeah man you know
you like look at this idiot picking your
nose you know you know I'm super
disappointed in right now is the fact
that I spent this entire weekend
watching stranger things - twice yes
front to back all nine episodes twice
they are you don't have awed mented
reality for the upside down anywhere the
Gorgon wouldn't okay no in your house it
would just basically superimpose that
come for brothers get on the reality of
what you're looking okay that would be
that would be totally sick video game
but i might get post-traumatic stress
yeah so that is a really cool it was
Google that just let me fanboy for a
little bit what's that Google to show
off that like Demi quarter yeah I think
so full upside down thing but it didn't
have like the demo Gorgon you could put
them next to you in a video I would just
like to see it warp the colors and your
actual visual spectrum yeah there's a
ton of potential with it I'm definitely
curious to see totally useless from any
potential no but like with them with
Google lens I think that that's we've
talked about that on the podcast a lot
and that is definitely an enablement
that if that one catches on it'll give a
lot of the tech companies
good reason to invest more in a are to
say like this is something people are
legitimately using and getting value out
of speaking of value let's actually go
back into some real questions in the
chat drone wolf media do you guys think
they'll ever bring back Google
I'm kind of bummed that they abandoned
that project I had high hopes well I
mean they didn't actually abandon it
Google glass is still around in fact
it's but it's still mating no no all
right it's like they've basically
shifted gears and it's all for the work
force I mean I wrote a feature about
when I profiled this lie marathon runner
who use Google glass to run the marathon
that's right that wasn't that long ago
it wasn't that long ago and he was
actually using sorry it feels like I
know he was using one of these so called
Google glass 2.0 versions which is
basically the same thing but it's almost
custom software built to be for that
specific use case right so that
particular case the whole thing was kind
of locked down except for that
particular app like your photos and
whatever but you could it wasn't the
full Google glass experiences really
just it was specifically tuned towards
having someone having a navigator it was
obvious they were still trying to figure
out who the customer was who the market
is and presenting it to consumer has
created so many potential problems like
movie studios didn't like it because but
if like were you actually able to record
movies like - like bootleg stuff with
Google glass yes directly could we
already like that the light would flash
though so it'd be pretty obvious
recording so it was also I remember
casino started banning it yeah just a
lot of well I mean restaurants bars they
were banning it as well yeah there was a
big social stigma attached to it I think
that's why they've kind of retreated
back to the enterprise world where
weren't you know if you go to Woking you
put these glasses on I mean no one's
gonna care if they look cool or not
right because they're useful for work so
that's why I think that's why they've
kind of moved into that world and I
don't know if they're gonna go back to
the consumer role it's really tough
let's tackle one more quick one about
goggles because we're getting requests
to talk about snapchat Michael Brown
what do you think we saw around Michael
Brown what do you think will sell more
in the long run Apple watch or Apple a
are goggles I mean yeah this is a very
theoretical question like we're talking
about a product that doesn't actually
exist yet and isn't in the market but
arguably AR is supposed to be an
enormous market when it actually does
take off now that
never happened and that might not be 10
years from now but Apple watch not yeah
probably not as much as I hate to agree
with Bend III I do agree with them
because the Apple watch I think they
kind of saw Apple watch as this
potential successor to the iPhone as a
next big product turns out it's more of
an accessory it really works with your
watch more it's it's it's not its own
product right so I think they really are
they try that they're viewing a are
they're viewing these this headsets is
potential next product that maybe you
don't need your phone anymore like maybe
Isis or all your headset or at the very
least as its own platform yet something
that exists has its own ecosystem it
would have its own App Store right so it
would be interesting to see if it would
actually happen so let's double down we
got another great question from Michael
Brown snapchat rebuilding the app could
make or break snap as a company Ben Fox
Rubin you know how much I love it makes
for the better and higher stock for
share price rising what do you worry
about that as far as from a business
perspective I don't really have Alfred
here sorry I've tried to get into get
into it several times that day like
snapchat right there comments like that
do they let you oldies use the snapchat
yeah
no they don't even let you you need to
be you know there's like an age yeah
yeah you to get out
I mean look this redesign is I think
it's pretty risky I think it's
ultimately the right thing to do is make
it more accessible it's you know user
but I also don't know if that like
taints it for like the old school the
hardcore users like that's the that's
forever the dilemma for all these
companies is like how do you balance you
know catering to the original hardcore
users while at the same time attracting
more of a mainstream audience which
Twitter has the same struggle with right
I think that hasn't really fixed that
problem I think that they've obviously
come to the realization that they've
more or less maxed out on that audience
and to really push into the mainstream
they have to redesign the product and
actually make it something that is
easily accessible now does that mean
that your grandma is going to be using
it more often
the thing like baby are you gonna be
using it to Grandma's it yeah but like
look at Facebook Facebook has two
billion users the motivation to ever
create new social networks is because
your mom found you on the prior one so
you got to move why we getting new
social network and drives inside
Facebook is minting cash snapchat
currently isn't they have a total user
base of 178 million daily active users
so they they should definitely try to
figure out ways to grow and to expand I
like that because Evans argument was
like with our audience isn't the biggest
but we've got we had a very strategic
audience I guess the implication is we
get all the young ones okay the youths
they they don't have me so I had a
revelation about how to actually fix the
Internet the problem the Internet is the
anonymity aspect of that guy what I
think everyone needs to do is apply for
a license to internet I like to that you
need to you need to actually present
your identity but then but then the
problem is what do you what happens when
kids start chalking up fake internet is
the organization that would run this
particular government license giving
entity you know it could be seeing that
scene that should do it
I don't think they were the case it's
too much power
Elon Elon should be the internet bizarre
sure Wow
that's all I get yeah that's rare mood
today yes yes Watson the issue with
spectacles believers never advertise I
mean how could you even bought them they
were without social media over the house
11 door sment dacher goes on to expand
where do they even sell them yeah pop-up
kiosks yes expanded them to like Best
Buy
more recently more recently but for the
first time goes to Best Buy it was the
it was a pop-up Keanu greed advertising
there wasn't a lot of effort they did
billboards in New York City I saw the
newer city but like around the country I
doubt totally
yeah they're not trying to get people in
North Dakota to buy snapchat spectacles
and they should say lutely but did not
do you know regular media marketing
again because they're they're trying to
push for I mean the youth vote as
opposed they're trying to go after that
jivin I'll give them credit I mean that
deal the early launches spectacles and
making that pop-up thing it was it was
smart it was a cool novelty it got
people excited but like it never evolved
beyond that like they just decided well
that worked really well so let's just
have more pop-up kills not only that but
like I think that the second they had to
admit that they wrote down 40 million
dollars worth of spectacles yeah it's
like the kiss of death now nobody wants
to be like seen with those on their face
because they're no longer they're not
gonna be entering the mainstream they're
not the hot cool new thing they're like
the thing that nobody is buying I still
see the I've seen those kiosks in a
couple places and I kind of just I just
stand there and kind of watch what
happens like people go up to it they're
still curious like oh those those
whatever they're cold and there's a
Salesman they're like you have their
spectacles whatever and they run through
it and then like inevitably oh that's
cool and they walk off yeah the price is
not cheap enough to make it an impulse
buy it would have to be $50 even then
like at this point grief still pretty
price how much how much are they they're
like 100 or something right that's not
an impulse purchase from those people
all right one more before we call today
and I hate to pick favorites about
Michael Browns on fire today this one's
gonna have to be directed at Roger
sincere the only one who's actually used
snapchat
besides better camera experience on
Android how would you like to see the
app and platform change just in general
he says Android in the question but I
think let's just talk about it in
general I mean depending on what your
personal I mean I would like it to have
some sort of hub I think like a menu
page yeah when it opens up it's just
like the camera you're like what though
uh-huh you start school left or right
and it just it's not intuitive like you
got to figure out it has its own once
you figure it out it has its own
language and it's it's fine to use like
I have fun using it I don't use it that
often but I do send snaps here and there
but yeah just have like a home screen or
something that like
takes people and I kind of welcomes
people in right like I feel like that
alone would help do so much to be to
make it easier for people to use
actually like welcome one more
commentary before we go from intrepid
chronics it says I'm 27 and use snapchat
it's actually really fun app you have to
be young to enjoy something yes
I'm 31 and I hate ever yeah yeah we're
we're we're older than 27 funny that we
shouldn't actually judge anybody on
their their UI oh we're like is
admitting that like I'm old because I'm
27
I wish is still 27 may enjoy your life
this is probably your life my friend
I just turned 57 okay I want to just
note out to dad she said he was watching
the video from his car I really hope
you're not driving yeah that's a we hope
you're not a saying
our videos not worth it that's awesome
alright we are out of time that was
great show everybody Roger you wanna
