CNET today we're gonna take a look at
the gateway sx20 870 UART NP so this is
a $500 slim tower PC it's actually one
of the few budget pcs we've looked at
over the past year now despite all the
talk about tablets and touchscreens and
others sort of growing PC categories the
budget PC market is actually pretty
stagnant there's not a lot of difference
between this system today and what you
could maybe get for a couple hundred
dollars more last year overall though
this is still a solid desktop workhorse
and I'd recommend it to anybody who
wants just a straightforward desktop for
day-to-day productivity so we'll just
quickly go over what you get with this
PC here in the front there's a DVD
burner behind this front panel down here
you get a couple USB ports as well as a
media card reader around the back it's
pretty simple pretty much what we expect
in a budget system you get a couple USB
2 ports some USB 3 ports which is
actually a little bit of a surprise and
that's nice to see
there's VGA video out HDMI output some
old-school ps2 mouse and keyboard ports
and then up here there's a Wi-Fi card
which is a nice feature and you don't
always get that a budget system so it's
good to see here so this is a slim tower
PC which means it's much smaller case in
a traditional mid Tower you still have
some decent components in here though
there's a 2nd generation Intel Core i3
CPU here it's a dual-core chip it's fast
enough it runs it about 3.3 gigahertz
it'll get most productivity stuff done
without too much hassle underneath the
optical drive here there's actually four
memory slots and that's sort of nice too
you don't always get four slots in
smaller pcs sometimes you just get two
there is no extra hard drive Bay there's
one hard drive behind the optical drive
here you can't really see it and that
represents pretty much all the internal
storage you're gonna get up here there's
the Wi-Fi card like I mentioned as well
as a PCI Express 16x slot here now as I
said it's a narrow slim tower case so
you can't fit a full-size graphics card
in here but you can get half height
cards that could actually make a nice
upgrade to this PC it won't make sort of
a powerhouse gamer but you can put a
budget priced 1/2 ID card in here and
get actually some decent gaming
performance on it if you want to stick
to 19 by 10 resolutions so that's pretty
much the story of this PC it's for basic
productivity
you can actually maybe use that as a
living room system it's a little bit big
but it's small enough that it won't make
too much of a mess in your home theater
setup and the HDMI output actually makes
it easy to connect to a television
overall though I'd recommend this to
anybody who needs a straightforward
system for day-to-day computing or maybe
some light duty small office work
sorry mirch Brown this is the gateway SX
2870 you are 10 P</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
