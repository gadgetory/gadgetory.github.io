people behind or some of the people
behind food z m 00 DZ IE which is like
etsy but for like independent food

people who don't know etsy is is like
it's a marketplace online and made goods
yet but my whole thing is all right yeah
i will buy your handmade clothing i will
not buy some crap you cooked in your bed
yeah that's free they're pretty they're
pretty legit like this is this is a real
um this so this produced one of their
like favorite producers is this
chocolate shop in North Carolina called
Luca chocolate we got they make they
make a product called the bacon box yeah
and I'll read what they what they sent
me they yeah that's here this box
started from a special request from a
blogger for something with bacon and
chocolate I knew the marriage of the two
flavors sweet and salty would be
delicious i crafted two different bacon
and chocolate truffles both of what
you'll find in this box so who wants to
try some let's get this guy with a
chuckle i want the chocolate bacon
chocolate covered bacon yeah okay can i
get i can't eat the bacon Boot I will
try the Bourbon you say
opens there there's there's also a well
to tell you the three things we're gonna
try there's chocolate-covered bacon
which is super crispy bacon covered in
dark chocolate dudes very lightly start
chocolate that's good for your heart it
is and the bacon is even better I
actually know the bacon in that they
cross they cancel out yeah that over
time I think that all i want that can
you touch the bacon wilson cause that's
it oh wow why do we do that that looks
pretty good future of bacon right here
yeah that's robot I ready to try echo
I'm gonna chew extra lad oh this is
terrible oh that tastes like the
world is it really that bad oh my god
what a bad idea let's taste like the
past oh oh this is amazing I didn't go
that bad good lord no it's really bad no
it's really salty so you want to try I'm
joking this is actually really good you
don't want that no that's all right
anyway let me try one more bite zoom
Justin liked it Jeff not something yeah
I can do with that it we got to take a
picture of this it's not gonna be at the
wedding I'll tell you oh my god this is
the worst combination ever but I really
like it no no I'm just I can't imagine
no well amen not as bad as really bad is
really bad uh what's so terrible about
it Wow I want to know the mixture of
taste in your mouth well it's really
salty first of all let the bacons
already salty but they put salt on top
of that yeah sure oh yeah yeah it was
the chocolates gonna like a dark like
musky flavor you know ya know I maybe
milk chocolate would be better carry out
what do you think he's like a hazel that
would be good I like it you think it's
okay I'm into it all right what's next
you all know you want my trouble um next
this one's for Wilson hey this is this
is tofurkey wrapped in yeah John the
side of my doll for Wilson oh no um this
is how about I'll try it first just to
make sure there's no meat in it because
I feel really bad if I gave my
alright nevermind i feel bad i was half
yeah this is a bourbon and black pepper
truffle is a dark-chocolate truffle
spike actually sounds delicious bite
with a Woodford Reserve bourbon oh oh my
god black pepper I'm surgeon dr.
Wilson's about get waste so this is
gonna be like diggnation I'm gonna be
drunk yeah you I'm you rely on the air
and all only have one okay sounds good
legislating the tram style eating ah ok
what do you think Wilson oh this is
actually really good yes it again
bourbon and a new black pepper o blind
no trouble you know Justin no pepper and
chocolate is actually really good yeah
why are you making those faces then dude
yeah why are you looking right now no
that's gross this is delicious Wow Rock
you're not bad that yeah that's good
like a yeah that was good I can actually
taste the pepper what I'm sorry to what
else we have care and then our last one
is this is bacon caramel this is a
caramel topped with a crispy piece of
bacon covered in dark chocolate and a
sprinkle of sea salt so you might not
like I'm gonna try it though all right
thank you very much and pass this to
pass this around you know Justin alright
so this is a lot of chocolate for early
in the morning I woke early in the
morning for me it is right now we're
talking about the caramel dark chocolate
and bacon here we go all right so tell
in while they're chasing this tell us a
little bit more about foods he like oh
my really nothing good oh my god I was
hearing it I was scared at first so wait
you get the naked really chocolate
mm-hmm ml kara melons idea cap caramel
bacon and chocolate why did really like
a schooi at the end yeah that is really
really good check out so we like the
bacon caramels boom and we like the
bourbon and black pepper truffles right
Jeff was not so much a fan of the talk
know that made me want to kill myself oh
ok so anyway food Z is um foodies
actually based right near cnet's office
in San Francisco they ok they were
founded in Boulder they were like a
TechStars incubator company ok they just
moved to San Francisco and they they do
they apparently like do tastings there
and stuff but it's all about like legit
food producers like like chocolate
people who don't get their stuff until
it shows
otherwise just be selling in their
hometown yeah but legitimately selling
it's not like I made cookies I'm in the
south at 10 so much food is delicious
they wrapped them in look really fancy
it's really impacting it's pretty legit
packaging which looks like a Tiffany's
box it doesn't seem like Tiffany yet so
I think the consensus is our favorite
maybe our favors I I like a bourbon the
bourbon gin yeah but my personal
favorite was that caramel really I think
wasn't gonna tasted the bacon while I
wanna kill them ya wanna throw to be
funny oh yeah come on dude it's like
half a slice of bacon man yeah be fine
but are not putting that caramel in with
the bacon and chocolate takes the
saltiness away yeah exactly yeah so if
you guys want to sound like a bale of
that over here ya know so what is your
opinion of this company though um I
think Fugees I I think it's super cool i
actually had heard of other people who
wanted to do the same thing but now
because i actually have friends who you
know yet to makes all you know foods and
one I know I know somebody in my
hometown whose family in Vermont I'm not
from Vermont but that's what this person
i know has family in vermont and they
have a maple syrup bottling Factory and
they oh and it real maple sets a
solution yeah I've never do only ever
had like tantrum like that the fake 1i
yeah which i warn't sear not very good
fluences dude i think i must have like
freaked out the tsa when i was flying
back from back home i think it was it
was either portland maine or burlington
or something like that and i checked a
bag full of maple syrup and pumpkin
butter Wow pumpkins ready I want to hear
Sean Connery's a pumpkin but rather than
rather than having to you know trek out
there and really good stuff and food Z
like like Etsy you can you can put up
ratings for the product right okay cool
alright so we recommend going to foods
in check absolutely yeah call this is
any indication like there's a it's
definitely hit or miss yeah I mean
obviously bacon chocolate is the idea
it's just fun to write you know it means
it's fun to try to step out you get what
you and I'll say this so that the guys
don't sound so desperate that um Wilson
and Jeff and Justin always love it if
you send them food just make sure
yeah actually no don't you marry me I
whiny little bitch option yeah be sure
to bring a rattle for peace caramel you
want ah I think I say we share with
their know you might what you guys when
I would it was split I'm done with the
bacon here right fair enough all right
all right all right Elvis delicious I
want to get a little like hot here like
you are the yes well is happened even
raised yeah that's what's happening your
ways deals well let me just uh you know
segue here into a little rant I wanted
to do about please I so last night what
happened okay so well this wasn't last
night but this happened to me a few
weeks ago I noticed that my camera on my
iPhone stopped working this is the 3g
model and this is actually a replacement
phone for the original that I bought
already resin that a great thing is that
Apple's like it's willing to replace
yeah is usually pain-free if it's
something that is out of control or
whatever you know they'll replace it for
free but this time I went in it checked
it out and they were like hey it looks
like this has been submerged in water
and they knew that because there's a set
water inside the phone now time and got
a flashlight to the phone can I ask
something ask me did it have to be water
yes I've in the toilet it doesn't look
any water I'm just saying because is
this a sweat stuff do you take it
running with you no no I mean I I put in
my pocket when I when I ride my bike but
I'm not like you know writing miles and
miles you know I'm not sweating that
much and so they told me it was
submerged in water not even like sweat
or like a bit of rain submerged which is
definitely never happened before but I'm
pretty sure any liquid would qualify I
guess it what are you trying to say to
this heat on my iPhone just saying it
doesn't necessarily have yeah Jeff it's
probably my DNA outside of the ivets out
your protein stains out of my I'm just
saying it might not have been water man
ya laters I got a little mini Justin
swimming around and basically pregnant
in my eyes I didn't say their eyes
rested some people that some people use
tube socks I use my iPhone what's the
problem what it's like a big hamper for
it geez Geoff what do you think first of
all not that you're the first one that
said that I didn't say that I just said
not liquid you went from water to sperm
no I'm not talking about spirit it could
have been orange juice apple juice right
to spur come on man right 27 I can tell
us what you were thinking yeah right to
sperm you like I had done my iphone my
iphone Jeff I'm not that smile you said
you had a green again you said it was
hello come on not how I relax all right
fair enough oh they say it was but what
did they say was nothing friend by the
ice they said that it was it couldn't
have been rain it's not a little bit of
water it's a lot of water so it had to
have been submerged which has never
happened before and so they refuse to
give me a replacement and now i'm just
working with a dead iphone based why
didn't you tell the people the apple
store don't you recognize me I'm Justin
you of the how many times I be something
right now I deserve some respect on ah
no anyway so yeah now my iPhone's camera
doesn't work and you know it's it's a
bummer now here's a recent rumor could
you i don't know if i should touch this
kind of sticky right oh no um what it
lifts your entire a girl to take it the
apple store for you yes okay well i
tweeted this yesterday and someone
replied saying the same thing happened
to them but they all they did was throw
a fit at the store and they gave them a
new one so i was thinking about maybe
just go in there like throw in a
tangible yeah pull the race card yeah so
very tiny he just cannot change clearly
you're the most clearly you're
incredibly intimidated right I just go
in there with like a Chinese accent not
so much in the water you doing Paul what
are you even talking about right now I
do not submerge in water cuz I'm tiny a
new iphone kids don't get to you I'm not
kidding Justin you should you should go
you should you should like hang out
around nyu yeah find a cute little co-ed
to do it today not as a girl to it I
don't think that would be the first
thing that just asked her to do right
become creepy you got it would take an
iphone
his door for me well no because I was I
um I broke my shuffle once um I was
actually like 20 bucks ok well here's
here's what happened what happened was
that this was this was one of the
clip-on shuffles ok i was i was walking
with it clipped on went through a
doorway and for some reason like the
cord snagged and the thing that the back
clip ended up bending oh you know you
ever had a clip on shuffle you know that
not only will no longer clip on you but
it will no longer charge rise a case
really oh yeah they charge us through
the clip it's not into the charge is Ben
that I could so I could the future of
engineer yeah how much is I'm charging I
couldn't clip it on um I took the thing
to the apple store and and I was like
well could you could you just put a pair
of pliers to it it should be really easy
to fix um the guy kind of looked at it
it was sort of late at night this was
the 24-hour apple store oh he was just
like I'm just gonna give me 10 and
that's because you're working with a
vagina yeah I but I guess my point is
that is that I i do think because most
of the people are writing is far our guy
um girls are more sympathetic to girls
night William favor you're right you're
funny i was reading uh this these forums
online and they were saying that you
know similar things have happened to
other people and what people do is take
cotton balls and squish them down into
the sensor so it looks white right it
only turns red when the right like light
or whatever thanking the send yeah so
people will put cotton balls down into
the sensor where that one answer so that
when the changes look situation looks
white yeah or the like preserving
geniuses yeah the gotcha
yeah I don't know I might just have to
go up to the store you know and throw
things just gotta show some skin tone
yeah you got either pull the lady card
right Justine car or the vag car just go
like this it's gotta be some form of
edge though yeah shake your money yeah
just shake it shake my booty sir can you
stop doing that clearly you're a man
you're making us feel uncomfortable
you're clearly a man honestly if you
dressing up as a woman you made it
possible this is just a cadre yeah that
would be a lie there'll be a lot more
groundbreaking than just getting your
lazy ass man dresses up as drag just

would not know that it's no laughing
matter haha skerries oh no trust me a
mail physical is not much fun either all
right I don't know exactly Oh a lot of
cops cough it out alright let's move
along I want to talk about this real
quick um ESPN yesterday had a moment of
glory yes in an effort to make me want
to read ESPN that was the first time you
ever really rethinking over hot exactly
so the company someone the webmaster the
web lead web by he added the konami code
right into the site so if you click up
up down down left right left right ba
and enter for start like all the
keyboard on the keyboard and kept
hitting enter you get rainbows and
unicorns and like My Little Ponies Wow
is it still up it was a ship it's not
it's not still up it was up for about I
want to say 45 minutes so this was like
a programmer that like I went renegade
and put for it was what what was idea I
guess that's what happened what was
interesting was that he sort of um I
think he like got the word out on
Twitter right uh-huh and then it really
spread really quickly that's pretty cool
i heard you also did several times do we
gotta keep hitting Enter reg I i entered
it once and then after you keep hitting
enter it goes damn band yeah you keep
hitting enter every time you hit Enter
was like a rainbow I know like like a
pot of gold so what happened to the guy
I don't know i think this was you know
this is not a bad thing is not like the
site went but I i I'm assuming that he
didn't do it legit like yeah it wasn't
like a thing boss being like hey once
put some ponies yeah cuz that would
really help our demographic we need a
frisina calm
now I'm talking at a random for a sports
I do that for for for yeah that'd be
great i'll just be pictures of Justine
all of me skin just somepony love ya
that it was really cool and you know i
did find out on twitter from our buddy
uh major yeah whatever they can't go
anymore unfortunately but there are
screenshots and she's funny we'll post
one in the show notes uh i believe
kotaku had a had a good screen grab I
should have taken one as well but now
I'm wondering what other big sites have
this uh script embedded into it like I
would be cool if like CNN or like
whitehouse.gov like had it yeah that
would be funny somebody's to embed that
in our blog come come with unicorns
never hurt anyone no yours ever did
anything know what I mean you know yet
nothing bad to come out of a unicorn
party yeah let's imagine this really
briefly we were you're talking but you
found this out on Twitter lot of
companies don't like Twitter course big
waste of time yeah we think it's big
wizard no I don't think I love it I love
them I love and hate it he loved and
hated writing a lot of people love it it
depends on the user well now there is
this website um we'll put those into the
will put the link into the show notes
but uh it'll actually do Twitter as a
fake office excel document right a fake
office excel yeah that's pretty cool
we'll show you everyone in the chatroom
what it looks like a go he wants to
launch it real quick this is pretty cool
this is like a way to hide your
twittering from your boss already office
yeah so make it ideal like a like a
giant spreadsheet when in fact you got
all your Twitter users on one side
messages on the other it's pretty cool I
got is a really good idea on this web
designer really loves pink but anyway so
that's the story it's a it's a good idea
and it works really well right which is
kind of fun there wasn't there like a
browser you could uh like hide in a word
document so actually and there was a if
you went to cbssports.com during march
madness we had a fake a boss button
right right so like if you actually did
it it would bring up a fake excel doc
yeah that's pretty cool right and what
if you're not involved in an industry or
job where you never use Excel what's
gonna happen that
you have no reason to be open we don't
even have it show understand if you're
gonna be in front of a computer wouldn't
you have I would say pretty much anyone
who spends their workday in front of a
computer probably has excelled yeah yes
I'm just saying like yeah use excel
every day but thanks for picking apart
my joke that's why you have a twirl
account open in a tiny window in the
left corner of your right projected I
always did on the wise yeah plus apart
twittering as part of our job you do
right yeah exactly you have to twitter
how do you know even even if you're if
you're any kind of journalist you want
to be using Twitter to see what people
are saying just it's so it's so
important for first word things happen
what can we talk about this real quick
yesterday speaking of Twitter remember I
was talking about the incident that
happened with the fighter jets uh-huh
yes well yesterday turned out to be
opening day at Citi Field right
yesterday did you hear what happened yes
the Statue of Liberty we do the Statue
of Liberty's missing her wrist think I
need to get eyes checked that was this
stupid know so well for what purview I
