francisco and this is reporters
roundtable or weekly show on a single
tech top of each time today we're
talking about a really interesting
change in technology and it is the rise
of the of the small inventor it has
become easier than ever to launch a
business thanks to cloud services and
all the technology that is very low cost
and it's getting easier now to get those
businesses funded as well through
projects like Kickstarter project based
funding on kickstarter or changes that
are coming in in laws about funding
businesses and now if you have an idea
and you don't know how to make it or
build it or design the electronics for
it there are places you can go probably
just down the street from where you are
where people will help you build that
and put you in front of the machine that
makes it and that's the kind of stuff
we're talking about today it is the rise
of the inventor and we've got two great
guests we're going to do the show is in
two parts part one is may sound like Ira
Glass on this american life I'll show in
two acts act one is an interview a
pre-recorded interview with Yancey
Strickler from Kickstarter a Kickstarter
of course is the place where you go to
fund the film or the project or the
thing you want to make I have a thing
here that was this thing is the
trebuchet it's a it's a it's a pre-cut
wood thing that was a the development of
which was funded on Kickstarter and this
and the prototypes were built at
techshop and so our guests are first
Yancey Strickler the co-founder of
Kickstarter and after that interview is
done we're going to i have here in the
studio with us Jim Newton the founder of
tech shop so this device the people who
made this device which is awesome by the
way it's called the trebuchet to the
Streb you--she with an ET te at the end
to make it cute they're both here let's
get started with this pre-recorded
interview with Nancy from Kickstarter
and we'll be back with Jim from tech
shop so we're starting today with the
ante Strickler who is co-founder of
Kickstarter a very interesting project
started in 2009 to help the
crowd funding of all kinds of projects
Yancy thanks so much for making the time
to join us and thanks for having me we
have to get started with some overview
here give us kind of the overview on on
Kickstarter why you started it and how
it's doing today sure um the original
idea for kickstarter came from Perry
Chen who's one of my co-founders and
Kickstarter CEO he was living New
Orleans about 10 years ago and he wanted
to put on a concert and didn't have the
money to do it and from that experience
he had this idea of being able to set a
threshold where a certain number of
people wanted the concert to happen it
could have happened and if not it
wouldn't have happened to wait for him
to sort of test the idea without putting
himself at risk personally and so he had
that idea and then he and I met in New
York about three years later Harry was
an artist I was working as a music
journalist and together we started
working on this idea and about it a year
later we met our third founder charles
adler who is a designer and and so we
had three non-technical founders which
as we all know is not a good idea and it
took about four years from us working on
it to the site finally launching in
April 09 so it was a long road and we
made every mistake that we could but you
know the site launched April
twenty-eighth 2009 there was no launch
party or anything like that but the site
has worked fairly well since then I have
to ask you you know for a site that's
designed to help people get funding how
did you fund yourself when you were
getting started before Kickstarter
existed yeah yeah I can't tell you how
many people suggested that we try
kick-started Kickstarter um you know the
early money came from friends and family
which is actually very similar to the
experience that anyone has launched a
Kickstarter project the people who
really saw the idea and liked it we're
actually primarily artists people who
had gone through the pains of try to get
things funded and that's something that
we thought about a lot we have a funding
system now in our culture that is geared
around profitability ideas are funded
based on how much revenue they can
produce because these your investment
that are being made and so but most
ideas you know 99% of ideas will never
generate a penny because they just
simply want to exist that's the whole
point and those kinds of things just
didn't have a home you know you could
maybe apply for a grant and wait a long
time you know you could try taking out a
loan you could get money from your rich
uncle but there really weren't many
other options and so we like the idea of
building a site that was a place that
was built just around people funding
things just because they like them just
because they wanted to exist not because
of any profit motivation or anything now
just in a nutshell people who aren't
real familiar with Kickstarter yet I
think most people should be with
Kickstarter you're not making an
investment in a product you're buying a
ticket or a product itself or the
promise to get the output of the of the
project right yeah that's right so
there's no financial return of any kind
but every project has to offer rewards
and so rewards are a copy the thing
being made some sort of special edition
maybe some special creative access or
come visit the set or write a song about
you or people offer really whatever they
want but financial return is strictly
forbidden now Kickstarter got started
for an arts project music project and
looking at the numbers it looks like
most of your projects are in fact
arts-based but this is primarily a show
about technology and technology
entrepreneurship and ideas and I want to
talk about that subset how much of the
Kickstarter model or the Kickstarter
platform is it goes to technology or
product based ideas and how are those
different from the arts projects yeah
you know there's been I think right now
the number is about a hundred and
sixty-five million dollars that's been
pledged on kickstarter and of that 20
million dollars has gone to either
technology or design now design on
kickstarter includes product design
which is probably something a lot of
your lot of viewers here are familiar
with ross concludes graphic design
people make fonts and they make posters
and more traditional kinds of design but
those two categories do makeup
you know they're together they would be
the third largest thing on Kickstarter
behind film and music it's it's not
something that we had anticipated you
know the very first product design
project that really made an impact was
one called the glyph and that happened
about a year and a half ago two guys who
were here in New York named Anna Tom put
up a really great video for this iphone
4 tripod stand and everything about how
they executed the project was just
perfect that they had a very clever
video their updates were phenomenal they
talked about how they made 13 prototypes
shipping them back and forth from Sweden
before they got the right design and the
whole process was really fantastic and
two that really put Kickstarter on the
map of product designers and then about
two months after their project after the
glyph a project launched called the
tick-tock which was made by guy chicago
named scott wilson who is a very
reputable designers former creative
director at nike and this was to turn an
ipod nano into a wristwatch he was
making a wristband to do it and that
project was really just an incredible
blockbuster end up raising almost nine
hundred and fifty thousand dollars in
about six weeks and the largest project
at that point was two hundred thousand
dollars so this was international news
and for a lot of people the first
introduction to Kickstarter and you know
when these came through we had mixed
feelings about it I mean the glyph we
actually turned down a couple times and
went back and forth with them we're
really encouraging them to present this
not as a new product they're bringing to
market but more as like here's this
thing that we made that we're really
excited about it you know make it very
human don't make it salesy don't make it
an infomercial and because that sort of
presentation that tone is something
that's important to us but in the end
you know as we got to learn more and
more about how this world works I began
to see a lot of the ways that it does
make sense you know dan and tom were
guys who were working at larger design
firms you know maybe their job was to
design some screw or some specific part
of something larger but they
unable to express their own creativity
in these roles they were trained to be
designers they're trying to create but
they didn't have that out because the
you know the bar of getting that money
together to do it you know manufacturing
run or whatever is pretty high and
Kickstarter suddenly just erased that
and made it so that they could take an
idea straight to market straight to an
audience and not have to worry about
those things in between and so you know
we see design and technology as as
different kinds of creative realms where
people are expressing themselves but
there are but there is a core to these
things that's important to us you know I
we're not interested in kickstarter
being a shopping site you know there's
lots of shopping sites we want it to be
something a little different we wanted
to be here's this thing I'm excited to
make and it'd be a lot more fun to make
it with you and then it's an experience
that you share together and I think
that's what the best projects do it
sounds like an interesting curation
problem that you have because you know
you put a marketplace or commerce
platform up there on the web and people
the users will make of it what they want
certainly but you say you you reject
project so there is a gate and you are
or you and your team are the gate there
so what do you look for are you are what
will make a product a project get banned
or say no or actually go back and say do
it again yeah you know there's there's a
there's interesting layers of
misconception about the kind and level
of curation that happens on Kickstarter
so to start a project you you create
your project and then we check it before
it goes live and and we're looking to
make sure it meets our guidelines and
the guidelines is the most core thing we
have to Kickstarter when the guidelines
are it has to be a project so a project
is something with a beginning and an end
it's a finite thing it will produce
something that will exist independent of
its existence and so we see starting a
business is something that is much
broader than a project as we think of it
for example we also require that
everything be a creative project which
is means it fits into one of our 13
categories we also don't allow anything
that is charity based or cause based
funding those things are also not
allowed
and that's that's the the the main point
that we're looking each project from and
hum it sorry good you know go ahead what
were you gonna say I just gonna ask so
if a product project sorry I keep
getting this wrong yeah meets all of
these guidelines and is by the book
acceptable in your experience what makes
a project work and what doesn't I know
excluding the outliers of a product for
an apple product because you know just
like here at seen at any time we write
about Apple is like okay we know that's
going to get traffic whether it's good
or bad story it just gets traffic so
excluding that what makes something work
or not work on Kickstarter yeah you know
the point that we really that I I stress
a lot is that every Kickstarter is a
story and how the how the project is
presented is really important you know
there are a few things that I view is
being core to each project on
Kickstarter one it should benefit its
backers just as much as its creator you
know anything where it's like hey give
me all this money and I'm going to make
this great thing and you know I'll share
a couple photos of with you when it's
done it's just inherently I think unfair
so we're looking for things where
there's a value exchange and we really
try to stress that to people there's
also a tone to how people come to the
projects this is kind of what I was
getting at with the glyph we were you
know I'm personally and I think we as a
group are much more sympathetic to
projects that are pursuing some sort of
creative goal or some sort of personal
achievement rather than a commercial
interests you know someone's saying hey
if we can raise this 50k you know we'll
be able to take our business to the next
level and do XY and Z and this
opportunity will be available to us I
think that's a much less interesting
story and one that feels less important
to Kickstarter you know also there's
just that that finite project thing is
really important and then also just how
the story is told so you know the really
great projects have a video that explain
how it is they made this thing they
talked through the design process they
show the working prototype they've made
they talk about the challenges that they
faced and how it is they're going to
make this thing happen transparency is
something that we see is really
important especially with product design
with product design you know you're
you're you're often you know
funding something that doesn't exist yet
you have that prototype but the act of
taking that prototype 2 then something
that could be manufactured a you know
10,000 times there's a huge gap in
between those things and it's a steep
learning curve so we like people to talk
about their experience that backers know
hey can this person actually pull this
off or not and then also just even how
far in the process have you got you know
there's some projects that have gone up
in the past that have had just like a 3d
rendering and you know I don't
personally think that's enough to really
to make a case for you being able to do
something so we actually don't get
terribly involved in the vetting and we
try to give people an idea of the
expectations we have you know share as
much as you can if we feel like someone
isn't sharing anything at all we'll
we'll tell them they really need to but
in the end we're relying on backers to
exercise their discernment you know the
things that they're supporting are not
shrink wrapped the ready to ship they're
not sitting in a Best Buy shelf there is
a person who has to make them and that
process is part of the Kickstarter
experience no in any cases that process
is great and sometimes it is disastrous
disastrous oh now you're talking my
language tell me about disaster well i
think that the creative you know the
creative process is rarely a linear one
and it goes in all kinds of different
directions and it's hard to anticipate
what's going to go right and what's
going to go wrong we want we want bloody
details here and I don't have any bloody
details for you all right I think in the
case of Apple you know if you'd imagine
at the iphone was a Kickstarter project
you know that's four years of seeing how
this thing comes together you know you
hear about oh no we have to change from
the glass to the plastic screen whatever
vice versa processes is important as
part of it but there's certainly been
cases where people have bit off more
than they can chew and and this actually
tends to happen projects that or it's
more likely to having projects that
become incredibly overfunded because
maybe someone has is ready to build the
thing for ten thousand dollars and
they're going to do it with their buddy
and a garage somewhere but suddenly when
there's a half a million dollars the
scale that you have to do becomes much
different and suddenly you're talking
about making things in Asia and tooling
things and and the scope of problems
becomes a challenge
just becomes much bigger and you know we
see people you know people aren't
running off with the money here they're
they're working hard to do these things
but the simple fact is that making
things difficult and especially making
things at scale and so it's good for
backers to have that sense going into a
dead hey this thing is not done yet it
is it is in progress and we personally
think that's cool but you know other
people might not be aware that that's
what they're jumping into now out here
in Silicon Valley Kickstarter has made
quite an impact anybody a lot of games
are being developed as you mentioned
earlier before the show we were talking
about some games that are working on
Kickstarter and I here probably more
frequently answer than you would like
we're going to launch our company on
Kickstarter we're going to launch on
Kickstarter now obviously they're
talking about products because that's
how you launched on kickstarter but
they're thinking this is my company so
tell me about launching a business not
just designing a product but launching a
business using Kickstarter as the
platform for that yeah you know I don't
think they were a great fit for that you
know the reason why we stress the
project ideas because we want everyone
to have clear expectations going in
about what's going to be accomplished
you know I'm going to make an album okay
cool I can tell when an album is done I
can get that album even if the band
breaks up I still have that thing you
know starting a business and running a
business is something that requires
constant maintenance it can't just exist
on its own and you know it's hard to
tell exactly what the rights or rewards
are for a business you know might be you
get it people might want to offer a
discount in the store or you get early
access things like that but those things
I think are a little nebulous and harder
to pin down you know there are ways I
mean you know the idea of a creative
project is kind of a made-up one and it
is a fuzzy line and every day we talk
about probably 20 projects that sit
right on that fuzzy line and we try to
work through what the best decision is
and our starting point is always yes we
want to accept projects want to find
ways to make them work and there are
places where the business stuff does get
in a gray area where we are more prone
to say yes like a food truck
tend to like because those are smaller
and they seem more accomplishable to us
maybe maybe we're wrong but I think
thinking about Kickstarter is the place
to come and raise your series day
probably not the best idea I mean it's a
great way to get publicity it's it's
surely a great way to make a splash and
I think people are right to think about
it that way but our focus and our
loyalty really is to this to this notion
of creativity and and being a place
where things are produced that you have
a hard time getting made otherwise it to
the to that point I have seen I think
not very many but certainly more than
one product or company get out there and
say we're putting our product up on
Kickstarter and then the subtext being
sometimes explicitly stated for
publicity they don't necessarily need
the Kickstarter money but Kickstarter
has become this platform for advertising
a new product yeah yeah I mean it's
interesting we're not i'm not opposed to
that you know i think that it ends up
its kick serve as a way to make a lot of
eyeballs suddenly turn to you and you
and you have your moment and from our
perspective as long as people do what
they say they're going to do and they
offer people value in exchange that's
fine you know we're we're not here to
judge the basis of need or you know this
person already has enough money or
things like that we have no interest in
getting that granular but it is I mean I
think it is a good way to think about it
listen we need to talk about the JOBS
Act which is one of the economic
stimulus bills winding its way through
our government it's passed the house
it's the jumpstart our business startups
act and this is a very interesting piece
of legislation a version of it will
probably pass the Senate I think and it
makes it it changes the accessibility of
investment dollars to small businesses
and makes it possible for a mom-and-pop
startup or a 10-person startup to
solicit investment money and to take
money from non-accredited investors up
to ten thousand dollars per year per
investor this is sending ripples through
the entrepreneurial economy I'm wonder
what the JOBS Act what you think of the
jobs act if it will have any impact on
Kickstarter um yeah it sounds like you
know as much maybe even more about it as
I do you know certainly there are parts
of this that's that I think are very
helpful especially you know changing the
notion of what a credit investor as
seems like something a lot of people
have supported for a while you know part
of this bill appears to be allowing
crowdfunding investment or something
along those lines and you know that's
not something that we've had any part of
and you know I'm not sure whether or not
something that we would do we've just
sort of been watching and following the
news like anybody else because to us I
think that what's important about
Kickstarter and the reason why it's been
able to connect the way that it has is
because you know ideas are fund it's
just because people like the ideas
because they want them to exist no one
is looking something trying to judge
whether or not it'll be profitable or
whether it be a good investment no but
that stinking base that's the space you
created that's that's the rules you put
in in your board game is you're not
investing in the business per se you're
investing in the work product and you're
getting one of them one of them or
something like that in return right when
the entrepreneurial economy opens up and
the same people who are abiding buying
say a trebuchet which is a product I
bought on Kickstarter are instead of
buying the product are now buying the
company that might change the way people
view Kickstarter and then might not
people want to say sell investments in
the company instead of investments in
the product per se and will you allow
that uh you know i think it i mean it is
very different that would be a very
different equation and when you look at
kickstarter where the most common pledge
amounts 30 bucks in the average pledge
amount seventy dollars you know these
are consumer price points and i think a
consumer experience of patron
experiences is something that people are
comfortable with you know we have not i
can't think of many if any emails from
backers saying hey can I in some way
back this and get you know invest in
something instead I don't think that's
exactly what people are
in here for in terms of weather kicks
are will do this you know we're just
word is waiting and seeing how this
plays out I mean it's hard to tell what
the final legislation will be and you
know what the terms are going to be so
it's really hard to tell but I think
that what is important about what we're
doing is the is the lack of investment
part because I think it allows a lot
more things the opportunity to exist and
what otherwise because the bar is
significantly lower the question isn't
you know will this producer return for
me and from that angle I think almost
every project on Kickstarter would be a
bad investment and instead it's just is
this something that we would like to see
exist and we want to share and be a part
of and I just think that's a
fundamentally different question and
that's the question that really
motivates us and that I think has been
the disruptive thing but obviously you
know I don't know we'll see what happens
sorry not anticipating any major
business model changes for kickstarter
uh no not that I can see but you know
who knows at some point these businesses
will be allowed to solicit for
investment on Facebook Twitter you name
it you would you see that as competition
for your model um I it's hard to tell i
don't think so i'm just just seeing it
from you know this thousand-yard view
from where we are i mean i think that i
don't know i think that the things that
that are motivating a lot of the people
in kickstarter is just again the desire
to create you know and if you look at
you know film which is our largest
categories you know 50 million dollars i
don't know that how many filmmakers will
be looking for investors I mean the
notion of patrons is such a simpler one
you know there isn't that level of
fiduciary accountability you aren't
having to you know cast some texas oil
tycoon second mistress in your lead to
get the check you know the trades that
you're having to make ur not nearly as
onerous and said it is a clean exchange
of hey you give me this money you get
this credit and you know you get to come
visit the set and it's more about
experience and more about something
other than a financial return and you
know maybe were too optimistic or naive
or what but i feel like that is a
really powerful motivator and one that
gets to more of the core of I don't know
of the human spirit of our desire to
create an hour desire to be part of
things that are being created I think
that's a really core thing Nancy thank
you so much Yancey Strickler is the
co-founder of Kickstarter if you've got
a widget or a piece of art or a film or
some music or a band or a food truck
that you want to put together and you're
looking for some funding resources for
that you really owe to yourself to check
out Kickstarter Nancy again thanks so
much for your time all right thank you
hey so that was a great interview with
Yancey Strickler the co-founder of
Kickstarter he was calling skyping in
from his New York office i'm here today
with Jim Newton who's the founder of
tech shop which is a place you can go to
get your stuff built actually to build
it yourself to be specific that's right
thanks so much for making the time yeah
thanks for having coming in I want to
talk about tech shop and about you know
where the make it your self movement is
going and what you're doing with with
all these shops that you're opening up
across the country and I guess elsewhere
too but first to continue the threat of
what we were just talking about with
Nancy jobs act now we recorded that
interview a couple of days ago the JOBS
Act for those of you who don't know is
going to change the rules of
entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley and
elsewhere and it's Friday right now and
we think next week there'll be a vote on
the Senate so this is bubbling up as
major news let's talk about this briefly
I mean this will make it possible for
people to raise money from on Twitter
and stuff like that and to go public
more easily what do you think I mean you
work with entrepreneurs all the time
what does the job back mean for
inventors well right now if you're a
small company and you're going to go out
and try to raise money you have very
strict restrictions on what you can do
and what you can't do and it's based on
a state-by-state basis it's like in
California you can register with the
state's equivalent of the SEC and you
can advertise your securities your stock
offer most other states do not allow you
to advertise even if you register with
the states so you're limited to doing
road shows face to face
you can't you can't send out an email
and say hey come to our you know we're
looking for investors in our product
with it so the the provision that is
making that it's getting the most press
may not be the most important but isn't
getting the most press because it's sexy
is the whole idea of crowdfunding and
how does that impact the guys you know
who are making the trebuchet or you know
whatever the somebody is making a widget
the glyph which we saw on the answer
interview what does crowdfunding mean to
you well as far as raising investment
goes it's way easier to get you know a
couple hundred people to kick in you
know 2,500 bucks yeah than it is to get
you know one or two people to kick in
huge amounts of money yeah right now
there's restrictions on the number of
people that you can get to invest in
your company through the exemptions that
the SEC provides for companies so this
actually is great because you know you
could blast out to your Twitter like you
said and say hey you know everybody put
in 25 bucks we're trying to get this
thing going I I think that's great I
mean I put money into Kickstarter into a
Kickstarter project is this one and I
might put money into another one but at
some point if everybody who has an idea
is starting to throw the stuff up on in
their Twitter feeds or in their
facebooks hey fun my project I don't
know personally I worry about funding
fatigue setting in is I any think it's
gonna be an issue yeah i think that
actually could happen and I yeah I don't
know how far it can go you know we've
only been exploring this since you know
since Kickstarter opened I mean there
have been crowd-sourced funding I mean
that's that's how investment is you know
and right that is how investment is end
to end to just to counteract what I just
said we certainly seen no waning of
interest in the public's want to buy
stop stock market is a great example the
crowd source finding yeah they don't
call it that but that's exactly what it
is mmm all right let's talk about tech
shop now give us a elevator pitch what
what is tech shop and why should we care
sir so a tech shop is a do-it-yourself
workshop
you join for 100 bucks a month you come
in and use our facility to make anything
you can imagine we've got I guess
they're putting some pictures up on here
we've got you know everything from
milling machines and lathes woodworking
textiles sewing equipment welding
woodworking electronics laser cutters
injection molding plastic equipment
that's a water jet cutter that can cut
through six inches of anything you know
just we've got everything that you could
imagine mmm that you need to make
anything so this is the the corner
garage where people i mean people used
to go in i guess the 50s and 60s they
would do this at an auto shop and you
would have the health club model for our
shop and you take your you park your
Model T that you were trying to hot rod
down there yeah and it was not just a
place but a community how does that work
that's that's that's the whole thing
behind TechShop the community is what's
so important you can build your own shop
in your garage if you've got the money
in space mhm but man you're going to
really want your neighbor to come over
and see what you're working on you know
and having all these other creative
people around all the time a tech shop
you talked about crowd-sourced your
crowdsourcing your idea your
crowdsourcing you're the intellectual
property for your for your idea mm-hmm
how much of what's happening at techshop
is just people goofing around and how
many people are building businesses or
products that will become businesses
yeah I don't know what the percentage is
exactly because it varies but I
definitely think the majority of the
people there what they aspire to make
money from whatever they're working on
really right because who wouldn't want
to have to be able to make their living
from their hobby you know everybody
would love to be able to do that yeah so
if you dig deep into some of these
people they'll tell you they're not
doing this for commercial purposes but
if you dig down and really reach you'll
find out well you sure they'd love to be
able to do that what are some of the
best projects you've seen come out of
there man there's a whole list of them
there's there's the dota case which is
an ipad case that's you know been
considered by a lot of critics to be the
best one on the market the president's
the president carries one around with
his ipad in it
and he didn't get it so he didn't get it
for free he bought it on the market oh
no it's good yeah oh yeah we have I've
seen those those are beautiful to the
bamboo book like case exactly yeah
there's a server server cooling system
that was developed by a couple of our
guys and got licensed by Emerson know
the embrace blanket that is designed to
save the lives of babies in the third
world when they're born prematurely they
can't regular regulate their body
temperature and general electric just
invested in that put a bunch of money in
so I mean but there's all these other
projects you know hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of them we've got you know
over 3,500 active paying members in our
in our five locations right now which is
the most active location san Francisco
has the most members is that right yeah
yeah and have you seen uh people doing
these kind of what do they call these
Japanese inventions that are really
ridiculous that are cool they're got
rube Goldberg's like the toilet paper
holder if it's on your heads you know
you don't really see that kind of stuff
no I mean the stuff is more even though
so I talking about danna it's it's you
don't get the crazy inventor types
that's that's really more of a
stereotype I think okay now as I said at
the introduction to show that the
landscape for inventors is changing both
because of funding models and
crowdsourcing like Kickstarter and for
because of availability of shops and
hackerspaces you know tech shop is one
and there are others and then there are
there tools coming along there's open
source and free design tools and then
there's 3d printing what do you make of
3d printing is that as it's certainly
sexy but as big a deal as it's being
touted as it's certainly sexy yeah and a
lot of times there's no way that you can
practically make the thing that you want
to make especially on the prototype
stage you know about this little device
here on the table yeah you know you
could make the case for this without
spending a hundred thousand dollars on a
tool-and-die and getting injection
molded you could do that in an afternoon
so I think from that standpoint 3d
printing is really powerful but you know
some of the press that 3d printing is
getting makes it sound like you know
okay throw away all the other tools and
all the other human you know implements
3d printing is all we need from now on
and that's
certainly not the case it's also by the
way as I understand it the case that you
can make things with the 3d printer that
cannot be made any other way yeah and 3d
printing is slow it's actually easy to
make things accidentally that you can't
manufacture that metric molds won't
worry so am old would be millions of
dollars you know to try to do this uh so
I say we've got it I got an idea I have
an idea and it's something I want to
build it at a tech shop a prototype at
techshop tech shop is for prototyping
really not manufacturers I you know
Patrick with the dodocase he made the
first two thousand units at TechShop is
that right do you take a lot of that no
we don't I really don't take now okay i
think if we took a cut of it people
would just find another way to do it I
don't think they'd come in there are
models so there's models like y
combinator and quirky that that do get
into that into that space have you
thought about expanding or doing a an
advanced program or an offshoot a quirky
likes to do that is attached somehow
detect shop you know we're always
playing with different ideas yeah I like
the idea of helping picking out the most
promising technologies that we see come
through our place and helping them get
up to the next stage you mean projects
or manufacture technologies ah both I
mean if if our manager identifies
someone that's making something and they
the manager thinks that's really got a
lot of promise we might approach them
and ask them if they need help to get
this up to the next stage to form a form
a company or get introductions to people
or get investment is that part of the
services or is that just what you do
yeah I would love to do that so I mean
if I have an idea for a goofball I told
you my goofball idea before we started
the show so oh and I can prototype it
there maybe manufacture a few dozen uh
what's your advice for the inventor
versus say ten years ago for you know
the product that I think could be the
next I know it rock or whatever I mean
I'll base this on you know right now
it's so easy to reach your audience even
with the most obscure little thing you
can reach people through you know all
these social networks through ebay
through etsy through Kickstarter you
couldn't do that 20 years ago 10 years
ago it was a it would have been
impossible
find that niche customer and now you can
find a customer base for anything that
you can think up yeah it changes
everything there's a I I don't know if
this is a Kickstarter or a tech shop
project but i have a canon s90 camera
which is a beautiful camera they're not
make it made anymore it's the s100 the
new model the problem is it's it's flat
and had no grip on it and there was a
guy who was milling out of aircraft
aluminum these beautiful stick on grips
I don't know how I found that I never
would have found that at a camera shop
otherwise he probably sold my guess in
the hundreds maybe thousands but that's
ok now you can get a roll mill custom is
that he ordered one back said his
machine to mill it yeah you think 25
years ago what would you have had to do
to get that out into anyone's hands
right put it in a like a photography
magazine and an ad in the back maybe and
have you know mail order there's no way
that stores are going to carry it and
even if they do you can't fill up the
pipeline of all the stores to get a
distribution generate at the right level
anyway um brave new world yeah so I want
to talk a little bit about education we
talked briefly about community but and
about the whole hot rod ethic is that
are we entering into a new maker era a
new hardware hacker mentality and if so
how do people like me or anybody who
wants to build this thing learn the
skills necessary to conceptualize design
manufacture and eventually sell an idea
without going to you know the late-night
advertisement inventors will help you
get your product for millions of dollars
what's the new model how do you learn
this stuff you know you come to tech
shop and you tell our dream consultant
what your idea is we've got a whole
staff of half of them or dream
consultants so they're there to help you
with the machines help you with your
project yeah and so you tell them what
your idea is and they'll say hey you
know you could use this machine over
here you could use this material why
don't you start with taking this class
on this particular machine and see see
what you think of that
and one thing about tech shop everything
in the shop is designed you know it
looks all it looks scary the waterjet
cutter that can cut through you know a
six by 10 foot piece six inches thick
whatever you want the milling machines
the lathes they all look pretty scary
but everything without exception in tech
shop is designed for the complete novice
to be able to come in take a hour or two
hours of classes and get on that machine
and actually use it and that's all
included in the membership the use of
the machines is all included in the
members of the classes are extra okay
because we've got you know we do 200
classes a month at each location more or
less so you know we're not going to
price our models so that it pays for you
to take all those classes because you
don't want to probably take all this
class right under stay just pay for the
ones that you want to take oh I have a
question from the chat room here saying
you better consult with a patent
attorney to ensure you're violating any
patents do you have is that part of your
consulting services as well and had an
audition no all right okay so watch out
but it is an issue is it not if you
disclose it you know anywhere you
disclose your patent yeah idea you need
to protect yourself so we've got our
members sometimes they'll sign NDA's
with other members before they talk to
them really you know it's actually the
most powerful thing about tech shop is
just get it out get it out to market
faster than anyone else don't wait for a
patent to issue in all cases sometimes
it's good but not always I like that
thinking but I wonder if it's realistic
considering the patent trolls we have
out there who are just sitting on ideas
that have that are buried in some file
cabinet somewhere just waiting to be the
smacked it well I guess they wouldn't
want to smack down the mom-and-pop
inventor until they're big right yeah
hey one other thing I saw that you said
you mentioned that you have like craft
as well as manufacturer and I saw that
you know make magazine love make
magazine yeah just for the possibilities
it opens up in your mind they launched
another magazine I think was called
craft yeah
craft which is about textiles is that a
parallel culture here I'm just curious
about because I'm not tapped into that
one at all Dale and sheri from make you
know it would be better to probably
explore what the difference in similar
areas are those two worlds they
certainly blend together a tech shop
yeah quite seamlessly you know some
people you know we think we often will
see people come in to one side or the
other they'll come into the the hard
arts side and they'll start to explore
you know the sewing machines for part of
their project and vice versa somebody
will come in thinking they're just going
to do crafting and quilting or whatever
in when they take a laser class where
they take a welding class and they this
whole new world opens up to them you
know I think I should come there just so
I can make my son a Horta the outfit
Star Trek order for Halloween mmm all
right uh what's next for tech shop I
mean you've got you said five location
yeah we have five locations right now
we're opening we're trying to open five
more this year and we're on track with
pretty much locked and loaded on three
of them and what in what are their they
all us are they guys all in the u.s.
right now okay there's a you have any in
London because I've heard there's
similar if not not yet okay but you oh
well yeah yeah we're exploring that too
so what are the locations right now in
San Francisco celoso downtown San
Francisco downtown I'm sorry menlo park
yeah downtown San Jose mm-hm we have one
in raleigh durham north carolina and
then we have one that we just opened
actually the grand opening is in May
Detroit with Ford Motor Company as a
partner I like that if I wouldn't it's
open right now it's been open for months
customers are using it everything but
our grand opening is going to be on May
fifth I want to visit the Detroit shop
and see what people are doing in the
Motor City it's really cool yeah talk
about you know talk about energizing the
community that needs a resource like
this you know what's interesting is
yesterday I was on another show press
here and there was a guy from Volkswagen
rd and they're moving a whole segment of
engineers to Silicon Valley to get into
the whole software ethos very
interesting blending of cultures yeah it
is anything else you want to talk about
with tuck shop I don't know
people should come and take a class and
check it out make stuff hey ray for a
quick i just wanted to point out you're
curious about building your son a star
trek outfit on wednesday the 21st of
marsh there is a wearable tech and eat
text house mita so you can attend at
seven o'clock did you even know this I
should have planted that no I can't
track of everything our teams doing
anymore so you should definitely check
that out right I absolutely Jim Newton
is the founder of tech shop
congratulations on your success so far
and keep it going let's keep that hacker
make it yourself build it yourself ethos
going I'd like to thank you an see who
was with us earlier on the show as well
from Kickstarter Steve thanks for
producing back next week with another
great episode of reporters roundtable
see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
