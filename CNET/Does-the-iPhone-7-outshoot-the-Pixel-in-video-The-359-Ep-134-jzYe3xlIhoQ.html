November second it's time for episode
134 of the 359 podcast with Roger Cheng
and pin Fox Rubin hey guys hey morning
yeah are you doing hi that was so funny
hello there person that I am familiar
with hello sir uh greetings everyone 22
on YouTube mm-hmm shut up then Wow nice
to be back Roger thank you uh so we've
got another busy day for you lots of
great headlines we were talking about
the results of cnet's iphone 7 plus
pixel video shoot out um the winner may
surprise you or not otherwise we'll talk
about Samsung's bid to make an all
screen phone and lastly amazon trying to
learn business through our kids yes yeah
it's the easiest way to get your money
it is it's very clear if you're if
you're a parent if you're not then it's
a terrible idea at all but for us as
parents we we would take a consideration
for the surface right sure yeah yeah
maybe not yet not yet for us right it's
a monthly subscription I don't know how
many people want to get a mobile app
with that but we'll talk about that on
the show all right let's uh let's get it
going as always if you have any
questions leave them in the comments
section Brian a producer will pick out
the best and we'll plan sirum Riley's
try alright this is a pretty chill show
already look at make it happen let's do
this alright studying the recording in
three two welcome to the 339 we talked
about the top tech news of the day and
all the other crap we want to throw in
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox ribbon so
cnet's extensive tests are done and we
have a winner in the video shoot out
between the iphone 7 plus and the pixel
and while the pixel won the photo shoot
out apple phone actually came out on top
this time yeah surprising or not I mean
maybe yeah I I think that what was
interesting to me about this is that the
image stabilization wasn't as good with
the Google pixel yes I remember on stage
google made a very big effort to show
that this is this is a big you have to
keep in mind that Apple actually has a
physical image
ization component there so that's what
makes it better google has a software
one mm-hmm and as you sort of rightly
know like Google could theoretically
make it better through software updates
right and you know right now it's just
for the camera it's not for the video
camera which is kind of weird mr. so the
physical difference that you're
mentioning is the fact that the iphone 7
plus has two cameras no no it actually
has like a physical image stabilization
mechanism inside and so google says they
argued with the the pixel that you know
the software can do just as good and it
can be tweaked a little bit more writing
with software updates so it can
constantly improved so it's sort of like
the the headway or four for the pixel
phone is a little bit higher
theoretically then than the iphone yeah
it definitely makes I think the decision
making for people a little bit harder
obviously would have been nice from
seeing his perspective to be like look
if you want the best camera for photos
and videos get the google pixel now it's
a little bit more of an awesome little
bit mixed yeah because it's like
obviously video is becoming such an
important component for everybody so
it's it's definitely a valuable thing
for people to do and if you take a lot
more videos maybe you do want to
consider the iphone 7 plus then just
know just to list out the advantages for
the iphone we're color image to the
stabilization sharpness contrast
low-light shooting in zoom and the pixel
did lead in the speed for autofocus and
it sometimes had nicer exposure when the
iphone had kind of went overboard with
brightness so some some positives for
the pixel but yeah if you're interested
in shooting video the iphone 7 plus is
the phone for you right i would probably
also argue that for most regular
consumers you might notice the
difference that's true you know so
they're probably both very very good
cameras so as that's concerned next up a
report out of korea's cited a samsung
executive saying that the galaxy s eight
could be ninety percent screen so almost
all scream no just to just to note most
phones now about eighty percent screen
so it's about a ten percent bump doesn't
seem like a lot but that's that could
make a big difference that sounds really
cool how it looks right so the rumors
are that the iphone 8
whatever they're going to call it is
also gonna do yeah that's also going to
do it so the expectation for 2017 is
that you're going to be seeing a lot of
phones without I don't like these terms
of chin or a forehead yeah yeah or at
least a minimized one right yeah and and
more excitingly the engineers saying the
symptoms really pushing to cover ninety
nine percent of the phone which is
amazing really cool I think said a lot i
just got any frame around the phone I I
would argue that a lot of people are
really getting phone fatigue and I think
that that is definitely something that
could get a lot of people excited about
phones again and be like you know you
just get a lot more immersive and much
more screen for edit the same size which
is kind of cool and it just didn't know
that I'm Xiaomi he's kind of done this
already with the me mix which is almost
people very excited about that yeah even
though it's kind of a concept and it's
it's actually not quite all screen like
they advertised when you look at it
closely last amazon just came out with a
new mobile app for kids reading called
amazon rapids it's 299 a month and it's
it's kind of this clever little take on
kids reading where is basically original
stories told through text messages yeah
so is this something that you would be
into I don't know what's the age range
for this was the intended agent at seven
to 12 so you're feeling I call yeah I'm
about seven years away from considering
this I don't know it's little it's
clever because it uses a medium that the
kids are gonna be familiar with totally
um but I don't know it's just I haven't
quite figured out how much screen time
like it's gonna have so yeah yeah
monthly cost i think is a little bit
steep at this month yeah it's but i do
like the idea so we'll see what happens
at Turnham amounts to one children's
book 01 children's book a month right
jordan less than that yeah so I mean in
that sense it's kind of a good deal for
a short period time I don't know if I
want to be on the hook for for like
several years on the surface so I guess
Apple ID / more about these stories
check us out Cena I'm Roger Cheng on Ben
Fox Rubin thanks for listening and we're
back to hit up the chat and thanks
everyone for all the kind words we're
happy to have you hey to Iran hey to
Puerto Rico I Seattle all right hey
everybody and
our old buddy Michael Brown right around
our favorite the answer to the title no
oh okay Wow yeah he iphone out shoot the
pixel no okay apparently he did the
similar test as we did he and a
co-worker between new york and DC took
side-by-side photos just me but what is
it what videos comes to a says he
specifies photos okay pictures were
closed in between but the pixel was a
clear winner in his book so look what we
had we found similar results with the
cameras as well for photos just to be
clear this test was for videos we did
pretty extensive one's side by side and
alleys to our our experts eyes the
iphone 7 plus one out on video again not
photos on video yeah and i would say
that on the photo side it is a bit of an
embarrassment fried for the iphone the
iphone has been very well known for
having you know one of the best cameras
out there so the fact that Google edge
them out oh my no I don't know if it's
an embarrassment I mean it's like the
edge them out I mean sure Apple's had a
great reputation for a solid cameras
phone I don't think that changes like it
still has a very excellent phone or
camera I don't know if it's an
embarrassment I think it's a surprising
win it's a it's a nice coup for for
google especially for like a first
generation phone yeah that's a damn
that's not it's not exactly established
right it's not like this he drew is it
was samsung that might be a big a deal
right totally well Samsung's been making
a big deal about their cameras
yesteryear did you know talking about
low light saying it's a good their
cameras are great yeah but it's always
kind of be like toss up so they're not
exploding cameras sorry not exploit
versions right it's are avoidable here's
a note from robert iphone limits 4k
recording 25 minutes for video because
google offers free storage to pixel yeah
do they limit 4k recording as well
that's it's a very good question I don't
know you have no idea none of us have
touched the pixel yet yeah is has one in
the office that's really get my hands on
it we should go bug him after this and
bring back in phone I'll just right now
see you guys avail now well we will get
an answer to you guys about that because
that's an interesting point I mean they
would add for limiting your 4k video is
kind of small
because that eats up so much of your
storage Oh totally if you were just
shooting 4k video non-stop I don't know
how long it would take for your for you
to hit your limit but it wouldn't be
that long it won't be that long it is
kind of cool that you can shoot in 4k if
you do want to blow up the video otieno
at that point so its knowledge that's
kind of like a standard feature now
right having 4 a high phone pronto for a
couple years now or at least you yeah
they've been saying in the chat iphone
camera hasn't been up to snuff since the
5s is that true I don't know I feel like
that the combination of software and
hardware as sort of kept apple of above
the pack in terms of camera quality I'm
going back to what I said during the
podcast I do believe that if you're
going to get a flagship phone from
samsung apple or now the Google pixel
most consumers probably aren't going to
tell these small differences and this is
for people that are like really really
big shutter bugs or they love taking a
lot of video maybe you're going to
notice like some some really significant
differences there are some nice
differences if you're going to pick this
one over the other one but generally
speaking those three you know sets over
there you're gonna they're they're
generally good you're not gonna go wrong
yeah it's way better than like if you
were gonna get like an entry-level phone
you know so ejc TV says the pixel is a
bad knock off of the Apple phone and
Apple should sue them this is entirely
that's good Apple has sued company 2444
less more than a few times it definitely
it my my immediate impression when I saw
the Google event was that there were
there were obvious elements that made it
look like an iPhone because it had the
rounded edges um it's for me it was like
always i'm it was a metal frame with the
the antenna lines that kind of look like
the previous generation iphone it i
don't know it's got a glass back you
know and they have it they have the
fingerprint sensor fingerprint sensor in
the back row big it's different i think
there is a lot of these phones given
that they'll kind of use the same
mitoonam they're all gonna kind of look
alike li you can look at the galaxy s7
yeah well that kind of looks a lot like
the iphone to like that's why i like the
edges the Samsung edge phones do
kind of pushes design a little bit
differently and you can immediately
identify those I'm still annoyed by
those hedges like the timing right I
haven't spent a ton of time with them I
just when I say it's gotten better I so
I'm not happy with my ass dicks edge cuz
the the curvature is just so dramatic
that you can't like hold it as well no
no when you're typing like the edge of
those typewriter the keyboard is a
little bit on the fe side like you you
miss type a bit so yeah they fix it a
bit with the last version okay and then
they start making well hopefully so it's
maybe people will go more toward the s8
than the s8 edge because if you're gonna
get so much more screen real estate
right then maybe you don't need the
edges as money i mean the edge is a cool
aesthetic feature but i don't know if
it's really that useful and so i know if
i want to buy a phone for like like that
edge well when they first came out with
what was it was the note edge yeah that
was the first one yeah um everybody
thought it was a gimmick or a lot he
wasn't bought it yeah in one side so i
was surprised that they kept building on
it but I mean look at let them stand out
from the pack mmm Mitchell says the LGV
20s of superior camera overall
interesting it's funny we just I think
our reviews either up now or was posted
recently no one seems to care about the
phone I feel bad cuz it's a decent phone
it's not their marketing it it's a metal
phone that has a removable back which is
kind of nice no one else really has that
now you know the LG is kind of kept up
with that that whole like removable
battery you know SD card slot on all the
stuff which is a huge money safe kind of
nice yeah but no one seems to care about
that phone I don't know why like like
carriers aren't support I mean they're
they're selling it I guess but they're
not like really promoting it yeah you
know a huge amount of attention for that
phone I saw a commercial for it I think
yesterday the day before so I think LG
is trying to promote it a little bit
more so maybe we don't know I imagine
after the the g5 blow up that they had
been a little bit more cautious about
this launch sorry what's that the last
phone that the LG g5 which is our
flagship for March really just
completely did not do well now I just
failed well yeah people just didn't want
the whole much
this is a backbone okay very good camera
great screen like super high-end specs
battle between the iphone and the pixel
no one's really consciousness Thea was
hopeful the modular phone was gonna work
out I thought that was kind of a cool
idea I was a cool idea it's just I don't
know whatever Michael phone we were
talking about James Bond before I
thought that would be a kind of James
Bond phone you would you know snap on
the Taser function yes and bad guys hmm
so q is just an app developer now yeah
well very rare the hips are guided
employ for love let's not get back to
this conversation I don't need your
YouTube audience through our hatred of
James Bond no no my Brian hatred of Jews
yeah actually no James I like somebody
wants to whatever dan Pony have a pre
pre show that you guys are going to some
time dan posed a really good question if
cameras will actually cause people to
switch from iOS to Android and vice
versa I'm interested to hear feedback
about that in the chat I don't yeah if
you guys have two cents on that but I'm
more interested in I would say no I mean
I think the camera is a still a huge
factor I think it's a bigger factor if
your are an Android user because it
determines which android deployed device
you're gonna buy it's less of a factor
if your iOS versus Android because i
feel like the the transition from one
operating system to another is so
annoying and so painful that people
rather would not do it and both Google
and Apple have done a really good job of
like keeping you in their respective
ecosystems whether it was like services
like Gmail or apps or whatever from the
google side or like I to deny cloud on
the Apple side it's come a pain to
switch so and I know they've both tried
to make it easier by like used like
offering apps that allow you to kind of
transition it's still the the
differences in how you use iOS versus
how you use Android are still
significant enough that like you're
gonna become annoyed the first couple of
weeks using it I think Google is
definitely trying to play that card
though I think I really did their
presentation they were they were saying
that they benchmarked their camera and
it was described as the best camera ever
so they were definitely trying to use it
as leading because that's that firm had
not come out with a report on the seven
plus yet oh so it was like really
misleading it was a camera
at the time I don't actually know what
the score was the plus then if they
actually had come out but it was that a
well-known benchmark company by the way
cuz it has obscured mdx oh yeah okay
yeah alright that's good to know
switching gears back to the essay what
will the other cool feature be besides
the screen more screen um I don't know
no no what they give you were having a
dog every like screen so we got a screen
for your screen so you can screen while
you scream hahaha sorry I had to bring
back an old name for that one um I don't
know what else what else that's that
thing that's the issue that I feel like
maybe Samsung is trying to play it play
play to the basic and play cool after
the note 7 was such a horrifying launch
I think they want to get the s8 out
there yes a sure that it doesn't explode
right it's explosively good sire duck
heavy ballsiest thank you my daughter um
right I think that what are the problems
with the note 7 was that maybe they
tried to cram too much in there yeah too
quickly and it caused some problems so
my expectation would be that they're
gonna make a really good screen and
hopefully not try to add too many I mean
I betcha the retina scanner that showed
up in the node 7 they might that might
pop into the note for the day assayed um
in terms of other features are there any
other kind of wish list features that
are left like that you really really
need or want the bigger screen is I
still feel like the bigger screen is one
of those things that's really going to
help push forward smartphones yeah and
and actually make them more interesting
looking I'm very different material
maybe it's a ceramic instead of glass
you're made out of wood or concrete
motorola tried that a would funk bamboo
bamboo back seriously yeah I don't
remember that moto am I had just
exploded customize the back with leather
bamboo all kinds of different materials
good lord they've tried everything oh
yeah so the other things better I'm
gonna mention this the other thing that
we've been waiting for and this is
probably a couple years down the line
are like bendable and rollable phones
yeah so that'll that'll maybe be
somewheres not
you like it's not next year you know you
know 23 years it's really not the
favorite isla node showed it off they
showed off bendable wearables and phones
that were concept devices it's the the
challenge isn't the screen it's like
getting all the material everything
underneath the components underneath
right the battery like how do you got a
battery right yeah how you roll a
battery I don't know they are gonna
figure it out though oh yeah they have
to get us to keep buying devices this is
what they're working on and what are the
rumor mills obligatory about the iphone
8 already we've heard wireless charging
while charging you all screen removal of
the home button those are those are
pretty big ones those are those again
rumor mill yeah we're hearing it the
same you know yeah we don't actually
know apple doesn't talk to us
specifically they talk to other folks
have seen that they just don't care
about us it is interesting that we are
already rumor in the iphone the new one
from next I don't like two months 7z I
must have just came out well I mean
Scott and I wrote a story about the
iphone 8 like two or three days after
the know what I would you know what I
would really love for the iphone 8 that
they bring back the headphone jack I'm
not happy we had the courage to admit we
were wrong I completely agree why come
out with macbooks that have the
headphone jack if you have the courage
to get rid of them in your iphone like
yeah how does that make any sense yeah I
think that was was that Sean's complain
somebody complained that was not my idea
somebody somebody else from cnet
mentioned that in the story um I'm sure
there was a dongle mania story that we
wrote yeah have we heard anything about
a 4k display with the s8 okay with Roche
on phones though are you really gonna
tell the difference no but I wouldn't be
surprised if somebody will care yeah I'm
it again obviously it's a marketing
point well you know there are four K
phones out there Sony makes 4k display
on its experience of high-end Xperia
phones I wouldn't be surprised if
Samsung loaded it said they just love
specs you know they just identify extra
features you you would have to like
stare directly into it actually tell the
difference I think by this right which I
guess for VR maybe it makes it does
makes
for VR okay all right then that is use
actor say my son's for k's i miss
efficient like to like our truly
immersive experience by your phone like
you need like an 8k display or something
hmm dad so there are there are practical
uses for it that most people can't
imagine that being said we're not really
good what VR that much 4k displays are
not mainstream quite yet other than that
sony phone that you just mentioned and
maybe some others but totally DJ that's
not that's probably not coming next year
either so just waiting on the whole
videos that's further down the line and
yeah most people don't use VR so it's
not an issue but adding the 4k element
plus a high refresh rate to a phone that
definitely helps with the wealthy are
you know what i would like to see if you
could use the surface dial on a phone
not for mine that's a dark actually
haunted phone it's like too big the
display what about day uh um i just
totally lost Oh lost my train of thought
for a second but if they ditch the
Lightning port and go USB see that would
make a lot of is amazing that would make
its atoms at all so Apple makes way too
much money off of the Lightning port
because you know copies accessory makers
charges yeah hey Apple good for the
rights to officially use lightning so
whereas USBC is a broad standard then I
don't know maybe somebody in Switzerland
is getting paid for it but it's
certainly not Apple someone from Intel
it's an intel-based Press that right
mm-hmm that's rotten it's like like the
original USB was Intel so does USB I
don't know the answer this at all does
USB can you be used for audio the same
way lightning can be yeah yes yes okay
can that's the thing that's why i feel
that most of these other companies going
to drop the headphone jack as well just
go with us pc that's right yeah yeah
shanklin wrote about that recently so
the intel has talked about the audio
like the benefits of using a USB see
instead of knowledge as so in theory the
google pixel could have lost the
headphone jack as well it is i just want
courageous enough they would learn
courageous at all
uh no it's gonna happen you know we're
gonna see more and more phones that just
drop everything except for a USBC port
it's gonna happen or maybe to you think
I don't know about this we'll see Oh
dongle phone telephone all right yeah
it's uh it's kind of one for me now
because I've got like I've got 15
headphones like hanging around the house
but I'll have to find like the one
specific one that only works on this
phone my god mine I don't like it at all
anyways let's let's wrap things up let's
get out of here yeah thanks everybody is
but five questions yes if you idea that
you saw her shirred here check us out on
cnet our podcasts also available on
