voice you gotta do like what's up is
squeaky in the pig I'm am I the pig now
I guess I'd be the pig every key nice
I'd be squeaky you would be squeaky a
squeaky little guy how's it goin listen
it's good it's good um it's been an
eventful week for me I'm said only into
my new apartment as everyone knows and
if you recall from last week I had a
run-in with a very friendly man named
tato who I called taco by accident yep
uh you call this poor guy and he thought
his name was actually taco yeah I wasn't
proud and then this week about two days
ago i usually get up around eight i work
from home predominantly so i don't need
to wake up super early you go downstairs
to go hey taco good morning is like now
it's tato you asshole no I get a at
seven-forty-five in the morning the
doorbell rings I like bolt up and I'll
meet that bleary I hate that and I like
like walk over and like look through the
eye hole and it's tato it's standing
there and I'm like Hello and he's like
I'm here to check your heat I was like
okay and I'm in like frazzled I haven't
had anything to wake me up and I throw
clothes on and I let him in and he's
like okay I'm checking your heat the
heat where I had the computer desktop
apparently the panel to check the heat
was precisely next to the computer
desktop so in 7 45 in the morning I'm
like a mess I'd be like tato be cool if
you gave me a little heads up about this
way well right I would certainly do that
well that's later in the story so I'm
like.he tato goes to like move the
desktop like no talk gonna be taught to
relax so I like gingerly unplug
everything and like move the thing away
from it and he likes pencils how you
like unhooks the panel and checks it out
Bob LaVon he's like everything looks
fine and he leaves and like I the door
closes that I like collapse back into
bed I'm like
out of it flash forward like five hours
later I'm in the lobby and my landlord
walks in and I was like hey how's it
going so uh there's a guy around here
call himself tato don't work here isn't
work here tato came by and she's like
really know oh yeah that was a mistake I
was like why what it was like he went
into the wrong apartment oh man show so
no one told us because he wasn't
supposed to be there Tonto dropping the
ball and it's possible that he's just
getting revenge on me at this point no
way you don't think he's pissed from the
taco incident is do you have a thing
right now I think we're building some
sort of a nemesis you have a few
lationship yeah it's a family feud he's
gonna start mispronouncing your name I'm
sorry doctor I am so tato I know you're
a fan of the show do us a favor cut Russ
some slack seriously at like 830 I can
deal with an 830 wake up time yeah 745
is is just too much for me I wonder if
people can hear the Giant Bomb guys
going nuts to our Jason sudhi they get
excited if ever do games they they do I
hope I wonder they can hear us on their
show that they're doing i hope so uh if
you are listening to our program on a
somewhat regular basis you are aware
that back to the future month is the
thing I mean way way way way isn't what
a month did we yeah just by accident we
made a month because it's it's uh it's
important to us now I know you had a
very spectacular day I'm back the future
day which is the 21st yeah was Wednesday
but for me even though I love back to
the future it was too much it was too
much it was like it came it reached uh a
proposed levy or just like by three
o'clock you're just like please God
enough already I don't care that someone
called someone else about Joe like
enough so I felt so going before I knew
that I was going to get to interview Bob
Gale and alan silvestri I was not
looking forward to october twenty first
yeah as a fan shows like man that
they're gonna be gonna be this into the
ground yeah and I'm not gonna let us
enjoy and I was preaching that on the
show for many weeks leading up to it
when I found I was going to interview
the writer
yeah the composer yeah I changed my
attitude and I then sort of bought into
it and I drank the kool-aid yeah where
the Pepsi perfect if you will and I was
like look I'm gung-ho on this I need to
be a part of this so yeah I mean I I
don't know I started things real early i
was sitting so so let me like back it up
so they so I go over to the broadcast
Center on um on Tuesday yes now the guy
i did this interview with his name is
Vladimir duty A's and B's a CBS
correspondent he didn't also account
count Vladamir sure yeah he's he's
vampire I know it um so I uh so I go
over there and this guy Vladimir i'm
always on CBS n with he's like dude you
have to do this interview with me he
shot this entire eight minute segment
for CBS this morning they aired on
wednesday morning as well sure where he
also interviewed Bob Gale and just
talked him and they they spent all his
money doing the CG like half a 80 I
really made a nice segment out of it
yeah when he was filming that he said
hey Bob I also i anchor my friend and i
would love to pick your brain about the
thing if we could dive a little deeper
but the lure yeah sure let can i bring
Alan Silvestri's like obviously that'd
be amazing so fast forward to tuesday
morning we get it all planned out we
know we're gonna do i find out hey
they're gonna have the DeLorean there on
wednesday you guys are going to do a
spot from the DeLorean as well wow so
i'm in front of the broadcast Center
this huge box car pulls up and they
lower the the thing yeah and what comes
out for a freaking DeLorean act like
working like a real car sure and the
thing pulls out I guess it's just a
Dorian write it but this was a this so I
came to find that this was a universal
studios license replica they used as a
promotional tool for when the film came
out in 1989 really like this thing was
legit exactly the same do you think they
started with the Dorian like body yeah
okay talk I mean it like prefab like a
Volkswagen know
this is an actual Delory okay uh and I
like I just couldn't handle it yeah it
was two monsters I was like so then
they're like yeah you're gonna get in it
so this guy starts mounting GoPros on
the inside of the DeLorean okay and
they're like you guys they go to me and
leather like talk about what you're
gonna do like how are you gonna enter
this segment so I'm like all right what
are we gonna do so so I'm like somebody
find a banana peel yeah someone go get a
banana peel yeah so I go to the guy who
owns the car it's his guy Andy exec from
long islands i guess my DeLorean uh got
a bunch custom license mocha audit from
the universal i dunno how he came to own
the DeLorean is gotta be fascinating
first thing is like this is like this
thin hair dude with slicked back you
know Andy from Brooklyn or after the
game my name's Andy Rudy how are ya this
is my DeLorean don't worry you touch
this don't do me a favor don't touch
anything in the car change the times who
knows what could happen time circuits
are on but if you bang it out wind up in
1830 nobody nobody wants that all right
nobody wants that shit so I'm like Andy
thank you so much for doing this like
you're you're fantastic sport yeah sake
don't worry about is my card you ever
need a movie prop you ever need a car
anything like that you call me up yeah
like okay but I cross that bridge i'll
hit you up but so we get in we put a
banana in mr. fusion sure the whole
thing it's awesome so is it designed
like the future Dorian yeah it's so it's
the 2015 it's the back to the future two
Deloria got it okay ah so we do the
whole thing it's great and I'll link to
that segment up on on on see on the show
notes so we get out of there and they go
Jeff so this is huge crabs like a
hundred people here ever the second and
this is a part of New York where like
nobody lives or work where is it so the
bracha centers on 57th between 10th and
all the way so it's all the way in the
west and it's basically in hoboken sure
nobody nobody goes there yet this thing
drew a crowd affair 200 people right
away and we're in it we should think
it's awesome we get out and one of the
producers of the segment this girl and
who was fantastic helping us out she
goes she goes Jeff Bob Gale and alan
silvestri are upstairs
they want to meet you before they go on
the air with you okay and already my
smiles like ear to ear like let's do it
so Vlad and I get up there and they're
just hanging out anniversaries with his
wife the the promoter for the blu-rays
there some other handlers are there are
they popping bottles they're not popping
bottles but they're in the green room
and they're just like the two most
chilled out I mean I don't know what you
expect I don't know what I x1's a
musician and one's a writer like well
Alan's Reggie has to have like a
shitload of Oscars too yeah that dude
sure he did Forrest Gump like the shores
but he's his primary job is sitting
alone in a room writing on a piece of
paper little notes yeah I mean so flat
and I get up there and they stand up
right away in there and Vlad and Bob
like knew each other from last week so
they're like super psyched sure and I'm
like I'm like hi guys and they're just
like hey Jeff we heard you're a big fan
this is great i'm just like you lost
your mind I was like McFly Einstein flux
capacitor and they're just like all it's
cool you know god will you guys want to
talk about what do you have in mind for
the thing I'm just and we just start
talking up and somehow like marijuana
started getting talked about things and
I'm like it was lean like a joking way
sure joking cuz they were talking about
like well you really gotta watch the
movie enough times and get in the right
frame of mind okay I'm like don't worry
Bob in the right form I'm plenty of
times I've seen this movie and he goes
yeah that is like sometimes you just
gotta let loose and I'm like in my head
I'm like I can stumble bother nobody
else gonna happen like do I need to
crack a window what's going on right
here uh so they're super grateful we get
down we start shooting the segment and
we only like seven minutes cuz they're
not just gonna block out entire hour for
me and let the geek out guys I'll link
to the interview it's it's a lot of fun
they're super enthusiastic the coolest
thing was that they were both very um
happy and and just you know the the i
guess like the the the novelty of
people's enthusiasm about
this franchiser has not worn thin on
them like they are so over the moon
about people who are passionate and
enthusiastic about back to the future
and you also got to imagine for both of
them in terms of like getting crowds of
people to cheer from the for them
doesn't happen too often no like and
like a clear leader Chris really come on
Jimmy Kimmel never loses their mind
exactly so these are guys that are like
behind the scenes guys they obviously
make amazing things right but no one is
recognizing Alan Sylvester on the street
who happens to be like a devastatingly
handsome older gentleman yeah who's like
great head of hair just like super
psyched to be there that really cool
they're both they both look great yeah
um so we do the thing and it's very
sweet talking's nice interview goes well
and then after goes off we're just
hanging out I'm like Vlad had to go and
continue anchoring yeah he's like I'm
like I'll walk you guys out and Bob's
like asked me more stuff I'm like really
I'm like what do you want to know so
like I got some really candid stuff room
oh I don't think anyone really has ever
asked him drop drop something so we
asked stuff about obviously the first
thing we do is like the Almanac sure and
he says the first draft that he wrote
yeah was a draft where Marty goes into
the antique store and asks for a book
and they're like a book what is that
what is that sure and they go what
format would you like the book on okay
right so they so he said we kind of
predicted like people would have either
like an e-ink sort of thing or maybe
super super micro paper like the USA
Today right like that kind of thing sure
so that was cool he's like yeah we kind
of thought like oh all books would be
able to change by themselves which is
what a kindle and did they say the
reason they changes because old young
biff would freak out upon seeing that so
there's that and also because that
wouldn't roll up nicely into a pocket
like that that was a big part of our
narrative towards the end of the film
were like the books contract moving
around and you know it's got to be
rolled up here um yeah he he told me
like he saw really interesting um things
when they
like when they first got to the set when
alan silvestri first got to the set he
saw the enchantment under the sea dance
and was like I need you to score this
and he's like how I do that yeah and you
know he just he just said he's like he
was so overwhelmed what they were doing
he had no idea how he was going to
somehow shrink this down into like an
orchestral preparation yeah and I
thought that was really interesting we
asked them if they would if they were
asked to be involved in a remake what
they say and they were like AB sorry
very against it from what I hear ya
absolutely not yeah which I thought was
it's great and Zemeckis feels the same
way like he doesn't want yet ever he
thinks like this needs to stay yeah pure
um we asked them about why the time
machine goes back oh when it gets hit by
lightning tip I light yeah we asked them
why didn't they just all when Marty goes
back to 1885 why didn't they just find
the time machine that he that doc went
back right Justin siphon the gas out of
that and how much of this is like them
being like yeah you know no like they
had answered like great question and
then then as I'm walking out I go I go
hey I'm like what are the paradoxes that
you love the most like what are the what
are the ones that like no one ever asks
you but you've got in your back pocket
and he said he said two things 1i know
for sure he said nobody ever asks about
the photograph he said the photograph
that Marty has of himself in his sibling
and he is disappearing from yeah that
photograph itself yeah not the not the
subject material in the photograph but
the photograph itself is really the
thing that should have been disappearing
yeah I ever mention a good point no one
ever mentions that sure so I was like oh
that's pretty rad and then there was one
more thing that was like kind of funny
uh in the very first scene when the time
machines debuted back to future one yeah
doc comes out like rolls the DeLorean
out of the truck yeah doesn't explain
like there's none of room in that truck
for the doors who have open and doc to
have gotten in and he's like no other
real wait hold on it's what he said
that's okay but it doesn't matter
because he's got a remote control he
could just drive it and no but he's in
it so he could use the remote control
from inside the car no
no how does he go I see we means not a
room for the doors to go into open and
there's no moon roof for anything how's
he get in as you know I had a personal
back the future moment on my birthday
which was last week where my fiance
surprised me with tickets to go to a
radio city to see the live performance
in rockdale and announce a vestry were
both airs along with Christopher Lloyd
and while watching it the one thing that
stood out to me is you're doing this
precise experimentation with Einstein
your dog and the time difference when he
travels through time has them and he
doesn't have a second hand on his
goddamn stopwatch and he said he said
you're exactly right but for the but Bob
and I and he says Bob Zemeckis chair the
Bob and I thought a more visually
aesthetic pleasing thing short was the
digital time it is more consistent and I
you know I get that aspect but not very
scientific I could have gone I for hours
you guys totally and I you know the
whole time I what made me so happy was
how happy they were yeah and how down to
earth they came across totally and and
yeah it was it was a blast man it was a
lot of fun uh so if you want to check
out the two videos we did I'll link to
that in the show notes I think with that
we can safely put back to the future
month behind us even though a week from
today it'll still be october i think
it's fair for us to close the book on uh
yeah i'll go back to the future neighbor
says I don't think anyone's gonna get
excited well I mean we're not gonna hit
the back to the future three I'm travel
dating you know I've soon unless things
loop around yeah so and I kind of sit
down like dude you know you like i said
to him like you indirectly and we talked
about this last week like directly shape
the future yeah right so I'm like what's
gonna happen in 2045 like what would
happen to share more angels the future
again right do that again so he goes by
the USA Today that came out yesterday
yeah which is like the replica sure
because they interview Bob Gale and they
say what's gonna happen in 30 years from
now yeah so go check that out but you
don't know who he goes use and then
before I said before you're saying
goodbye and everyone's like hugging each
other
like this I'm like this is great this is
great he goes unlike thanks I'm like
thanks for you know being you and is
like thanks for helping pay for my house
seriously I present la you need any
other help let me know he's hysterical
totally fun hundred percent very cool
well so there you have I'm happy for you
Jeff you know what is killing me what I
and I'm and I'm I just need to say this
Joe me so crazy I didn't get anything
like signed by them did you get a photo
with them yeah I've got plenty so
whatever and I guess I think videos too
yeah so what are you gonna do with the
signature I don't know I Jamie cool like
fee but I Great Scott or something I
don't know I get weird what a great job
Scott you do it anyway alright closing
the book on that stuff good stuff uh
thanks for bearing with me while I geek
out a little bit on back to future stuff
all right let's move along um this week
not just back to feature week other
things happened yeah including guess
what it's about time fossil it is
realized a good segue classic classic
watch company yep well they're gonna dip
their their hand in the pond of
smartwatches yeah yeah how do you feel
about this because so what I smartwatch
thing has not like I've seen tons of
them I've worn a bunch of them still
have not been convinced of any necessity
remotely close to that I don't like them
you don't like them in general I don't
like him in general I've worn an Apple
watch I don't like the Apple watch I've
worn other Android wear watches I don't
like them at all yeah but you know
that's I don't know none there's hasn't
been a lot of established watch brands
that have entered the arena sure there
are you would argue that like Apple
hired a bunch of watch people sure but I
happen to like fossil watches other nice
um I'm curious to see how this is going
to play because it's a different kind of
ID I guess they're going like a
different angle on the Android wear
thing they're circular watches are going
to be called the fossil queue line and
they're going to start at 125 dollars
which is cheap which for a android wear
our watches is on the cheaper side so
you know again like my whole thing is I
need a watch that's always on I hate
have like right shake a wrister totally
like that but you know I'll give a
fossil watch a look I'm not I'm not one
of these people be like oh they're
finally making a SmartWatch sign me up
I'm pre ordering now ya know I want to
see just how they implement it this is a
no-brainer for them they're an
established watch brand they've got to
get into this sure yeah I just it's been
tough to convince people that there's a
market yeah and Apple watch obviously
had its day in the Sun and then a lot of
people sort of either forgot they had it
or didn't want to wear theirs anymore or
whatever and they you know it's still
kind of troubling so I still think it's
in this period where it's like is this
the equivalent of 3d TVs still kind of
it works like all these companies came
forward and they were like this is the
future this is what's up you need this
thing see I don't say I think the
problem with 3d TVs is that there was
nowhere to go like a cure mount and that
was it yeah had to wear the glasses yeah
you know they were it wasn't evolving
into like Oh a glasses-free 3d to you
know I know those exist I don't know I
think the next step the step that would
get me more engaged is like you don't
have to walk around with your iphone
anymore everything's on the line right
once it's an independently you know
usable thing outside of the phone
tethering yeah i'll check that out yeah
um okay i'm going to talk a little bit
about YouTube and YouTube red so earlier
this week YouTube came out with a
subscription service ten dollars a month
it's going to get rid of all the ads you
see on youtube super smart very smart
idea because what they did was and like
take a step back so what they did was
they were like all right at you've been
dealing with ads on YouTube for a while
yeah then they entered in your and you
hate them then they introduced that skip
ahead button which is like oh I can
handle five seconds here now they're
like hey you want to get rid of it all
together fork over ten dollars a month
which I would imagine is like would be a
gigantic boom in revenue well here's the
benefit for them there's a few things
one obviously is dedicated youtube
people that will buy it and be happy to
it gets them less reliant on external
appetizers they're getting money
directly in the way that Netflix and
Amazon does right and it puts all the
control in their hands which is
obviously one of the issues that people
were you know youtubers have right now
is if you're like a hardcore streamer or
whatever and you're on YouTube you have
let's say five million subscribers on
YouTube you are so beholden to certain
switches at Google right whether they
promote your stuff or whether it gets
bubble to the top or whatever um and you
have no leverage whatsoever so any
change that they make they're just gonna
do and you're gonna be like to adopt
right because it's like yep it's
essentially like you have this big
investment lets you invested a million
dollars into one company and you can't
take it out right so the money might
grow and you might make money off of it
but you can't move it to another it's
not like you can move it to twitch and
be fine so so figure I think yeah I'm
sorry go ahead we're gonna I was gonna
say I think it's smart for google I
think it's a drag for youtubers but
youtubers need to have known this is
probably going to happen is that they're
gonna be taken out of the equation when
it comes to making these choices and
YouTube you know the internet moves at a
very rapid pace and it evolves at a very
quick pace it's nothing gold can stay
right so you know what what's a what is
that nothing gold can stay is that a
thing yeah it's a I don't know why idiom
it's an idiom it's it's it's a new it
was in this new found glory record but
it really means like nothing lasts
forever sure but nothing gold can stay
it's everything okay you know never
heard it's from a movie I think okay
right I'm gonna I'm standing here
tonight I'm standing by that go for it
new new news comes out that youtube not
only like is forcing people to fall in
line with this yeah but they're saying
they're gonna completely remove videos
of creators who I don't sign the deal
will not remove them but hide them which
is effectively the same thing right who
don't sign up with red yeah don't or
unwilling to accept that right I mean
that's kind of messed up it's messed up
but again although average in the world
with it really yeah we're just hosting
your content and and you have to
consider like so of course they would be
hidden because if someone's paying for
no ads on YouTube and one guy is like no
I want and I want them to see ads like
what do you do with that piece of
content right you can't show it to the
person that just paid for no ads they're
gonna be pissed exactly and then YouTube
you know who is holding all the cards
could be like all right well you know
you uh you're just not gonna stream here
anymore put your content up somewhere
else and what you're really seeing the
parallel is Spotify essentially because
with Spotify you know the the owners of
the content get a very small percentage
and you know they don't have a lot of
options unless you're like Taylor Swift
you're like no I'm gonna take all my
songs off here so you know it's it's
tough but again the person the company
that owns the network that owns this
organization that you've decided to
become part of has all the control in
the world and you could stamp your feet
and be angry and be upset but they're
gonna do what's gonna be best for their
company they have shared with
shareholders and it's kind of cold and
heartless but and yeah I guess that's
all you got to do is sort of like shrug
your shoulders I don't think there's a
better like do you think there's a
better way that Google /youtube could
have presented this change to its
content creators like YouTube not gonna
live or die if PewDiePie goes short so
but but there is a general conception of
like YouTube being the destination for
this sort of content and what you don't
want is like 50 of your top creators
being pissed off enough and like go to
Vienna to go to vimeo that would be
there dangerous concern that i mean i'd
be curious does this go into like the
rev share like what the difference in
money they would make I guess it varies
depending on like how many videos people
are watching it seems like it would very
pretty dramatically it's going to change
a little bit you know and I would say my
guess is that for the top streamers
they're probably working on individual
deals yeah I'm sure they have individual
deals um one of the one of the chief
business officer at YouTube Robert I
can't pronounce names what no sense
mecca's kinsel I'm going to
okay says that YouTube will pay out the
vast vast majority of revenue to
creators but he repeatedly refused to
detail what exactly that percentage
would be a subscription music services
like Spotify payouts seventy percent
Apple music pays out 71.5 percent oh
thanks for that is representing a half
after earlier this year changed to the
YouTube partner program terms so that
creators would just be paid fifty five
percent of revenue that is comparatively
speaking that's pretty low yeah I don't
know you know YouTube's got a lot of
leverage that's a thing like YouTube say
what you will about YouTube but it's the
best player on the internet yeah it's
the best infrastructure on the internet
in terms of video searching uh they're
holding all the cards man like I'm not
saying you know you need to embrace that
and bow down to it yeah but until
something better comes along I mean
YouTube is so ingrained into the fabric
of the Internet yeah there's a
conference coming to New York pretty
shortly it's like VidCon or stream con
or something like that I forget the name
of it and I got a press release email
and there's a bunch of names on it like
come to a signing pay $65 to meet and
greet blah blah blah and it was
literally a list of names of people I
had never in my life heard of and it may
be because they're not for us super old
and I totally get that but what I did
was I was like let me check these people
out so I went and I like paste the links
and like went to their pages and what I
found was I've always been a been
amazing production value they were not
badly produced stuff but what I found
was that I was surprised I've always
been on the impression that if you you
were big youtuber and you got in early
and you have like let's say a million
subscribers that's something you can
bank on like you're always gonna get
tons of views on your stuff because you
have all these subscribers this is
circling right so what I found was there
was a woman that had been producing
videos for about five years she had a
bet a million subscribers and I was
looking at her view numbers and the view
numbers about four years ago were like
half a million seventy five hundred
thousand stuff like that seventy percent
whatever 750,000 thank you and then you
sleep
see this tail off where she's and the
last week it was like 5k 10k stuff like
that and she still has those subscribers
but like what happened in the algorithm
that was not causing her to stay on top
so when you I think a lot of people get
this misconception that people can sound
of ride this train to the bank and
guarantee like oh I have a career for
life now you have it's a day it's a
castle constant hustle yeah and its
social media promotion and its
production of the videos and it's all
sorts of stuff and for someone that like
was so well viewed and then like kind of
fell off that's a tough pill to swallow
it's it's really tough and I wonder it
all it does is like make me think about
the future we're like is it just gonna
be like this for a while like are we
just gonna have these flavor of the week
YouTube people who maybe make 200 grand
in one year and they're like shit I
could do this for the rest of my life
but then the next month they only make
like 600 bucks like I don't think it's a
month a month but I think over the
course of radiation someone I feel like
her I don't know man if you is there's I
think there's always going to be people
that are sort of perennial the like
Howard Stern equivalent that become like
constantly watched like even PewDiePie I
think will be around for many many years
but like that's one guy I know no you're
right wonder why there are a few that I
think like have have been around for six
years and they've only grown and
increased in quality and stuff like that
but yeah I mean you can't rely on these
fan bases because let's say your content
is designed for 10 year olds or 12 year
olds or whatever they get old it doesn't
apply to them anymore it's the MTV
problem MTV's always had that problem of
like holding onto people same deal and
now you're only a dude you're not like
an entire company trying to fix this
problem and producing new content you're
just this guy tell me if you've ever
heard okay of any of the top 15 most
popular youtubers in the world ok I'm
going to say unlikely but go down the

TV if you have 10 million people tuned
in that's like a good that's great like
a monster that that's like way better
than like probably any mad men is like
the tops episode of Mad Men I think got
three million peering in okay so like
you're in serious company yeah number 15

what's crazy about it says like games
and number one is PewDiePie look out I
don't again i'm not i'm not being i'm
not gonna be this like you know her much
shaking my fist at the computer I'd like
I feel old but I totally acknowledge
that that thing where things are and
it's not like I don't get it I get it I
understand what's happened there are
youtubers that I like I'm a big fan of
donkey I don't know if you've heard of
Dunkey I don't know that does a video
game streaming it's the one of the very
few youtubers I can watch and I watch
like the informational stuff like planet
destiny does a very good job so I like
watch this some of this stuff but
they'll like cult of personality thing
where people are like literally there
were people paying a hundred dollars to
get a signature from a youtuber is just
like bonkers crazy to me and and they
make otoño they can make hundreds of
thousand dollars in a day it's doing one
of these signings so ahhh it's crazy
yeah i mean look when your audience is
planet Earth yep instead of like you
know yeah a small town in Iowa things
change but it's great it's all good it's
all good because we're we're traveling
at the speed of light towards something
great right we're all we're all on this
on this voyage together unless it's like
it vet horizon yeah where the end is
nothing yeah and samuel turns it to the
devil maybe I don't know we're hurtling
towards something right now we're gonna
hurtle towards a goddamn commercial
though right because you got to pay the
bill Sam you guys were on this
antiquated medium we're not youtubing
we're not casting uh-huh can we get
money from people and we'll just stop
doing commercial yeah if you guys just
want to send us money yeah that'd be
right send to the 404
show care of scenic huh-uh we'll be back
right after this stay tuned my friend
Russ fresh dick we uh we talk a lot
about softlayer and clouds we do all the
time they're a staple of the show by now
they really are if you want a cloud
built for transparency I think clouds
are already built for transparency but I
think your meaning technical clouds your
tea they're not built God builds that
good point you want ones that IBM build
yes for your company because your
demands are unique and you need to have
a private and secure cloud
infrastructure guess what we got guys
for that they're called softlayer
software's an IBM company in fact iBM
yeah you've heard of IBM they use
softlayer as their cloud infrastructure
for any kind of cloud stuff IBM does
they they hit up softlayer for our
listeners right now you can get five
hundred dollars off cloud infrastructure
by visiting softlayer calm / podcast get
five hundred dollars off anything you
want that they offer metal servers
virtual servers storage networking any
kind of security service all that five
hundred dollars off visit softlayer calm
/ podcast sign up today hey welcome back
to the 404 show if freaky freaks me out
man yeah it's I don't know I guess a bit
of a part of me is a little jealous a
little bit yeah because when we were
that fuck kind of like you know
wheelhouse age to do this the internet
was shit yeah but you have to consider
like if you we were ten years older then
we'd like really be out of position do
you like the Webster's release were like
vaguely kind of knowledgeable about how
to do this stuff you know we I maintain
we have a very interesting generational
weight position we're definitely on the
straddling the to the British stragglers
man grew up with nothing no internet I
me not nothing but nothing really
digital right until you know CDs yeah I
guess alright was digital before your
watch yeah my watch is pretty much go
back down you
yeah unbelievable all right we're
shifting gears a little bit this is a
funny story coming from Russ about being
a medieval bell ringer yet so what what
I didn't realize and I found this story
it was a highlighted today I learned on
reddit's new content site upvoted calm
which pretty cool content site and
apparently one of the being a bell
ringer like the gentleman that rings the
bell at the top of a church during the
Middle Ages was one of the worst jobs in
history I can you do you have any idea
why I would imagine they didn't have a
great way for you to get up there I mean
you're probably right like I would
imagine like this it was like a rickety
s like a like a Batman stairs yeah
almost really like shit I really should
have been like the donation collector
sure I'm pretty sure at that point
everyone said sort of accepted the fact
that stairs were pretty much the only
object again I I get was like you know I
wish there was like an elevator wait
that has a minim veniam one comes
another you just has an ear you just
have to like repel up to this uh bell
tower yeah is that you call repel up is
that the right word I think repel use
just come down to him up just climb
we're just gonna use climb yeah we'll go
with client you just gotta move up that
um no good guess though so what year we
talk so we're talking Middle Ages I
guess this is like 1200 come around
there okay I just think life must have
been so funny at nine hundred years ago
but it's also like it went for a while
so so the big issue at hand which seems
kind of obvious is that a lot of these
bell ringers were getting struck by
lightning like it was a very common
really was a span of about 20 years
where 120 bell ringers got struck by
lightning and killed oh my god and why
is because bells for a very long time
were advertised as being a prevention of
lightning when you rang the bell it
would prevent lightning strike oh my
gosh they would go up during storm you
dumbasses the stop to stop the lightning
god yeah
even in the 12 hundreds if that's the
right man was sorry so we're looking the
the 121 bell ringers killed between 1750
and 1780 okay that's way too recent
that's way too reason for the Darwin of
what this is all so Darwin but that's
also the same errors like Ben Franklin
with his key experiment okay guess what
founder found a pattern here right I
still don't understand that key
experiment do you have any just like any
assessment is that a true thing I before
night with a key on it no I need to drop
the key and what happened because I can
read it metal conducts electricity no
did the key turn red and that's how you
knew no I think the how would you get
the key down no because the key maybe he
was like the key there cut the lightning
only struck the kite when there was a
key there and not when he was a baby
he's I oh shit I should power the world
with that right yeah when I got to that
stage yet but yeah and then Edison
killed an elephant dude he was such a
bastard a big dick oh my god hidden
Steve Jobs like you know biggest dicks
in technological history and and great
marketers and knew how to shut down
competition yeah I snuffin him out right
by breaking their ankles damn in the
Hudson yeah not to their murders of
humans yeah so just so people are aware
if you happen to work in a church or
near church and it's during a lightning
storm don't ring the bell and don't play
golf during a lightning storm either
what if you were golfing was like a like
like wooden clubs I realize woods are
not made of wood but like if you just
had wooden clubs would be fine right I
guess if you're in a feel that's not I
made the point is that you don't want to
be the highest point in a field it was
very usually golf courses are flat yeah
or not flat but there's not a lot of try
at a very intense moment I was in summer
camp I was about 11 years old and I was
windsurfing and a storm a lightning
storm I was in the middle of the lake so
when serving on this lake a lightning
storm comes out of nowhere like just it
shows up 02 lightning storm in five
minutes yeah no joke that could happen
and I'm like I've got this metal pole
I'm dead I'm dead like unlike water do I
paddle do I stick my arms in the waters
do I liked below would you do I
paddle my way back in you like jumped
off the sailboat well no I couldn't I
didn't want to get in the water because
the water would get much out of an
entire Lake gets electric you don't know
I didn't know I still don't know any of
the sediments probably defuse it I think
if it's clear like pool water you get
our ticket yet dead because I'd like
this own contained right there's nothing
in a like in the lake it gets absorbed
by ice theologians others things but it
was very scary for me that is scary man
I'm trying to think of the scariest
lightning storm situation that I've ever
been in a lot of the weird storms that I
remember from my childhood our camp
related I guess is the summer times then
you're outside way more yeah yeah I've
never seen lightning strike anything
though really yeah i don't think i have
you saw yeah okay you've seen in the
distance i say i've seen lightning hit
like gargoyles in the city example
gargle just sits there like what's up
I'm bring it on bring it did literally
did nothing can take that all day made a
dope spark it made a dip spark yeah uh
all right we're gonna pivot into a story
about um tough tough times working at
Google I mean it's nice to work at
Google the problem is you can't work
there all the time when you want to
sleep you need another option so here so
like I I read this story it's not a long
one um and I and I guess I don't
understand it i guess i understand it
but I at the same time I'm confused by
some of the elements to it it's about a
23 year old named brandon who moved from
Massachusetts to the bay area back in
May to start working as a software
engineer at Google he tried to find a
place in San Francisco to live but it
was too freaking expensive San Francisco
does have higher real estate renting
prices than Manhattan for the record uh
so he's like screw this i'm not gonna
live in an apartment I'm gonna actually
just get a truck yeah I'm gonna live in
the truck and I'm actually going to put
it in the lot the parking lot of Google
and that's what we've been doing he
moved into 128 square foot truck and
he's just sort of been like doing that
for a while yeah
it's kind of crazy yeah well you'd the
like Google the fact that google allows
you know has free food and I think they
have showers and stuff like that allows
for this sort of living any like most
normal companies you could not do this
because you'd come to work and you'd be
like hey where's my breakfast or where's
my place to shower and they wouldn't
have that option but because all these
tech companies are so filled with men at
ease because they want people to stay at
work and you know not head out all these
people aight this is not the only story
we've seen there's been dozens of them
of people living in cars cuz like that's
the idea you're at work let's say until
eight o'clock at night you go sleep in
your van until seven and then you go to
work and take a shower and you're
working again it's still a very sad
existence who's working at Google the
Ford the 2006 for truck that he bought
and this is like a box truck yeah it's
like a moving van it's like a it's like
a Penske sort of situations at the right
Penske Penske uh the truck Austin 10
grand had 150 7,000 miles on it it cost
him an even 10 grand which he paid
upfront when he got his signing bonus
you people don't get signing bonuses you
get a signing bonus and you just pay it
towards your your car van right there
your truck house that you're living in
he projected that he was gonna break
even on October 21st and apparently he
did he's got a site up called thoughts
from inside the box he's got one fixed
cost that's truck insurance which pays
121 dollars a month for he doesn't use
electricity and his phone bill gets
handled by Google yet but he lives in a
freakin box truck yeah he's not meeting
anyone that way hey where can we go back
to your place sure writing for the best
buy egg we go back to we go oh let's
just give me man I gotta drive it over
here someone actually did some math and
figured out you could commute from las
vegas to san francisco and still have it
be cheaper than living than living in
san francisco i believe it it's I mean
it's bad I'm going on there
happy so the issue a lot of the issue is
that there's so much speculation terms
the value of the land that I think they
increase their evictions by like ten
percent over the last year and you have
companies like Airbnb which I use a lot
they're good companies but the flip side
of that is like all these people that
would ordinarily be like I need to find
a renter for this place you don't
necessarily need that you can just say
hey I'm going to you know put it on
Airbnb make some money so you have all
these single units that are just sort of
empty and there's no place for people to
move in the demand to sky high so you're
paying 35 hundred dollars a month for a
one-bedroom in downtown San Francisco
which is outrageous like it's nowhere
near that New York like it's expensive
in New York don't get me wrong but it's
probably twenty percent less than that
it's just I don't know I I mean I just
feel like this guy shouldn't have to do
this yeah I I know Google like set up
some sort of like a dormitory situation
no I wasn't aware that uh where they are
doing something III thought they were
they were figuring out a way to like get
people to live there reasonably without
hers there's an easy saw when Japan came
up with it it's called capsule hotels
just live in a tube and that is a sign
that is a sad thing I've done yeah those
are like coffins they are but is that
sadder than living in a van I don't know
now I'd rather live in a van than a
coffin then a tube I'd rather live in a
van down by the river I think it's a
little more social to live in the tube
community I probably have like dicom you
know I guess they rank and yeah to every
night's tube night can you hook up with
people that are only like adjacent to
your tube yeah exactly only fit in your
tube oh yes so like how we get
claustrophobic with that it's weird but
they have little TVs built in mugs for
stuff yeah because we're just sardines
pack us in yeah we're human being would
probably be more expensive than 121
dollars a month though yeah so it will
be all right I want to switch gears one
last time to a thing that people always
ask me about and I don't I never have an
educated answer until now
about vampire power uh basically the
question is should you leave your plum
like turning into a bat turning into
mist sorry yes go ahead the question is
should you unplug your chargers when
you're not using me okay I a hundred
percent never do no one does but how the
geek did and they measured it and they
figured out a way to figure out how much
electricity sure vampire power is
actually using and costing okay so they
did a lot of testing by taking this
kilowatt measuring device so that
basically bypasses stands in between
your charger and the outlet yeah you
plug it in and the thing can see how
much power is being pulled share so they
plugged in a charger by itself and the
the register didn't go above zero point
zero wat something means it's negligible
right it's not even worth looking at
right so then they finally like well
damn we got to get this thing to
register something so they plugged an
entire surge protector into it ok and
then filled every slot in the surge
protector with a phone charger okay and
only then did they get the thing to
register and it finally showed 0.3 wats
now I don't know if you are aware of how
much a wat Kost now but when you equate
so let's say you had this point 3 watts
which again is 6 chargers yeah unplugged
into the surge protector which goes into
the outlet yeah is drawing with no
charging involved is drawing 0.3 wats ya
any given time ok assume let's assume
that you keep those six chargers plugged
in for 24 hours a day 7 days a week for
an entire year yeah that's eighty seven
hundred and sixty hours the entire year
and that equals to two point six to
eight kilowatt hours which is Kate
wh-which is there that what the which
shows up on your electric bill yeah okay
that would cost you on average in the US
about 34 sensing huh that's particular
that's great so I don't know like I feel
like oh there you go that's solved but I
feel like there's this whole
controversy over vampire because people
didn't know the true answer even if you
live in Hawaii right the most expensive
yeah we live in Hawaii where we're a
kilowatt-hour costs thirty cents per
kilowatt hour versus what versus the
average in the US which is about 13 Wow
significantly more yeah even if you need
that it's 79 stands for the year yeah
the year now I don't that's great I'm
very happy this cuz I have tons of bugs
in my apartment that I don't you that I
might you cushion I wanna know is is it
a fire hazard aight well i'm sure it is
a fire hazard but that not was saying
well first of all I want to know now
they'd be more fire how does it know to
start sending the power what's telling
it you're serious I'm dead serious I
don't know how electricity works no you
think it's just like little microchips I
have no idea how it knows the start
sending power no idea I'm an idiot
correlates well no cuz there's not
really like an answer because it doesn't
wait now follow question those surge
protectors that have little lights on
them to indicate that they're plugged in
does that increase the chart the amount
apparently by a micro amount yeah well
they were they using those though this
the surge they have in the thing does
not like a light okay understand that
and maybe that's what's drawing the
point 3 watts yeah I a I know that might
be a topic for another show is expelling
me how electricity works only a certain
amount of power can run through now I'm
aware right so why they have converters
raced I mean the power and the elect and
the products you plug in yeah are
limited to how much power they can suck
chair it's just the metal touching the
metal that conducts the electricity so
the product itself it has it is whatever
pro got a built-in limit limiter ok I
understand because if you use the wrong
wattage on a thing you share blow a
circuit sure okay it's not much more
complicated okay now the other question
I have and this I think is a more
significant worry for people where does
the Sun go it no I was gonna say sleep
mode for your devices so like sleep like
your you put your computer to sleep or
you put your ps4 draws less power but
still significant amounts of like a lot
more than what it shows bear I don't
know how much but address / I know that
the Earthies have
and very concerned about that they're
they're not happy with sleep mode now so
like I mean ma I would imagine my you've
been to my house you've seen like out
I've got a bunch of consoles plugged in
you might as well have a smoke snack
came out as your soo is burning coal
it's uh it's it's significant I'm sure
yeah I don't want to know my bill my
bill is more than I would like to pay
but it's not astronaut oh yeah sure so
okay until I hit like five hundred bucks
a month I'm cool yeah I'm not doing that
coned man is connor even like the thing
still yeah it's big how do you get power
what do you pay uh oh pse and jeering
cuz your jersey huh net is like New York
it's just not yeah all right and it is
everywhere yeah man Tesla baby we miss
you one love one love all right we're
gonna get to the product hunt game of
the week and then say goodbye to you
fine people uh so the game of the week
on product hunt calm / games is it's
called emily is away and where'd she go
that's a good question it's a short game
and Jeff I think what you might
appreciate this this goes back to us
talking about our early days of the
internet it's a recruit it's an
interactive fiction story it's all set
in an IM message box that looks like
it's like mid 90s like windows 95 I am
message how is this not a copyright
infringement cuz it's like parody it
doesn't say like eight AOL but you know
it lose uses some of the icon best are
the buddy icons yeah there's like a
blink 182 buddy icon oh yeah it's
fantastic it's like super accurate for
the time and it's like it's just a
really clever kind of throwback
interactive fiction thing so what is it
it's just a simulator with a robot yeah
essentially there's an AI person it's
not like there's someone hired to do
this day in day out it's cool there
should be but it's cool check it out
emily is away is it free um I think it
because I just it is free yeah yeah I
think its name your own price right so
if you're you're a jerk um you could pay
nothing oh just give them a dollar him a
dollar you know I mean look do I think
you should pay a lot more than a dollar
for an IM simulator from the
90s probably not no you know you can pay
your AOL a monthly fee you want to do
that authentic it's pretty cool I think
one of the reviews of emily is away
comes from Rock Paper Shotgun Susannah
from Joe Donnelly emily is away does a
fine job of transporting me back to a
time in my life I had mostly forgotten
about it's pretty cool good for emily's
away man long live the AI am away
message ya love ya mo suppose you did
you deep custom blows look like why my
were always lyrics no I I think mine for
a very long time was my yearbook quote
from high school which they artificially
truncated much to my chagrin they
censored mine they censored mine too not
truncated they censored effectively they
censored mine they said good night as
they thought it was too aggressive okay
what was yours mine was a George Carlin
quote that said if you can't beat them
ya arrange to have them beaten that's
funny and they're like now doing it you
can't do that okay mine was even worse
than that yours was go F yourself San

exactly um spring crisis like have you
thought about cricket they have really
good coverage that was cricket this oh
don't forget watch it isn't like a
budget I think yeah I've seen
commercials for it I feel like they're
like the best buy brand mobile phone
I've seen commercials I don't know but
it does i think it's the cheaper option
so I'm glad that they have coverage but
yeah I've never looked into them no
family law says please cover more tech
topics dude I think we do if we hit up a
lot of tectonic lada and especially this
month with the microsoft event we did
two egos talk about the servers in the
macbook pro in the chrome yeah man we
talked about that solid enough you gotta
pay more attention I know you're just
like taken in by the sound of our voices
but we're hitting it got peddling on
listen right um is HTC's a nine the last
phone from HTC before they go belly-up
and you have a problem with them copying
Apple so closely I don't care I just
don't care the eighth I know the MA
people love that phone you know talk
about the HTC m8 no I'm nurse you know
that funds now I don't know that fun I
have seen that a nine it looks great it
looks great I mean it does look like an
iPhone
but yeah whatever I don't know who cares
uh hey Jeff your wife as a small chance
to run into another Morticia on
Halloween because it was ranked in a
hundred and fifty at the moment and
realize their ranking there's a ranking
where their ranking its fright Geist dot
with google.com conjure up Halloween's
most popular costumes and then like rank
them so you can see like what's trending
um nationally geo you hover over this
interactive map and you can see what the
most popular caucus are star stuff so
superhero is the most trending wait
that's not I'm not specific enough I
know but it goes in and then it goes to
Harley Quinn gotta go uh Batman Star
Wars and then Wonder Woman Harley Quinn
that's a bold you really have to lean
into Harley Quentin can't just kids do
pigtails now I mean you know can't you
pick kids on a mallet no you gotta go on
so this is practically a really cool
interactive site it's called fright guys
dot with google com link then the show
notes as well thank you guy from
Trinidad for sharing that with us we
appreciate it let's see what else we got
here in the subreddit do we have
anything else in there subreddit we do
this comes from chibi conga raga ok
Maggie so what do you think of the new
Star Wars trailer uh huh I didn't I
didn't watch it oh cuz you're I've
decided to stop I'm sorry I've just that
lies I'm sorry does a part of me for
Star Wars does kind of want to be part
of the zeitgeist of like enthusiasm
what's going on and I am very excited
about the new Star Wars movie are you
yes I actually am but I've gotten to the
point where my memory is so weird about
remembering things in the trailer that I
just sit through the whole movie waiting
for like yeah yeah moment to happen I
just can't I wit I'd like wish I could
turn that part of my brain off and I
know I'm gonna see it and I have like a
hook up to see it on opening night so
that's great but yeah I don't I'm done
watching the trailers like I'm done
you are the worst really maine is very
clown heavy by the way in fact regarding
the costumes in that little interactive
map lots of islands so alright so i
guess i can't even talk about it then
because I mean I don't know Caillou no
kylo Ren you know that I yeah I know who
you know was playing it yes so I didn't
know Adam driver was playing him ok but
I did know because i think that kylo
Ren's mess yeah looks a little like Adam
driver's face I think it's more is that
awful to say is you know you think it
looks like his face but I think his body
is like he's very live like jack
skellington body yes it does definitely
I mean I think Adam driver is great it's
a great I love him very good I've
Natalie do enjoy here's what I would say
I've never seen him play like a grounded
role like he's always a very
over-the-top kind of character no enough
well he's barely in that inside llewyn
davis oh yeah barely in that yeah but um
but he's a very talented actor doesn't
clearly like he's got a lot of range on
girls like he yeah but it's always like
a very intense performance like there's
no like casual moment with him which is
fine like that's why he said successful
right let's just do one thing so you
know he's the bad guy yeah you know that
do you think he survives his movie
that's a good question um I think he's
gotta I think he does I think he's too
cool of a well oh but you could argue
that about Darth Maul as well no it's
much pretty bad but here's the thing
here's the reason I say yes is you need
a villain to extend through all three
movies there needs to be consistency
there you can't have just like Dayton
you know zombie the week situation sure
and you know unless they bring like a
blue goes to the Emperor back which
would be pretty lame like you need a new
villain and he looks pretty bad as his
villain so by killing him off I don't
know for all I know he in the trailer
there's a blue goes the Emperor floating
around shooting lightning up your phone
what do you think where do they get
these names it does seem like an name
generator it's a perfect star war yep
is a very good it's cool not Darth Vader
you're not excited all for the movie I
am did you get more excited after
watching this new truck it's a good
trailer yeah that's good like so keep my
thing is like I think I'm gonna like
then the seven eight nine more than one
through six okay well no one likes
really shit share four through six I
think I said it doesn't this is my guess
I think seven is gonna be really really
good I I just don't see anything like I
feel like it this is what the star wars
that everybody wants so I think seven is
gonna be really good the problem is JJ
Abrams is not directing eight he's not
know I was think he's only I forget that
guy's name zack snyder that's act but
that's the issue at ratner he's not I'm
pretty sure he's not directing eight
that's down to me and uh why well let's
say for argument's sake let's say he is
directing ate it doesn't matter because
my feeling on JJ Abrams is that he's
amazingly good at rebooting and starting
something fresh but continuing with it
not so good if you look at like Star
Trek to search or tues not bad it's not
bad but it's not great it's pretty
middling it's underwhelming compared to
the first but I think it's still solid
and it's good man man that first starts
you're so good yeah the first Star Trek
is amazing so I and I think that's the
issue his expectation is gonna be so
high for the second one yeah the other
issue is that i think that this spin-off
movies are really gonna be like I'm
worried about the quality they're like
whether you're you can maintain that
stuff because it's like you know it all
ties it like you can't you want to say
it's like Avengers where it's like you
have all these separate stories and they
all come together but it's not it's not
that it's like like one of them is going
to be set in olden times with young Boba
Fett and one of them is going to be here
one of them's gonna be there so they are
separate stories and it's hard to
imagine that the like quality would be
maintained so I very high hopes for the
first one and like cautious optimism
beyond that okay
I can handle that will sink ah very good
sir thanks for the chat about that at
the end I'm glad you didn't go
completely cold on me Star Wars no I can
talk about it I just don't I don't wanna
just watch the trailer stop being such a
loser I'm a baby I know just watch it
