to the cnet mailbag the show where I
give up on trying to answer serious
questions because the crazy mail just
keeps pouring in this week I'm
dedicating the show to the most
hilarious most baffling and most
fantastic email that I have gotten in
the past week let's begin with fanboy
mail sometimes I just get these random
declarations of love for unexpected
things like el caso chick who writes the
Chevy Volts going to own up all those
stupid hybrids from Toyota and Honda
sneer GM FTW that's a proud American
right there and then there's this one
from anonymous who just says microsoft
is the best i kind of feel like a robot
wrote that all right now a lot of your
crazy mail comes in as requests requests
that i can never ever fulfill jkl b-29
for example rights I want taco Vanar to
says please please more of the
remarkable Dwight Yoakam and sake Jacob
reports want to know the sample dot okay
I can't actually tell if that's a
request or like an answer because maybe
dot okay is the sample or something the
next category of crazy mail we get is
the tech support questions now our
engineers then the cnet TV product
manager do monitor the feedback and they
try to get back to people who are having
problems but sometimes the problems fix
themselves like when CJ 22 emailed and
said your cnet TV won't come on all the
info comes on the side but no video but
then a few minutes later we got this hi
just called back to let you know I was
downloading from the web and that was
the problem sorry about that glad it
worked out thanks for calling or Andrew
who sent these three messages in quick
succession first there was what about
the speed how fast can it go does it
need two or one gigabyte of RAM can you
use 512 megabyte of RAM then how much is
it going to cost and finally when does
it go to be coming out to buy
what dude what and then finally my
favorite category of all the mysterious
missives from abroad ok i swear i am not
making fun of your english only the fact
that you sent these particular emails to
me here at seen a TV like Augustina from
Argentina who writes hello sorry but I'm
looking for someone who calls
Constantine Isaac from Germany actually
he's Russian the thing is that i'm
looking for him by any place on earth
and i found this site but i don't know
if he is part of it or what so if he
will let me know if not let me know it
too because i don't know how keep with
my search thanks and then this one from
joelle and i'll do the best i can hear
hello guys I'm an old man I have 58
years old I love high-tech my life are
siting in front off the video at 15
years ago and all the world came on my
brain through this video's I'm so happy
I'm free I'm not alone my girlfriend
live in Russia we make sex we learn
English too and our stand us but in
other room in my house my path erard a
aiding just going out without video he
loved the silence that just he feeling
and no one video can tell you nothing
because he'll even day by day on the
dark and the silence what that is
straight notes from underground right
there I love that email i love you guys
in your crazy mail thank you i will be
back to answer actual questions next
week as long as you send them email me

snail mail to 235 second street san
