iPad this is the best ipad the ipad pro
nine point seven inch it's got a nicer
screen anti-glare it works a pencil it
works with smart connector keyboards and
attach like this it's got a better
processor it's got four speakers that
sound louder it's got better cameras if
you're into that it's more expensive so
you're gonna pay $5.99 for the 32 gig
that if you want the one that's really
got the storage you're gonna be spending
along with the accessories maybe up to a
thousand dollars but it's the best ipad
why hello you with lots of extra space
and maybe extra money to welcome to the
12 point 9 inch iPad pro you got a lot
of room well this is that iPad it's a
larger canvas so it's got more pixels to
draw around in if you're an artist
that's great but this puppy is more
expensive than the nine point seven inch
iPad pro and I don't have that type of
money and I'm not really that good an
artist maybe you don't care about pencil
you don't care about believing edge tech
you just want a good iPad well iPad air
2 is still around it's still a really
good iPad this thing has got most of
what you need it runs split-screen apps
it's got a good screen size good battery
life and it costs $4.99 for 64 gigs of
storage a lot less than the others
Horace's is almost 2 years old so who
knows how this runs a next version of
iOS or the one after that but still
really good value
maybe one sign smaller
tiny tick around on a trip doesn't cost
that much the iPad Mini 2 is still
around this thing has a tinier screen it
costs about 300 something dollars for a
32 gig version 200 selling dollars for a
16 depending on where you get it on sale
this has been around forever it's still
really good but I wouldn't do a lot of
work on this I would just take it to
read play games and that's it but don't
forget the kids
you could spend even less you could buy
a Kindle Fire tablet or you could not
buy anything at all she's a phone or a
laptop those are your choices for iPads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
