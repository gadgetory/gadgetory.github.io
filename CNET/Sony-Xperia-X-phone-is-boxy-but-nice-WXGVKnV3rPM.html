a pretty pleasant one
there's nothing terrifically exciting
about its design or specs but that's
actually okay because it's a good
comfortable phone for a price that's
much lower than your iPhone's and your
Samsung galaxys I was able to do
everything I wanted on this global model
running Android 6.0 that I have here in
basic black
I took a conference call talked to my
bank for a painfully long time played
games and of course there was the
non-stop emailing and messaging the
straight sides here in this phone make
it easy to grip and I dig the dedicated
shutter button for taking photos I
always have the xperia x posts an
enormous 23 megapixel rear camera and a
13 megapixel front-facing lens that has
so much Sony's camera tech that's been
adapted for phones plus there are a ton
of manual control settings and options
that you don't see on a lot of other
handsets like fill-flash pictures are
absolutely good enough to proudly share
but I'm not quite ready to call this the
best camera on the market for every
lighting scenario while a good
all-around are this 5 into X here faces
very stiff competition from other phones
that are water-resistant and have faster
processors and larger screens if you're
into that I personally think this is a
really great phone to use one-handed the
biggest red flag though is that for US
buyers Sony is disabling the fingerprint
reader that's built into the power
button which is extremely perplexing
because the reader works really well
without it it will take longer for you
to unlock the device and you won't be
able to use your finger to authorize an
Android paid purchase so when it comes
down to it u.s. buyers should move on
like maybe to the Nexus 6p for instance
but everyone else who's looking for a
less expensive phone that's nice to use
should keep a xperia X in the running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
