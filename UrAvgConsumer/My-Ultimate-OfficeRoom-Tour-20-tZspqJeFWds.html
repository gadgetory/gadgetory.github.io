consumer and today it's finally time to
give you guys a room tour is to end of
2014 so you guys might as well see some
of the upgrades that I've made during
the year and hey what's not wasting time
let's get right into it
blah blah blah blah so to start this off
I'm going to give you guys a quick tour
around it just so you guys can see what
the room actually looks like so here it
is so from the door you make a left here
you see my dresser typically the pending
dresser see I've got my camera stuff
over here
bed and futon bookshelf all this good
stuff and then over here is my desk and
for those of you who have our friend are
new to my channel we haven't seen my
previous room tours up here I have all
my consoles all my games all in this
hanging cabinet and above those are my
collection of headphones which I tend to
switch around every now and then so I'm
going to give you guys look around some
of the items that I have placed
everywhere so starting off with the
pending dresser now this is not
technically the pending dresser right
now because I don't have a lot of the
stuff that I have to review out because
I have a ton of stuff to do so they're
not all here so right now this is just
holding some of the items that I need
access to and I don't know if you guys
noticed this WWE chair right here but I
actually use this chair when I'm at
filming it actually is a takes up less
space than this one on camera so that's
where I use when I'm filming but over
here I have my Canon 70d this is what
I've been using for ever now I got it
last year I've been using it for like
all of 2014 awesome camera but I decided
to upgrade behind that I have the beats
solo2 wireless that I have to unbox and
do some videos on I've got some cell
phone boxes here some things that I need
to get rid of actually me get rid of
both of these over here I have some lens
carrying cases now these are really
awesome carrying cases they provide a
ton and ton of space you can actually
open them up it's very durable and they
actually ex
and so these are from tortilla really
good stuff have links down below to
everything you see in this video in the
description so look out for that this is
actually the contraption that I used to
vlog so I have the camera quite a bit
away from my face so that I can get more
Volek wide-angle look more stuff in the
shot
this is the tascam dr-60d this is my
audio recorder well it used to be my
audio recorder I'm not going to be using
it much anymore simply because my new
camera has an internal recorder so I can
use my mic on it and you know one of the
speakers to my surround sound speakers
the Logitech Z 506 and I guess I might
as well show you the new camera this is
the sony fs7 this thing is a beast they
record in 4k awesome quality this is the
whole thing right now
I have it ups to have this part upside
down because I like to look at myself
while filming but this is it I've got my
mic here and you might see all of these
sticks back here you might be like what
the heck is that well there are tons of
different things here lots of sticks
I've got some audio some mic boom poles
some tripods down here some light stands
tons of stuff so that's all that's right
there over over here I've got my two
book bags I've got my camera backpack
and my ojio renegade what is the RSS 17
now I did a I did videos on both of
these backpacks before this is my
current backpack that I use to carry all
my tech all my gadgets if you guys
haven't seen that video I'm gonna leave
a link down below in the description
very very awesome stuff every techie
needs one of these and of course I have
the boxes to all of my Gundams I I can't
help but keep the boxes I don't know
they give me inspirations for poses and
what not to use during the videos so I
have all the boxes right here and a
couple of tools that I use to build it
and right here I also have my Manfrotto
monopod
so if I'm looking to be lightweight and
go outside and get some
cool footage this is what I'm using on
that handheld or I'm not carrying a
heavy tripod over here I have the lights
that I typically use and some daylight
bulbs from Home Depot these can get
really really bright they fill up my
room very well so those are my lighting
kits a very low-tech but it definitely
does the job of course I've got my futon
here honestly it doesn't really get much
use but it's good if you wanted to sit
down and relax I've got this little toy
here you guys told me the link the name
of it laughs in my last tour but I
forgot I also have this board so I can
do white balancing so I can get my
coloring right for my videos let's see
over here is the bookshelf and funny
thing about this bookshelf you guys said
that it had no books in it well BAM I
added one just for you guys who said
that titanfall
but going from top to bottom these are
my Gundams these are what I feature in
pretty much every video that you see on
YouTube now I always feature one of
these guys and a pretty cool pose if you
guys are familiar with Gundams you
should know what these are
let's see moving down I have all of my
games
so ps3 Xbox 360
I've got some ps4 games here just a
couple of Xbox one games and of course I
got 3ds all this good stuff PS Vita
pretty much every system right here
every current system right here I'm
moving down also some Pokemon stuff
me and my girlfriend are collecting a
bunch of pokemon cards right now so we
usually get some of these figurines when
they come in the box and some androids
now right here is a special special
piece for me this is my plaque for a
hundred thousand rue
100,000 subscribers and I've got the
awesome perfect grade gundam right there
so it's a bigger piece and this thing
just it's awesome I love the spot
favorite spot in the whole book stuff
because you guys made it awesome and
down here I've got some let's see some
old-school games on ps2 ps1 RPG
I've got some cool very very cool tablet
stands these are a must-have if you're a
frequent tablet user let's see I've got
some in earbuds all right here I've got
quite a few of them top five video
coming soon so definitely check that out
I've got a little stand or a mini tripod
rather for my my my cameras so something
like the rx100 mark 3 that I'm using now
can stand on this with no problem look
pretty good I've got a zoom h1
definitely very very handy awesome
starting a starter audio recorder and
it's still very functional when you're
on the go so definitely a good job there
by zoom let's see I've got tons of
portable batteries you guys know I am in
love with them and I've got quite the
selection here and two very old PSPs and
down here I have a bunch of headphone
cases and note that I have about four or
foot five v motor cases yeah I'm kind of
in love with them I also got some other
headphones here just a Ton Ton Ton but
that's pretty much it for the bookshelf
to the right of that is actually the Z
board now I love this thing most fun I
ever had doing a review this thing is
awesome
pricey if you can afford it though it is
so worth it I love using this thing I'm
upset that it's winter right now and I
can't get on it but that's there and
this is my slider this is the eye
footage shark slider very very very
fluid shots with this this thing is
buttery smooth if you can if you guys
check this out it's very smooth and it's
got a counterbalance right here very
awesome shots with this and it's sitting
on de sel old-school tripod that I had
definitely upgraded because it was so
heavy but it's perfect for this because
it gives us more stability moving on
I've got a Logitech UE boom box never
quite did a review on this but if you
guys are still interested let me know
if you guys are interested in any of the
products actually that I'm showing right
now and I haven't done a review if you
really want to review let me know in the
comments down below I promise I'll do up
to it this is my avid studio mic this is
what I use for voiceovers typically
that's a pretty good job can't complain
about it the the stand that it's on is
terrible though like the top of topples
over all time but it's a really good mic
over here I have my little portable
station this is where I keep my tablets
laptops all that kind of stuff as you
can see here I have the Google Nexus 10
I am in love with this tablet still my
favorite Android tablet today after all
these years and this is the surface pro
3 awesome for productivity and behind
that I have the MacBook Air
competitors sitting in the same spot and
I also have an iPhone 6 plus right here
I've got a Nintendo 3ds XL and another
one at the bottom of course a PS Vita
love these guys
portable gaming man that's where it's at
and a USB hub as well as a wireless
charger and I've got this adidas
SmartWatch that wasn't really impressive
to me to be honest I've got some hard
drives right here a three terabyte one
down there and what a 256 up top and
taking a look at what's inside of here
let's see this has a couple of random
things some more DS's some phone cases
I've got an iPod some storage over here
an Apple Magic Mouse unboxing knife and
a little stuff some super og phones the
Android first Android phone out the g1
I've got the g2 uh let's see what else
we've got tons of microfiber cloths
because I am addicted to microfiber
cloths I love cleaning my screens I
can't help but do it whenever I see a
fingerprint and I've got the Logitech
performance MX the initech 3.0
USB hub this is awesome for using with
the surface pro 3 because it gives it 3
USB 3.0 hubs awesome and I've got the
travel case down here for the 3dsxl
carries a bunch of games good stuff and
down here a little bit of a life hack if
you got a ton of cables and you want to
store them you don't want it to get
tangled Dome in some ziplock bags that's
how I do mine and it's been actually
really helpful whenever you're looking
for something boom there you go so
that's that and let's see this is my
desk
boom boom boom here it is now first off
this is the chair that I use I got this
from Ikea I know I got this from Staples
so if you guys saw the vlog you know you
saw when I picked this thing up super
comfortable definitely great for sitting
here and doing my editing work it's just
a little too big for my videos it takes
up a lot of space on the camera so
that's why I use that WWE steel chair oh
yeah and that is my old iMac 27-inch it
is a late 2012 still a very awesome
computer I have this pretty much maxed
out for the time that it came out 3
terabyte fusion drive but I had to
upgrade it for the new 5k iMac because
I'm editing videos in 4k now so I needed
something a bit more powerful that could
handle it and over here we have the whoo
audio wa7 fireflies now this thing is
quite the amp if you guys aren't
familiar with headphone amps these
things can actually make your music
really pop really awesome stuff here and
I've also got the Sennheiser HD 700 so
it's a crazy crazy combo I'm gonna have
a video on this for sure so definitely
stay tuned for that and let's see what
else we've got going on here so this is
my 5k iMac this is my PlayStation 3d
display and you might notice that I have
some cameras above it this is actually
the camera to the ps4 and this is the X
box one connect so I've got all of those
systems right up here now this is where
I keep my ps4 my ps3 Wii U and my xbox
one so this is all where everything is
held now typically I don't have my xbox
one year this is pretty much my room in
its most optimal setting this is where
this is how it would be if I wanted to
pimp it out all the time but I don't
always have my Xbox one Kinect here I
usually have it in my living room but
you're seeing my room at its best so it
also got some charging cradles for the
systems here so it can charge my
controller so I can charge my
controllers while I wait and play my
games up here I have my headphones I've
got the urbanites
the Sennheiser urbanite Beats Studio 2.0
boom phones Bayer dynamic custom one
pros Logitech UE 9000 beats so beats
wireless audio technica ath m50x Sony
mdr-1r 's and the Sony pulse wireless
headset oh alright F so that's what's
going on over here and what's cool about
the ps3 display is that I can actually
play games on the same display they're
all actually connected right to this guy
so if I don't feel like using two
monitors for anything I can jump on play
some ps4 no problem I'm good to go and
right here I do have my what is this the
Nexus 6 so videos on this coming soon as
well actually down here you might not
you might have missed this but this is
the PlayStation TV so if I want to play
play the VF PS Vita on this TV I got I
can do that as well and with this little
HDMI switcher I can switch between all
the systems and you know pretty much
switch to whatever system that I want to
without having to unplug anything so
really really convenient and over here
is the Logitech z5
Oh sixth at I mentioned earlier and a
cool thing that you might have noticed
is that I have these huge Phillips
Hughes lights that these strips that I
can change the color for my videos for
the background of my you know scenes so
I really like that in one of my videos I
think I switched it up about five
different times in my top five favorite
headphones video I used these quite a
bit so go check that out and you can see
what I've been doing with that but
pretty much this is it guys
this is a tour of everything in my room
hopefully you enjoyed it I know this was
a bit of a vlog --is-- style kind of
video but hey that's how you got to do
it
hopefully enjoyed it if you did be the
cool guy that gives it a thumbs up or
gal and I'll catch you guys in the next
video till then it's your average
consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
