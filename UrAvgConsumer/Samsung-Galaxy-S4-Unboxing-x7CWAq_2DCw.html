consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of the brand new Samsung
Galaxy s4 so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it
and all right guys here we have the
Samsung Galaxy s4 now this is the
much-awaited Android phone of the year
I'm sure people love the HTC One but
Samsung has gotten so popular that
everyone just knows about Galaxy phones
so here it is this is the box
and it may look wooden but it's not real
wood of course but I did get asked that
question so I wanted to let you guys
know and let's unbox it so we slide this
off and here we are but on the back of
this they list some specs so this is on
the AT&amp;amp;T network and it's 4G LTE capable
it's a 5-inch display it's Full HD so
it's 1080p it's an AMOLED display it's
got an infrared blaster
it's got 1.9 gigahertz of quad-core
processing power now in for average
consumers that means it's going to be
really really fast going to be able to
handle a lot it's going to be able to do
a lot very quickly it has the watch on
feature a 13 megapixel rear facing
camera it's got the latest version of
Android is 4.2 jellybean and can record
in Full HD 1080p so tons of good stuff
there and these are just like the
hardware specs this thing has got a ton
of features that Samsung has built in to
the newest phone so it's just going to
be kind of crazy but enough blabbering
let's unbox so let's see open up here
and first off we get a Quick Start Guide
from AT&amp;amp;T probably some stuff on how to
get started all the slow stuff and I'm
assuming this is all eco-friendly
materials even the paper so here we have
it and this is the black version so
that's what I have here and already I
can tell you guys is feel really light
and AT&amp;amp;T has a big you know texting and
driving can wait so
that's there we're going to take this
little tab pull it open and I'm assuming
there's some stuff inside here no
actually there is it so nothing in here
we have another little tab here we're
going to pull that open and more
booklets and stuff like that so this is
some more advertising set health and
safety all that fun stuff we like to
read and of course you'll get the power
adapter you also receive a micro USB
cable such as micro cable and you get
some ear buds and these are some pretty
cool ear buds let me give you guys a
quick look at what these look like and
alright guys here are the ear buds that
come with the Samsung Galaxy s4 now I
think the other Galaxy phones came with
ear buds similar to this so if you're
familiar with that you won't be too
surprised here but I'm very happy that
Samsung includes ear buds
I know HTC did for the one but I guess
t-mobile skipped out on that so I don't
know if t-mobile's version of the s4
will have it but who knows ATT has it
though so that's good stuff and it's
pretty much it looks like a regular pair
of ear buds that go in here and it has
some volume controls as well as the talk
button here so I'm sure that'll work for
playing pause when it comes to listening
to music and things of that nature and
it's a flat tangle free cable so it
should be tangle free because it's got
the flat design but yeah that's about it
for this pair of earbuds guys alright so
now back to the box last but not least
is the giant 2600 milliamp battery now
2600 milliamp sure is pretty good that's
going to give this thing some great
battery life but this does have a 1080p
display so that means it's going to eat
more battery power it's going to consume
more so maybe this might have regular
battery who knows I'll find out in the
review and let you guys know how the
battery fares but this thing is pretty
huge standard phones don't come with
batteries this big so I'm expecting some
good life but that's about it for the
box you got your power stuff here
earbuds here
and of course they give you some
different ear tips for different sizes
but that's it for the box I'm going to
move all the stuff aside and then I'm
going to put in this battery into the
phone itself but before I put the
battery in I'm going to give you guys a
quick tour of the phone and let's take
off some of this plastic wrapping on it
so first you got this big sticker
take that off and we got some more
stickers in the back
let's see where it's the best place to
peel it I don't want to rip it alright
cool so boom there you go all stickers
out of the way and here it is and like I
said guys this thing is very light of
course that's because there's no battery
in there but um let's install the
battery now and see what we can do here
and rip this open
oh well that fell okay so we're going to
put in this battery and you can see we
have a slot here for the SIM card and
another slot here for your micro SD card
slot so that's where you can upgrade the
storage and you know not really have to
worry about that which is really cool
umm this back plastic is really really
thin and light but it doesn't feel too
cheap so it's not that bad
and of course you see some AT&amp;amp;T branding
over here I'm going to give you guys a
quick close up of the actual phone I've
already gotten quite some fingerprints
on here but here it is closer close up
of the phone itself and all right guys
here we have the Samsung Galaxy s4 here
we have the home button and you can't
see him right now since the phone is
empowered but this is the back button as
well as the menu button here up top
you'll see a quite a few sensors I don't
know if you guys can exactly see but
there's a couple of sensors up there for
movement all kinds of stuff that this
phone has features for now so it's light
sensors movement sensors all kinds of
stuff I think this is a 2 megapixel
camera 2.1 maybe but I know it's in the
true range and in the back you've got
your huge 13 megapixel rear camera
you've got some ACNC branding and you
have your LED flash of course down here
so Samsung
cs4 or just as galaxy s4 and of course
this is your speaker microUSB slot and
of course your 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack as well as another mic over here a
mic here and that's probably another one
hidden somewhere or maybe these are two
right here I'm not sure but either way
this has tons of mics all kinds of stuff
this is a 5-inch display so in
comparison to something like the nexus 4
which is a 4.7 inch display it's quite a
bit bigger and comparing it to the HTC
one the HTC One is pretty big so it's
probably taller I wonder which one is
taller the HTC One is probably pretty
close in height to it but these are it
5-inch display on this guy let's power
it on see what it can do
oh and on another note here is the power
button on the side as well as your
volume rockers on the left side so here
it is we have Samsung Galaxy s4 greeting
us so no surprises here um I'm gonna go
ahead and set this up guys this is just
going to be a quick unboxing I'm gonna
go in depth with all the features all
the things it can do in the review and
let you guys know how this fares in
comparison to phones like the HTC One
next is four and the iPhone 5 I have as
well so I'm going to let you guys know
how the stacks up against the leading
phones out on the market right now
hopefully you guys enjoyed this and if
you did please feel free to rate comment
and subscribe so you can expect tons of
videos on this phone comparisons all
kinds of good stuff let me know if you
want to see any fun videos in particular
about this phone and I will work on that

I'll catch you guys in the next one real
Dennis your average consumer
