consumer and we've got a ton of packages
here as you can see and you can also see
that we are in a different location not
the gamers paradise but there's gonna be
a video on this soon don't worry we have
massive tech unboxing number 21 it's
been a while folks so of course
grab your snacks grab your drinks we got
a lot of stuff to open up let's do it
okay Ari
Ari's here y'all go ahead pick the first
one this one okay all right so now I'm
going to open up one I got this in my
hand why not damn you just dropping
stuff so this is the birdnest backpack
23 litres so let's see this is I'm
always down for some backpacks this one
special oh look at look at this guys
look at the materials this is made out
of that's pretty interesting so this is
from a company called bird nests the
bird nest there's like lots of velcro
all over I'm gonna have to mess around
with this and see what it's all about
and what kind of features it has but as
of right now this feels like a really
nice backpack so I'm gonna go for this
guy
we're going for like the big boxes first
this time around and we're just keep on
dropping stuff let's feel suitcase okay
briefcase yes all right
it is okay that was kind of cool
are these battery cases for the new
iPhones so this is to go against Apple
in their battery case you got you got
your phone so this so this is Aries
battery case from Apple it is white and
dirty this is compatible with the 10s
and the regular 10 I wonder if you feel
slimmer does this feel slimmer to you
this is not my phone so yeah if this one
for the 10r has two thousand milliamp
hours and let's see what the iPhone 10
one has this one has two thousand
milliamp hours to so that is what seven
hundred more than the one Apple offers
Oh
22 so 2200 for the max nice it charges
with USB type-c that's the own like I'm
a fan of USB type-c as a charging
connector but for the iPhone cases it
should just be lightning just make it
easy oh and it charged
okay so the way it charges it - it
hasn't charged to the Lightning port
charges wirelessly so you're getting
wireless charging I'm not sure if that's
gonna be as fast as Apple's option we'd
have to compare it but wireless charging
isn't as fast as being plugged in so
this is cool nonetheless though and I'm
sure it's probably cheaper maybe all
right so that's cool this packaging is a
one though
yeah yes I do
so they actually sent two to me because
i pre-ordered the titanium version
that's what we have right here folks
now titanium version of the red hydrogen
took a lot longer to be produced
so everyone who pre-ordered one got the
normal one first to make up for it so we
got two phones for the price of one
let's see it
boom red hydrogen in titanium I think
mark has said something about this being
heavy and cold this is yeah
this is a much heavier phone Wow now
this is a phone that either love it or
hate it some people weren't thrilled
about it I'm sad that it's it came so
late now - Jeanne's heard that whisper
so what's special about this phone is
that it has this display that gives off
a 3d effect I forget what it's called
but you know they bring in three back so
that you can consume content differently
than you know all the other typical
phones offer so right now you can't see
if it'll camera but it's got that 3d
effect going right now it doesn't very
good 3d yes yeah it looks very much like
that but yeah there's gonna be a video
on this soon we'll talk about this a
little bit more all right so that's red
hydrogen now I'm gonna go for something
I know this is from color wear and this
is extremely special guys alright so in
here we have some air pods these ain't
just any air posi all these are very
very special like I said and for those
of you who don't know who color wear is
or who they are they customize tech
paint um add special colors to it and
logos even and here we have the very
first day and a like wrap this up all
the way hold on give me give you a
second guys but here we have the first
ever UAC air pods with the new
logo so we are changing the logo on the
channel we are changing it to this one
this is a teal gray and I guess darker
gray color scheme and I'm kind of
letting go of the orange aren't just
cool but you know you're gonna you're
gonna miss it
well I like this a bit more but it's so
cool that color was able to actually put
that on here and this thing looks
awesome oh look at inside so we went
with a two tones air pod look so we got
like a gray and the darker gray to go
with the theme of the new logo and so
with Madison gloss they can do it matte
all of these different colors you guys
can check out codewords website they've
got so many so many options but this is
not the only thing that they sent over
we got some other stuff too no that's a
sticker they paint it on that is legit
we got another switch y'all but have you
seen one that looks like this this right
here is the 16-bit version and I might
have shown you guys these joy cons in
the past but I haven't shown you the
entire switch with them so these are the
joy cons they look absolutely awesome
but the switch matches so perfectly and
then color where I'm telling you guys
every time color wear sends me something
they just blow my mind because it looks
so so good tell me that doesn't look
awesome but this is the entire box so
that means that they also do the case
now this is not the case there's
actually the dock and like I said before
this thing is painted on so this smooth
you feel it feels like it came right
from Nintendo like this damn come on
y'all this looks amazing so if you love
the retro look you're gonna love this
too I'll of course have links to this
down below in the description but color
wear and I are teaming up to give one of
these away to one of you guys and all
you have to do is follow us over on
the Graham to insert I'll have a post to
that down below in the description so
you guys can get your chance to win a
16-bit color we're retro
it's a Nintendo switch and just so you
know they do the little handles too so
the entire thing is colored the
attention to detail guys is next level
so this is from Steel serious or high so
right here we have the SteelSeries rival
650 Wireless
now I've featured this mouse on the
channel before but the wired version and
when I saw that they had the wireless
version I went nuts had to get my hands
on them and my goodness I am very very
excited to use these this is such a good
looking Mouse guys not when I got this
in hand I badly wanted it to be Wireless
so to see that they actually made one
that is has me super super excited not
only is the design very clean but it of
course has the RGB lights that I love
and not to mention you can also change
the feel of the mouse after you use it
so you can go ahead and pop these parts
off and add little weights right here
and also on the other side you can even
it out so I'm very happy to see that
this is a wireless option now so thank
you steel series for sending this to me
had to get my hands on this no still
service is awesome
well alright okay alright imma choose
next so my sister-in-law wants to choose
something go ahead that one alright
honor this is your chance this is a
weird box Metro Exodus Oh for the Xbox
one Xbox what's up baby it's been a
while
alright so we got something from Xbox
princes Metro Exodus of course we got a
nice little string
look okay so it's like a some kind of
kit okay
it's a gas mask okay for you yeah I used
to protect against you yeah yeah yeah
that backfired
please do not try to use gas masks for
display only ha in your faces
holy man this looks like it's been
through it look at that alright so you
got a little satchel for your gas mask
to go into the world of Metro Exodus the
deer zombies means zombie apocalypse is
right there
this is DOS oh it came out on the 15th
nice all right thanks Xbox glad to have
you back and you long antlion audio so I
have heard of antlion audio before and
this is the mod Mike Wireless and
basically what you're gonna be able to
do here is get a good quality microphone
on any pair of headphones that you own
so if you've owned a pair of over ear
headphones you can pretty much just
attach this to it and get really clear
audio and it's wireless so you can
pretty much attach this to any headset
and you don't have to worry about
needing to plug in some crazy way you
just attach it to the side of any
headphone and you'll be able to use this
as you'd like so thank you antlion for
sending this out bag smart interesting
so it's a backpack so backs back smart
is a brand that I've been using a lot
from my tech survival kit bags and
they've make some really solid accessory
bags or cases that's a Nintendo switch
case interesting alright so this holds
your switch and it of course holds a few
games and it's just like a built-in
stand and you got a little zipper area
over here to store other accessories
cool and they got a backpack now this
I'm interested in got a nice handwritten
note from the people out bags smart
interesting this is a cool bag oh and it
goes crazy deep so I guess this is how
you close it you do this and I still
need to figure out how this thing works
I need to figure that out
alright cool thanks bag smart for
sending this out I will figure out how
to use it what I'm done with the video
oh yes
alright so this is from Satechi this is
their 75 watt dual USB PD charger
usually when you see USB PD on a charger
there's only one port that allows it but
this one has two and you need that USB
PD port if you want a fast charge an
iPhone or a power a powerful laptop this
is gonna give you enough juice to
actually do that and you still have two
USB ports so this is something that I
know I'm gonna be taking around with me
always now I'm curious how many of you
guys using an iPhone 8 or something
newer are taking advantage of the fast
charging I want to know because this
thing is a game-changer and I feel like
a lot of people sleep on that X round so
this is the X pump brings your speakers
and headphones alive what does that even
mean
so this is like an audio interface so oh
it has a DAC so this is a DAC so this
right here is a portable DAC with a
surround algorithm area is that what you
said so you get surround so basically
you get surround sound with anything
that you plug in so this could take the
gaming up to another level I'm gonna
have to try this out this is the X round
interesting of course have them link
down below in the description and if you
guys want to hear my thoughts on how it
actually impacts
music and games let me know what the
like button just try to get better like
but haha oh cases for your air pod cases
air pod wireless charging case oh so
these can make okay so you put your ear
pods in these and they'll wirelessly
charge them this is the green one you
guys can see inside it has a lightning
connector alright so I'm gonna put in
new air pods right inside of here and
then BOOM
alright so it's inside open them up oh
there we go now it's charging I guess if
you have like a really big wireless
charging that you can do that wait what
the heck oh is this guys check this out
we got Dragon Ball Z figures for days
over here and I think this is from
Bandai so Bandai sent me something for
the first time which I'm very very
excited about holy mess oh yeah nice
little care package I wish I opened up
this first so we got Tales of Vesperia
for the Nintendo switch and the ps4
we got a Logitech G 703 mouse and some
Dragon Ball Z bigger so I'm guessing
these are like sort of like model kits
let's open it up we got veggie toe over
here and yes I'm saying veggie toe I'm
sure anybody has to say so this is just
like my Gundam model kits holy mess this
is awesome
is this a spoiler I haven't seen the
movie yet but this is so awesome now
Tales of Vesperia this is the first
Tales game that I've ever played and it
is a nice
long adventure I enjoyed this one a ton
I played it on the Xbox 360 I spent tons
of hours playing this in college thanks
Ben die
very very very happy over here now if
you guys ever need any gundam stuff
shown on the champ no I'm just playing I
just play it now not what I feel like
these are gonna be like iPad cases oh so
this is a wireless charging mouse pad oh
that's kind of cool
so there's a wireless charger built
right into this mouse pad I had
something like that with the I think it
was a corsair mouse pad this is clean
check this out
so this is the mouse pad and right here
I guess is where you can charge things
now this is a very clean look look at
the back - it feels like it and then you
have the charging cable over here USB
type-c so that's nice so you can just
plug this in and then you plug it up
it's really cool so we've got black
midnight blue and grey and so far this
looks really really good surprisingly
random but very nice Mouse card haul
system G now they make awesome backpacks
and they sent me over their latest
through the system G backpack in all
black let's go Dan's happiness hmm
now I don't know if you guys saw the
video that I did on this backpack or one
of their backpacks but I felt like it
was the ultimate backpack but it's just
a little bit on the large side a man
when it comes to quality look at this
look at the materials that this thing is
made out of guys it is just absolutely
amazing honestly I'm not even
exaggerating here guys it's second to
none like this is the best feeling
backpack that I've ever used this is
just so so nice quality Harrison
yeah this is so this is the same type
act that I showed in the past but it's a
different color and I think this is the
17 inch version so if you have a 17 inch
laptop it'll be able to fit this and no
problem I'll love having the link down
below in the description but this is
such a nice quality backpack man all
right last one guys let's hope this
isn't a dud what is this I don't even
there's a USB port it's like a science
project I think this is supposed to be a
speaker of some sort an LED speaker well
that about wraps up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed a huge shout out
to everyone who sent something over lots
of cool stuff few shots at Bandai
Microsoft everybody but I'll catch you
guys in the next one if you enjoyed it
be the cool girl gives via thumbs up
I'll catch you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
