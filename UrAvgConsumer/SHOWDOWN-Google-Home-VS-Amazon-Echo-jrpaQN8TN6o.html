home just came out and we've been using
the Amazon echo for about two years now
and we're in love with this thing but we
want to see how Google home compares to
it so wanna start off with a question
sure
so we're going to start this comparison
this tests with one of my most common
questions that I asked the Amazon echo
Alexa what time is it
it's 328 p.m. simple enough yeah you
just activate here by saying Alexa so
for the Google home you say ok Google
what time is it
the time is 328 p.m. so that's how you
kind of activate them but let's ask you
some real questions Alexa how old is
Morris Chestnut Morris Chestnut is 47
years old ok I like them a little more
mature ok Google how old is not Ethan ha
ha no laughing is 45 years old butchered
her name yes ok
Alexa sing happy birthday happy birthday
- happy birthday
that was she also did you say stop or
shut up she'll listen ok Google sing
happy birthday happy birthday to you
folks you got more social yeah happy
birthday to the most amazing person in a
universe she's gone ok Google stop now
Google keeps talking about how you can
ask follow-up questions to the Google
home and their assistant on the phone so
we're gonna try some of that out so ok
Google
when did I earn Man first come out Iron
Man was released globally on April 14
2008 ok Google who played in it it's
cast includes Robert Downey jr. Jon
Favreau and 59 others there you go 59
others ok Alexa when did Iron Man come
out the movie Iron Man was released in
2008 Alexa who played in it hmm I don't
know but you can take a look at the Bing
search link I added
the Alexa app that's so cool so you
can't really ask follow-up questions
here but it is cool that you can do that
with this kind of have a conversation
that's kind of what Google wants to
happen here you have a conversation with
your assistant so we had a chance to ask
these two a couple different questions
but they can also play music so now
we're going to test out the music
playing capabilities Alexa play Drake
fake love Ben Union here's a sample of
fake love by Drake sample Alexa stop now
that's one thing I don't really like
about Alexa sometimes the songs are hit
or miss you'll get the full song
sometimes sometimes it'll be a sample so
look for it in your library all that
stuff is very hitter in this I shall
play songs similar to it it's just yeah
okay google play Drake fake love alright
Big Love by Drake playing like googling
games and maybe I got it yeah now one
thing that's always bothered me with the
echo is that it won't tell you how long
it takes to get to certain place so if I
say something like Alexa how long will
it take me to get to Best Buy in
Secaucus New Jersey I don't know how
long it'll take but I found the Best Buy
in Secaucus it's nine point three miles
away on Paterson playing groan well this
gives you a lot of information in total
how far shortcoming though right yeah
yeah okay Google how long will it take
me to get to Best Buy in Secaucus on
your way to Best Buy traffic is light as
usual it is 22 minutes by car so that is
really helpful like in the morning when
you're trying to get somewhere like how
far is work yeah and then you'll find
out real quickly and this works with
Google Maps try to get that integration
exactly so it'll it'll know now
obviously these both have built-in
speakers the echo has a much larger one
as you can see but surprisingly the
Google home is just as loud and just as
bassy
so they both sound really good even
though this has a much much smaller body
now these are both supposed to be voices
system so let's try out some of those
features Alexa remind me to buy eggs
morrow at 4 o'clock I added buy eggs
tomorrow at 4 o'clock to your to-do list
okay okay Google remind me to buy eggs
tomorrow at 4 p.m.
sorry I can't set reminders in it that's
baffling now what worth it
what's really weird about that is that
you're supposed to have access to Google
Calendar all that kind of stuff with the
Google home so I'm sure that's a feature
that's coming it's just weird that it's
not out with launch mat launch now when
it comes to smart home devices I've been
testing these out quite a bit and I
gotta say Google Homes a bit
disappointing so far Amazon echo I used
to control everything in my studio all
my lights at home in the studio in the
game room you guys if you haven't seen
that video you should check it out but
in the intro you saw me turn on all the
lights in here by simply giving Alexa a
command now with the Google home it only
supports three kinds of smart home
devices and I still of use um smart
things from Samsung and I think nest so
that's very very lacking you can't
control everything with this to your
life X both just wouldn't know life X
none of the Smart Switches I have from
like Wemo so it's very disappointing
that I can't control everything just yet
so Alexa definitely has to leg up there
if you want to control some are owned
devices
this is a much much better choice for
now and now the last category the design
you're putting this into your home so
you want to make sure you choosing the
one that you think looks the best I
personally think the Amazon echo looks
better than the cool that's very
surprising I do and think it's sleek I
like the color if it's really really
well in our home so I really really like
it I'm really used to it now this is a
lot smaller you can actually change out
the bottom mesh part you can change
different colors I think can get a
different feel a metallic one as well
and of course that cost a little more I
think they're like 20 bucks but you can
change it so that it matches whatever
room it's in people say it looks like an
air freshener
does so let us know what you guys think
who do you think won do you think Google
home won or the Amazon echo
I personally my heart still belongs to
this beautiful device here I really want
to jump on the Google home bandwagon but
Alexa controlled all my stuff so she's
gonna get it for me
I mean she's gonna you know but I hope
you guys enjoyed this video and if you
did be the cool guy or girl to give us a
thumbs up subscribe for more content if
you enjoyed this one and catching the
