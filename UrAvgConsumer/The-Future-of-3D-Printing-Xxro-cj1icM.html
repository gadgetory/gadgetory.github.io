something from the real world bring it
over to the digital world change it and
bring it back over to the real world how
can you say no to that so I got a chance
to try out the new HP sprout with it's
crazy 3d features and even demo it to an
awesome crowd over at Maker Faire in New
York if you aren't familiar with Maker
Faire it's where tons of techies come
together to show off some really cool
things that they've made using all kinds
of technology and honestly I can't think
of a better place to show off what this
thing can do the sprout truck shop was
loaded with sprout machines and people
who are interested in learning more
about it and even trying it out for
themselves
I got to show off a cool project I've
been working on which was all about
taking my puppies true toy personalizing
it with her name and shrinking it down
into a dog tag the trucks were equipped
with dremel 3d printers so I was able to
go there and have him made on the spot
then I got to check out some of the cool
stuff made with sprouts before I got
there I mean the stuff is mind-blowing
it was a seriously cool experience and I
even got to meet up with some of you
guys which was awesome shout out to me
looking like Tony Stark when I use this
bang so right now you're probably
wondering what's this sprouting all
about well you're looking at an
all-in-one desktop with built in 3d
cameras and sensors that allow you to
scan an object and manipulate it through
various applications within the sprout
workspace but before we get into that a
little info on this Hulk of a machine
this guy's packing a core i7 processor
with eight gigs of RAM one terabyte of
storage so you can hold all the projects
you'll be using this for and NVIDIA
GeForce graphics it will come with
Windows 8.1 but you'll be able to
upgrade that to Windows 10 with no
problem the standard mouse and keyboard
combo which are actually very
comfortable to use and another very
interesting input a 20-point touch
enabled mat that
also doubles as a second screen with the
built-in projector this and that is
where all the magic will happen and
you'll also get an awesome stylus that
you can use both on the mat and the
touchscreen of the sprout itself there's
also this 3d capture stage that while
not necessary to get project started it
helps tremendously in making the process
simple and efficient and now that you
know we're working with let's make
something as I mentioned for my project
I wanted something practical and a nice
little dog tag was perfect for cookie
the sprout guides you through the whole
process making it very simple for anyone
to use it you can scan your object
manually on the mat or use the 3d
capture stage to do all the work for you
on a flat or tilted surface I like to
start with a flat surface then move on
to a tilted one for more angles on the
scan the first flat scan will be a good
base for the model and the second tilted
scan will fit right in it the more
scanning cycles you use the better the
outcome of your model since the sprout
will have more to work with and if
you're worried about your object not
sitting still during a tilted scan don't
be they've got you covered with this
adhesive putty to keep things in place
after about two scans I had a pretty
good model but there were some gaps
since I only went with two scans the
cool thing about the sprout is that I
can get a solid idea of the patterns and
shape of your model and fill in the gaps
itself I use the feature and I was
pretty happy with the results you can
use the quick editor after your scan to
do things like change the color or even
the texture of your model now what I
needed to do I needed a few more tools
which came in the shape of an app called
meshmixer with this app I was able to
really get my hands on the model and
start making the changes I needed to
make for this thing to become an actual
dog tag first thing I wanted to do was
get her name on it and with the mini
sculpting tools available that took no
time next I needed to make a hole in it
so I could loop it into my dog's collar
and surprisingly enough there was a tool
for that as well all that was left to do
was shrink it during the printing
process and I was able to do that when I
visited the sprout truck at Mei
pher it's insane to think that I took
something that already existed
manipulated it virtually with the sprout
and then created something new entirely
this might have gone over her head but
I'm sure she appreciates it but I gotta
say guys this thing is freaking cool and
if you have even the smallest creative
bone in your body
I can imagine some awesome stuff being
made with this guy but that about wraps
it up for this video guys the sprout is
awesome and if you want to learn more
about it feel free to check the links in

average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
