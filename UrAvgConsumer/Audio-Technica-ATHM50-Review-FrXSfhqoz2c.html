want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone a average consumer and today I
have a review for you guys of the a th M
50s
alright so it's not wasting time let's
get right into it alright guys so here
we have the a th M 50s one of the most
highly praised headphones for under $200
um and I must say they really do live up
to the height these are a great pair of
headphones and especially at the price
that you can find them for you can find
Ising these as low as one hundred and
eleven dollars on Amazon so these are
very affordable and you get a lot of
value for what you pay with these
headphones so it's really nice pair um
so let's talk about some of the aspects
of these headphones um first thing we're
gonna talk about is like the looks so as
in the design overall I think there are
pretty decent looking pair of headphones
they're not the best looker as far as
maybe going outside being seen with
these but um you know I don't think
they're meant to be used outside or
anything like that to be honest they are
monitor headphones so that means they're
really supposed to be used with like
computers and like home equipment and
studios things like that so I don't
think they're meant to look outside so
they're not trying to allow anyone as
far as looks not that they look bad or
anything but I just think are some
better looking headphones when you're
outside but overall it looks good it's
um it's pretty durable this is um
everything is very thick I think seems
to be um have some strong hinges it just
seems like a pretty good solid pair of
headphones I won't feel too worried
about you know maybe dropping these or
anything like that not that you should
but you know I wouldn't be too worried
if something like that were to happen
anyway because as you can see everything
is pretty thick on them like the hinges
are pretty thick the band is pretty
thick the ear cups are pretty solid so
as far as durability I wouldn't be
concerned with it at all
I know a lot of people like to
ask how much the um headphones can
stretch at the top while these can go as
far as this so they'll fit in your head
I wouldn't based on the material that
this is made out of I wouldn't risk you
know bending them all the way like you
can with like some soul Republic's or
anything like that but you know
headphones aren't meant to be bent that
way anyway so that's not really a
problem this goes as far as you wanted
to if you were to sit on it I'm sure it
can stand up to something like that so
as far as durability goes these got a
win for me and aside from that um based
on the whole design I think what they
really hit home with is own comfort and
honestly these have to be the most come
the most comfortable pair of headphones
I've ever worn um the SL 300 sold by
Ludacris used to hold that seat but
these are just definitely a lot better
you almost don't even realize that you
have them on which is really nice I've
seen some people say that the headband
doesn't have any support but um I don't
really find that to be true
I find that had been to be just fine the
ear cups are great they go completely
around the ear so you're definitely sits
in here just fine I'm happy it has the
oval shape so your ear fits in no
problem and you know they're just very
comfortable like I said the most
comfortable pair of headphones I've ever
used I could use these for hours without
even realizing it so I'm very happy with
that
this thing's got some good durability
some decent style and some really great
comfort very very nice and another
aspect of the design would be the cable
I'm very glad it's a thick cable so you
won't have to deal with tangles or
anything like that but one thing I did
find is I'm not too happy about the the
coil that you have here but to be honest
there is um there is a solution for that
there is the 88 M 50s that you can get
instead of the regular M 50s which has a
straight cable that's what the S stands
and so that won't be a problem typically
I just found this to be um a little it
made the headphones the cord the cable
seemed a bit heavy and when using off
the device and really weighted down
tilted it because of the weight that
came from this side so tips with my
devices a bit but I'm sure with the s it
will be just fine
another thing as far as the design is
that this headphone jack isn't really
doesn't play well with like a lot of
mobile device cases so here's an example
alright guys so here I have my HTC One S
and this is my typical phone for
everyday use as you can see I have a
case on here and of course the 3.5
millimeter jack is at the top and when I
try to use the M plug 1050 s into it I
get into a bit of a roadblock here with
the case so the case doesn't really play
well with the m50 s because of the flat
design around the cable input so that
tends to not go too well with these but
once i take off the case it's really not
a problem but it's just unfortunate that
i have to you know take off my case in
order to use these with my cell phone
device and as I said before the coil can
weigh down the device a bit see if I
loosen up on my grip you can see that it
tilts unless I give it some support with
my finger so that's just something to
think about not not a deal-breaker or
anything like I said there is the m50 s
that doesn't have this coil as a
straight cable so that's always an
option not really a problem just know
which one you're going to pick when
you're buying it now another thing about
these headphones that I like is that
they can kind of they have like a lot of
flexibility they can kind of do anything
you really want them to here's an
example you can see it does all kinds of
weird things it can move around have
headphones being opposite directions
really interesting stuff headphones can
kind of go just anywhere really which is
pretty cool I don't know what kind of
situations you'd want to have your
headphones like that but it's nice to
have the
have that flexibility and you know
doesn't take away from anything with the
headphones themselves it doesn't make it
a loser or anything like that so I mean
it's ad it's a welcome feature to be
able to do that with the ear cups and
now of course I know you guys want to
know about the sound quality what I
think how good I think the sound quality
is I must admit these are really great
sounding headphones really really great
probably the clearest headphones I've
heard today um honestly you just can't
complain about them at all they just
sounds really good um I am a really I
really love my bass I'm a bass head and
I think others who are bass heads as
well will um probably want something
else that has a little bit more bass
mouth to say that these lack it at all
these don't lack bass these have great
bass but I just like really heavy bass
and um you know just that's just my only
thing with them um I've heard others say
you can mess with like equalizers and
amps and stuff like that well I'm just a
regular guy I like to fiddle with my
settings too much or you know mess with
external devices like amps so I'm
probably not ever going to really use
things like that but I mean for as far
as what that's for what these give me
it's pretty good pretty good
like I said the cloudy beats anything
I've tried so far just wish it had a bit
more bass but I know that that's not
what these headphones are going for
these headphones are supposed to get
like an all-around experience and it
delivers on that very very well um I
don't know if your average consumer will
be able to get the full advantage of
these headphones
I know audio files love these but will
your average consumer really pick up on
all the all that beats headphones offer
I would highly doubt that they will um I
probably myself have not picked up on
how great everything sounds like the
treble mid ties lows all that kind of
stuff I probably don't know how just how
good these are but in comparison to
other headphones I have her
how clear they are so they're very clear
vocals sound great
like I said the bass is good everything
just sounds good
overall so we'll average consumer pickup
everything that these can do probably
not
but will they have a good listening
experience they definitely will and at
the value that you pay like you know the
pit the price you pay for these is a
steal you get you pay a small amount for
some really great quality and pretty
much that wraps up what I think about
these headphones guys great value
headphones great durability not the best
looker compared to some of the stuff
outside but that's not all these are
going for these are monitor headphones I
think these are a bit more for inside
use and know a bit more on that let me
show you guys what it looks like on
alright guys so now I'm going to show
you what the headphones look like on so
this is what they look like I think
they're a bit they're a bit on the
clunky side like I said I don't think
that these are the greatest for going
outdoors but they're not terrible but
they are a little a little on the bigger
side but um you know here they are
around the neck you can have a maybe
like this too but let me show you on my
head now looks like this we get this
right like this and this is the side
view
alright that's about it overall not bad
looking headphones but like I said there
are little more stylish ones out there
and um during once that wraps up my
review guys these are a great pair of
headphones very very good for the price
um really you can't beat the what you
forget out of these for the price you
pay you really can't beat that I'm very
happy with these I would recommend them
to anyone who really wants a deeper
deeper on listening to their music they
get more out of these than they would
probably a lot of the other headphones
in its price range so definitely a
recommendation from me and that's about
it guys I hope you enjoyed this video if
you did hit that thumbs up button and
leave a comment if you'd like alright

till then it's your average consumer
