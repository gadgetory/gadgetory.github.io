LG Gram 14 Review!</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2015-09-29</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P59xdHjCn-M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">and all right guys now let me start off
by saying this has to be one of the
lightest laptops I've ever experienced
this is the LG gram 14 now the LG gram
is the first laptop LG has brought to
the US and for first try it's quite
impressive
I'm loving the simple yet tractive
design as you can see here it comes in a
champagne gold color which I like
because it's actually pretty subtle it's
also got a carbon magnesium and lithium
magnesium body which is the stuff that's
used in race cars so it's light and
durable so let's take a look around the
Graham even though it only has 1/2 inch
thick profile it's equipped with an HDMI
port which you typically don't find on
laptops this size a micro USB port a
couple of USB 3.0 ports a micro SD card
slot power adapter port microphone and
some status lights for battery and
charging when you lift the screen you've
got a nice full size keyboard with
slightly lifted keys so it's comfortable
to use the trackpad is also fairly large
which is always nice what's great is
that even though this laptop is small
and extremely portable LG didn't make
any sacrifices in terms of giving you a
laptop equipped with all of the basics
and more this guy definitely stands out
when it comes to laptops and its weight
and size category
weighing in at roughly 2 pounds the LG
gram is lighter than the MacBook Air and
extremely portable and what's even more
interesting is that even though this is
around the same weight as the new
12-inch MacBook which you all know I
loved for its portability if something
about this laptops build and materials
that allows it to evenly distribute the
weight over a larger surface than a new
MacBook which makes the carrying
experience just as effortless and this
is perfect for me since I'm always
looking for a new place to get work done
and I tend to carry a lot of stuff
around so it's great that this doesn't
weigh me down you can expect
seven-and-a-half hours of battery life
and a solid-state drive that can be
configured up to 256 gigs making this
machine perfect for media lovers and not
to mention the screen is beautiful you
have 14 inches of
vibrant color with its 1080p IPS display
this makes watching your favorite shows
and even gaming extremely enjoyable the
viewing angles are great
I use this laptops in many different
places and at different angles with no
issues so for those of you who like to
do work or watch things in bed the
screen should be perfect and even though
this guy is light importable is still
packing a punch the gram is loaded with
an i7 processor which gives it enough
power to handle any word processing web
browsing and a lot more so whether you
need something for school or
professionally this should be able to
keep up with you during the time that I
view this as my primary computer I was
very pleased with my experience it also
has this feature called instant boot so
you can expect this guy to power up
really quickly whether you're starting
from fully off or sleep mode and of
course Windows 10 comes on this device
so you can have cool features like
Cortana or the new Microsoft edge
browser needless to say this is the PC I
can see myself grabbing whenever I'm
traveling and I need to get work done
quickly you honestly can't beat the size
and weight combo you get with this
laptop especially with that IPS display
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy that gives a
thumbs up I'll catch you guys in the
next video till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
