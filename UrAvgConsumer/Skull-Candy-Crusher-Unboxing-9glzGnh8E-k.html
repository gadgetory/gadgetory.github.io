consumer and today I've gotten unboxing
for you guys of the Skullcandy crushers
now you guys have been asking for this
one for ever like I get comments on this
every day people who's asked me to get
unboxings and all kinds of videos on it
so it's finally here on the channel so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it my my Bob Bob Bob club Bob and
all right guys here we have the
Skullcandy crushers and a lot of the
things that promoting here is bass you
can feel so from what I've heard this
has bass that has like a rumble feature
which is similar to the pulse wireless
headset and if it works like that I'll
be very impressed I love my pulse
wireless headset you guys know this and
to have it in a small form-factor like
this would be pretty interesting so
looking around the box you can see you
know Skull Candy logos all over you can
see the headphones itself and you can
see the headphones back here as well and
it gives you some more information about
that phones and yeah so let's get to
opening this thing this should be a
pretty quick unboxing I think get my
unboxing knife to pop the plastic there
we go
just some more stuff off yeah all right
so we get that out the way start peeling
this thing off and boom there goes the
plastic let's see so looks like we have
a little tab here skulls all over so
here we have it this is crusher so here
we have a user guide so let's see if we
can get this thing out so this is just a
user guide gives you some information
about it right pull this down boom so
let's see we've got a little pouch here
feel very nice feels very silky and of
course it has a skull on I'm not sure if
you guys can see that but it does have a
skull
on it there you go Skullcandy loves to
put a ton of logos good thing this skull
looks pretty cool so let's see what else
we've got we've got some rad a battery
here and the cable that it comes with
that's about it for the box so we're
going to put this back here and one
thing about this this retails for a
hundred bucks so it's not too expensive
compared to other headphones out there
so pull these out take out this battery
and boom and we've got another I guess
what is it a user guide or warranty
guide probably so boom you got that so
let's get to the bad boy itself
we've got plastic all pop this thing
open and boom these are huge ear cups
okay so here you have it these aren't as
small as I expected but they're not bad
the ear cups are just pretty pretty big
so let's see we've got a couple
interesting things here so let me give
you guys a quick close-up alright guys
so here it is
so it's interesting it's got these
little grilles at the bottom not sure
what they're for but also next to it you
have a 3.5 millimeter jack so that you
can plug in your cable and let's see
here you've got a slider and I believe
this slider is to control the base so if
it's too much you can bring it down or
put it up and let's see what else we've
got here up top there seems to be a
little latch that you can take the ear
pads off at least for this one and this
will give you access to the battery spot
so you can take this just pop it in
right now
all right so now if we've got that in
there let's see what else we've got here
and just close it up
and boom so batteries in of course
you've got a Skullcandy logo here I'm
not sure if you guys can see it but
there you go
so you've got that as well the ear cups
they're pretty soft they're not really
soft but they're you can they have a lot
of cushion so it's pretty big padding so
that's good
of course these are adjustable not very
very adjustable not very long but this
will definitely work for any sized head
I'm sure it's got a pretty interesting
headband it's not your typical cushion
here because it has these ridges so I'm
interested in seeing how this little
feel after a long period of time but it
looks like it can conform pretty nicely
to most head shapes though of that and
of course at the top it says it says
Skull Candy and that's about it guys the
band feels pretty thick it feels like it
can definitely withstand withstand a bit
so cool and that's about it for this
close-up and let's see I didn't get to
show you guys the cable yet so let's
open that up and it does come with in a
remote sort of so I guess you got
playing pause here
so you've got one button I'm sure this
will work for Android and iOS devices
you can play in pause and it has a mic
on it as well so there you go that's
that and that's about it for this quick
unboxing guys just wanted to show you
what the crushers come with and how it
looks in the box so like I said these
are only $99 but links will be down
below in the description to check out
other prices like on Amazon but that's
about it for this video guys if you
enjoyed it be the cool guy that hits the
like button and subscribe to the channel
for more content from me and I'll catch
you guys in the next video till then is
your average consumer
