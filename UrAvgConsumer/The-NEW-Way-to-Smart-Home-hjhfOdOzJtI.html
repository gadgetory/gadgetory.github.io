and I am here at Eva Berlin checking out
a ton of cool
LG thinkyou products and I know a lot of
you guys have been hearing the word AI a
lot recently and we're gonna talk about
that a bit and huge shout out to LG for
not only sponsoring today's video but
sending us out here to check out all
this cool stuff and it really got me
thinking how I would use all of this
stuff in my home and how it could fit
into someone else's so one of the
biggest components is this guy right
here this is LG's thinkyou speaker and
with this you'll be able to give it a
ton of voice commands
it has Google assistant built inside of
it so you can use Google assistants to
speak to it as well as like your TV even
these awesome not zuy is it what is it
not to Z these in the to Z seats which I
have fallen in love with while I was
here I can actually sit down on this
chair and ask Google to set up my TV
mode and you guys can check that out
okay Google talk to the to Z I'd like to
watch TV
yeah see this is the kind of living I
could get used to I need an A to Z in my
life so you guys can see that this thing
is awesome and it's really useful to
have Google assistant built right into
your television being able to talk to it
right from the remote and have it give
you all kinds of information based on
what you're looking for play a travel
documentary and just like that I can
throw up a bunch of search results so I
can pick the travel documentary that I
like to watch and just pick what I'm
watching for tonight so if you're home
you can come home tell it to kick up
your seat change the AC get it to a
certain temperature that you like kick
on a certain show so you got a lot of
control here and it kind of starts to
learning their habits and all the
different things that you like when you
come home which is part of the whole
thing qki part and it's cool that
everything is interconnected here so you
can control everything in your living
room but you can also expand that over
into the laundry area so over here
you've got some more thinking products
here we've got the LG twins watch this
is the twin Washington wash mini and
what's awesome is that with the
thank-you it all speaks to like your
phone so if you go ahead and put in some
laundry you can go ahead and check your
phone or ask the Google assistant how
much time you have left so you know
exactly once you need to go pick up your
clothing tell me that's not going to be
good for us lazy folks out there who
don't want to keep getting up and
checking it I think technology is moving
in the right direction folks now this
room I got really excited when I first
saw because we just got the new house we
see a ton of cool stuff in here that we
could personally use ourselves and over
here we have the instant view think you
now this is a smart fridge where you can
do a ton of cool stuff you can say
something like Alexa what's the weather
like in Berlin in Berlin Jilly it's 20
degrees Celsius
sunny skies how many fridges do you know
that can do that and this is also
connected to a lot of the other think
you products out there and now you guys
know area and I do not cook so if we
need to pull a recipe maybe you want to
make something for the first time we can
actually just pull up this little menu
right here hit recipe you know they got
some options buffalo chicken pizza and
what's cool is that since these are thin
cube products they speak to one another
so if we see the recipe we get
everything we need we can actually send
this to our oven and from here it sends
the recipe right over to the oven that's
down there and it'll preheat it and get
it ready to make buffalo chicken pizza
and the whole idea behind the thinkyou
line and having appliances be able to
communicate with each other is being
able to do cool things like have your
fridge mute the TV if you left it on
when you've got your dinner already so
it's the little things like that that
just kind of make it a bit easier to
work with your home appliances no matter
where you are in your home and we cannot
forget Chloe you guys might have seen it
in the Instagram TV video that I did
Chloe's gonna have some really cool
functionality coming but imagine being
able to just ask it to mow the lawn
that's mind blowing check us out
Alexa asked Chloe to mow the lawn
guys that is insane listen I would love
that for our house I wouldn't have to
step outside mow the lawn myself that is
it go look at this guy but that about
wraps it up guys that was a peek into
what a home could look like with a bunch
of LG thinkyou products having a I
control a lot of the things that we use
on a daily basis
to make our lives a little bit easier is
going to be awesome but hopefully you
guys enjoyed it if you did be the cool
guy or girl that gives this video a
thumbs up let me know what you would
think of having all of this cool stuff
in your home and I'll talk to guys in
the next one until then it's your
average consumer ace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
