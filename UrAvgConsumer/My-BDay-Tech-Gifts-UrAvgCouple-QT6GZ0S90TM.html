whether or not she should get another
Fitbit flex she had she had before but
she ended up getting rid of it because
she didn't use it that often I'm not
just gonna try it again
yeah actually did use it often I'd never
do it because I lost weight don't want
to lose anyone pay in charge again the
roller coaster of oh you're like a sling

be fine
have faith in you so we're all done at
the event she's alright yes Ana was
honored with the free samples man

actually already opened it here it is
right here

speaker power bank and it's waterproof
and it's got like a pretty tough design
so it's made to go out with you if

solid this thing is just like almost 200
bucks so very surprised to see that in a
gift bag and what else have we got here
