it's fine time to let you in let's check
it out now I've been working on this
room for a few months so it's finally
time to show you guys what I've been
working on so without further ado Alexa
start the game room so cool so guys
welcome to what I'm calling the ultimate
gamers paradise and I'm calling it that
because this room has just about every
aspect of gaming that you could expect
so let's start off with one of the
biggest ones here and that is the
console area so right here we have a
giant 65 inch samsung KS 8500 so this TV
has 4k HDR all the bells and whistles
that you'd come to expect now it's not
OLED that's back at the crib but this
one is actually a really nice TV and I'm
not a huge cable management guy but I
was able to get the cables hidden here
so it does have this nice little
floating effect on the wall and it even
has that with these uh so no speaker
system that I have here this is the play
bar so together they look like they're
just mounted on the wall like it's just
floating which is a really nice touch
but let's take a look at the TV stand
that I've got here since I've got quite
a few things on it so starting off from
left to right we've got the Amazon echo
dot now this little thing is actually
connected to these two speakers and
these are the JBL pulse and they're
actually here with a decorative look so
that you guys can see I'm rocking the
teal so it's flashing those tail lights
and the Amazon echo dot is connected to
it so with that I can actually speak to
it and it can actually produce some real
volume if I ask Alexa to play some music
it can do that really well with the two
speakers so going on we've got the Apple
TV this is the latest generation now I
don't really have much use for it here
but it's here as an option in case I
want to buy something from the iTunes
movie store or whatever but typically
with all the other things that I have
hooked up I don't use it that often but
moving on even though I have a Sonos
playbar in the sound system if I'm
playing games at night and I don't want
to
turbine e1 I also have the Astro a 50s
so if I'm late night gaming I want to
disturb anybody those will do the trick
and over here of course I have a
logitech harmony now this is going to
connect to a lot of the devices that I
have here so I don't have to have
multiple remotes always reaching for
another one this kind of connects them
all and just makes things a lot easier
when I want to control everything at
once and down here I've got this little
guy this is the nest security cam so
with this I can keep an eye on all them
suckers trying to get my stuff now just
joking but I do have to keep an eye on
my stuff just in case a lot of stuff
here so I want to be careful but I got
to show you guys the actual systems
hooked up to this guy you see fours over
here so you know there's an Xbox but
check it out right here I've got the
PlayStation 4 and of course I've got the
VR headset we've got some controllers
got a keyboard to use with it and leave
that at end of cable since the VR
headset needs so many but virtual
reality right here on the ps4 over here
I have the best-looking Xbox one not
counting the 1s and this is the halo 5
edition and I've got a couple of
controllers here as well the
best-looking controller for the Xbox one
this thing looks awesome and it works
really well with the theme of the room
of course I got an elite controller a
couple of other things so Xbox one and
I've got the actual cameras for both the
Xbox one and ps4 so even though I'm
wearing a ps4 shirt right now the Xbox
one get some love as well I don't pick
sides and on the last side we've got a
Wii you don't tell anybody but now I do
have a Wii U and of course I do have
some controllers here as well so people
want to come over and play I've got all
different options got that Smash
Brothers control over here so uh you
know if anyone ever wants to play with
you you can do that
but over here we have all of the games
now I also have some Gundams you guys
know I'm a huge fan of Gundam and I
build quite a few of them so I've got
them over here I've got some pokeballs
because you know I live that anime life
but over here I got all the games so
whenever you want to play a game over
here you just grab one off the shelf
now it's terrible because so many of
these games are still in the wrapping
over here we've got the collector's
edition of Star Ocean and that's in the
wrap got some more stuff in the wraps as
well so I don't know why I keep buying
games folks but I do it because I'm a
camera at heart I just need to find the
time to play it all and speaking of
games got to pay some homage to my
favorite series yet this is the Final
Fantasy series over here we've got Final
Fantasy eights main character squall
over here Final Fantasy tens Titus and
it just gives the room an awesome
awesome look and down here is where you
just kind of enjoy it all this is the
couch that I got pick this up from Ikea
and I've got some flip Philip huge
strips and lights all around this so
that it gives it a nice glowing effect
and I've also got the speakers for the
sono sound system these are the Sonos
play:1 zai believe so when you're
sitting down right in the middle
enjoying the really big screen you've
got the sound coming from the front and
two sounds coming from the sides so it
gives you that a surround sound feel so
it's really really nice alright guys
check this out this is what I call the
portable gaming section so over here you
can see I've got a portal a couple of
portable systems I've got some 3d asses
of course with some Pokemon on it
because you got two and Oh some 3d essex
cells and even a playstation vita
because the vita has my heart man just
we should have more games but you sit
down right in this chair this is a
special chair because it's got some
built-in speakers here so if you're
playing and you want to enhance your
portable gaming experience you plug this
in throw that volume up and you you know
you get an Enhanced portable gaming
experience just so that you're not
sitting here just playing it like this
you could play anywhere like this but
with the speakers in the chair adds a
little more depth makes it more
enjoyable and if a game has a good
soundtrack makes it even better
now what's really awesome about this
chair is that the speakers are right on
the sides of your head so you can really
hear it sounds great and down here
you've got some controls so that you can
actually increase the bass or you can
increase the volume however you want to
do it now this is the X rocker I'll of
course have links to this and everything
else I'll try to do everything else in
this video down in the description so
you can check that out but this is a
nice little setup guys I love it sit
down here play some games and you get
some really rock out now I know you guys
probably saw a P go over there but just
give me a second we'll get to that but
over here we have my Gundam collection
this is something I've worked on forever
each of these has taken countless hours
and over here we've got a giant one this
is a perfect grade this one takes the
time of like three of these easily and
then you know it's holding my special
plaque for a hundred thousand
subscribers you know we're on the road
to 1 million so if you haven't
subscribed yet and you're watching this
subscribe but yeah this is my collection
that I've amassed over time is taking
quite some time these all take forever
and I just like the way this is
showcased
since this game room is all about the
things I love I had to get this inside
of here so it kind of just looks great
and this isn't the only one I've
actually got another one over here and
this is these I didn't build myself
these are more like
pre-built but they're all pretty rare
very rare they're all from Japan
collectibles and they just look awesome
I don't know I also don't have to worry
about them falling apart because I built
them but these are really awesome and I
just had to have my Gundams you guys see
me put them into videos all the time so
I had to show them off here you guys
have seen this in a previous video but
this is what I'm going to be using as a
cool little set whenever I have products
probably pay something over
here it's got this a motorized desk so I
can move this up and down whenever I
want and you know I can build this out
however I want though whatever props up
there make it a nice little shooting
space and you know I got to have another
poster over here so it's not blend and
we've got a Vitara Aang the best avatar
that chorus stuff we don't mess with
that this is the stuff right here and
over here we've got this cool little
lamp I got from Amazon looks pretty
awesome it's got a lifx bulb inside of
here since the Phillip Hughes bulbs
don't change to this particular color so
I'm really trying to do the whole teal
thing in here and these balls were
actually able to help me do that alright
so I know you guys got a peek of this
already but this is the gaming PC now I
put a lot of effort into getting this
whole situation hooked up cable
management all that stuff but this is it
this is the desk this is the area this
is where I get my first real leap into
gaming on a PC thanks to main gear who
hooked me up with this gaming PC right
here which I'm calling flood now you
know teal is the main color of this room
white teal black that's kind of like the
theme here and main gear was able to
capture that perfectly with this system
now if you're wondering about specs
we've got two GeForce 1080s in here and
an i7 6700 a processor so if you want
all the details I'll have that linked
down below description I have all this
information in a much more detailed
video so stay tuned for that now they
were able to make a system for me that
was going to handle having three Acer
predator X 30 fours so I've got three
ultra wide screens right here so that I
can have a super super immersive gaming
experience and I've also even got the
oculus rift help up to this so if you
guys can see here this is the sensor and
I've got the oculus so like I said it's
going this room has like all the aspects
of gaming so we've got virtual reality
which is a bit better
than that PlayStation VR so that's over
here we've got the Xbox controller to go
with it now just actually taking a
quicker look at the desk we've got a
next desk which is also a motorized desk
so even though this thing is hooked up
and set up and wired up I can use the
desk to mount it this is about the safe
height over here so that I can still
have my cables hidden pretty decently
and not have everything rip and fall
apart so this pretty this looks pretty
good and it functions really well if I
want to stand so this is awesome over
here I have some audio engine a5s so
these are amazing they've got some
insane sound quality they're very
powerful
I've even got the subwoofer over here at
the bottom and they pack a punch I'm
afraid to even play it at max capacity
because my neighbors are going to freak
out but it's amazing and taking a look
at the peripherals I've got a steel
series K 800 keyboard so of course it's
matching the theme here and something I
really like is that when you hit a
button it goes into orange attention to
an orange key so kind of those UAC
colors the teal the orange kind of gives
a little odd to that and I even have two
Mouse's here now this is a bit
unorthodox because I just can't pick one
between the two of these
I've got Blodgett XG 900 which is a
really awesome Mouse but I got to say I
do like the SteelSeries mouse over here
because it has a couple of awesome
features like having my logo right on
the mouse this is insane folks so this
is a really awesome Mouse and it feels a
lot more ergonomic but they're just this
one's Wireless so you know they've got
their trade-offs I decided you know what
I can pick between the two whenever I
want I can just grab whichever one I
want at the moment so I've got two over
there and if you haven't noticed
everything is illuminated with RGB
colors so I got the colors here on the
mouse
this one's cycling through all the
colors and I even have a mousepad that
does it as well so all the colors are
represented here teal is real and it's
here to stay
of it even got my Sony here on
headphones though these this probably so
much green and teal going on over here
that you can't even see it properly but
these go perfectly with it as well as
this chair this is a Herman Miller chair
huge shot to Eric who's recording this
because she got me this for my birthday
so I was able to fit this into the room
really nicely now I've got my favorite
headphones over here and I can use these
whenever I want but I also have this
gaming headset because come on you gotta
have a gaming headset for the PC and
these are the logitech g930 threes now
this is awesome because it has the RGB
lights as well but of course I have it
so that it matches with the room so
these headphones these are awesome these
sound great they're super comfortable
and these are what I'm rocking with this
whole system and just check this out
guys side by side with the flood system
over here they go perfectly it's just
just such an awesome set of guys and we
didn't talk about this but this is my
favorite Gundam right here this is the
double-o riser 7 sword looks awesome he
has to be on the best with me his spot
is right here but he has to be on the
best because he's that cool and we've
got this little notification system
thing right here called the naughty now
with this when your phone goes off if
you get a missed call or your get a text
message or an app goes off you can
actually get a notification here or
changes color and this actually matches
with the room pretty well if I'm playing
a game and I'm like really immersed into
it and I'm not paying attention the
blinking light can go off and let me
know that hey there's some activity
going on on my phone so that's an
awesome little touch here and check
these out we've got some panels to kind
of give the desam style liven it up a
bit make it a bit more personable and
over here we've got this drawer that
holds the oculus of course on the
controller you guys saw that but in here
we've got quite a few phones from super
old-school phones like the very first
Android phone the g1 this is a baby
right here true true blue even though
it's not blue second drawer even more
phones they're just kind of just racking
up at this point
and down here we've got a few Android
devices Android wear devices and an
Apple watch there's the first version
but we've got quite a few options over
here and you guys know me and you know
how I do these are a bunch of Ziploc
bags with cables so I can always have
options readily available and he'll pick
this these are from select blinds
these are blinds that are motorized
there's a remote over there so I can
remotely do this but yeah I can
completely control these blinds from
afar this is really really cool I love
these kind of just makes having blinds
bit more futuristic that's how it's got
to be over here at UAC HQ and last but
not least I know you thought it was over
but I still got one more room to show
you guys come check this out this is
just a closet but it's an awesome closet
this is where I store all my headphones
I've got quite a few of them you guys
know I've been doing headphone videos
for years now and you know they kind of
rack up over here up top above them are
the boxes for all of my Gundams I'll
give you guys a more in depth video
about everything in here
check out those backpacks at the bottom
all tech backpacks baby if you guys want
to see more a more in-depth video about
what's inside of there let me know with
a comment down below give this video a
thumbs up all that good stuff and that's
about it for this video guys hopefully
