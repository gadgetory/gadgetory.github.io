average consumer and today I've got a
review for you guys of one of my
favorite headphones the v-moda m100 so
let's not waste any time
scare right into it and all right guys
here we have the v-moda crossfade m101
of my favorite headphones today and have
built up quite a reputation amongst
audio files and average consumers alike
but let's see if is worth your $300 the
m107 dust really look going for them
from the metal hinges to the metal
shields that are on the ear cups which
are interchangeable but we'll get into
that in a second the headband is also
quite nice but if you have the shadow
color you might run into some issues
with wear as you can see mine looks a
bit dingy after a while but the headband
is actually very very nice it's an
amazing headband very durable you can
bend these without any issues whatsoever
and you can actually bend these I
believe up to a million times is what
v-moda is promoting so you can expect
some longevity from this headband and
not really have to worry about it
snapping or anything like that
these are definitely very strong and
very sturdy the band itself doesn't have
a ton of cushioning but I don't have any
discomfort issues to report because of
this now as we take a closer look at the
ear cups of these headphones you can see
that they have little bolts on the
shield of the ear cups and that's
because the shields are interchangeable
and you can get all kinds of different
designs on them you can get different
colors you can actually go on the
website and customize it by putting on
things like logos and all that cool
stuff definitely a lot of options out
there to customize these to make them
exactly what you want them to look like
so thumbs up for that the ear cup
cushions are made of an Ergo soft memory
foam and these are supposed to make it
really comfortable but for me personally
after wearing it for a long period of
time it did tend to hurt my ears I had
to wear it for maybe about an hour in
order for it to not be an issue but any
longer than that did hurt my ears I'm
not sure if my ear shaped just didn't go
well with the shape of the over ear
cushions but it did hurt after some time
now looking at the actual inputs on the
head
phones you'll see that it has to now
this means you can daisy-chain and daisy
chain means you can share your music
with someone else who wants to listen
now taking a look at the cable you'll
see that it has a brave material on the
cable itself and what's really nice
about these cables is that it has a
raised input so you can use this with
any mobile device cases without any
issues and of course it comes with an
inline remote where you can use the play
and pause button with any Android or
Apple device with no problems and it
also includes a mic now it comes with
another cable with the same kind of
inputs but what's special about this
cable is it has another input that you
can put another pair of headphones in
while you're listening to your music so
you have the potential to do some really
crazy things here as you can see I have
my headphones connected to two other
headphones the 80 HM 50s and the master
tracks on the right and as you can see I
have one audio source and that's my cell
phone connected to the cable and I'm
daisy chaining to the other headphones
so three headphones listening to one
audio source now your audio quality
might take a hit from this but it is
pretty cool nonetheless now taking a
look at the actual form factor of these
headphones you can see that it can get
very very compact and that's one of my
favorite things about these headphones
because it's very very portable you can
kind of put these in anywhere and pretty
much be alright the case is tiny it's a
hardshell case but it has a very small
footprint and you can see I can pretty
much palm this in one hand and I don't
have very large hands so this is very
impressive to me and comparing it to
some other cases you can see other cases
just dwarfed this headphone case it's
tiny and in comparison to others they
look huge so definitely a thumbs up
there but in comparison to something
that folds up like the beats Wireless
case you'll see that it's pretty small
but it's still a hardshell case which is
great and now to get into the sound
quality the m102 have a great
combination of crystal clear sound and
thumping bass I don't think I've tried a
better pair of headphones in the m100
that deliver from all angles as well as
they do
they provide a very vibrant sound with a
lot of detail and Abdullah bass has a
very
presents it doesn't sound bloated or
overdone so you don't have to worry
about muddy sound quality here at all
and vocals are quiet clear so as I
mentioned before you'll get the full
package with these guys and I think what
surprises me the most is that these do
so well in the sound quality department
without requiring any batteries so
v-moda definitely gets a vote in my book
for doing a good job with these
headphones but of course it's time for
me to show you guys what it looks like
on and alright I'll show you guys what
it looks like on and here we have it and
as you guys can see it looks very very
compact it doesn't look good not just at
all it's not that big very happy with it
you guys can see here it's got a really
small footprint on the head stays close
to the head really really love the way
it looks um one thing to note when you
put it around your neck if you're not
listening for a moment or you just want
to take it off you don't want the ear
cups to go inward because they'll
definitely hit your throat so you kind
of want the ear cups to go like this
instead of like this because it just it
just won't work like you know straight
so you want it to have you like this so
it can be comfortable and yeah that's
about it um as I said guys I love these
headphones definitely one of my favorite
ones so far um they're really they're
worth it they're worth the investment if
you plan on getting these and I highly
highly do suggest getting them because
they're really just that good and that's
about it for this review guys great
headphones stylish great sound quality
great durability it's a total package
hopefully you enjoyed this review and
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then it's your average consumer
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
