and as you can see it is time for
another massive tech unboxing and just
taking a look at this guy this is
definitely the biggest one we've ever
done yet so like I say in every other
massive tech unboxing video grab your
snacks get ready to chill we're gonna
unbox a bunch of stuff check out a lot
of new tech so let's get started
now Ari I know you like to choose the
first one but one of these things is not
like the other this guy in in a box and
that's because we have a sponsor today
the guys over at Skullcandy sent out the
skull candy crusher Wireless and these
are actually pretty though so shout out
to skull candy for sponsoring today's
video but let's unbox this bad boy and
I'll show you guys what's inside you got
the crusher Wireless inside of a pouch
and of course you got some accessories
as well oh you get three free months of
youtube red so you got a little promo
code here today you can go ahead and
sign up for youtube bread you get three
free months and you can just sign up
once you buy one of these and obviously
YouTube red is great because it's ad
free you see some special content from
big youtubers and you can even play it
in the background so if you're jamming
out to some music you can do it
continuously while it's in back now
these are a pair of bluetooth headphones
and what's special about them is like I
said it has insane bass and that's
because it has this stereo haptic bass
here and this is a slider so you can go
ahead and control it and they've also
got 40 hours of battery life which is
crazy for a pair of bluetooth headphones
and even if you happen to kill that from
crazy listening you can always use the
audio cable that's included to continue
listening to your music and as you can
see they've got a pretty low profile
design so they can match your outfit
with no problem you don't have to worry
about big logos standing out these look
really nice and low-key so if you guys
are interested in picking up the crush
or Wireless and those three months of
free youtube bread definitely check the
link down below in the description I
already have a pair like I said of
clothes crusher Wireless so I'm gonna do
a giveaway so any of you guys can win
that pair right there uh I'll have links
down below in the description to a
giveaway for that the details will be
there I'm gonna be doing a lot of
giveaways in this video so you're gonna
want to stay tuned now I'm not re you
pick the first box all the time
but I've got to pick this one what I've
got to do it I've got to do it
and that's because I know it's inside of
here ah
this is a special one so I gotta open it
up first
boom here we are it's from YouTube baby
and you guys know what's inside of here
clear the table
this is my gold play button right here
it a million subscribers a million
awesome folks like you I've decided to
follow me for just some average everyday
reviews I don't know but I appreciate it
all 100% this is the gold play button
how it feels it feels amazing it feels
amazing to have you guys in my corner to
help this all happen and so because of
that I got to give back a little
something and that's why we're gonna be
doing a buttload of giveaways in this
video and let's just keep going alright
so now that we've got that done you can
go ahead and pick a box re you want you
want jump right for it okay oh yeah
there we go our pokemon ultra son and
ultra moon listen I don't even know why
we picked this up honestly we have not
even played Pokemon Sun and Moon we
didn't do it so we're super behind we
got to play those and then these but uh
we have to pick them up nonetheless
let's get to the next one alright let's
see so over here oh okay yeah so this is
a power port
it's a USBC hub so this guy is going to
be able to charge the iPhone eight eight
plus and ten with quick charging now the
reason why I picked this up is because
this goes for 50 bucks how much does the
fast charger that Apple sells go for 50
bucks but the benefit here is that you
also get four USB ports so you can
charge most
four things at once now the thing is you
can't just pick up any old USBC adapter
with a high wattage to try and charge
your iPhone you're gonna have to get one
that says USB PD so that is very very
important because that's the only one or
the only standard that charges the
iPhones quickly oh and this came from
the guys over at I fix it so they sent
me their little toolkits
oh okay so right here we have the
essential electronics toolkit so if
you're into fixing electronics you're
into fixing phones and all that good
stuff this is a toolkit that you want to
pick up oh this is a nice kit though
this is like high quality stuff and
right here we have the protec toolkit
and this is more so what I would want to
carry around at all times except that
this is this is actually serious this is
a big deal right here this thing is no
joke oh that's nice - look at this stuff
this is high-quality gear this is a nice
nice kit Wow
alright this is awesome but we got a lot
to go through all right so what is Oh
xbox say no more Oh custom controllers
baby
nice Oh guys those guys that Xbox look
at this so this looks this looks like a
very Star Wars II kind of controller
it's got the galaxy look to it with the
black and the blue oh so I get two
copies of a Star Wars Battlefront for
Xbox one alright so I got a bunch of
codes here so boom here's one code for
one of you guys Congrats to whoever just
got that and the other one I'm going to
be throwing up on Twitter so I'll have
links down below in the description and
you know what boom here's another code
there did a little giveaway there's
gonna be more hay destroying this box
it's a pair of j-bird runs alright we
just did one we open one of these in the
last one so we got to giveaway link will
be down below in the description if you
want to try and enter this one okay this
is a good day so far that Hercules stuff
right there this is a speaking case for
the iPhone 10 oh this is one of those
thin ones that I purchased I'm a big fan
of speaking cases I really like them but
you seem to be really good quality and
they usually look really nice so this so
this is it
uh I don't know how I like this um
material here I don't like hard shell
cases are typically like speaking cases
you guys have heard me say it but this I
don't like so I'll pass on this what is
this the thin fit yes or no Oh Harry
here we go yeah the Pokemon to the SXL
we bought this a while ago but we didn't
open the boxes because we knew we had to
do this video so Abby's been holding out
she's the one who bought this ready kind
of can I open it alright well it's got
the charger I guess all the two DS xl's
now include the charger which is nice
oh that's nice oh yeah oh you can press
them you can press the button oh the
black is glossy while the red and the
white is pretty flat it's like matte but
I really like the color here like the
bread looks great I like the contrast
between the red and black this looks
good
yeah oh lucky you man this is nice I
should have picked one up I'm gonna go
for this one
next I promise but then we got to get to
some of this other stuff you got some
bigger things to give away okay so this
right here is the invoke for Microsoft
and I think Harman Kardon so they
collabed and came out with their very
own speaker
so this is their version of like the
Amazon echo rule home but with Cortana
this this looks really high quality
though I'm not sure how great Cortana is
gonna be in terms of competition for
like the Google Voice is too thin and
Alexa crap stop listening but this is
interesting to see Microsoft get their
foot in the door if you guys want to see
a video on that you gotta let me know
alright guys so we are finally getting
to this guy this is a giant wooden crate
but it's from the folks over at Origin
PC so I'm pretty sure you know what's
inside of here how many of these are
there okay six alright this is the last
group to finally see this baby and we're
greeted with a box of course it makes
sense though oh man this is insane so
this is their box I guess this is where
they have all their details and
information and cables plus a t-shirt
okay we got some swag this is bigger
than I expected alright I'm gonna get
this guy out and unveil it to the world
yo I like this not this is clean so it's
painted on and this is actually origin
pcs millennium case so this is one of
their best top-of-the-line
pcs okay so we took out some of the
packaging some of the tape that was
around it some of the stuff for when
it's in transit to keep it safe and this
is what we have guys this is a pretty
amazing build and this thing has so much
power so I am super hyped this thing is
a beast on the spec sheet so for those
of you who are interested this has an
Intel Core i 9 processor 18 cores which
is absurd and we've also got 64 gigs of
ram which is also insane and the
graphics card we're rockin an NVIDIA
Titan XP so is one of the best
cards on the market this thing is insane
I am so height guys not to mention this
thing is also liquid cool and see that
color there guys
that's that teal baby of course if you
guys want a more detailed spec sheet I'm
gonna be talking about this a bit
further in my gamers paradise video you
guys know I need to have an insane beast
in that video and I know probably some
of you guys are wondering what happened
to flood well flood is still here flood
is just gonna be somewhere else this is
gonna be the main machine powering
everything but at least one thing I want
to do with you guys is power it on for
the first time
you ready re yeah let's do this oh we've
got that tail going baby
that's serious Oh check this out I got
the LEDs right here on the sides - oh
that's dope
that's dope you guys are gonna see this
baby in the gamers paradise video and if
you're also excited for the gamers
paradise video be sure to hit that like
button let me know you guys can't wait
I'm stoked
I am ready what's this military lens ik
compass with LED light oh okay Xbox once
again baby
so over here we got a gamer survival kit
what's in this freshener hand sanitizer
you got pocket tissues vitamin C advil
you even got a lifesaver in here to keep
your breath minty fresh
you got a lollipop you got some suckers
in here okay what's this chicken chunks
white cooked are you hold up are you
serious
so this is these are like rations so if
you out in the wilderness you got cooked
white chicken chunks what the heck yo
Xbox these guys are crazy we got two
controllers again all right Ari I'm
gonna have to pass on you somebody's got
to get one of these somebody's getting
one of these now this is good
this this really matches that World War
2 vibe what's this Call of Duty and down
Mint rally of the troops
multiplayer challenge all of this is no
I'm good I'm good I'm good but over here
we got two copies of World War two man I
already got it so uh more giveaways you
know what
boom here's one for whoever's fastest
watching this video and another one is
gonna be giving away links down below
you know Microsoft gives the best
packages ever alright so this is the top
lock one smart fingerprint padlock so
this is pretty cool so if you ever
needed a padlock that was smart
this is the one to get so instead of
your typical dial then you dial in the
numbers to try and unlock it this thing
uses your fingerprint all you do is put
it in here unlocks it now I'm not gonna
set this up right now but if you guys
are interested in seeing this in another
video let me know down below but I think
that this is really cool let's just kill
off these envelopes oh no I get two of
these dang it this is another one of
those spigen thin fit cases oh this one
doesn't seem as hard though it's still
probably gone passed though oh yes the
surface book - I have been waiting for
this now I'm a huge fan of the original
surface book and I could not wait once I
heard that this got announced this is
gonna be crazy well maybe some of the
specs to you guys so this has got a core
i7 processor nvidia geforce gtx 1060 so
it's got a 1060 graphics card inside of
here and I don't know if you guys have
ever seen the surface book but this
thing is flat it's also got one terabyte
of storage and 16 gigs of ram alright
this is a big box this is the 15 inch
version so with the second iteration
Microsoft announced a 15 inch version
well as a 13 inch version so you can
pick the size that works for you but the
15 inch version is the only one that
houses the 1060 graphics card so what's
nice about this is that it has all the
typical i/o but they include a USB C
port so for all the people who are
complaining about no USB C on any of the
surface products it finally has it this
is it this is nice that is all screen
and what's nice is that this is
detachable so that if you want to take
this off and go into tablet mode you can
do that this is nice
I cannot wait to power this up all right
so here we have what is what oh wow is
this from Mike oh wow Mike oh actually
came out with a portable docking kit for
the Nintendo switch which was supposed
to be a lighter easier version than the
original dock but I actually found an
alternative to this because this one
took so long to come out okay so this
kit comes with a dock a an HDMI cable as
well as the power brick so it has
everything that you need to get your TV
and your switch connected it has all of
the standard ports that you would come
to expect so uh took long enough but
it's here alright and over here we've
got some echo products that I ordered a
while back i pre-ordered these and I
guess since I never opened up these
boxes I didn't know they were actually
came in and let me be honest with you
guys I really don't know how beneficial
it is to get an echo plus or even the
second generation echo over the standard
one so this is going to be something
that takes some real testing the second
generation is smaller so there's that
benefit but this echo plus it says
built-in smart home hub I'm not sure
what that means the regular one can
control all your smart home stuff so I'm
gonna do some testing I'm gonna let you
guys know if these are actually worth
picking up if you this is on your radar
but uh yeah I'll get to these later
so and you know what let's get to some
of the really good stuff
some of the good stuff here is going to
some of you guys oh snap due date cut
oh they pack up they packed a lot of
stuff in here we got one of their
backpacks so this is a Razorback pack
right here I think is this one like
they're stealth or something I'm not
sure what it's called this says
Razorback pack but this is actually
really nice love the smell of a new
backpack let's see we've got a razer
blackwidow okay chroma v2 tournament
edition this is gonna be in a giveaway
we're giving this away for somebody this
oh I actually really wanted this the
dual sided gaming mouse mat this is the
best feel of v2 dang I'm making a mess
okay so this is like a two piece set so
you throw this piece down so this is
like a little wrist rest for you and you
can throw this on top of it so if you
want a fabric side and go ahead and use
that but if you need something with a
little a little harder a little more
firmness you can use this side as well
so this is cool when it comes to
peripherals Razer is pretty legit man
I'm gonna find a nice place to put it
over there okay and we've got the Razer
Kraken 7.1 v2 this is also going to one
of you guys your razor King to hook us
up
razor basilisk okay now I want to see
what this is but I feel like feel like
we got to keep the giveaway train going
but that's also going to one of you guys
hold the razor base station chroma nice
this is a headphone stand and it has RGB
lights and it also is going into the
gamers paradise doh
all right guys we're winding down but we
still got some crazy stuff inside of
here this is from Gundam Planet you guys
you guys know I gotta have a Gundam okay
so this right here
is a high-resolution wing zero this
thing is dope but my boy curial Ventura
already got to one of these for me I'll
have his profile up to Instagram link
down below if you guys want check out
his work but the guy's just he's a
master of what he does the fact is this
Oh Astro oh the Astro a10 and over here
we have the Astro a 20s so these are
like the entry-level wireless headset
for people who want to buy Astro
headsets so this is for the ps4
I like this if this is anything like the
a-10s this should be very durable you
know this is this is legit so now
they're worried about durability which
is nice
this feels this feels good but um I'll
have links to these and everything else
that's you guys have seen in this video
down below in the description along with
all the giveaway stuff and the last box
oh yeah baby
our Xbox one X Scorpio edition baby so
now you guys know I already got the
standard for whole lot
sonic forces yes I can't wait I cannot
wait okay back to this but yeah this is
the Xbox one X square P o edition you
guys know that I already got the
original one but uh I'm working on that
review don't worry it's coming and in
that video there's gonna be a giveaway
yeah you know it but you guys got to
stay tuned for that it's coming
oh no this is a very different unboxing
experience this is pretty pretty
standard even though it is the Scorpio
edition and for those of you wondering
what the difference is between the
project Scorpio edition 1x versus the
normal one you pretty much get Project
Scorpio written right down the middle of
the controller here so that pretty much
an indicator that you've got one of the
first Xbox one X's and you also have it
right here on the side of the 1x so it
says project Scorpio here and project
Scorpio here in green and from what I
can tell that's pretty much it that's
the only real difference is there's a
color different but that about wraps it
up for this video guys we got a ton a
ton of tech here just some you cool you
want to go alright but yeah guys we've
got a ton of stuff here lots of things
to be given away we already gave away
some codes but there will be more codes

thank you to you guys for making
something like this possible you guys
