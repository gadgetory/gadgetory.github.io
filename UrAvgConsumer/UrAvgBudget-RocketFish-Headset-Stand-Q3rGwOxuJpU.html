consumer and today I've got a new video
for you guys it's going to be the first
video of the year average budget segment
and in this segment I plan to show you
got some lower price but quality
products that should fit your budget and
the first item that I'm gonna have for
you guys today is the rocket finish
headset stand now you guys have been
asking me a ton about this because you
see it in my reviews and you want to
know a little bit more so I'm gonna be
doing an unboxing and so it'll be a
quick unboxing I might do a review in
there as well so let's not waste any
time let's get right into it alright
guys here we have the rocket fish
headset stand now these are very cheap
but I really do like them I got them
from Best Buy
I believe they don't they're on sale now
for about $7.99
I actually saw them on sale online
through an email for 5 bucks
so you guys can get this for really
really cheap so um I actually got this
one for 5 bucks and I saw them in stores
for 8 online for a at $7.99 so
definitely be sure to grab it it's not
it's very inexpensive and it's a really
nice stand but enough talking let me get
to the unboxing of it so we've got a
little bit of tape here on the side so
we're gonna pull out this blade they are
the unboxing knife rather and kind of
slip this open put this away and
all right so we got that open see and
it's pretty is pretty simple packaging
this is all there is to it and like I
said I knew this would be a quick
unboxing so I'm going to do a little
review of it as well boom there you go
unboxing done so we're gonna put the Box
away and here we have the headphone
stand now what's really cool about this
headphone stand is it's made of plastic
but it's like a very durable tough
plastic it kind of has a chrome look to
it but it is plastic but it still looks
really good the bottom is weighted and
it has like a soft padding so it's not
gonna like scratch up any surfaces or
anything like that
but you don't have to worry about it
tipping over or anything like that
because it is weighted at the bottom it
does have the little rocket fish symbol
here I'm not sure if you guys can see
but yeah here it is the rocket fish
symbol and what's really cool is that in
the back of the stand you have these
little um I don't even know what to call
this but these little parts here that
you can tie your headphone cable around
and just get it inside there so that it
won't be loose or anything like that so
this is really cool feature as well and
I'm give you guys some examples of how
it's gonna work with some headphones and
first and foremost here we have my
PlayStation pulse headset as you can see
I can just throw it on there and it
looks pretty good no problem it's not
gonna tip over easily I can have a move
or jingle around a bit and as you can
see it's not gonna fall it's pretty
sturdy because of this weighted bottom
but I wouldn't go it down too hard from
the front because as you can see it can
kind of tip over from the front side but
side to side is not a problem the front
is probably the only place you wouldn't
want to drop it forward and also when
you have a cable and I'll attach one
here what you can do with it is as you
have the cable here you kind of just
throw it in the back and I don't know if
everyone can do it differently you can
kind of wrap it around do stuff like
this but personally I don't I don't like
the whole wrapping thing so
just kind of go like this hold it down
to work like this and they're you know
pretty simple and easy to to do it's not
it doesn't take long or anything and
boom there goes my cable in the back
headphones over here good to go and then
this is pretty much just pretty much it
and it looks really good in the matter
what kind of headphones you're putting
on there let's see some examples of some
other stuff okay we've got it with the
beats Wireless and here we've got it
with the beats Wireless and it's cable
and here we have it with the Bose QC 15
and of course here it is with the cable
here we've got it with the subject
bluetooth headphones and of course here
we have with the monster inspirations
and here you can see it with its cable
and here we have with the H th M 50s and
this has the coiled cable so it's a
little funky but you can make it work if
you really want to as you can see here
it's still a little ugly though I must
admit but if you really want to make it
work somehow boom there you go so pretty
much guys I showed you with a couple of
different headphones they all look great
with it no matter what except for this
mm weird looking cable in the back but
overall it does well it holds the
headphones like you would want it to and
it just really does a good job and it
looks great all right guys I can't
recommend this headphone stand enough it
really does a good a good job at what
it's made for like I said it doesn't tip
over anything unless you're really
moving it forward other than that I
can't say anything bad about it it's
really good stuff it is plastic like I
said before so keep that in mind if you
think plastic is cheap or anything but
overall good stuff and this has been the
first video for the your average budget
segment if you guys like videos like
this feel free to let me know and I will
try to keep it going
alright guys this is your average
consumer until the next video
