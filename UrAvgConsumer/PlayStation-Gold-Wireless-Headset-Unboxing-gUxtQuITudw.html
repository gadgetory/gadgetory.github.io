consumer and if you need a proof that I
read all your comments and listen to
your request here it is the PlayStation
gold wireless headset and you guys know
I love my pulse wireless Edition and
picking up this guy almost feels like
blasphemy but I picked it up because you
guys wanted to see an unboxing and
review and also a comparison so I'm
going to get to doing all that but we're
gonna start off with the unboxing today
and hey let's not waste any time let's
get right into it Bob Bob Bob and all
right guys here we have the PlayStation
Gold wireless stereo headset and in the
front of the box you'll see the headset
itself and you'll also see that it's
compatible with the ps4 ps3 as well as
the PS Vita turn to the side it'll tell
you some more information about the
headphones as well as the compatibility
and in the back it will give you some
information about the headset itself
some of the features like 7.1 virtual
surround sound custom audio modes
rechargeable battery and a hidden noise
cancelling microphone and that's the
question I got a lot about the pulse
wireless headset where's the mic well
this and the pulse wireless headset both
have built-in microphones and that's
about it for the box really so let's get
to opening it we've got some tape up
here now I can't find my unboxing knife
so I'm going to be using this thing now
shout out to anyone who knows what this
is from but let's see if I can get this
thing open alright so I'm put this thing
to the side let's see here and it feels
like it's a box within a box and looks
like I'm right so I can pull this out so
we can put this to the side over here
and let's see what we've got greatness
awaits and please lift tray for
accessories and we'll pull it out so
this is the tray this is the accessories
but I'm going to put this to the side
now and here we have the headset but
let's put this over here and see what
kind of accessories we get first
so we've got quite a few things in this
box so of course we've got let's see
safety guide a Quick Start Guide of
course the little dongle that comes with
this so you can plug this into your ps3
or your ps4 eye or also your PC as well
and then you can start listening to
audio from here we've also got a 3.5
millimeter audio cable and I think this
is about four feet so it's got some good
length to it nothing too special here at
all just a regular audio cable so you
can plug this into your Vita or any
other device this can be used with any
device that has a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack also you've got a USB
cable this charges with a micro USB so
this can be charged with pretty much a
phone charger any kind of charger really
so very standard stuff here very short
cable to be charging this I'm not too
crazy about this at all
and what's also nice with this is that
it comes with a travel pouch not some
something that the pulse didn't come
with which I would have loved but here
we have it and it's got some nice little
blue going here it's a very nice pouch
so hats off to that so now we'll get
some of this plastic out of the way and
go to the bad boys themselves so let's
pull this out and of course it's wrapped
in a bunch of plastic and this place got
messy really quick go ahead so let's
pull this out see what we've got
these things are always a little
difficult to get out this is a big long
piece of plastic and I have to fold it
all the way back and boom
finally it's undressed you can get rid
of this piece of paper here and here we
have it now these really remind me of
the first iteration of the wireless
headsets it's got the big fit band and
really huge ear cups these are really
really big hmm they feel pretty soft
though feels like it would be very
comfortable it's really cool that these
are foldable the other versions were not
foldable so this is a bit more portable
especially when you're going to be using
this travel pouch so this is really
really nice edition and this is a very
blue headset and a lot of blue but it
feels very comfortable at the top the
cushion feels really good um decide the
ear cushions feel pretty good as well a
lot of nice space for your ears and let
me show you guys around the actual
buttons and stuff like that
alright so taking a look around the
actual headset we'll start with the
sound to chat volume buttons so you can
switch between sound and chat from the
game or your party by clicking on these
buttons before the older versions had a
slider where you would just slide it
between so now you have to actually
press buttons to kind of toggle between
the two and on the side you'll have the
off switch as well as the one switch
which will turn it on in regular mode
and then two will turn it on with a bass
boost mode I'm not sure how much bass
this thing has it's definitely not going
to beat anything on the bass impact
level but we'll see how that goes here
you have your 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack as well as your micro USB port here
so you can charge it up as well as a
mute button over here and on the side
you have your volume controls now on the
other side you don't really have
anything at all and there's also a
internal mic so I'm not sure we're
exactly where that is out here it goes
so it's on the left ear cup it's
actually a little hidden behind here and
that's about it now what's really cool
with these guys
you might not have known about is that
this thing has a faceplate but you can
actually take this off let's see here
there you go so you can take these off
and customize it so it's going to be
interesting to see what third-parties
come out with what sony comes out with
but you will be able to change this and
customize it to look the way you wanted
to so that's a cool little neat feature
and pretty much that's about it for this
close-up guys this has been the gold
wireless headset and that's about it
guys I'm going to have reviews and
videos and all kinds of good stuff about
these headphones so definitely stay
tuned for that and this only retails for
a hundred bucks so this is a little less
expensive than the pulse wireless
headset so you've got some savings there
but I'll have a link down below in the
description so you can check it out
now I'm going to compare this umm and
see how this works I'll probably see if
I have a ton of you guys now on my
friends list so I'm gonna see if I can
maybe throw some of you guys in a party
and just check out how it is maybe play
some games with some of you guys but
