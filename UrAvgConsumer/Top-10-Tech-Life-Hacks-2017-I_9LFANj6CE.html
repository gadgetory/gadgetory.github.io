version 2 of the top 10 tech life hacks
so let's get started so you know those
sites have say five dollars off of your
first order 10% off of your first order
well I found a way to make it so that
you can have those discounts more than
one you can have it 5 times 10 times 20
times and what's out creating multiple
email addresses simply take your regular
email address - your office girlfriend
at gmail.com
and if I already use your average girl
Senji maqams to get a discount then all
I have to do is this yeah rich girl
friend plus sign and any word I want so
if I want to use the word cat I can do
that so your average girl friend plus
sign casts a gmail comm if I enter that
then the website will register that as a
brand new email and I get that discount
and no worries the email that came from
all those different accounts are all
streamlined into the back to the
original account so you can simply press
unsubscribe if you're getting too many
emails now I couldn't just leave all the
glory to area so here's one of my
favorites if you just picked up a brand
new phone or maybe you're borrowing a
phone from someone you know and you
don't happen to have a sim ejector tool
in sight all you'll have to do to swap
your SIM card is use an earring most
should have no problem fitting into the
little hole of the SIM ejector so if you
happen to rock one of these you've
always got a sim eject tool on you I'm
not even going to lie this earring has
saved me on multiple occasions and third
on this list is for you selfie lovers
out there if you're like me and you love
a good selfie but don't want to ask like
fumble around with the camera apps to
press the center button then you'll love
this tech hack simply take any prayer
vessels that come with an inline remote
I have my iPhone 7 have phones here open
your camera app ever holds V headphones
on my size you can't see them but put my
hand on the up or down button stop for
the perfect selfie and press the up or
down button and boom you have a clean
selfie now here's an interesting little
hack if you happen to use snapchat you
might have noticed that that camera has
unlimited zoom what that basically means
is that you've got a low-key telescope
right in your pocket now don't get me
wrong this thing does not have good
quality when you zoom in because it's
doing it digitally so the quality is
going to be pretty bad if you zoom in
very very far but if you're far away
from like a sign or something or
something that you want to see you can't
read you can
use that to zoom in really really close
and get a better idea of what you're
looking at and this one is for all of
you good Samaritans out there if you
happen to find a lost iPhone you don't
know who the owner is
simply ask Siri who do you belong to so
lots of it who do you belong to I
believe this belongs to Mario now it
says the first thing but on the lock
screen it shows all the information will
show the first and last name the number
emails that's already programmed into
the phone and you can find the rightful
owner alright so number six is a little
bit sketchy but it can be used as a last
resort if your laptop tends to get
really hot when it's laid out on a
surface you can use two forks okay it's
a lot of sketchy but you can use two
forks and put it under the laptop and
then to actually give this some space
between the surface and the laptop so
that the fans can get that air
circulating more and kind of get it to
cool down
me personally I had a really old laptop
that I used to use that will get hot
whenever I had it on a surface so
something like this would have been a
lot of help back then even if you're not
using it to cool down your laptop you
can use it to elevate it to give you a
better typing position and I really like
this next one this is for those of you
who actually like to study for your
exams so basically all you have to do is
type this into the Google search bar and
into the brackets where it says subject
to the subject back in the day I loved
algebra and I would love to study for it
so I probably type in algebra I knew
about it and a list of different
practice tests will be generated so you
can test yourself a secret actually
ready for that quick now for those of
you who live by Microsoft Word you know
how annoying it is to write a whole
sentence with caps lock on now instead
of having to go ahead and delete the
whole sentence and type it out again all
you have to do is highlight it hit shift
F 3 and it will swap from uppercase down
to lowercase now that solves a lot of
headaches but if you want to do the
reverse you can also switch lowercase
letters into capital letters and if you
want you can also switch it for that
every first letter is the capital and if
you're an average email user then you
probably know about this type life hack
but if you're not you need to switch to
Gmail quick because it's pretty awesome
basically FEMA has a setting that allows
you to
new emails that you already sent and you
can do this between five seconds up to
30 seconds from when you sent your email
that's a lot of time so let's imagine
you sent a love letter to someone but
needs our cold feet you can quickly undo
that within 30 seconds or even more
practical use if you sent an email then
quickly realize you had a grammatical
error too you can unsend it fix your
mistakes and then send it so that you
don't barish yourself now the last one
is pretty interesting if you happen to
be here on YouTube and you see a video
that has something really funny and
would make a good gift all you have to
do is type gif before YouTube in the URL
and it'll take you to a spot where you
can actually make a gift right from that
video and it's actually pretty easy to
use so if you have no experience making
gifts this is a good place to start
alright guys that about wraps it up
hopefully you enjoyed it if you've got
any cool tech life hacks that you use

below maybe we can use it in the next
video yeah and if you like this tag team
action we had going on here throw us a
link and also let us know down in the
comments alright guys till next one with
your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
