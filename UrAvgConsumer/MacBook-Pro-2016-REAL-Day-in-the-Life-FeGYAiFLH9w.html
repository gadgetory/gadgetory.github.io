and it's time for a day in the life with
the new MacBook Pro with its new touch
bar now we're going to be spending a
full day with the new MacBook Pro and
since it has a few changes we're going
to see how those changes impact the day
to day or of course gonna take a look at
the performance and of course how that
new touch bar works so today we're
spending the day with this guy
the MacBook Pro new one with the touch
bar 15 inches so let's see use unlock
with touch ID there I go some social
blade for you
now obviously this doesn't have the
ports so I've got some of the gear that
I mentioned in my top 5 accessories
video so this is the Satechi hub plug
that guy in and with that I can use my
Final Cut Pro and all that good stuff
but I did just drop a new video so I
should probably respond to some comments
as you guys know I do and try out this
keyboard and as good to just respond to
you guys because I mean I'm killing two
birds with one stone here luckily trying
out this new keyboard this is a
butterfly 2 keyboard now Apple made this
with their 12-inch MacBook and I did not
like it it will it felt way too flat but
this feels a lot better and it's
something you can get used to over time
I just couldn't get used to the 12 inch
now something that I can't get over and
I'm not getting used to at all
is the giant trackpad now if you guys
look here this thing is massive it's way
way larger than the original MacBook
Pros and it's actually not as much of a
blessing as I thought it would be
because I tend to rest my palm on the
trackpad as I'm doing stuff and I
usually ends up with this happening palm
on the trackpad try to click something
and that's a right-click it is so
annoying and I was able to replicate
that on first try so just think about
how often that happens to me when I'm
just trying to browse look at that uh
and I went back definitely not what I
want to do I don't know I got to get
used to it maybe it's a matter of me
learning to work in the mid
the trackpad but it's a learning curve
and it sucks now while I may personally
not find any real use for a much much
larger trackpad it's going to be good
for some creators artists people who
tend to use the trackpad for getting
some creative work done yeah I just got
to get used to that but I know you guys
are probably wondering mostly about this
touch bar now I have some mixed feelings
about this I'm definitely excited to see
this thing develop and grow but I do
have some qualms with it some things I
don't really like think that I dislike
the most about this is that it falls
asleep so if you're doing something and
then you need to hit the escape button
let's say you're watching a video you
got hit the escape button you got to tap
it and then tap it again whereas with a
regular MacBook Pro you could just hit
this gay bar and boom you're done IRAs
actually been having her own issues with
the touch bar so as you can see you can
hit emojis of course but sometimes they
don't work for her obviously it works
here but it's infrequent really so she
might have she might be able to use two
sometimes but a lot of the times now I
think she's had a few tries where they
just didn't work now for Thunderbolt 3
ports like it or hate it one thing
that's really cool is that you can now
charge it on any side usually it's on
the left over here depending on where
your outlets are you can just plug in
and as you can see this is me in the
middle of an edit right now I'm pretty
much done with this one this is going to
be an exciting video if you have not
seen it I don't know when
which of these two videos will go up but
I'll have this video linked down below
in the description one cool thing though
just so you guys can get a sneak peek is
that the speakers on this are amazing
check this out what's going on everyone
at your average consumer and this right
here behind me is what I'm calling the
fire setup alright guys right now I'm
just packing up because I'm about to
head over to
to office because he has the new LG 5k
monitor in there and I'm gonna see what
it's like to edit some video there hey
guys this is Austin
not really obviously this is Austin's
office but over here we have the LG 5k
display now this is going to go
perfectly with the new MacBook it's made
for it but LG decided to sponsor today's
video so I can put the 5k display
through its paces and see how it works
while I'm doing my editing and all the
regular stuff I do with my new MacBook
so sadly this is the life of someone
with a MacBook Pro you're gonna have to
connect dongles and all kinds of stuff
before you really get anything done but
what's cool is while this thing does
have four Thunderbolt 3 ports or USB
type-c ports the LG monitor actually has
a few as well so back here we've got
another Thunderbolt 3 port and three USB
type-c ports and as you can see I've
just dropped it down a bit and that's
because this thing is adjustable so you
can adjust it how you want to whatever
height move it however you want so
there's some pretty good flexibility
here depending on how tall you are I'm
sure so I put it all the way down now
this is a workflow that I'm pretty
excited about now for those of you who
don't do any video editing or Photoshop
stuff like that I apologize for the
nerdy stuff but this thing is just cool
I've got my timeline down here and all
of my video clips and typically I would
have a small screen that I can see my
video preview but with this monitor I
can have it over there while I go
through everything and since this is a
5k display I'm able to watch my 4k
content in full resolution so I can kind
of see beforehand what you guys see
whenever you're watching my videos all
right so I need to see if this video is
ready to go I'm gonna watch it a bit a
big thing
and argued a lot and quit no do you hear
the speakers I think with LG's 38-inch
ultra-wide they introduced these new
speakers that sounds really crazy have
some deep bass and I think they brought
that here over as well because right now
hearing the quality a big fan LEDs and
RGB lights and all that good stuff like
all I've got over here
and you can kind of just tell that this
thing was built for the MacBook Pro
because of the integration into the
actual settings of the system so when
you go into the display settings you can
see that the Mac has settings for the lg
monitor as well so you can actually
control the brightness right from the
setting bar and you can control how the
resolution as well that is not something
that we typically see with everyday
monitors usually you just have a few
options but being able to control the
brightness and the resolution and all
that good stuff right from here is
really really nice this thing has like
500 nits of brightness so you can really
push it here with no problem
now one last cool thing about this
monitor is that when you're hooked up to
it and you're using it as a display this
thing actually charges your MacBook now
it is not easy to charge this Mac
because it's drawing a lot of energy
especially if you're doing something
intensive like video editing but I'm
charging it with no problem so that's a
very very nice bonus you can finish work
here and whenever you're taking your
MacBook off you can be sure that
wherever you're going you're going to
have some juice alright guys so today is
pretty much wrapped up did a lot of
video work and now I'm pretty much in
chill mode so I'm going to be using the
MacBook to do regular stuff like browse
the internet um you know just do
everyday things and I think what's
different here is how you interact with
the touch bar so to take full advantage
of the touch bar you got to use an app
that supports it right now I'm using
Safari as a browser because that's
usually where you try out most of the
new features whenever Apple comes out
with an update unfortunately all the
features of the touch bar you won't find
on browsers like Google Chrome as you
can see right here all of the functions
just kind of went away but if I go back
to Safari they pop all back up again but
what's cool here is that you can switch
between tabs by just tapping
so you can see all the tabs you can even
create new ones just by going like this
and then you all lead to Apple of course
so there's a feature that a lot of
people are starting to like with the
touch bar and that's with watching
YouTube videos you can kind of scrub
through it by simply moving this little
cursor around and you can see the red
bar moving up and down as I move it
around now that's really cool but it
doesn't work with every video site so if
I were to go on something like let's see
go over here go to crunchyroll if i try
to watch this video there's no bar so as
you can see not everything supports it
just yet so I guess that's going to be
up to website developers also to go
ahead and implement some of these
features I'm not sure if Google had a
hand in that
or if Apple themselves made it so that
you can do that with YouTube but that's
going to be another thing now of course
I spent more than a day with the MacBook
Pro by the time you guys see this video
and I gotta say I really do love the
machine but I got in it Apple does make
it a bit harder for those who are
investing in this on the professional
side of things you do have to use
dongles and cables to get your things
all hooked up and you know that part of
it does suck USB C is going to be more
popular soon upcoming days so we're
gonna see more devices that work with
just that the as of right now that
transition period is gonna be a bit
rough for most people now in terms of
performance this thing is a beast
it's fast it's powerful it's gonna do
everything you want the only real
hiccups I've had has been with the touch
bar sometimes having some faults because
it's a bit buggy here and there but
overall my experience with it has been
pretty smooth typing on the keyboard has
been super Pleasant the trackpad I'm not
crazy about as you can see I did have a
lot of clicking issues now I did end up
changing my trackpad settings like I
said I was used to using the bottom
right side but I had to go ahead and
change it to the two-finger right-click
because that just worked a lot better I
didn't have any incidents with that one
but it is frustrating that I did have to
change the way I was using it and I
gotta say the performance is exactly
what I expected this thing is a beast
it's a powerhouse I'm able to edit 4k
footage with nope
whatsoever I think it even performed
that my iMac and I am really really
happy about that because this is not my
main editing machine now one thing I
gotta say though is that even though
they're getting that really awesome
performance you're not getting an insane
battery life I was actually pretty
disappointed using Final Cut Pro and
editing for a little bit gave me a few
hours but definitely nothing crazy was a
regular use you're gonna get more hours
out of this but I would not expect that
ten-hour battery life that you see on
the site but like I said guys I'm really
enjoying the new MacBook that thing is
powerful it's got new features it sucks
that you have to use adapters so if
you're planning on picking one up I say
it's definitely worth it but if the
download life kind of scares you you can
wait a bit till more things come out on
the market and that about wraps it up to
this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
until the next one that's your average
consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
