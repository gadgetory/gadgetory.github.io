want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone it's your average consumer and
today i have a review for you guys on
the 88 ws 70s so let's not wasting time
let's get right into it alright guys so
here we have the 88 WS 70's and I just
want to thank Audio Technica for sending
these out to me to review and unbox and
you know do the girlfriend test for you
guys so I'm definitely really grateful
and glad that you guys sent these out to
me now on to the review I really wasn't
sure what to expect when I first got
these they said they were part of their
solid baseline I wasn't sure if they
were gonna have you know a good enough
base for me coming from like things like
the beats that have some really strong
bass and if you guys don't know I am a
bass head so I really like my bass and I
just wasn't sure if something so small
and like you know sleek looking would
really pack that punch and I'll tell you
guys I definitely am was surprised when
I tried these cuz these things sound
great definitely one of my favorite
headphones today and you know this is
for those of you who might think that
this is a bias review it's completely
unbiased I really was surprised with the
quality of these but before I jumped
into the sound too much I let's just
talk about the design I've already said
that these are sweet and if you see my
unboxing videos I'm sure you guys saw it
around my neck
it just looks real it's really nice to
look at it's very got a really nice
finish to it it has an aluminum finish
on the ear cups really great got the
silver got the silver lining around the
ear cups the whole things that they just
look like a classy pair of headphones
nothing nothing over the top it doesn't
it's not like you know as flashy as the
beats with like the red and stuff but
you've got that more you know sleek look
still great-looking pair
felt very impressed by the designs that
I've seen pictures of it and I wasn't
too impressed by the pictures but
actually getting this in person really
you know definitely wowed me I really
really do like the design it's got a you
know pretty simple headband it has
little latches on the sides here so that
you can adjust the size of the had been
to fit your head shape now something
about the headband I'll be honest with
you guys when I first tried these they
were a little tight and for some people
that could be a problem it was kind of
kind of reminding me of the beats mixr's
although not that bad but with that with
the the thing is even though it was a
little tight luckily I was able to get
them to become a little looser all I had
to do was really just you know bend them
out a little bit nothing extravagant no
180 degree you know turns or anything
like that but just turned it out just a
little bit like stretched it out little
by little and it only took doing that a
couple of times and you know I got it to
stretch out a little bit and now it fits
perfectly from my head usually when you
first get them they're like this close
to the gear cuffs of the disc close to
each other but after stretching it out
you can see I have it's a bit of a wider
gap there so I'm completely happy that
it wasn't a long extravagant process to
get these to fit the way I wanted them
to all it took was a little bit of that
I don't recommend bending it out too far
I don't want you guys to break your
headphones if you pick these up and you
find them to be a little tight just bend
it out a little bit little by little and
within minutes you'll be fine and you'll
you'll be able to see if it'll fit your
head shape so Comfort was my only issue
with these headphones and I was able to
fix that relatively easily so I'm very
happy about that and other than that
guys asked that that really could be my
own complaint with these um the only
thing somebody might nitpick about is
that these cords are not detach
a bull and you know it's really not that
big a deal to me I'm coming from beats
where all my headphones are detachable
my favorite headphones being the beats
Wireless that don't even use the liars
buy so far these to not be a bother
they're the cord isn't too long so it
never really got in the way so I'm
really happy with that I think maybe the
court is maybe about three to four feet
long
so you know I can't really complain
about that so overall really happy with
the design this is pretty durable like I
said it has an aluminum finish so it
definitely gives you that durable feel
to it so very happy very very good
design
can't complain that at all now let's
just get jump into the sound quality of
these sound quality I was thoroughly
impressed by how great these sound um if
you're not a bass head even if you're
not a bass head you're not someone who's
too keen on having a lot of bass this
thing offers a lot of clarity so it's
the music still stands clear even for
those songs that aren't too bass heavy
you'll still get a good sound out of
these so definitely surprised about that
um but the real big thing here is that
their whole overwhelming bass feel about
these headphones is true I really liked
it it was definitely comparable to my
beats headphones the sound for those of
you wondering where these comparison
beats I would say these are more so
around the mixers would sound better
than the solo HDS they sound better than
you know it hurts me to say this but it
sounds better that might be it's
Wireless
it's got the clarity and the bass that
you kind of get from the mixers and you
know that's really good I've always been
a fan of the sound quality on the beats
mixr's so this is really nice you got
the combination of good clarity and
strong bass
so really happy about that and as far as
like the studios I don't think it has
you know as much base as the studios
have the studios have a lot of bass and
you know there
so you know just kind of give you guys
an idea of where they stand compared to
the beads and what's great about these
headphones is that they don't cost
nearly as much as the beads um you get
the same sound quality of something from
like the mixers at you know a hundred
dollars less use retail for about 150
and you can find them on Amazon for even
less than that so if you guys want some
great sounding headphones if you like
the bass a lot but you don't want to
spend all the money on the beats or you
know similar brands these are definitely
a nice way to go um
they sound a lot better than you know
like I said a couple of the beats out
there and at such an affordable price of
only a hundred one hundred plus dollars
so definitely got some bonus points for
that I've actually even compared them to
the audio technica on the end 50s and
although the audio technica and 50s have
more clarity than v's I would say if you
could hear everything else better on the
EM 50s but these are like I said I'm a
bass head and I like to have more bass
so these actually want my favor over
those headphones and I know guys that
might be likes into stay because in
fifties are so highly rated but I did
like these over the EM 50s because of my
preference as far as you know bass is
concerned so I'm really happy with that
and um overall I just had a you know
great time with these headphones I
really enjoyed them I'm an on-ear kind
of guy but these over here's um you know
kind of did the thing for me just like
the SL 302 did for me and overall guys
that about wraps up my review for an 80
hws 70s and what I'm gonna try and do on
my future review that these head up
headphones in general I'm gonna try and
show you guys what they look like around
the neck and also a deal if I go on so
here it is around my neck and when I put
them on this is how it looks
and here it is from the side so as you
can see it's a really clean sleek design
I really like the look of it very happy
with them and that about wraps up my
review for the ws 70s and like I said
there are great pair of headphones if
you are looking for it something that's
bass heavy but you don't want to spend
all the money on beats or you don't like
the brand or whatever when I for
whatever reason your you want bass heavy
headphones that you won't have to pay
too much money for it that still sound
great these are the right way to go I
definitely think the average consumer
will have a great time listening to
these alright guys that wraps up
everything and if you like this video
please feel free to rate comment and
subscribe and definitely a thumbs up for
audio technica for sending these out to
me and letting me let you guys know some
great options out there as far as bass
heavy headphones are concerned alright
