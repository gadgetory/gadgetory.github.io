but if you want to know what it's like
to own one look no further here are my
thoughts on owning the galaxy s7 for
more than a month Samsung came back with
its fancy and premium looking design
with the galaxy s7 and it looks very
similar to the galaxy note 5 but not
quite as big similar design or not this
is a good-looking phone it's got a full
glass body with metal edges and I've got
to say this is probably the most
comfortable phone I've used from the
galaxy line since Samson started going
with this premium looking design the
back glass is curved so it sits nicely
in the hand and while it may not be as
slippery as the s6 unless you have a
firm grip on the edges you might still
find that it likes to slide out your
hand while improved I still find this
pretty annoying while a glass body is
nice one thing I hate about it is the
fact that it gets fine scratches and as
you can see above my front facing camera
I've got this thing that is just so
frustrating and also right on the
fingerprint scanner you'll see another
scratch and I feel like that's gonna be
an issue that you'll come across over
time with this guy you're gonna find a
ton of tiny little scratches that can
probably drive you crazy if you care
about it one-handed use as plausible
since it isn't a massive phone and that
also means that doing standard things
like making calls texting or even
putting it away in your pocket won't be
a big deal
the only other complaint I'd have here
is to share a lot of fingerprints that
this thing attracts it kicks my
obsession with using microfiber cloths
into high gear and when it comes to
stuff like this
my favorite solution is throwing a skin
on it of course you know I had to team
up with slick wraps to see what they
made for that seven and if you guys are
interested in seeing all their options
so it can customize your own and avoid
some of that slippage be sure to hit the
links in the description below buttons
are pretty accessible since this isn't a
massive phone but I think it'd be nicer
if the volume button set a bit lower so
that they could be reached with one hand
the home button also functions as a
fingerprint scanner and works really
well with unlocking the phone not only
is it secure but it's quick and accurate
which makes it my favorite way to unlock
the phone there are also a couple of
awesome features built into the design
of this phone first being the SD card
slot which is finally back
and it's built into the Sentry which
allows you to expand the storage from
the standard 32 gigs it comes with since
you can grab a 64 gig microSD card for
less than 20 bucks on Amazon this is a
very welcome feature the other awesome
feature Samsung packed into this design
was waterproofing it without any extra
flaps or pieces this gives us some nice
accident proofing if water or something
else spills on it and this is nice
because we're finally starting to move
away from that fear of having water
damage on our phones now I'm not going
to bore you guys with reading off a spec
sheet but there are some specs that we
can't ignore that impact of daily use of
this guy first thing is that marvellous
quad HD Super AMOLED display and for my
non-techies out there watching this that
I have no idea what a Super AMOLED
display is just know that this is
probably one of the best screens you'll
find on a smartphone its high resolution
super vibrant and colorful and the
blacks are really rich thanks to it
being an AMOLED display so watching your
favorite videos and doing pretty much
anything looks really good on screen
this display also allows for the awesome
always-on feature you can have some info
displayed like the date time and a few
notifications without it taking up much
battery about 1% per hour and this has
to be one of my favorite features on
this phone you can glance at it for the
time or to see if you have any missed
calls without even having to turn on or
touch your phone the next notable spec
for me was the 3000 milliamp battery it
won't last you two days or anything but
it will definitely take you through a
full day with no problem this was one of
my biggest gripes with the s6 and I'm
glad Samsung finally decided to increase
the battery size I definitely saw a nice
boost in standby time which used to be a
huge issue another nice bonus with the
s7 is fast charging you can take
advantage of this with the included
charger or any other fast charger in
about 15 minutes you can easily get 25
percent and a little over an hour will
get you a full charge that's really good
especially if you need a quick charge
before heading out you also have the
ability to charge wirelessly and they've
even added fast charging to the wireless
which makes it extremely
since you can just drop your phone on
the pad and charge away when it comes to
actually using it in the performance you
should expect there's honestly nothing
surprising here and I say this because
we're looking at a 2016 flagship by
Samsung it runs as fast as anyone would
expect from today's flagships and he
handles playing some of the more
intensive games with no problem the
different forms of multitasking are very
smooth and of course basic social media
browsing won't even make this thing
flinch and unless you're in it for the
numbers game from benchmarks and that
kind of stuff I really can't imagine
anyone thinking there are better
performing phones out there even though
Samsung is still rocking their touch
with skin over Android I haven't found
it too obtrusive and in the past I felt
like TouchWiz hindered the experience on
the galaxy line but with the newer less
in-your-face versions of it it hasn't
been a bother to me and of course we
can't forget about those cameras the s7
is rocking a 12 megapixel shooter in the
back and a five megapixel shooter up
front this phone takes amazing photos I
love the quality that you get out of
this and if you're looking for a sharp
and very saturated colorful photos
Samsung is who you want to talk to
pictures come out great and super
vibrant and I can't say I was blown away
by the low-light performance when
comparing it to some of the phones that
are out there already but it'll surely
be fine for anyone who isn't putting a
side by side with its competitors now I
know Samsung dropped the megapixel count
and made them bigger so low-light
performance would increase honestly I
still found more noise than I would have
liked especially for these kind of
claims I had quite a bit of fun shooting
video with this and I found that it
looks just as good as it does with
photos and it even has optical image
stabilization so you can get some nice
steady shots but I did find that
sometimes it did cause some warping
depending on how fast you moved with the
camera overall I was super impressed
with the camera and I think that goes
for the phone as a whole while I don't
think it's a worthwhile upgrade from
something like the s6 or any other phone
from the galaxy line released last year
it's still an excellent phone if you're
on the market and I'd highly recommend
picking it up but that's about it for
this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
if you did be the cool guy or girl that
gives this video a thumbs up and

from me till the next video is your
average consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
