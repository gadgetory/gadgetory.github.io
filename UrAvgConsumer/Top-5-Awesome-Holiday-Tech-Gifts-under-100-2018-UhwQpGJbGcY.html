wide variety of people but this week
we're doing it for the tech lovers and
this time we're sticking to a budget of
a hundred bucks and a kickstart this
list we've got the anchor sound core
flare now this is a speaker that not
only it looks good
but it sounds good too and you'd
actually be pretty surprised at the
power that you get out of this guy and
not to mention it is a 360 speaker so no
matter where you place it in a room
you're still gonna get a nice crisp
audio now you guys know I'm a sucker for
RGB lights and this thing has a ring at
the bottom that can kind of change
colors and also pulse and match the
music that you're listening to so you
can see that nice stuff when you're
listening to your audio and there's even
an app so if you want to customize the
lighting with different themes you can
do that right from there and I think
it's also a p67 water-resistant so if
this thing happens to fall on the pool
maybe there's a ton of rain that gets on
it no matter what it may be is gonna
have that water resistance so you don't
have to really worry about accidents and
it makes a good pool buddy and what's
also nice about the speaker is that if
you get more than one you can pair them
up together through bluetooth and get
even louder sound now the version I have
here is the Christmas edition so it
comes with a travel case as well as this
nice gift box but if you guys want to
save ten bucks you can go with one
without any of the extra thrills and
just get the speaker itself for fifty
either way I'll have both of them linked
down below in the description as well as
everything else mentioned in this video
and while we're on the topic of audio if
you want to give someone a pair of
Bluetooth earbuds you're gonna want to
check out b1 + Bullitt Wireless now the
channel I've shown a ton of truly
wireless earbuds but those tend to be on
the pricey side coming in at 70 bucks
the one plus bullet Wireless is a steal
now I know not everyone is crazy about
the neckband design but me I personally
love it because I have a hard time with
keeping in ear buds in my ears so in
terms of comfort the neck that tends to
help but really stay in place which
leads to a better overall experience and
of course they come with multiple sized
ear tips so you can pick the one that
fits best for you so of course the
comfort is great on these but what's
also nice is the fact that it has
built-in Google assistant so if you like
to check your schedule maybe send out a
text message you can ask you all kinds
of things you'll have access to that all
from your ear buds and while that's cool
one of the biggest features of this guy
is the battery life it gets about 6 to 7
hours of battery life which is pretty
average but you get 5 hours of battery
life from a 10 minute charge when it
comes to charging speeds one plus is
and they brought that over to these
earbuds so if you forget to charge them
before you head to the gym just ten
minutes and your gym session is covered
and they're also water resistant so if
you want to use these as a workout pair
of earbuds you can go ahead and take
them to the gym and not worry about
sweat ruining them honestly guys for 70
bucks you get that sweat resistance the
Google assistant fast-charging
great comfort I really feel like you
just can't beat this you get a lot for
the money and it'll make a great gift
now the next gift is something I usually
recommend around this time of year I've
had a bunch of family members ask me
which iPad they should get for their
young very clumsy child and I just
cannot recommend it the Amazon fire HD
tablet is a much better option and
here's why young kids need something
durable that they can watch their shows
on and maybe play some light games and
at 60 bucks the Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet
it's just a way to go until they get
older and they have more demanding tasks
the Fire HD 8 is a great choice for
light web browsing watching shows on
Netflix Hulu and other typical apps but
what's even better is the functionality
you get when you add the dock this
connects magnetically and pretty much
turns the tablet into an echo shell so
you can dock it and it goes into show
mode where you can ask Alexa to show you
the weather for the upcoming week or
even show you the lyrics of songs that
you're listening to you can even video
chat with someone who has an echo show
or tablet but I think that's a great
option for kids or maybe someone who
isn't super tech savvy and wants to get
their hands on a tablet or maybe even
have something that's like an echo show
I think this is a really great choice
but something that Amazon makes that I
think makes a great gift idea is the
Amazon fire cube TV this thing is just
honestly a game changer to me but it
basically allows you to do is connect to
your TV and you've got basically an MS
on echo in the size of that little cube
so you can ask your questions do all
that kind of stuff but what's really
awesome about it is being able to
control your TV with your voice so you
can just say turn on the TV it'll turn
it on you can tell it to switch to
Netflix or maybe pull up a certain show
play pause volume up volume down
anything that you would do with a remote
you pretty much get access to right
there and what's really nice about this
is that it works throughout the entire
platform so you can go into different
apps using it
I think that's really
not having to touch a single remote just
use your voice to control your
television it's a game changer and
because it's an echo device you can tell
it turn off the lights you can have it
control your smart room there's a lot of
possibilities with this guy and I think
right now it's going for 60 bucks so if
you haven't gotten your hands on it yet
you gotta jump on it right away but one
thing I will warn you guys about though
those edges are pretty sharp so if you
got kids around just be careful that
they don't bump into it not a huge deal
or anything but just something to be
careful of if you've got some kids and
you want to put it in their reach I
gotta let you guys know about the sony
xba-40 and ones they are currently going
for a hundred and twenty bucks on Amazon
and I think a few other places so it is
absolutely a really really good deal
twenty bucks over but I am telling you
guys these are my favorite headphones of
all time not only do they have active
noise-cancelling so you can block out
your surroundings but they're extremely
extremely comfortable so if you like to
travel these are gonna be a very nice
travel companion their be nice and
comfortable so you can have a long
flight with them this thing has a ton a
ton of base so it sounds really great if
you really enjoy that thumping sound
when you're listening to your music this
thing is awesome but it has an app where
you can access a ton of controls and the
ability to increase the bass so if you
really just want to have your head
rattling that is the headphone to go for
personally it's my favorite I've
recommended it to a lot of people and I
have yet to have anyone say that they
didn't enjoy the experience definitely a
great Buy 220 bucks you know someone who
loves music buy it it is absolutely
worth it trust me
now next up is a gift I think a lot of
people will find a good use for and
that's the pocket juice Qi wireless
portable charger now this is a portable
charger so that means you'll be able to
take this with you if your phone dies on
you while you're outside you can just
plug in charge up your phone with no
problem you don't need to find the wall
outlet but what's special about this one
is that if your phone supports wireless
charging you don't even need to find a
cable to make sure you do it all you
have to do is slap your phone right on
top of it and it starts charging
automatically I actually stumbled across
this in a Best Buy shopping challenge
that I deal with Ari and I actually
really really like this device this one
10,000 milliamp hour version I believe
the one I found before was 8,000
milliamp hours and there's also a 5,000
milliamp hour version if you want less
and less battery but 10,000 you cannot
beat that but not only that it also has
an LED indicator that lets you know just
how much battery you've got left no more
guessing how much you have left with
these four little dots now that'll tell
you the exact percentage which i think
is a much better way of showing so if
you've got one of the new iPhones or a
phone that supports wireless charging
this is something you definitely want to
take a look at I wish it had quick
charge 3.0 or something but it doesn't
but not needing a cable to charge your
device it's pretty solid too and another
little bonus that I got to throw in here
guys is if you know someone who loves to
play on their Xbox one or maybe even
their PC you got to get them a
customized Xbox one controller
maybe that customized it for them you
can probably get them a gift card and
let them do it themselves but Xbox
allows you to customize their
controllers using their design labs and
I'm telling you you can create some
really awesome stuff here I've done it
myself and they've actually added even
more things that you can customize your
controller with more designs I think if
you give someone a gift card so that
they can do it themselves it is
something that they're going to be very
very happy for but that about wraps up
for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it hopefully you got some good
gift ideas here but till the next one
guys it's your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
