consumer and today we've got another
massive tech unboxing this time we're
calling a 17.5 now I know you guys
always say why do you have to point O at
the end reasons like this guys we got a
ton of packages here but all of them are
from either the UPS Store or my peal box
or Microsoft sent it over so I feel like
there wasn't gonna be a ton of variety
here and we just recently did a massive
tech unboxing so 0.5 I felt was like a
good name for this one but you guys know
what you got to do you got to grab your
snacks grab your drinks and let's enjoy
unboxing some cool tech now Airi has
made it an amazing habit of not being
here whenever we're doing a massive tech
unboxing so you guys you guys know what
you gotta do
I'm gonna have her social media links
down below in the description and you
gotta go get her get her for the next
118 she's got to be here guys but Jay my
men I'm gonna let you pick the first one
this guy what is this guy this is from I
I don't know all right what's in the
first box
oh is this is this Ares I think this is
a Therese guys this is gonna be pretty
pretty disappointing so we got some
Lacroix salsa water-re
somehow you managed to troll me right
back and then you weren't even here
thank you this is at yourselves water I
hate seltzer water all right so I'm
gonna pick the next one since these guys
have set me up here so this is from Kiwi
design and it's a battery base for the
Google home mini silicone magnetic wall
mount for Google home mini we got two of
those this is actually pretty
interesting let's see if this what this
base looks like so if you have a google
home mini
you kind of just throw it inside of here
it's not a bad little base there if you
have like the grey one and then I guess
this is a hollow this is the magnet and
then you can put in the actual power
adapter plug it into the wall and it's
looking like this but this is the
battery base now I want to see what the
battery base looks like I wonder how
long this battery base actually lasts
I'll just say on the bar
no but a battery base that lasts a long
time could be cool because you could
take it around with you in your home if
you're maybe listening to music or
something that could be pretty useful so
a seven thousand eight hundred million
power battery so I would just plug it in
here and I guess set it down like this
right here you have it this is your
battery base for the Google home mini
from Kiwi design not bad I like the look
it looks really good alright guys so
over here we got a little setting from
Microsoft
oh-ho yes Oh baby
so right here guys we have the white
Xbox elite controller I have not seen
this in person yet this is exciting
tango it looks alright let's take a look
at this guy
oh they switched up the case too so
before it was like a black case now it's
gray that is clean I'm telling you man I
know how to make some hardware this
looks so good guys check this out so
this is the elite controller guys and
you could of course swap out the
joysticks the d-pad for all the pieces
that are inside here so you have a bunch
of options that's what the elite
controller is all about configuring the
controller to work best for you so this
is really really good-looking the white
one man this is this is cool so thank
you Microsoft now I don't know if you
guys caught the last mess of tech
unboxing but Microsoft sent over one of
their Forza packages with this I think
the one they sent over was spring I
think I missed summer and I unboxed fall
on Instagram live I feel like they've
been trolling me so let's take a look at
what summer had to offer
no this isn't no Microsoft you didn't
send me sand did you like you didn't try
to bring the beach to the crib did you
Microsoft
please this is sand I can I can see it
guys this is okay so Microsoft is
definitely bringing the seasons to us so
we have our beach towel here
welcome to The Horizon festival with the
UK flag UK I get it now guys and yeah
I'm not opening this there's no way I'm
opening sand in the studio but thank you
Xbox I appreciate it
another one from the peel box okay so it
looks like we have some cases for the
iPhone 10 looks like a leather case from
notice not bad looking kind of reminds
me of the Apple case but a bit more
texture here and they've got one this is
like I guess the folio case so cool now
we got a little something else from
Microsoft let's open this guy up I'm
excited for this so what we got right
here guys Microsoft Surface laptop - so
this is the matte black version and so
let you guys know what specs were
working with we got a i5 processor here
256 gigs of storage eight gigs of ram so
this is something I really want to open
up oh man now I've seen this already but
it's nice to have it in house hey this
thing is so clean look I dressed for the
occasion
all black baby you guys can definitely
expect to see a video on this this is
something I want to test out and put
through its paces this is a very nice
clean looking laptop man and the first
one the typing experience was just
amazing the keyboard had a really nice
feel to it so I am very interested in
trying this out all right what do we
have here we've got two boxes from the
same company it looks like this one set
with this one says judge Nora that's me
but this one says Lamarr Wilson how do
you get back a few how did I send me a
but Lamar I got your package man they
sent it to me amia
so this is an accessory company oh so
this is a case for the Nintendo switch I
guess you can prop up your switch like
the ultimate charge station for the
switch okay so this is a charge station
for the switch oh okay I guess you put
your joint cons in the back and in your
switch up front because as a USBC port
up front and a USB port on the side to
try
and I guess you turned this on off ah
okay so we've got some green lights here
okay and we got joy Khan controller
grips interesting so you can put your
joy Khan's inside of here and kind of
hold them like normal controllers all
right and it comes with two of them so I
guess if you play a multiplayer game you
can play with the person you're gonna
play with them you have to control it
now we've got some bigger boxes over
here okay so we've got some cases for
the iPhone ten actually has a nice
grippy feel to it and you can put your
like your cards or whatever you want
inside it here as well so that's nice so
we've got a couple of cases um some
tempered glass screen protectors stylus
pen the little ring stand just like a
pop socket and a charger for your car
and the last box from them an essential
pack for a Nintendo switch and this
thing has grip case for the whole switch
so you can put the entire switch inside
of here feels pretty comfortable if you
want some extra little grips to hold on
to and something else what's in here so
another little stylus pen USBC cable
earbuds and i guess a game case so or
zli thanks for sending these out Lamarr
you'll get yours soon okay so this one's
calling my attention
he says open me first this guy is the
winter box for the horizon and for Zack
election what is this is this it this is
a winter coat
yo these guys set a winter coat what
look a little further back no this is
actually kind of nice though what this
thing is lined right in everything now
this will keep you warm I'm about to
start sweating in here so I got my
official Forza horizon winter coat Xbox
logo right there oh man
I'm hot already y'all alright though we
got the next box over here I'm gonna
pick this off before I start sweating up
a storm all right so this is the box I
need to be worried about that was good
that was okay now this one winter
changes ever
they sent me snow guys so it's in a
cooler
it's a giant Xbox cooler never had one
of those oh my gosh I see it falling out
already please don't make a mess please
don't make a mess
I'm gonna have to dig dig through this
why Xbox why you do this to me
soil sand snow leaves I didn't love
these guys so much well actually it
looks like snow so that's cool I have
yet to get the game you guys know this I
still don't have the game okay so we got
a little drink mixer you know keep the
body warm when you out there in the cold
make a little cocktail why not Forza
horizon for folks check it out so this
one is from the peel box nice okay so
this guys this is actually really
special so this is great this is
actually a bumper up very premium bumper
for the iPhone 10s so if you want to
have a really nice cool look on your
iPhone but you don't want to cover it up
with a huge case you can definitely take
a look at these definitely very very
premium stuff right here very expensive
but it is cool and it feels really
really nice this is like solid like I
said guys this is like high-end stuff
right here so here we have something
from quiver oh a backpack with my name
on it okay this is jut Nora right here
it's a tiny backpack but I guess this is
why they call it quiver I don't know if
you guys know bows and arrows the quiver
is usually what holds the arrows and
it's like a small bag that the arrows go
into so I guess that's what they're
going for here this is
a travel backpack or sling I guess
because it's not really a normal
backpack you got the strap right here
this is cool quality feels nice
materials feel good looks good not bad
what's this is this from oh we got more
stuff on that box and pull up right here
got a dope hoodie from Xbox and we've
got some t-shirts over here too
well this is actually a long-sleeve
shirt and we got another shirt over here
oh this one matches their control where
it seems actually really cool so this
one matches the controller so Xbox has
some of you know some gear some apparel
looks pretty good it feels like decent
quality I'll wear this with my winter
coat you're all good to go for the
winter oh I was not expecting this nice
so this is the HyperX cloud mix those
unbox this real quick take a look at it
now I personally am a fan of HyperX gear
because they have some pretty good
quality without breaking the bank
they don't really stray too far from
their typical design language oh but
these ear cups though that's real comfy
of course you also got your mic so that
you can plug this up and you got a
couple of cables inside of here as well
and a travel pouch but yeah I wonder how
they stack up to their other wireless
version but I'm excited
nice I didn't know this was coming last
but not least yo I didn't drop anything
today I deserve a pat on the back so
this is from Satechi
interesting a bluetooth keyboard for the
Mac okay so it's a USB C charging port
can connect up to three devices it looks
pretty good the Box doesn't do it any
justice I like the way the keys are
indented a little bit so you got a nice
little indent when typing should feel
pretty comfortable
oh cool and the fact that it takes USB
type-c to charge that's always a nice
thing but yeah guys I think this is it
this has been our haul yeah guys the
reason we have a massive tech unboxing
17.5 it's because you know we got a lot
of Microsoft stuff here and a bunch of
clearly random stuff from the peel box
I didn't want to give it the full-blown
18 but I think we got a lot of cool
stuff though Microsoft hooked us up like
I am really really excited about this
elite controller right here this thing
is nice and we got some other cool
things as well but either way I'm
rambling guys let me know what your
favorite piece of tech here was thanks
to all the companies who sent something
out and still be on the lookout for
18-point oh and I'll catch you guys in
the next one till then it's your average
consumer and peace there's a lot to get
out bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
