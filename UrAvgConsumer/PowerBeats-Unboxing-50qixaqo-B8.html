consumer and today I've got another
unboxing for you guys of the power beats
so let's not waste any time let's get
right into it alright guys here we have
the power beats now these are the
earphones with the little clip on them
they're endorsed by LeBron James and be
getting tons of requests for these by a
lot of my subscribers so I had to go out
and pick them up for you guys unless you
guys know what I think of them and um
yeah pretty much that's it this is the
newer version this is without monster so
it might look a little different to some
of you who might have it with the
monster branding the box is different as
you can see it's like a lot shorter into
other boxes I believe it's a bit taller
it's a bigger box but you know some
things have changed so we're going to
see what's in the new packaging and
there's no quick look around the box
it's really nothing special right here
let's you know works with the iPod
iPhone and iPad and over your here also
shows you that it works with the
blackberry and HTC and Android and
pretty much that's it you got a little
touch of LeBron and that's about it so
that's not wasting time let's open it up
and there we go so now let's see what we
get inside this little thing here and
this is like it's funny this is like a
real miniature version of the UM be on
ear headphones and here you are these
are the power beats very interesting
alright so let's see what we get inside
on the left side packaging so if I can
get this out alright so of course we'll
get some regular documentation adverts
for other products and such so got that
we got the beats sticker that it was
included now warranty information some
other stuff
versus and of course we have the
powerbeats guide so all the good stuff
with words and all that good reading can
go over here and now let's move on to
the power booth themselves you see they
have a little tab here that you just
want to pull down so that you can get
them out here you are from the side real
quick and get some more stuff okay cool
I've never seen I've never seen this
case before they've got an interesting
little case all right you've got a real
close-up so here we have the case that
the power beats come in it's very
interesting it's like a longer version
of what the beat stores come in the beat
store is like a slim circular case this
is like a pretty long oval shape so it's
pretty cool and inside they come with
the I guess a cable which is pretty
interesting and I just drop the clip and
here goes a little clip for it so we
have a little red cable here I guess
this is an adapter so I guess you can
extend how long you want the UM the
power beats to extend so that's pretty
cool I didn't I didn't even know they
had this so it's not bad and also inside
the case you have these little bumps
right here that you can put the power
beats around I guess so they can stay
right there against this side and you
have your little cables and whatnot over
here as well as the clip so that's
pretty cool case that they have here
which is always good on the the case
side of things so I like that alright
and here's a knotted little piece that
we get here I'm not sure what this is
for
let's open it up okay this is these are
where you come to your ear buds very
interesting usually they just have like
a plastic little cave um a little
plastic ziplock bag kind of and that's
what you usually keep your spare earbuds
and it's very interesting to see that
they give you a nice little pouch here
so that's pretty cool then though they
had this either and are
that's about it for what's inside the
box that's a move on to the power of
yourself here we are I'm saying this is
okay cool so we can just take this part
off this is like a sticker you can take
this off and here we are pretty cool
it's interesting I didn't know if they
had a red arm a red inline remote I
thought this was black but bad overall
it's a lot of red and if I can just rip
this part open well I set them free and
here we are all right so these are power
beats let me give you guys a quick
close-up of what I'm saying right now
and years ago guys to use onto the power
beats and as you can see they're in ear
headphones with this little long clip
it's got a very interesting design as
you can see it kind of goes inward so it
should go right inside your ears this is
supposed to really be - stop right here
it's very interesting I wonder how
comfortable these are these I've never
seen in the design a design like this so
I'm very curious as far as comfort goes
and here you can see that you can move
the little um little clip part that
hangs on your ear and it's kind of
adjustable you can move it left to right
a little bit so give some flexibility
and yeah they're gonna be very
interesting and here's the inline remote
now I really expected this to be red I
mean black but it seems that it's red
and it's like a lot of red on this so
pretty interesting that they didn't go
black with this so it's going to be
interesting to see if these on all these
different parts way down to headphones I
know what the beat stores having the
inline remote as well as this little on
piece right here it kind of weighted
down a bit but these do have the little
clips that hang on to your ear so it
shouldn't be much of a concern actually
alright guys just one last close-up of
what the actual headphones look like
like I said very interesting design I'm
curious about how comfortable these are
and how they sound of course so yeah
alright that's about it for this
close-up alright and this is pretty
interesting guys the cable for the power
beats really isn't that long I'm
stretching it out here it's not that
long which makes sense why they don't
include the extender to their extender
cable for it
now I'm thinking this is because you
don't want a long dangling cable while
you're doing sports activities like
running or playing basketball which is
of course what these are targeted
towards being that LeBron James endorses
these so it makes sense that this just
has this has a shorter cable and yeah
I'm not I might actually do some running
or something while I'm working out and
see if um how these work with um the
shorter cable if it really if it really
doesn't interfere with you or anything
like that so I'm gonna try that out and
um we'll see him and pretty much this
about it for this unboxing guys these
are the power beats by dre I can't wait
to let you guys know how it sounds and
feels all that good stuff so if you

tuned for the girlfriend test and the
review coming up soon alright till then
