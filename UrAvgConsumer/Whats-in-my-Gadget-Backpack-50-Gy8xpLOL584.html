consumer and today we've got another
what's in my gadget backpack 5.0 now
it's crazy that we're there but this
time we're looking at the icon backpack
from in case and let me just say it this
has to be my favorite gadget backpack
ever it's a bit pricey since it retails
for about 150 on Amazon but I've seen it
as low as a hundred bucks on other sites
so I'll have all the links down below in
the description for this bag as well as
anything else so I've got it in this
blue color it actually is able to stand
on its own which is always a nice bonus
the design is got this rectangular look
to it now this is an over stuffed
version because it's the gadget backpack
if you don't over do it like I do all
the time you're going to have a nice out
looking backpack with a ton of
compartments that can hold a lot of
stuff so we're gonna kickstart things
with the very front and that holds this
and this is the Sony here in wireless
earbuds now these are Bluetooth earbuds
and they're the first earbuds that I've
ever used that actually have this thing
that hangs around your neck now whenever
I saw these on people I thought oh man
that's just too much
it felt like a gimmick but man I am a
believer this is this is right like you
know just having it chill on your neck
this is comfortable
so these are really nice and the sound
quality is very nice as well but this is
solid and it's my it's my color man
can't beat that and let's see is there
anything else oh of course there's other
stuff so I've also got of course my
boosted board remote whenever I'm
traveling with this or let's say I got
to go somewhere on a boosted board I got
my remote here now this has a couple
more things now I came out this thing
let me say this backpack has a ton of
compartments and there's no way I can
possibly fill them all so I've got a
couple of pens now you guys know me I
got some pretty standard stuff all right
there we go so I've got some G Pilot g2
pens you guys don't always carry these
around oh and I've got this Microsoft
pen as well it's a pretty
Android pen looks decent but it has a
stylus up top so that I can use this
with like a phone or any other kind of
touchscreen so it's nice to have four
bike storage I've got the Samsung t3
solid-state drives
now with this I've got two terabytes of
storage so that is a lot I could hold a
lot of footage on here and with the
really fast data speeds I can take this
on the go and record and edit and have
no problem with my files this is a
godsend but what's really awesome about
this in comparison to the t1 since this
is a little bit bulkier it's actually a
bit more durable as well so Samsung says
this thing can handle about like six
feet falls or stuff like that you want
you want your footage to be safe
especially when you're traveling you
don't get a second chance this right
here is a universal power adapter so you
know how you usually need to get special
plugs to put into those outlets when you
travel well this one has all of them in
one pretty much all you do is flick one
of them down and you get the outlet that
you need and it can whoa almost dropped
it but you're able to convert your power
plug into whatever you need so if you're
traveling if you tend to do that a lot
you can bring this around and you're
solid you're covered and it also has a
USB port so you can charge there as well
while you plug something in definitely
worth if your traveler this is a 10 port
USB charger by Aki now with this you can
charge 10 devices at once and even
features to quick charge 3.0 ports so
that if you have a device that supports
it you can get this thing to charge
those up really quickly ten devices can
be charged with this guys when Judd
charges everybody charges so this is a
really awesome addition I always have a
ton of gadgets and whatnot so if I'm
travelling somewhere and I don't want to
use up someone's outlet or their USB
port I got my own this is like the power
section over here
I've got USB cables I've got a lightning
cable a micro USB there braided so they
have extra durability this one oh this
is actually a really cool cable I don't
remember where it's from though but
what's really nice is that it's a USB
type-c cable with a regular USB end but
what's awesome is that this USB end is
reversible so it doesn't matter which
way you put it into a USB port it'll be
able to charge it so you can actually
use this without worrying how you're
plugging it in it just works
over here what if we got okay this is
where I've got my portable power now
this is also from a key now this is a
thirty thousand milliamp portable
charger I'm charging anything with this
it doesn't matter what it's getting a
full charge anything I've put on here
has been charged up really quick but
what's cool about this is that you can
charge it with two ways if you happen to
be an iPhone only user and you don't
want to carry around a microUSB cable
you don't have to charge the with a
microUSB cable you can charge it with
your lightning cable so that means
you're carrying less cables with you and
you're still getting a lot of power and
you can also charge it with micro USB no
problem whatever user you happen to be
this thing can support you so that's
really awesome less cables is always a
good thing
and with this backpack actually if you
have a portable charger and you throw it
into this slot this green one right here
there's a little hole so you can put a
USB cable into the portable charger and
you know charge your device while you're
walking around really nice feature on
the other side now a standard a macbook
charger
spoiler alert so up top you also have a
little compartment which all backpacks
should have and that is to store things
that are you know a little more
sensitive a bit more fragile here I have
my Sony rx100 mark 4 this is my vlogging
camera
I don't think I'm picking up the 5.0
because there's not a drastic difference
there from this one so I'm going to be
rocking this guy for a bit but the thing
you might notice here that's a little
different is that I've got these little
wind screens on top of the microphones
the wind has killed quite a bit of
footage for me with the rx100 so with
this I'm able to withstand the wind and
still be heard my vlogging materials so
I'm not worried about wind which is very
nice if you happen to have any camera
you can actually just cut the pieces up
and put them on the microphone of your
portable camera so if you guys want one
of these I'll have links to these as
well
very very helpful for vloggers now one
thing about this top compartment where
the rx100 was resting is that it's got
this fuzzy interior so you know it's
nice and protected it's not a rough
material so not to worry about
scratching the screen or anything like
that this is the main compartment here
so we'll pop this guy hoping and this is
where everything just tumbles out so
over here let's top that I've got a
Zelda notebook I showed you guys this
look before this is what I like to use
you know I'm a gamer I love Zelda now
let's see what else we've got so there's
a ton of stuff I'll grab this one first
this is the selfie stick vlogging stick
whatever you want to call it it's a
selfie stick really but it's called an
actual mount action monopod from Sony so
I put my vlogging camera on it like this
I do what I got to do no shame no game
when you're vlogging you know what let's
start off with these guys right here
can you stay up yes you can so these I
got these because of you guys now these
weren't on my radar at all these are
actually open it for you these are the
sony MDR 1000x
that sounds like a crazy name but this
is a super interesting headphone now
these are closed back headphones so
you're not going to hear a lot of stuff
going on once you put them on and
they've got noise cancellation but you
can switch to a mode that led to voices
in so if you're you know listening to
music or jamming out but you have
somebody or your
while you're traveling or doing whatever
you can hear them by using this feature
and this thing also has some cool
features like touch controls you can
control your music from the side of this
and it has like a leather feel to it
which is very different so we've got
some interesting touch controls I'll go
into all of that in a full video but I
gotta let you guys know bees are awesome
they're super pricey super super pricey
guys like too much money but it's got
features that I haven't seen on any
other headphones yet now I told you guys
I'm a gamer and you know that so I've
got my PS Vita with me
it hasn't been traveling with me for a
while because there's there's just not
that many games but there have been a
few RPGs that I've been getting into so
I picked up a new a PlayStation Vita the
white one this is an old school and this
is not the second gen first gen white
model love the color I think it looks
great and it's just giving me some new
appreciation for the Vita and some of
those new RPGs I get to play on it so
this is gonna get some more time with me
hopefully I get to finish those games
now what gets way more time with me
happens to be my Nintendo 3ds now you
guys have seen me talk about this case
in the past I've had it in my gadget
backpack it's a big case but it's also
solid because I can hold two 3d S's at
the same time as well as a ton of games
like my whole library of 3ds games are
right inside of this case if I lose this
I'll cry swear to God
but yeah this is where I hold my 3ds is
it's over here I've got blast toys since
I when I was younger I got the blue
version of Pokemon first I know crazy
right but I got the blue version so I
got the regular new 3ds here and I got
the new 3ds XL with this guy and of
course I also as you can see have a
Zelda case on it so I've got that extra
Zelda protection but yeah this is a
solid little case that's cool
got that Pokemon Sun and Moon demo going
and with this guy right here we've got
the tech survival kit 1.0 now quick note
I took a ton of stuff out of this bag
already
and it's still standing but over here
we've got my tech survival kit one point
and listen if you haven't seen this
video I urge you to go watch it's super
super helpful I think anybody who
watches it can walk away with something
special here I officially have to carry
this in any backpack anywhere I go this
is with me because it's just that
essential so go check that video out
I'll have links in the world so you can
go find it today there's a lot in this
one guys so over here we have the iPad
pro now this is the 12-inch version
which is just insane it's a big giant
tablet but I like to play yugioh on it
it's an iPad now know what iPads all
about over here we've got a mouse this
is a logitech g502 i tend to carry the
602 all the time since it's wireless and
I use it for a lot of editing I travel
with this guy so I can get used to it I
got a new cool gaming PC I don't know if
you guys have heard but check that video
out if you have it I got a couple of
knights Mouse's already but this one
gets a lot of attention so I wanted to
try it out and that's why I take it with
me now wherever I go and let's see what
else we've got in here the pencil Apple
pencil because you know iPad pro oh and
over here I've got this cool little
stylus which goes for something on the
side here let's check this side out so
not only do you have these compartments
for tablets and stuff but you also have
this side compartment for tablets and
stuff for computers whatever you want
but over here we have the Lenovo yoga
book now this thing actually feels like
a book you can hold it like one they
even have their logo down at the bottom
just as if it were a book so you can do
like this but it's a tablet laptop
hybrid now this thing is actually a
keyboard once you power it on it lights
up you see all your keys and actually
gives you haptic feedback so it feels
like you're actually typing on some keys
which is very innovative that makes it
super flat super lightweight so you can
close it like this walk around as if
it's a little book of magazine
even and it gets the job done but enough
about this let's move on to what should
be the last piece of this gadget
backpack and that's a MacBook this is
where I do all my editing nothings I
keep dropping stuff this is where I do
all my editing nothing special here guys
you know you've seen this many times
before but this has been a macbook that
I've been using for maybe like two years
now maybe a year and change I don't know
but this is handled all the stuff that
I've thrown at it very well it's a
powerhouse so it does a job holding to
note though is that inside of the
compartment that holds your laptop
you've got the furry inside so you're
gonna get some protection there as well
but like I said guys all of this stuff
right here did not fill this out nope
this thing can hold more but that's
about it guys hopefully you enjoyed it
if you did be the cool guy or girl that
gives this video a thumbs up subscribe
all the good stuff
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
