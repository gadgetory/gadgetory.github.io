consumer and it's time to talk about
some new smart home tech but first we've
got to take a look at a pretty
interesting piece of smart home tech
that I was able to check out at CES this
is the sunflower by shade craft and they
were cool enough to sponsor today's
video and give me exclusive access to
the sunflower before it's released this
is the world's first autonomous shade
and if you're wondering what that means
you can basically think of it as a shade
for your patio or backyard that'll
automatically means depending on the
position of the Sun without you having
to lift a finger
thanks to some awesome AI it's also
jam-packed with a ton of features like
having built-in cameras for added home
security built-in speakers for jamming
outdoors and hecht it's even got some
USB ports to charge your phone while
you're chilling outside and speaking of
charging this thing is solar powered so
it's always gonna be good to go it'll
even have an app so you can control
yourself as well as have access to a
bunch more features and I gotta say guys
this is probably one of the most unique
things I saw at CES but if you want to
learn more I'll be sure to have links
down below now I've been getting a ton
of questions about those lights right
behind me and with good reason these
other Aurora by nano leaves and these
are seriously changing the game when it
comes to dope lighting for your home or
setup the Aurora can be manipulated into
a variety of different shapes and I love
what I came up with for mine but you can
get even more creative if you want
simply think up the shape you want stick
the included 3m tape to the back and put
this little card on the side to connect
the adjoining one and boom you're good
to start sticking them on your wall so
if you make a mistake you can pop them
off and reposition them now in terms of
what can actually be done with these
lights you can pretty much do anything
you can tap on any of the lights and
create your own color scheme but if you
lack creativity there are different
themes like Nemo flames for steam and a
bunch more I'm really liking the look of
those so you guys can definitely expect
to see them in more videos now I
couldn't possibly make this list without
mentioning the awesome home assistance
the Amazon echo and the Google home
the Amazon echo has been out for about
two years now and the Google Home has
recently come out but both are pretty
comparable the best thing about these
assistants is that they can work with
various smart home tech and allow you to
interact with them just by using your
voice and I do this with all the lights
in my game room and throw out the rest
of my studio as well as all my lights at
home and as of right now since Alexa has
been out longer
it works with more smart home tech but
Google home is definitely going to catch
up they can also answer random questions
provide traffic information tell you the
weather and do a ton of other things and
through my experience I found that
Google home has a better time answering
random questions which makes sense
because Google but I love them both and
my setup wouldn't be the same without
them so if you're trying to decide which
is best for you check up the showdown
comparison area and I did between the
two and I'll have the link listed down
below in the description and if those
kind of features sound cool but you
don't want to spend that kind of money
Amazon echo has a smaller version called
the echo dot which only costs 50 bucks
which is a steal it's a steal so
definitely take a look at that if you
want all those cool features now if
there's a device that you love and it
isn't Alexa compatible it's not a smart
home device here's a good option this is
the tp-link smart plug you can plug in
your device like a random lamp or even a
TV and you'll be able to turn them on or
off right through the app and what's
even better is that you can do this from
anywhere as long as you're connected to
the Internet and if you do have an
Amazon echo you'll be able to control
that device with your voice the voice
controls the future folks I swear it is
a pretty simple device but is essential
if you want up your smart home game next
up is the I live v 3s robotic vacuum
cleaner this is a sleek this that
detects and cleans up dirt and other
annoyances like animal fur or hair right
off your floor so if you or someone you
know is pet has a shedding issue this is
gonna be perfect it has sensors all
around it that keep it from bumping into
furniture or falling down stairs so
there's no need to watch it that closely
when it's doing its job but if you do
want control over it there's a remote
that you can use that targets the
cleaning and you can even make a
schedule that allows you to clean at
certain times of the day which is really
nice
if you want to get back to a clean home
after work or school one thing to note
is that it works really well on hardwood
floors and should be fine with really
thin rugs but if you have a thick carpet
or you'd like some mopping functions
then you might want to take a look at
the a4 or the v5 s which will run you
about thirty dollars more and I'll throw
links to those in the description as
well and last but not least we've got
the Moxie showerhead and wireless
speaker and this is exactly what it
sounds like it's a showerhead that plays
music the speaker connects through
bluetooth to devices that are up to 32
feet away and it's even a bit louder
than I would expect it acts the same as
any other wireless speaker so you'll
need to recharge it by popping it out of
the showerhead
which is super easy and as an added
bonus the showerhead comes in a variety
of finishes so you'll be able to match
it seamlessly with the rest of your
bathroom hardware and you cannot tell me
that this isn't perfect for people who
love to sing in the shower but huge
shout out to my boy danny winget
actually saw it in his video and I was
like this is cool I've got to share it
with you guys I'll have a link to his
channel down below in the description so
go check him out pretty good stuff but
that about wraps it up for this video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it and I'll
catch you in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
