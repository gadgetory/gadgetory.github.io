and you knew this was gonna happen today
we've got a showdown of the three most
talked-about
wireless earbuds right now the power
beats Pro the air pods - and the galaxy
buds now we are going to cover
everything you need to know so you can
pick the right one so of course the
first thing we're gonna talk about are
the designs so with the power beats Pro
these pretty much look like your
standard power beats but without the
long cable and these actually look
really good I like the way these look so
they've got that ear hook so they can
stay in the ear of course a lot of Jimi
earbuds kind of look like this now so
that they don't fall out but of course
looks are subjective but I really like
the way these look I think they're
pretty solid and of course we have the
air pods - now this is a design that
people used to make fun of some still do
but it's pretty iconic now I'm not super
crazy about the you know whole stem look
but it's pretty normalized now so I
don't think it's that bad but I don't
think that these look better than the
power beats they also don't fit that
well but we'll talk about that aspect of
the design a little bit later and then
we have the galaxy buds now these are
super low-key I actually really like the
design of these because you just throw
them in your ear and boom they're like
hidden it's really nice some people say
it looks like you got like marshmallows
or cotton balls in your ears when
they're white so the white ones maybe
aren't as stealthy but if you have the
black versions it'll probably look
really good I wish I had the black so
when it comes to the overall design I
think I'll have to go with the galaxy
buds as the winner here and then in
second place probably the power beats em
err pause last now when we're talking
about design we also got to talk about
the cases because that's pretty much
where they live now with the air pods
it's pretty nice and simple you got this
little case here that you just pop open
get your air pods out and it's nice
small convenient you throw this guy in
your pocket and it's no big deal at all
now you also get that same bit with the
Galaxy buds really small low key pretty
flat a little bit bigger than the air
pods in terms of the length but this is
also very easy
so just throw in your pocket and kind of
forget about it so that's also nice but
when it comes to the power beats Pro
this is a thick one and you're not going
to want to throw this in your pocket I
mean you can but that thing sticks out
like a sore thumb
it's just not convenient whatsoever so
you'll probably want to throw this in a
backpack or something else rather than
throw this in your pocket so it loses
points for that
now we talked about the design but let's
talk about comfort and you would think
that the power beats Pro would be a easy
winner here but they're actually not
even though they have this ear hook
design they stay on the ears pretty well
so in terms of comfort it's nice that
this doesn't slip off but I found that
there's ear fatigue after about an hour
of using these and I think it's because
of this part right here is actually
pretty hard and it's just really
uncomfortable after some time it really
starts to dig into the ear for me
personally I can use these for more than
an hour without starting to get really
tired of them and then we've got the
Galaxy buds now I like the Galaxy buds a
lot because these of course have an
in-ear design so they can sit right
inside of the ear they're not heavy they
don't dig into anything in my ears these
are very very comfortable and you don't
even notice that you're wearing them now
when it comes to the air pods - these
are a bit more of a toss-up some people
have ears that they fit perfectly for
some people just can't wear them I'm one
of those people but for those who can
wear them I haven't heard any complaints
about the overall feel these are also
very lightweight so even I can keep them
in my ear for like two seconds this is
not a strain on my ears whatsoever if I
don't move around a lot I can wear them
for a long period of time but once I get
to actually moving and walking around a
bit that's when I have issues with them
falling out so in terms of comfort I
like these even more so than the power
beats which are made to stay in your ear
because these don't hurt and they don't
give any ear fatigue I will say though
these don't create a tight seal or
anything so you'll be able to get a lot
more ambien
sound in your ears you know could be a
good thing when you're outside if you
want to know about your surroundings but
it can have a bit of an impact on music
listening so something to keep in mind
so for me the most comfortable are
absolutely the galaxy buds and then I'd
go with the air pods to of course
depending on if you can wear them or not
and then I'll go with B power beats Pro
now of course we got to talk about the
features now when it comes to the power
beats Pro and the air pods - you pretty
much get the same skill set here they
both feature apples h1 chip and with
that you'll be able to do cool things
like just open up the case and have
automatically pair or quickly pair with
an iOS device and it's also going to be
able to switch between Apple products
very seamlessly and very easily another
cool thing with the h1 chip is being
able to just have them in your ear and
you call out to Siri by just saying you
know the phrase I don't got to say it
and then you can ask you whatever
questions even ask you to control the
volume play music skip music so that is
some really cool functionality if you're
into using voice assistance and you also
have the ability to add some different
functionalities to them in the settings
on iOS devices but it's not much you
really can't do anything too crazy with
these in terms of features now one thing
that says apart the air pods to some
power beats Pro is that the case can
wirelessly charge so if you opt for this
special case you opt to spend a little
bit more money you can go ahead and get
this wireless charging feature so if
you've got a wireless charger or
something you can just kind of throw it
down and then it'll start charging there
you go it took a long time but it's
there now the air pod soo aren't the
only one with its wireless charging case
the galaxy buds also feature one as well
but what's cool about the Galaxy buds is
if you of course pick up a Galaxy S 10
it has that feature built right into us
where you can just kind of throw it on
top and have it charge the galaxy buds
just like that I mean you could do the
same with the air pods I guess but
easily this is not a combo like never
now while we're talking about the galaxy
s 10 this is where the galaxy buds kind
of blow the other two out of the water
so with the galaxy buds app the where
app from Samsung you can actually use
this
so go ahead and change a ton of
different things with the galaxy buds
now I'm not gonna go into all of them
but you can see here you can choose the
kind of sound quality you want you can
choose what the touchpad does so there's
a lot of cool options that you can do
with this that you just don't get with
the other two so if you're running an
Android device it absolutely makes sense
to get the galaxy buds over these two if
you care about features that isn't to
say though that you can't rock these
with an Android device
all of these earbuds work with pretty
much any device that has bluetooth and
one last feature that I'll mention with
the Galaxy buds is that they've got this
cool ambient mode so you can pretty much
pick up everything in your surroundings
while listening to your audio so that
you can know what's going on around you
even though these create a pretty tight
seal if you want to be able to hear
someone call out your name while you're
listening to your music or something you
can turn that feature on now when it
comes to battery life you can expect
about 4 to 5 hours of listening time
with the air pods and with the case you
can get an additional like 19 hours or
so the claim is that you can get 24
hours or more than 24 hours with the
case included whenever you charge up
your air pods now these also have a bit
of a quick charge feature where if you
charge these for 15 minutes you get 2
hours of playtime and with the power
beats you get a crazy 9 hours of
playtime and with the case you get an
additional 15 hours which is just insane
that is extremely good battery life for
truly wireless earbuds so when it comes
to the case and the earbuds either
around the same realm in the 20 hour
plus range but what makes the power
beats Pro really nice is they've got
this fast fuel feature which gives an
hour and a half of music listening for
just five minutes of charging that is
really quick and for the galaxy buds you
get about five to six hours of listening
time with these and the case only gets
you another seven hours so this case is
the weakest out of all of these here but
with five to six hours of listening at a
time it's definitely no slouch but you
will have to charge this case more than
these two and the Galaxy buds also have
a bit of a quick charge feature where if
you charge them for 15 minutes you'll
get an hour and a half of playback now
when it comes to the chargers for all of
these the
of course charge with a lightning cable
so you plug in a lightning cable and
you're good to go and the same goes for
the power beats Pro it also takes a
lightning cable but the galaxy buds uses
a USB type-c cable so of course we've
got to talk about the audio quality
that's why you're here so when it comes
to the galaxy buds
I actually really like these they've got
a decent amount of bass don't have like
a crazy thump or anything but they
definitely sound pretty good especially
since these are in ear buds you
definitely get to feel that bass a
little bit more with these so overall I
really do like these vocals are pretty
clear they sound great
but when it comes to something like the
air pods now these are a little bit
tougher they don't have a tight seal so
music tends to leak out you don't get
everything the music doesn't sound as
separated these are absolutely good for
everyday people who aren't really crazy
about sound maybe you just want
something that just sounds decent B
sound good they have some solid bass
although the bass isn't as tight as with
what both of these actually but it
definitely does still have some bass but
I think that the clear winner here
though has to be these guys right here
the bass is pretty punchy vocals are
their instruments sound good I feel like
there's a lot of separation here so you
can kind of pay attention to different
little things when listening to these
but I'll be completely honest with you
guys I think for average listeners every
day people who pick any of these up
they'll be pretty happy with the sound
quality but it's once you start
comparing them that you start to see the
gap in quality the power beats Pro
definitely ranked first for me here then
I'll give it to the galaxy buds and the
last place I'll give it to the air pods
and I think this makes sense especially
when you start factoring the price these
better sound better than these other two
and of course my quality is very
important since people use these here
buds to make calls and right now you're
hearing the audio quality from the air
pods - right now you guys are hearing
the audio
from the galaxy but I've had addy
complain about the audio quality when
talking for a few times with these so
it's gonna be interesting how it
compares and last but not least we have
the power beats pro so you guys let me
know with a comment down below which is
the three you think sounds better okay
guys so the most important part of any
purchasing decision is of course the
price earpods go for 200 bucks with the
wireless charging case galaxy buds are
only one $29.99 and the power beats Pro
are two hundred and fifty bucks so
definitely the most expensive you get
better sound you get better battery life
from it but it is a lot of money I feel
like the sweet spot is the of course
galaxy buds because you get good sound
quality a nice comfortable fit really
inexpensive price tag and if you're on
Android you get a lot of features so to
me this is a really solid deal
especially if your ears can't fit the
air pods but if you're rocking an iOS
device and you absolutely don't care
about the galaxy buds and you want to
pick between the air pods and the power
beats Pro I personally think if you
really like to work out and you're going
to the gym a lot
power beats Pro are a good option thanks
to of course that sweat resistant and
that secure fit or if you really need
better sound quality then these are
worth the investment but you do have to
factor in the comfort if the air pods
fit for you they might feel a lot more
convenient since they got that smaller
form factor but for me personally I'm
still gonna go with the Galaxy buds as
my winner I think they're better than
the other two overall although they have
a little bit less battery life but the
bang for your buck is absolutely there
but hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video if you did be the cool guy or girl
that gives it a thumbs up and we'll
catch you guys in the next one till then
it's your average consumer piece I
really wanted to love these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
