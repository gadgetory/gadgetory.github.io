getting into these subscription boxes
that have like makeup and all kinds of
girly things so she's getting into that
now so she's a big bitch she has like so
many boxes coming all the time how many
she almost rivals me as far as getting a
bunch of packages so used to be every
time there's a package I think involved
looking at it and it was for him someone
sending him something electronic but now
my time has come like this fine no it's
mine I get at the very minimum of six a
month
she's clearly addicted so we just
wrapped up a girlfriend test here we had
a little setup doing some stuff boom
this is what we used in this episode
I'll turn on my team you would like to
watch TV and eat at the same time we
really love it
so Xbox fine so right now watching

your Xbox mute like I love the controls

my Xbox one now to be honest I've been
playing my xbox one like the video game
side of things too much I only have rise
and unfortunately titanfall is over the
bait is done but I enjoyed it a lot I
can't wait for him to come out but other
than that I used the xbox mainly for the
voice controls and stuff like that it's
really really helpful
what did it just staring at us listening
to us watching us even so BAM getting
ready to eat we have a nice little
dining table missing a chair cuz their
girlfriend test we had a nice dining
table but we choose to eat on these
dinner trays and watch TV

spot like the worst player in the world

myself I'm on my way to at Best Buy
right now and I'm actually going to pick
up titanfall for the Xbox one
apparently at Best Buy I'm not sure how
long this deal is for if it's even still
going but I heard you can trade in an
Xbox one game I guess I have a select
you that you can trade in to get $45 off
your copy of titanfall so I barely
played this thing I'm not really
interested in it so I decided I'm
getting rid of it and getting the 45
bucks off of titanfall so I'm pretty
excited
I played the beta for titanfall and I
enjoyed it quite a bit so hopefully this
deal is true and I'll pick mine up
alright guys so I just got my card
so it's $45 off ended up working so now
I'm gonna go pick up titanfall really
cool really excited um one thing that's
really cool I got recognized in here so
