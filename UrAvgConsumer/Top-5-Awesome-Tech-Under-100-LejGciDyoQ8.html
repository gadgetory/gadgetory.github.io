and today we're going to be checking out
some awesome tech under a hundred bucks
now the first thing we're going to check
out is right in front of us this is the
ala mouse and keyboard combo actually
easily comes with a mousepad but guys
get this the total for everything right
here forty bucks
so forty bucks gets with a keyboard a
mouse the mouse pad and what's crazy is
that this thing is gamer ready it's got
all these RGB lights so if you're
looking to get into maybe building your
first set up you don't have a huge
budget forty bucks is all it takes to
have some RGB lights in your life now
guys this should be just fine for gaming
I'm actually really impressed by the
mouse it's super comfortable the
ergonomics was definitely there so if
you want to use this for gaming let's
say you're a beginner or you know you're
just trying to get your setup going this
is a really really nice combo now the
only caveat that there really is here is
if you can't really switch up the colors
like you do with some of the higher-end
RGB keyboards so this is kind of the
preset that you get you can change the
lighting effects so you know there's
that but for 40 bucks this is an awesome
deal I was pretty happy with this alone
so getting the whole thing 240 gets my
pass and if you have that person looking
to build up your setup and you need a
decent monitor to go with it this is a
pretty good option this is the HP 22 CW
a I read that right so this is a solid
monitor it's only 23 inches so if you
looking for something massive maybe you
don't wanna look at this but I think for
what this is it's an awesome deal this
thing goes for a hundred bucks it has
really tiny scheduled full 1080p so you
got full HD going on and it's IPs so
watching content on this looks really
really good let's see let's go some
YouTube
now one thing though is it doesn't have
built-in speakers of course that makes
sense at this price range but the
quality is really nice the colors are
good I'm a big fan of it so if you guys
are interested in seeing a kind of a
budget set up that could be a really
good thing to show off so if you want
give this video a thumbs up and let me
know you want to see that now one cool
thing to note is that if we take a look
at the back here you'll notice that it
does have an HDMI port so if you're
using your device with it you'll be able
to work with it just fine I was kind of
worried that VGA was the only thing I'd
be able to use with this and that would
be a problem but yeah this is a solid
buy especially through looking for a new
monitor alright guys so next up we've
got this vizio sound bar now sound bars
are typically pretty expensive but this
guy retails for just 70 bucks now this
is a 29 inch sound bar and it has some
pretty cool features but check out the
sound
sounded dope so you guys are looking for
something you want to add this fear
entertainment system you've got a really
solid option that won't break the bank
and if you want you can add a subwoofer
to it and you know get some extra bass
out of it but what's really cool with
this though is that with the remote you
can actually go ahead and add some extra
bass or treble or even use true surround
sound and you can of course use
Bluetooth if you want to just listen to
your mobile device with it so it has a
couple of awesome features and I
actually really like the true surround
sound it gives me like a virtual
surround sound feeling and it does
pretty well definitely worth picking up
for 70 bucks why not
next up guys we've got this portable
charger by Nomad so this is the Nomad
power pack it has about nine thousand
milliamp hours and I do wish you had a
bit more capacity fifteen thousand would
have been boom but it does have a really
awesome feature because it has tiled
built into it so with Tom this makes it
a trackable portable charger which is
really good because you can throw this
in your backpack take it on the go and
you guys always talk about me getting
robbed or I mean losing the backpack but
with this thing I'll be able to track it
down thanks to the whole tile
functionality I'd be able to pull out
the app find out where it is and get my
backpack and it has USB type-c so it can
charge your new devices like the Galaxy
s8 or any of the other new things that
just came out so definitely a win with
this guy so laughs on this list we've
got the rode videomicro now this is a
tiny tiny mic that you can throw on to a
camera and get some awesome sound
quality this is actually the mic that
we're using right now for this video so
all the sound that you heard is coming
from this little guy and it even comes
with a suspension mount so even if
you're moving around the camera you're
not going to hear the shaking from the
actual mic itself because it's suspended
with this now so you just throw this
onto the hot shoe of your camera plug it
into the microphone jack and you're
ready to go now it also comes with this
this is a burning windshield they call
it a dead cap so you just throw this on
top of it and when you're outside all
the wind sounds that you typically get
that mess up the audio quality
gets blocked out with this let's
actually go test it out so right now
we're outside and you are hearing the
sound quality and it's a bit breezy but
I'm sure the mic isn't picking that up
and that is because of this windshield
so definitely very good stuff and this
only cost 60 bucks guys so if you are
trying to get your foot into vlogging
game YouTube game this is worth picking
up I highly highly recommend it it's
definitely an awesome shotgun microphone
so go ahead pick it up I'll have links
to everything down below in the
description we're outside so I can't
stop that crazy mode that you're hearing
over here well like I said great for
vlogging Eric come in the shop coming
out no I look crazy plus a lot of baby
anyway guys hopefully you enjoyed this
video like I said everything will be
linked down below in the description be
sure to check it out
if you enjoyed the video be the cool guy
girl that gives it a thumbs up I'll
catch you guys in the next one Eric get
in the shot man feedback</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
