consumer and today we're gonna be taking
a look at what's on my android phone in
2018 and if you saw last year's version
then you've got a good idea of the
layout I like to use but I'm gonna show
you how I change things up this year
right here I've got the huawei mate 10
Pro and huge shout-outs wallet for
sponsoring today's video but if you
haven't checked out my video on the May
10 Pro it's a solid phone worth checking
out with amazing battery life great
performance and a few tricks up its
sleeve if you want to learn more and
catch that video I'll have a few links
down below in the description but on to
the apps and layout that I've been using
on Android this year first up on the
home screen you'll notice my live
wallpaper and honestly guys I used to
use this way back in the day like when
live wallpapers just got to Android and
this one is called Galaxy pack it has a
few different preset live wallpaper
themes and they all look great come in a
variety of colors and have some nice
motion effects and like I said these
wallpapers have been around forever but
they still really good on 20:18
flagships there are free versions with
separate galaxy themes but if you want
the entire pack it'll cost you just 2
bucks now in terms of my layout I'm
using Wally's main date and time widget
which is actually pretty clean it gives
me the timing whether very simple stuff
is accessible and absolutely necessary
now on the bottom is where you find more
of my standard stuff like my Google
search bar widget my phone and messages
apps as well as my browser and camera
all essentials that I want quick access
to at all times
I've also making sure I have access to
the Play Store for whenever I want to
download a new app as well as a folder
that has all the Google apps that I use
on a daily basis I'm talking Gmail
Google Maps Google Play Music YouTube
you get the picture now of course to the
left of that we've got the Google now
section that gives me updates on all of
my interests like basketball tech and
even gaming in headphones if you haven't
really taken the time to let Google now
know the kind of things that you're
interested in you probably should
there's a lot of great articles and
information in there
and let's face it Google probably knows
already now to the right of my home
screen is where I have my secondary but
very important apps at the very top you
guys have seen this before this is my
YouTube life section where I have a lie
sub count widget doesn't know how many
of you folks join the UAC fan and so the
right of that is RAB my studio app right
jump into the comments section to talk
to you guys as well as check out the
analytics to my videos I've got that
YouTube app and the subscriber count app
where that widget originates from and
the socialblade app that lets me keep an
eye on how the channel is performing
every day some days are better than
others put underneath that I've got the
calendar widget called
calendar widget but with this I can see
the items on my calendar right at a
glance right on the home page
I love the transparent look since it
keeps the homepage looking nice and
clean but of course under that you guys
know I like to keep all of my apps in
nice clean folders and I've got a few
right here of course I got my games
right now I've been spending way too
much time playing this game called hyper
heroes they called this marble-like
RPG where you can power up heroes and
send them dashing towards opposing
enemies and honestly if you're one of
those people who just like to see their
characters progress and grow in strength
this is a very fun game and it's super
addicting and of course you guys have
seen me talk about this a lot in my real
day-in-the-life videos sonic forces now
I'm a big Sonic fan so this game is an
absolute must for me and it's just
downright fun once you get the hang of
it and you know I have to get pop G
mobile on here and I'm not gonna say I
play this a ton I played it a few times
and I can see why everyone's going crazy
for it I do wish for it and I was on
Android but you know it's obviously
coming but right now pub G mobile it's
pretty solid and I've even got some of
my older games like Pokemon go which I
really don't ever play anymore but I
can't bring myself to delete it I got
asphalt 8 which is a racing game I feel
like I've got to have at least one
racing game on all of my phones at all
times just for when I'm like stupid
bored so I got asphalt 8 here which is a
classic for me now next up is my
entertainment folder where I catch all
of my latest shows mainly consisting of
anime so I've got Netflix where I'm
watching the Apocrypha as well as the
latest episodes of Voltron must-watch
shows
trust me as well as the typical stuff
that I watch over dinner with Airi but
then I've got the more hardcore anime
apps like crunchyroll and Funimation and
I can't not have Hulu I highly recommend
watching my hero
cata Mia it's on Hulu I believe
crunchyroll as well it's probably all
over the place
definitely watch that and double Oh
Gundam definitely watch that one I've
also got Amazon Prime video but you
don't typically hear much about but
there are some nice gems over there and
I've got all the standard social media
apps in this folder over here I'm pretty
much on everything if you're not
following me on Instagram or Twitter or
anything like that I've got links to all
of my accounts down below in the
description hit me up and next up I've
got my music folder now I've always been
a hardcore Google Play Music list in
there but I started to try out Apple
music once it came out and now even
though I am super super late I recently
got on Spotify and I'm really starting
to see the benefit of being on Spotify
for discovering new artists and kinds of
music that I haven't been listening to
before it is amazing I understand why
everyone's on it now my last folder is
kind of like a miscellaneous folder but
I've still got some very important apps
in here
I'm checking over important but besides
the regular uber app I've also got a
bird eats which me and Ari have been
using way way too frequently you guys
know us we don't cook it's terrible but
it is so so convenient I've also got
Microsoft OneNote which is hands-down my
favorite note app I love it because you
can use it on pretty much any platform
no matter what device I'm using it's one
of the first apps I make sure it's on
there so whether that's an iPhone or an
Android device or even just a regular
Windows desktop my macbook being able to
access my notes of my scripts on any OS
is just amazing so I love it for that
reason I've also got some pretty cool
apps like Adobe Lightroom which is where
I edit all of my photos before I upload
them to ig or Twitter it's an easy to
use app that allows for some great
control to really bring your photos to
life there's also this other really cool
app that I definitely recommend called
know in now this is a pretty cool app if
you want to add a reminder or a note of
any sort to your notification bar it's
really simple you just type up your
message and it stays in your
notification bar until you send it away
it's great if you want to have this
constant reminder for something or if
you want to just write a nice little
positive message to yourself it's really
simple but it's really cool to have and
while I don't have it in a folder one
app that I really do reckon
and is G Boyd I love it because it's
nice and easy to type on it has swipe
functionality so I know a lot of people
are familiar with that I also like the
ability to Google search something right
from the keyboard so if you're in your
messages you can quickly send somebody a
link to something you got access to your
emojis your gifs all kinds of great
stuff I use this thing on all of my
Android devices as well as iOS so this
is my main keyboard for almost every
smartphone that I use now this is pretty
much my layout and all of the new and
old apps that I've been using this year
I'm always interested in hearing cool
new apps so if you guys have some nice
recommendations let me know down below
hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you did
be the cool guy oh that gives this video
a thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in
the next one till then it's your average
consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
