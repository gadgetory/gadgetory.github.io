consumer and today we've got a list of
some of the best Android apps available
provided by you guys I went over on
Twitter and asked a couple of you for
your opinions on some of the best
Android apps that you've been using and
we made a little list I picked out which
ones I thought were really really cool
well first off huge shout out to all of
you guys who left your recommendations I
had a lot to sort through but I think we
came up with a pretty good list and
first up I want to shout out blue collar
for sponsoring today's video and wait
for it throwing in a giveaway of a brand
new Google pixel so dual collar is an
awesome app that scans incoming calls
automatically identifying where the call
is coming from and if it's spam it'll
let you know and they can do this pretty
easily because they're drawing from a
database of over a billion phone numbers
and if you don't ever want another spam
or scamming phone call again this app is
everything it'll even let you create
custom black lists that will block all
potential telemarketers and those super
annoying spam calls and you can
customize it yourself to add some choice
people you don't ever want to hear from
again like exes that dude that keeps
asking you for money or even those bill
collectors now there's some fun features
here like phone call recording a secret
contact list a hide phone calls and even
I'll call history scanner that allows
you to see the name of missed calls you
might not recognize and being able to
dodge scanners is some pretty nice
protection now you're probably wondering
how to enter into the giveaway and all
you have to do is check the link down
below in the description to download
blue collar and then leave a comment
down below on this video
letting us know what your favorite
feature is this is a US and Canada
giveaway and in about one week
Ducasse going to be picking a winner so
be sure to enter the contest you got a
chance at a free pixel so why not next
up we've got backdrops at first I wasn't
too interested in this app because I
thought it was just another wallpaper
app but it's actually really good
if you into the clean look of material
design you'll be able to find a ton of
wallpapers here that mailto look when
you find one you like you can either
save it favourite it or go straight to
setting it as your wallpaper all within
the app the only thing here is a video
ad might pop up when you click the
wallpaper you like but you can skip it
and is
small price to pay for a beautiful free
wallpaper now cool thing about this app
is that the wallpapers are pretty
exclusive because they're made by the
developers so you really won't be able
to find these anywhere else
third on this list is Nova Launcher
which is a very popular app that I
honestly never really tried out until
this video but I can absolutely see why
I get so much love for those of you who
don't know the ins and outs of your
Android phone you can actually switch up
the main home screen of your phone with
different launchers like this one
each launcher has special looks or
features that your phone didn't
initially come with that gives you a new
way to switch up and interact with your
phone now what's special about Nova
Launcher is its clean look and tons of
customization options you can change
things like the grid size of your screen
so you can make the perfect layout with
your apps and widgets and you can do a
ton more like change the look of your
app dock your folders the overall look
and feel of the app and a bunch more I
actually threw this on my LG g6 and
replace the skin home screen it came
with and honestly I don't think I'll
ever go back is that much cleaner and if
you really dig it there's a paid version
that comes with even more features so if
you haven't tried this one out yet it's
definitely worth looking into next up we
have alarm you and this one's perfect
for those of us who set alarms and end
up dismissing them and going back to
sleep anyway now you can't just
mindlessly do that here because you have
to go through various steps to actually
turn off the alarm depending on how you
set it there's the picture mode where
you have to take a picture of the exact
same thing you set the alarm with and
when I say exact
I mean exact same angles same everything
shake mode requires less effort in terms
of getting out of bed but the varying
shake difficulties should make it a bit
harder when setting the alarm you can
choose a difficulty and the number of
shakes which goes from anywhere between
5 and 995 or if you really want to
challenge yourself you can put it into
map mode here you how to solve a number
of math problems before the alarm shuts
off and you can choose the difficulty
and the number of math problems you can
even choose to correctly solve 99
multi-step math problems to make the
alarm go off I have no idea why you do
that the last mode is the barcode or QR
scanner mode
where you can preset a barcode and scan
the same one before you can turn it off
this was definitely a fun one to test
out so shout out to all of you who
recommended it I could definitely use it
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
again huge shout out to everyone who
left their suggestions I'll probably
have more videos like this in the future
so keep your eyes peeled for that if you
enjoyed it be the cool guy or girl that
gives this video a thumbs up and I'll
catch you in the next one till then it's
