consumer and today as you may or may not
know Apple has just announced the iPhone
6 and the iPhone 6 plus and also the
Apple watch and in this video we're
going to be going over the top five
features of the Apple watch that they
discuss today so let's not waste any
time
let's get right into it Bob hi dad dad
so to kick start this list at number
five we're going to go with the fitness
monitor that you can find on the Apple
watch so in the back of the Apple watch
it has four sensors that will track your
heart rate it can also track your motion
and it has GPS so that it can track
where your motion has taken you so you
can see just how active you were and
stuff like that you can also see how
long you've been sitting and how long it
takes for you to get up and be active
again since the last time you sat down
now these are all pretty cool features
and what you would expect from a watch
or Fitness band Apple seems to have a
lot of focus in the fitness department
with the Apple watch so now this is
really going to be a big competitor for
fitness bands out there that are
probably cheaper but the Apple watch has
so many other features that the fitness
watch side of things is a perfect add-on
so that's why we have it at number five
and for number four on this list is the
Apple watch is not going to be
chargeable with a MagSafe connector now
the MagSafe connector is something we're
familiar with with the Apple laptops
like the MacBook Air or the MacBook Pro
so now you can actually just use the
MagSafe to charge your Apple watch at
night now Tim Cook specifically said
charging it at night they didn't touch
on battery life but if they say charging
at night I'm assuming it's going to be
one day of battery life pretty much like
most smartwatches that we're seeing
nowadays so that's actually not bad you
don't have to plug it into anything you
don't have to put it in a cradle you
don't have to line it up with some pins
so it's going to be really easy if
you're familiar with charging your
laptop with your MacBook you're going to
know it's pretty easy to charge the
Apple watch as well so I think that's a
pretty nice and simple way to charge it
and that's why it has the spot at number
four and for number three on this list
is the Apple pay now Apple introduced
Apple pay with the iPhone 6 and the 6
plus and now they also have it on the
Apple watch now I really like this
feature but I do have some concerns as
far as security goes Apple didn't really
touch on how it's going to work without
touch ID I'm most likely sure that it's
going to work with having the iPhone 6
in proximity of the Apple watch but I
really do like the idea of this being
able to just wipe your watch and make a
transaction is really really cool we
still have to see how how seamlessly
it's going to work but I do like the
idea of it because that means you don't
really have to pull anything out of your
pocket you don't have to go for your
credit card and the way Apple has
described Apple pay it seems very very
secure so far but it's going to be
really nice to be able to just swipe
your hand really quickly and pay for
something instead of having to look for
your wallet look for change look for
your phone it's going to be really nice
stuff and I like that so that's why it's
at number three and number two on this
list is being able to work seamlessly
with the iPhone now this is a given but
I do like how it functions with the
iPhone there are a lot of different
things that you can do with the Apple
watch and iPhone like send messages send
voice messages you can actually even
control music from your phone that's a
big deal for me I love to listen to my
music from my device so being able to
control it from my phone is definitely a
huge bonus and you can actually store
music on the Apple watch itself so kudos
to Apple there for including some
storage Apple has also stated that it
can work as a viewfinder for your actual
camera so it's got a lot of nice
features that work seamlessly with the
iPhone so I think that that integration
is going to be awesome apples really
building their ecosystem with
functionality between devices so working
with your iPhone to your Mac and now the
Apple watch to your iPhone is going to
just make a stronger ecosystem and I
really do like being able to message
people and interact from your watch and
even if they're on their phone so
definitely good stuff and one of the
best things about it working seamlessly
with your iPhone is being able to use
Siri from your SmartWatch so you can
just call up Siri ask for some questions
or look up some information and you boom
it works no problem you can also send
emails all kinds of stuff and there are
going to be more apps that developers
can create so that you can use on your
Apple watch so I'm definitely looking
forward to seeing the seamlessness
between the iPhone and
and also seeing the new apps that get
introduced so that's why we have working
seamlessly with your iPhone at number
two and for number one on this list is
personalization now there's a ton and
ton of personalization with this there
are tons of watch faces different kinds
of casing for the app actual Apple watch
and even new different bands now what
the bands are really easy to change out
all the seems like you have to do is
slide it out and then put in a new one
so there's all kinds of different bands
I think there's a total of six there's
like a leather strap there's a stainless
steel mesh strap that's also really
interesting they also have a fitness
band and all kinds of other straps so
it's really up to you how you want to
use your Apple watch but it seems like
customization is a huge thing that Apple
is going for because one size doesn't
fit all and that's another thing
Apple also introduced that it's going to
come out in two sizes so you'll have a
smaller for those who have a smaller
wrist you can use a smaller Apple watch
or if you have a bigger wrist there's a
bigger one so two sizes for the band's
the actual watch itself all different
kinds of customization there and I love
fagged now if you guys know me you know
I love options and Apple is definitely
making sure that there are tons of
options out there for people who want to
wear watches of all different kinds of
styles so pretty much that's it for
number one now there are probably tons
of features that the Apple watch has
that we don't even know about but so far
these are the top five that I found
interesting I also like this one feature
where it has the navigation on the watch
you can actually know exactly where to
go if you're looking for directions by
looking at your watch and it can
actually vibrate to let you know go left
or go right without even looking at it
so seems pretty cool but it's too bad it
works on Apple maps Apple masters almost
gotten some people on airport landing
strips which is pretty dangerous so I
don't trust the software just yet but I
love where they're going with it but
that wraps up my video on my favorite
features of the Apple watch that has
been announced so far and if you guys
think that a different feature should be
on this top five list leave a comment
down below and maybe I'll overlook
something but pretty much that's it if
you guys enjoyed this video definitely
be the cool guy that gives it a thumbs
up and subscribe to the channel for more
content from me I'm definitely getting
the iPhones and the Apple watch so I
will have coverage coming on that
and that's about it so I'll catch you in
the next video till then is your average
consumer please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
