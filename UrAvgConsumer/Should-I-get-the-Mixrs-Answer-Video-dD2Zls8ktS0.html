want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with dad which consumer
in mind alright let's get to another
tech video what's going on everyone at
your average consumer today I just
wanted to do a quick little video
answering a couple of questions I've
been getting about the beats mixr's now
usually people are asking me whether or
not they should choose between the
mixers and a different pair of beads now
I do like the mixers a lot and I
understand their popularity they have
some great sound quality as well as
really nice build quality and a really
great design but I think the major flaw
with these is how uncomfortable they are
I know I say over and over I'm like I'm
being a dead horse in all my videos but
the uncomfortable it is really is a big
factor to whether or not these are
headphones that you should really invest
in now you want headphones to be
comfortable if you're gonna be listening
to the music for long periods of time
and you just want to be able to listen
to it without really noticing that you
have on the headphones and being
bothered by them the mixers don't do a
good job with that they're really tight
as you can see here the ear cups are
like touching each other that's how
tight they are and if you look at a pair
of like solo HDS you can see the huge
gap and the same thing goes for the
beast' Wireless as well huge gap in
between the ear cups
that's just goes to show you that these
are really stuck together and this kind
of pressure is gonna be on your ears
which you know after a while it's gonna
cause some pain and I know I'm not the
first person to say this so I'm pretty
sure that if the think ongoing thing
with most most mixers out there now
people have been able to remedy this by
putting the mixers on their box that
they come with overnight for a couple of
nights and I've heard that some people
have had some some success with it me
personally when I've tried it didn't
work out and I still
uncomfortable tightness from the
headphones so I can't say how much that
works because I don't know I haven't
experienced it myself but it's really
hard to choose the mixers over any of
the other beats when it's really so
uncomfortable now if you're able to go
to a local Best Buy or
anywhere that has these out on display I
would urge you to try them on and see if
they're a good fit for you if you're
interested in them definitely take the
time to do this and see if it's gonna be
worth the investment as if you do find
it to be comfortable you're definitely a
winner there because these are really
some great headphones I honestly think
that this has better sound quality then
both of the mixers I mean I'm sorry
nothi mixers then both the solo HDS and
the beats Wireless I wouldn't quite say
that oh it has um better sound quality
than the studios but it definitely has
some perks against um it definitely has
some perks that the Beats Studios don't
have such as not meeting batteries or
not leaking nearly as badly
so there's definitely reasons to go with
this over any of the other ones but the
main thing is not is it being
comfortable now if I didn't have the
comfort issues and I were to choose
between the mixers the wireless and the
studios the mixers you win every time
except for the wireless because those
are my firt my favorite pair of Beats so
those I would choose over the mixers but
the mixtures would probably win over
everything else because like I said
before it has great build quality and I
love the design I just think it's a
really great pair of headphones - the
Comfort so if you guys are out there and
interested in purchasing these
definitely go try them on at your local
Best Buy or anywhere that has a mount on
display if they fit I definitely think
it'll be worth the investment because
they're a great pair of headphones if
they don't fit definitely look elsewhere
you might want to try out the solo edge
these although they don't have those
greatest sound quality but you guarantee
that some more come for
then you get from these so I just wanted
to give you guys a little insight look
in my thought process when it comes to
the beat mixers and hopefully this will
help you make a sound purchasing
decision all right guys so this is Jay
average consumer if you like this video
