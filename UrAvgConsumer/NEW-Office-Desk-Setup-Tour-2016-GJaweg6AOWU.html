consumer and it's time for you to
finally get a look at the office of UAC
2.0 so come take a look now when you
look inside of here you'll see a ton of
different doors but mainly a bunch of
closets bathroom yada yada
but over here we have a really really
special room but you guys aren't going
to see that just yet you're definitely
going to want to stay tuned for that
video over here we've had another room
that you guys will see eventually but
not just yet that's a little bit more in
the future so let me show you guys the
actual office so coming down here you
might actually see our board that we got
to get stuff done and this Xbox one that
I'm gonna have to ship out because I'm
doing a giveaway so if you haven't
gotten to that giveaway I'll have a link
down below for you to check it out but
this is the kitchen
starting off it's a little dark right
now but Alexa turn on kitchen lights
okay and boom there you go so we've got
Alexa tucked away right here and this is
where we wanted to be so she's not in
the way of anything she doesn't stand
out nice and quiet and it's still a good
place where we can speak to her and she
can be heard so definitely a cool spot
now let's actually go into the office
space so starting things off we've got
the samsung s UHD 4k television i
believe the model number is the KS 9000
now this isn't a curve TV but flat works
just fine and this is 55 inches great
quality amazing quality really and over
here we've got the Kinect because we've
got an Xbox one hooked up to this guy
there's absolutely no way I'm using a TV
of mine without Kinect so we've got the
Connect hooked up voice controls it's my
life and we've got the Xbox one sitting
right here so whenever we want to play a
game if it comes to that we've got some
time don't throw in some titanfall I'm
good to go
and we've also got right here the
Samsung soundbar I don't remember the
model number of this guy but it works
pretty well for a soundbar and wasn't
really expensive so I think was like
around 300 bucks and it works really
nicely it's not like my sono sound
system but it'll do the job and we've
also got the subwoofer right here so it
pumps off some pretty decent bass so I
was actually pretty surprised by the
quality here but very good stuff now Oh
while we're here this is where we nah
keep the remotes but here's a little
special remote now take a look over here
we've got some big windows very wide and
there's two of them they're very short
now finding blinds for these have been
such a pain it's been a horrible
experience trying to find them
but I found this company called select
blinds and check out this they've got
some awesome customized blinds with some
cool tech I can control both of them
with the push of a button really awesome
stuff and I was just amazed by the fact
that I can actually get these customized
blinds for something this wide and short
so I'll a select blinds I'll have links
down below to them and pretty much
everything else I mentioned in this
video down below in the description and
they even have these little buttons over
here you can just press those if you
want to control it let's say you don't
have the remote press that and you're
good to go you know I even have to get
some tech inside my blind so there you
go but that's the TV this is what we
keep all over here you guys saw my
little party trick and got the Xbox one
and over here we've got the Nvidia
shield that guy now these are the main
things that I keep connected to this TV
nothing else because this is like the
work area not supposed to be a ton of
games I don't know if you guys have
noticed but I've got a bit of a walnut
theme going here
I even got some walnut barstools for the
kitchen so if we're having lunch or
something we've got these guys over here
and got them from Amazon pretty nice
front piece of furniture
I've links to those down below as well
and this is our sitting area it's a big
orange couch that ari and her sister
Anna convinced me to get I was a little
afraid at first but I kind of fell into
the whole orange theme and it spilled
into the logo and all that so that's
pretty cool and actually we got some
logo pillows right here
pretty cool stuff this is actually a
pullout so if I need to crash or if I
have company coming over that needs to
crash boom we've got a built-in bed
right into the couch so let's put this
guy away over here what's this
this is Aries IPAB she never uses it she
always goes to our phone tablets are
dead but over here we've got the HP
pagewide Pro now this is an amazing
amazing printer it's basically made for
like a real office like where you have
your 9 to 5 but we're pretty legit
business we doesn't have a printer like
this this is pretty amazing we've got
this cool little lamp which I can
control with some with Alexa using the
Amazon echo and we're powering it and
those bulbs over there these are some
lifx bulbs where you can control the
color I can turn it on with the voice
Alexa turn on lamp and there you go so
these are powered by lifx bulbs I'll do
like lifx because you can control the
color quite a bit I'm sure you guys what
it could do now what I really like about
these lifx bulbs is that you can control
the colors with the app so you can kind
of just spin it around and you got
access to a ton a ton a ton of colors
now you can even do these really deep
blues that you can't with a lot of the
other bulbs out there get exact greens
so it's really awesome and
you can actually I can actually do the
same thing with the lights in the
kitchen check this out so if I want to
change those up all I got to do boom
turn them green turn them blue just
watch it up however I want but white
typically works best so let's put those
back but yeah that's my little party
trick that I like to surprise people
with when I speak to the Amazon echo
Alexa turn off lamb now something that
I'm really proud of is this little
section right here now this along with a
ton of the other furniture that I got
here is from Ikea and not a sponsor but
these little letters over here we got
from Michaels which is like an art
supply shop and it makes for a great
little shoe spot for shooting so if I
have a product over here I can just
throw something down and it looks really
awesome on camera but it spelled it
spells out hashtag UAC because obviously
I'm UAC well yeah I know some of you
were watching a vlog and saw me trying
to hunt down the a you can see that I
found it very happy with it and it I
also got some other cool little lights
something that I put together with these
little branches with little pieces of
light makes for a great shot when
shooting products these little pieces
really helps with the Bokan and here it
is this is the desk where everything
gets done it's all powered by this 5k
iMac and this is pretty pretty much
where I do all my editing email social
media all that kind of stuff
this is where it all happens and this is
the desk that I use to get it all done
now I know a ton of you are wonder have
been asking me on social media through
emails you guys have been hitting me up
like crazy asking me about the wooden
pieces that I'm using to hook this whole
setup up and actually been stalking this
company called Grove made on Instagram
for months and then I finally decided
hey you know what I got to get my hands
on them
and this is the result super super clean
looking desk and of course you guys know
that the walnut theme is going on
throughout the whole office so I decided
hey I need some clean walnut accessories
for the desk and as you guys can see
here it works perfectly with Apple
products they're made for them and the
fit is just amazing so you've got no
problem fitting these in and it's super
smooth super clean look these are made
specifically for like the Magic Trackpad
or the keyboard and you've got cool
little pieces like this where you can
put in plants or use it to hold pens
whatever you want to do cool little acts
and stuff like this so a lot of slots of
cool stuff I know a lot of you are
asking where did you get the thing
that's holding your Dragon Ball well I
got it from girls made but I've got the
six star dragon ball over there because
birthday's in June so after a good six
for six that works okay but if you guys
have hawk guys you might have noticed
that I have some more scattered around
this office I've got about four of them
scattered around this office because if
you're familiar with Dragon Ball Z you
know they don't all stay in one spot so
if you got some hot guys you might have
notice where they all went
but this is pretty much it this is where
I have everything I'm stoked about this
desk I have fallen in love with it and
if you guys want to check them out I
have links to their Instagram account as
well as their store so you can find in
their products and check it out for
yourselves I know a ton of you are
asking so there goes my secret it's
right here but this guy right here this
isn't my Grove made I got this from
Amazon and it kind of fits in pretty
decently with everything else and its
housing some v-moda m100
these are what i typically use when i am
on the computer so this is the set up
and over here you can see that app also
got a dot for my iPhone so they make
Doc's for it as well and this is this is
the double-oh-seven sword this guy is
amazing if you guys haven't watched done
them before I highly highly suggest it
but that guy is amazing he's a metal
build for
those of you who know about this stuff
so you know he's he's pretty rare and
the mouse that I use is the Logitech
g600 2 actually got re one as well
because it's just like the best mouse
for editing I think personally because
you got those macro buttons on the sides
you can do a ton of stuff and this desk
does have some drawers so let's take a
look at what we got inside of here over
here we've got a notebook some pens and
pencils you know just some stuff so that
I can jot down ideas really quickly if I
need to I've got a little picture of
this ugly girl you guys might know her
but that's in one drawer and over here
we've got a little bit of tech nothing
too crazy some ear buds some portable
chargers hard drives or solid-state
drives
lots of storage some Mouse's pretty
basic stuff I don't keep anything too
crazy inside of here this desk is mainly
made just to get the regular work done
so this isn't like the tech heavy office
so I try to keep it a little simple here
and if you guys want to see Ares little
setup she's got a lot the same thing
going on
we've got grove made stuff on here as
well instead of plants she has the tall
ones with pencils and stuff like that
but one thing that I like about her
setup that's a little different from
mine is that she's got these Bose
speakers I believe either the companion
50s or something like that but these are
really awesome speakers that she uses
and it has this little control here
which is really awesome as well and
instead of a Dragonball this is what
she's got going on gives it a nice
little clean look that's the thing I
like about these growth made products
they can take your setup and make it
look super super clean like we both have
these big stands for our IMAX to sit on
and it gives us some nice height so we
can be at eye level so I'm really a fan
of their stuff if you can't tell also
one thing that we have on these IMAX is
this little stand it's like a little
turntable that it can be on so you can
swivel it if you guys haven't if you own
an iMac you know that turning it or
something is quite a hassle since it's
so heavy this
super easy super smooth but yeah that's
that and we've got this little uncounted
do all the scheduling all the posts that
needs to be done that gets done over
here and actually I didn't even mention
these chairs now I can show you guys
these black we both have it on both
sides but we've got these little chairs
we've got from Amazon not very expensive
and it's actually pretty comfortable we
have to get this little mat on your just
so that it doesn't our jeans don't
transfer on it since they're white but
they've been really comfortable and
we've got these little butt stands so
that we can uh you know just relax but I
need one of these whenever I'm at my
desk I need to have my foot on something
and we figured why put it on the wall or
the little bars on the desk get
something dedicated to it a super super
cheap so I've got one of those both
speaker has like a subwoofer right here
and on the side you'll notice we have a
little box and this little box is where
all the cables are hiding sort of but
that's where all the cables are stored
and plugged in and really I think we've
come full circle this has been the
office tour for UAC 2.0 hopefully you
guys enjoyed it we have another video of
another tour coming really soon so I'm
so excited for you guys to see that one
