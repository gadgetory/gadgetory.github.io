consumer CES 2015 is over but I'm gonna
give you guys a quick rundown of the top
five pieces of tech that I saw now
there's obviously a ton of cool stuff at
CES but these are the things that I
could see myself using on a daily basis
either way let's not waste any time
let's get right into it now this list
isn't in any particular order but we're
gonna kick start it with my favorite
category headphones to my surprise
Sennheiser released the momentum
Wireless a Bluetooth option of the
popular Sennheiser Momentum's I'm a
sucker for wireless headphones so this
immediately caught my attention and it
still has the same overall design
however it does come with built-in
Bluetooth controls Sennheiser made some
very welcome improvements such as larger
more comfortable ear cups as well as
adding hinges so that the Momentum's can
finally fold I'm pretty excited about
these however I'm not thrilled about the
$500 price tag now alongside the
momentum wireless Sennheiser also
released the momentum Wireless on ears
up next we have the star mobile device
of the show the LG G flex 2 the G flex 2
is the improved successor of the
original G flex featuring a 5.5 inch pio
LED curve display running at 1080p a
snapdragon 810 processor clocked at 2.0
gigahertz 2 to 3 gigs of ram depending
on your region a 13 megapixel rear
camera with laser autofocus and optical
image stabilization a 2.1 megapixel
front facing camera and 3000 milliamp
battery and all of this is pushing
Android 5.0 lollipop and there are some
cool features like being able to check
your notifications without completely
turning on the display as well as some
interesting ways to get your selfie game
going and of course that self-healing
that made the original G flex so popular
now it wouldn't be CES if we didn't talk
about TVs and Sony has one that
definitely caught my eye this is the
Sony X 900 C now this is the thinnest TV
that you're probably gonna see for a
very long time it was pretty shocking to
see a 4k television so thin that it
could fit between my fingertips those
are some crazy bezels I don't know what
that means for the durability of this
guy but it looks great and if I wasn't
so sure that this thing would be the
cost of three cities I'd probably have
it on my radar and then there was the Z
board too
I got a chance to write this guy and man
that I enjoy it they improved just about
everything with the Z bore to that you
could have possibly asked for and now
it's the top speed at 20 miles per hour
it can go for 16 miles with only about
16 pounds and it has a recharge time of
90 minutes they did add some more bells
and whistles to the Z board too and if
you're interested in learning more about
it I'll have a video link down below in
the description if you want to check it
out but this is supposed to be coming
out in the summer and I can't wait to
get my hands on it and last but not
least we have the razor turret this is a
gaming keyboard that has a fold-out
magnetic trackpad and this is the ideal
gaming setup for gamers who play on the
couch I'm actually one of those guys so
this looks like a godsend to me with a
magnetic trackpad you don't have to
worry about your mouse slipping off
while you're enjoying the action from
your game the mouse has a 3,500 DPI
sensor which is more than enough for me
and surprisingly I don't even want this
for PC use I see myself using this with
my ps4 so I can play Final Fantasy 14
this could be a very nice upgrade from
the random Logitech keyboard that I'm
using right now what's also pretty great
about this is how conveniently it can be
stored away when you're finished using
it I'm not sure how much this will cost
yet but I'm pretty sure I'll be picking
one up and that pretty much wraps up my
list like I said there's tons of
different tech icees
but these are the ones that I could
actually see myself using day-to-day
going to CES was a great experience and
I definitely can't wait to do it all
again next year if you guys enjoyed the
video be the cool guy that gives it a
thumbs up and till the next video it's
your average consumer
