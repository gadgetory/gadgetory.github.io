our sponsor for this video hotspot
shield is a free internet security and
privacy solution for all of us average
consumers out there who just want to
surf the web without any worries about
getting our identity stolen or our
secure passwords taken so high special
does this through what's called a VPN
and a VPN is a virtual private network
that pretty much makes a bubble around
your internet browsing and protection
from all the malicious things out there
like hackers spammers all kinds of crazy
stuff so you can use this in places like
airports hotels things like that where
the average consumer sometimes doesn't
know is that sometimes there are people
lurking on these networks who are just
waiting for you to log in and steal your
identity when you log into like let's
say your bank account or anything like
that so hotspot shield does provide you
protection from things like that so if
you're a frequent traveler you
definitely want to use the service it's
free to sign up all you have to do is
