want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey guys
mister average consumer and I have
another review for you guys today we're
looking at the beats Wireless by dre
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it so here you are with the beats
Wireless as you can see they look very
similar to a solo HDS but I can say that
they are not like to solo it to these in
all aspects the band and the overall
design is right up there with the solo
HDS but the big difference are the ear
cups we already know that they're
wireless so they have this side has the
bluetooth controls and decide as you
know your standard and but they both
have the blue the little blue lights the
little blue LEDs that blink just you
know like all the rules use that show
that their Bluetooth what makes this
different from the solo HDS is that the
ear cups are actually larger here I have
a pair of solid C's to prepare and as
you can see this stands much higher than
this if solo H these are smaller they
have smaller cups compared to the
wireless also when you look inside
there's a lot more cushion on the the
wireless than there are on the solo a to
these this actually feels really small
in comparison to these even though they
look very similar that I'm putting on my
solely entities after using my wireless
I can definitely tell the difference
that's as far as the differences goes in
between those the build quality is what
you're going to expect from some solo
HDS so there are no real surprises here
you definitely feel the difference in
the sound quality these have a lot more
bass compared to the solo HDS or even
the mixers I'm not sure about the
studios because I can't
I haven't been able to compare them
while I've had these but the base is is
very real huh on the Bluetooth now a lot
of people would think that because it's
bluetooth and it's wireless that the
sound quality is lacking because of that
that is by no means true now I'm not an
audiophile so I can't say it reaches all
the highs and lows but I can tell you
from you know a regular person just
listening to their iPod who's not an
audiophile or some music technician
professional these are great and the
sound is great on these I think they're
better than solar et's in my opinion I
like this a little more I like it a
little more because of the base then the
mixers but the mixers were clearer in
hearing like Glee ryx it's just you can
hear the layers completely fine on these
but the mixers did the lyrics to sound a
little louder and you know the vocals
sound a little louder than these this
might be because this has so much bass
it might drown it out a little bit but I
honestly like the bass and the vocals
aren't lacking to the point where I
can't hear it or anything or you know I
really feel it's impaired so I
definitely think that well geez the
sound quality on these are great they're
definitely out of the range of solo HDS
the Bluetooth controls those they're
great but they have some quirks I've had
no issues connecting to my iPod or my
iPad but I did have a couple of issues
with connecting to my computer I have a
MacBook Pro and for some reason it just
didn't get along with this I don't know
too many people who might actually want
to pair the Bluetooth I mean they might
actually want to pair this to their
computers but you know they're your
headphones you want them to work with
everything you have my experience was
that it
didn't work didn't play well with my
MacBook Pro but it did work fine with my
ipod worked fine with my iPad and worked
fine with my Android cell phone which is
a g2 it worked well with that too
I don't think I was able to make calls
though the person on the receiving end
couldn't hear me so I don't know if
that's just something with my phone that
didn't support it
I'm sure if you have something like the
iPhone you'll be fine with no problems
as far as certain sounds though when I
use my ipod there were times where I can
see the there was a bit of lag between
the sound between my actions and the
sound that came in on the headphones
like unlocking the screen with the you
know four digits I would finish pressing
it and while it's already unlocked I'd
still hear the the numbers being pressed
and then the unlock happening like a
second later so there's you know a bit
of lag between you know the sound and
actions but nothing that would warrant
you know staying away from these one
issue that I did come across with the
build quality of these is when walking
outside as I had these on there was this
very irritating creep going on and I
looked it up online and I wasn't the
only one experiencing this it was on the
left side I believe some people were
complaining about it on the right side
so I'm guessing it's just you know
random um I don't know how often that'll
happen with these pairs but it
definitely happened with mine and it was
irritating it hasn't done it lately for
me but it's really on and off so it just
very frustrated when you know you're
walking down the street and you know
you're listening to your music and all
you hear just like the squeak
squeak-squeak of the headphones while
you while you want I definitely would
suggest if you hear that return them
get a new one and see how it works out
but I would like to warn you that that
is possible and I've heard other people
complaining about that as well I really
don't get too many surprises with these
as they're pretty much what you would
expect from these headphones what did
surprise me was how good the sound
quality was I didn't expect it to be as
good I actually thought it would be
worse than something like the solos
because it was Wireless but that it's
not lacking at all it's actually better
so I know since there are a little
bigger than the solo HDS are probably
wondering if they're heavy or not
they're not heavy at all it's you know
slightly bigger than this always these
nothing that you'd notice a big
difference and they're very comfortable
because there's so much cushion on the
ear pads it's it feels like you're
wearing a pair of marshmallows they're
great I am very comfortable wearing it
no cord made it even better I had no no
no issues with a cord and just great so
as far as the experience of wearing it
it was I've had a great experience
the only thing would be that creaking
sound while I'm walking alright guys so
that's one if you want the beats
Wireless like I said they're a great
pair of headphones race sound quality
really great bass better than you think
because you know because it's bluetooth
but like I said it does have some issues
with the creaking sound that you will
experience maybe when you're walking
like I said Ford if you experience that
I would suggest taking it back to where
you got it and getting a new pair
overall this is great this great pair of
headphones these are actually my
favorite ones over the it's always Dee's
the mixers these are the oh my go-to
headphones and the convenience of them
is great the Bluetooth works well
although you might hear a slight lag
with certain actions that you do on your
iPod or phone there might be a slight
lag but it's not a deal-breaker it's
like a second
it's really going to school I would
highly recommend getting these if you
are in the market for a new pair
headphones and you want something
Wireless these are the way to go
and I also suggest that you guys pick it
up from Best Buy as they have warranty I
know I sounds like a spokesman right now
but it's really a great deal because I
think you pay maybe $50 extra and
basically have a two-year warranty
where you can just if you have any
issues you just bring it right back and
bring the pair of headphones right back
and it gives you a brand new pair I
think it's a great deal I've used it on
numerous occasions for some of my older
headphones so I highly suggest you guys
pick that up is retail than 270 $9.99
it's a bit pricier it's the price fit
because it's between the studios and the
solo HDS so it's kind of got that middle
ground and it's a great pair of
headphones I highly recommend picking
them up if you're in the market for some
wireless headphones
alright guys your average consumer

be sure to answer them
I appreciate guys looking at the video
thanks
