consumer and today I've got a 4k video
test for you guys on the camera of the
Samsung Galaxy s5 now this is actually
recording right now I'm actually using
the Samsung Galaxy s5 to record this
intro so you guys are seeing what the 4k
looks like in a controlled environment
like my office and one thing to note
about the galaxy s5 is that when you're
recording in 4k you don't have access to
optical image stabilization and while
optical image stabilization is it
basically keeps this video steady when
you're moving around so you won't get
that jittery shaky kind of look but
there's none of that on 4k so a lot of
these shots and test shots that I've
done I actually use a tripod and some of
them I use tenpel so you'll be able to
see the differences there but enough of
my blabbering let's not waste any time
and there you have a guy some 4k sample
shots of the galaxy s5 it looks to me
like it performs best outdoors during
the day recording situations outside of
that doesn't seem to be too spectacular
let me know what you guys think in the
comments down below but before we close
out this video here's a quick message
from our sponsor hotspot Shield is a
free internet security and privacy
solution so the use of a virtual private
network or VPN for short you get
protection from harmful websites and
allows you to browse the web securely
one of my favorite features is the
ability to access blocked websites and
content no matter where you are for
example here's what someone in the US
would typically see from the BBC iPlayer
in UK but with hotspot Shield VPN we can
access content even from the UK hospital
is available for Windows Mac iOS and
Android and if you're interested in
getting behind the shield check the
links down below in the description and
that's about it for this video guys if
you enjoyed it be the cool guy that hits
the like button and subscribe to the
channel for more content from me so the
next video guys is your average consumer
