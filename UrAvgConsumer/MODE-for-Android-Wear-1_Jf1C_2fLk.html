today let's talk about some wearable
tech I think we're all pretty familiar
with Android wear watches and how you
can pick a set style to go with before
you pull the trigger but now there's a
new way to add some customization to a
ton of popular Android wear watches
without having to buy a whole new watch
to switch up your style cue the mode
bands Google was cool enough to send me
over some of their watches so let's jump
right in and check out what this multi
system is all about
so mode is a system that basically lets
you choose your mode of the day or
moment and they have a plethora of bands
with varying colors and materials so you
can truly customize your SmartWatch and
you get to choose between silicon or
leather which I think those are the more
sought-after materials when it comes to
watch bands the bands come in different
sizes to fit different watch faces and
range from 16 millimeters to 22
millimeters and then added nice touch is
the retail packaging that comes with
measurements you can use to determine
whether your watch is compatible with
the band you're looking at but if you
don't have it on you the front also
lifts compatibility now let's jump into
the fun stuff
let's start with the Huawei watch you've
probably been hearing about Huawei a lot
recently
they made the Nexus 6p but they've also
got this nice watch that comes with a
silver face and a black leather band was
white stitching now imagine I'm suited
up and I finished my day and I want to
workout instead of sweating through the
leather band I can easily use the mode
system and switch to a more appropriate
sporty look with the traditional bands
you push these little nubs to pop off
the current band and no lie in two
seconds they're off you then choose your
band which comes with a tool and silver
bars to apply to your watch face so you
can use your hands or the tool to put in
the little bars and then you're all set
the mode system makes it even easier and
a lot more simple to swap between any of
the new mode bands compared to the
traditional ones now let's imagine the
reverse I'm prepping for date night so
naturally I need to get these ABS right
and I'm working with my moto 360 and a
silicon band and when I suit up I'm
gonna want to switch into something
that's a little more sleek and
sophisticated what's nice is I have the
Moto 360 so I can opt for a smaller and
sleeker band I've got my navy blue mode
band to match my navy blue suit switch
it out and boom just like that I have a
completely new looking watch with the
right look but whether you're using one
of the silicon or leather bands they
have a really nice feel to them and
they're pretty solid so you don't have
to really worry about quality so if you
plan on getting your hands on an Android
wear watch or you've already got one
definitely look into the mode band so
that you can switch it up and customize
it to your styling based on whatever
you're doing at the moment and they make
these for women too so ladies you're not
missing out but you can find these at
the Google store Amazon or even Best Buy
and to be honest this is really what
Android is all about customization and
being able to change something based on
your preferences and they're continuing
it with the new mode system which I'm a
fan of but hopefully you guys enjoyed
this if you did be sure to leave this
video a thumbs up subscribe to the
channel for more content from me and
definitely check the links down below in
the description if you want to pick out
some bands for yourself but total next
one guys is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
