consumer and today we're going to be
taking a look at the top five best
office tech first on the list is a
pretty great fine the back a motorized
desk from Ikea motorized desks are
becoming more and more popular because
of the known health benefits of standing
as opposed to sitting while working and
being able to adjust your desk to the
ideal height while sitting that means no
more hunting over the type for you
giants out there and in the tech world
there are a couple of motorized desks
but they can cost over a thousand
dollars but this bad boy is only 469
which is still pricey for a desk but way
better than some of the other options
out there at 63 by 31.5 inches is the
perfect size for a decent setup you can
adjust the height electronically from 22
inches which is really short but
actually pretty good for kids all the
way up to 48 inches I'm pretty excited
to use this desk for some dual product
shots and for the occasional moments
where I don't want to sit while getting
some work done second on this list is a
bit of a game changer and shout out to
LG for sponsoring today's video and
sending this guy out
this is LG's Ultra ride 38 you c99 know
what that 38 stands for 38 inches folks
this is a massive screen with a 38 40 by
1600 resolution and a 21 by 9 aspect
ratio this monitor can up any offices
productivity by providing a ton of real
estate for multitasking and just getting
things done you've got all the ports
you'd expect in the back as well as a
USB type-c port which connects the
displayed to my new MacBook and also
powers it not only can you use this as a
giant screen for multitasking but you
can even connect to things to it via the
DisplayPort so if you want to dual wield
some laptops or computers that's
completely possible it has some other
awesome features like Bluetooth audio so
if you want to connect the mobile device
to your monitor for some music playback
you can do that too I know it's kind of
crazy to use monitor speakers for
something like this but I gotta say
after testing it I was completely blown
away by its performance but whether you
use the Bluetooth feature or not you've
got some awesome sound to go with this
great display and it even has free sync
for some of you gamers out there now if
the monitor wasn't impressive
it's own LG decided to spice things up
by giving away 15 of these to some of
you guys and even a grand prize winner
will get a creative death setup worth
$10,000 so for all the details hit the
links in the description and if one of
you guys win you better let me know on
Twitter or something now I'm kind of
cheating with this one but I had to show
it to you guys since I feel like my best
levelled up with some of these editions
my desk is decked out with these
beautiful grove made products and I saw
these guys on Instagram and had to get
my hands on these since walnut is kind
of the theme for this office space and
since getting my hands on them I've
fallen in love I definitely plan on
getting some more of the products so I
can kind of complete the collection and
what's awesome is that they make a ton
of different products to support items
typically found in des setups my
favorite is the Apple keyboard holder
since it just fits so perfectly and it
gives us such a clean look and honestly
all of the items take everything to the
next level mine are all in walnut but
they also offer maple which is a lighter
wood if you're looking to have kind of
an atypical and unique look to your desk
or you just want to find some cool wood
and functional items like phone cases or
even pocket knives you're definitely
going to want to check these guys out
now the theme here is beautiful yet
functional and I found that in this
Satechi smart LED desk lamp this sleek
touch sensitive lamp comes in a glossy
black or white and it provides a decent
amount of light it actually has four
different modes for four different types
of environments the warmer modes are
relaxation and bedtime mode and the
cooler modes are study and reading mode
so there's a mode for whatever you're
into and you've even got options in
terms of the angle of the light you can
swivel the lamp from a 90 degree angle
all the way up to a 140 degree angle
which is great if you want light in a
more or less concentrated area on your
desk this dust lamp also includes a USB
port in the back so you can
simultaneously charge your phone or
other devices so if you decide to put
one of these in your office you can
charge your phone and keep it nearby and
honestly it never hurts to have an extra
charger at the best
limp is a little pricey but worth it if
you have the extra cash to blow since
it's multifunctional and adds
minimalistic but attractive look to your
desk and last but not least is the
Logitech MX master the mouse isn't
understated but essential parts of any
desk setup especially if you're using a
desktop computer and I'm picky with the
mouse's I use and yes you can say
Mouse's or mice when talking about
computers and the MX master is my pick
for everyday people looking for a mouse
that adds a little something extra like
typical Mouse's the MX master has a
left-click for selection and a
right-click for additional options it
also has a scroll wheel that allows you
to smoothly scroll up or down a page and
write where your thumb naturally rest
there's a scroll wheel you can access so
you can move things horizontally this is
super clutch if you're working with a
big Excel spreadsheet since you can
seamlessly move horizontally so you can
access more of the page but my favorite
feature is the ability to sync these to
three different devices you have three
different profiles so if you want to use
one at work home or on the go with your
laptop you've got that freedom but
overall it's a solid choice for the
average consumer you see what I did
