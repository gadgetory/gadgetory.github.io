alright guys today we're taking out a
new space and making a dope editing
setup for one of our employees and you
guys might have seen you interact with
Jay on the channel before but he does a
lot of hard work for us from shooting to
editing and even taking a lot of work
home so we wanted to give him a really
cool comfortable setup so that when he's
working at home he's all good to go he
happened to have a den area in his
apartment that was mainly used for
storing things so it was the perfect
place for us to transform it isn't a
huge space like a bedroom or anything
but the idea here is to make it very
functional given the limited room and I
figured this could be a good guide for
you if you're working with a smaller
space but this is what it turned into
now if a clear focal point for this room
is the desk with a triple monitor set up
amongst a few other things that make it
really functional and the computer he's
rocking is an iMac Pro that I by no
means provided well don't quite got it
like that but thankfully he already had
one and I just wanted to kick up his
experience by adding two LG ultra fine
5k monitors and I like the idea of
having a lot of real estate especially
when worked as involved because it
allows you to multitask and keep her eye
on a bunch of projects at once but yeah
that's what he's handling all of his
work but we added a few more things to
his desk as well one of the more
interesting pieces are these Dolby
dimension headphones now these are
actually straight from the company Dolby
and not some other manufacturer that's
just borrowing their technology and we
were able to get an exclusive look at
them before launch day which is today
but as a headphone guy I gotta say they
did a lot of good moves for their first
headphone they're made of a leather
material and have very soft ear cups
which is really important for Jason he's
sitting behind the computer for so long
listening to video and audio but it's
also very good for everyday content
consumption like watching movies and
listening to music
Dolby is calling this their cinematic
sound which aims to provide a ton of
depth dimension and clarity to audio and
it was tuned to sound like this thanks
to their own engineers it also has some
pretty cool features like being able to
connect up to three different devices
and being able to toggle between them
with the three little buttons on the
right ear cut and you also get touch
controls for your audio on the right ear
cup as well one of the biggest features
and probably the biggest selling point
of these headphones is what Dolby's
calling their life mix feature this mode
allows you to hear outside sounds around
you while you're listening to your audio
so if Jays watching a movie and his wife
calls him they'll be able to hear her
pretty clearly or if he wants to jam out
on his headphones but doesn't want to
miss anything that may be happening
around him like his dog hyeju trying to
get his attention the outside audio
comes in pretty clearly without
overpowering the original audio and with
the included app you could control the
transparency of this feature so you can
tune into just how you like and if he
wants to go nuts and binge watch some
Netflix he can do this smarter by not
completely missing out on what's going
on around him they also sit pretty
nicely on the desk here because of the
included dock that also charges it but
you can also charge it with a micro USB
cable but I will say I do
USB type-c instead but if you guys want
to learn more I love course have a link
down below in the description but moving
on to the rest of the desk we do have a
few more peripherals and we kept the
original keyboard that came with the
iMac probe since honestly there aren't
any third-party keyboards out there that
quite beat it just yet
now with the mouse he's using he's got
the Logitech g600 2 which is my personal
favorite mouse and that's what we have
all over the studio and the reason why
we love this mouse so much is because it
has these programmable buttons which
makes it a lot easier to edit we just
set our shortcuts to them and it makes
the editing process a lot easier and
figured if he wants the same experience
I'll have the 6:02 at home as well now
as for the mousepad he's using we've got
the SteelSeries I believe it's called
quick prism and this bounce mat is
actually really nice if the texture is
great but it also has those RGB lights
around the very top which is kind of
cool because usually RGB lights on mouse
pads are on the sides the top means
you'll be able to see it even when
you're using it so I think that's really
cool and that's what he's got right here
which actually fits well with his whole
blue look that we're going for in this
room and you might have noticed the
sound bar under the iMac Pro which is
actually the Sound Blaster ex katana
we found this in micro Center and I got
to say it really caught my attention
because of those RGB lights but I never
used a sound bar under a computer before
so it was really interesting to see how
this performed and it actually sounds
really good it also includes a subwoofer
so it sounds very powerful I was
actually really impressed to stumble
across this you can adjust the sound
quality by changing into these different
modes I think every mode has its own RGB
light situation going on and I will say
this sound bar is a lot more compact
than I thought it was going to be which
is a very nice surprise because who
wants a giant sound bar under their
computer and we've included a little
wireless phone charger so when he goes
in he just throws phone down it's right
there it's in sight and it'll be able to
get on with his work without looking for
some kind of cable and we also threw in
a Google home mini because why not it's
really small and compact it's always
nice to have a voice assistant nearby
and it's also got some really nice
functionality when the TV that he's got
right on the side
Soha on the right side of his room he's
got a 55 inch samsung TV 4k all that you
come to expect but it also has a
chromecast
to it so when he wants to tell the
Google mini to play a certain show
that'll pop right up on his screen with
it's from Hulu or Netflix chromecast and
Google homework well together if you
want to have some show stream without
having such a remote and he already had
a PlayStation 4 slim so we threw that in
there but we did get a cool little dock
so that he can touch his controllers
whenever he's done using it and to the
right of that we also have an Xbox one s
I figured why not have best of both
worlds
you got your ps4 on the side Xbox one s
on the other side the Xbox one s is
great because he could take advantage of
that 4k TV since he's not really getting
that from the ps4 and he'll be able to
stream his shows in 4k right from the
system and since he has a samsung tv I
figured why not throw in a Samsung
soundbar it's kind of up the experience
I'm I'm all about sound bars guys
they're way better than the dedicated
audio within the TV or computers so it's
always a nice upgrade to have those and
with the included sub he's gonna get a
lot more punch than he ever did before
and that's pretty much it for the tech
side of things but for those of you
curious about the furniture that we used
we went with a couple of things from
Ikea
the desk itself is a back in kitchen
countertop it's got a funky name they
always do it not here but this is the 74
inch one so it's nice and long and it
provides enough space to get whatever
you need on the desk and we use one of
their own legs and coupled that with an
alux drawer so he has a ton of storage
whenever he wants to put things away and
we also got the TV stand from Ikea to I
don't quite remember what the name of
that one was but I'll of course have it
linked down below in the description now
let's talk a little bit about lighting
by the lamps that we have on the side we
also got those from Ikea but the little
bulbs that are inside we actually found
them on Amazon we wanted to go Philips
hue but the prices were just ridiculous
twelve bulbs in total will just cost way
too much money so we found some cheaper
alternatives over on Amazon and they
surprisingly worked really well even the
backlighting that you guys see across
the desk and behind the TV stand
those aren't philips hue or lifx they're
actually straight from Ikea they have
these little light sets that you can
purchase which cost a lot less than the
regular light suits that I get and he's
still able to change all the colors of
all that if he wanted to but for those
of you out there who want some
inexpensive light but still want to have
those different colors these are some
pretty decent options and last but not
least we gotta respect the jaegers that
are in this room J built them just like
I did my own Gundam so I'm proud of him
uh-huh but we have one on his desk we
built a little shelf that holds a few of
them as well and he's insert the whole
robot thing so I really really
appreciate that he even has like the
Iron Man Hulkbuster suit above his iMac
so I think it all came together it's got
a really nice beam going and of course
you guys know I had to reveal the room
to Jay and here's how he reacted yeah so
we got the iMac Pro we got the two 5k
monitors from LG over here and we have
all of the jaegers my man these aren't
quite Gundams but he's got these
Yeager's and we even got them we got a
little YouTube playing showing the thing
actually is a it looks pretty clean we
weren't too sure about this at first
yeah so this thing actually doesn't look
too bad
you know the idea here was to keep it
nice and clean minimal even though
you're editing and doing all that and
you got your stuff all over the place
and whenever you're done editing you're
done working you can always jump on over
here
so no you got your TV over here you also
have the PlayStation that you already
had I decided you gotta have an Xbox as
well you can't just you can't be on one
side man and that's pretty much the
setup guys so hopefully you guys can
draw a little bit of inspiration from
this if you're working with a smaller
space or maybe if you're looking for a
few things on a budget like lighting and
stuff let me know what you guys think of
this transformation I'll of course have
everything linked down below in the
description but till the next one guys
it's your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
