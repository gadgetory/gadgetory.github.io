today I'm going to be doing a comparison
of the iphone 5s camera to the HTC One S
camera and this can be a bit of a
comparison between most of the one s
series cameras because they're pretty
much the same but um listen always same
time let's get right into it alright
guys we saw for a second a huge video
quality grab in the intro between the
two front facing cameras but that won't
be the same for the rear ones we have
the iphone 5 on the right and the HTC
One S on the left they both have amazing
8-megapixel rear cameras and the main
difference that can be found between the
two is that the HTC One S seems to have
more vibrant colors than the iphone 5
and when comparing some of the brighter
colors like the orange on this shop the
iphone 5 seems to have seems to be a
little washed out in comparison to the
1s and so that just makes the one that
stand out a bit more to me some may see
this has a flaw of the 1s though as they
might say the colors might be a bit more
exaggerated here we have some indoor
shots without the best lighting since we
won't always get lucky with a bunch of
sunlight or indoor lighting in my
opinion the iphone 5 performed better in
some of the darker areas as it showed
more attention to detail than the 1s
could produce although I still like the
kind of color we were getting from the
one s minus some of the white areas like
on this little bike sea and tires since
they seem to be a bit fuzzy and produce
sort of a ghost effect in comparison to
what the iphone 5 produced also
something to note with the iPhone 5 is
that it has much better image
stabilization which means you won't get
this you won't see as much camera
shaking after you finish recording your
video and this could be very helpful
when you're taking outdoor shots or
walking around with the phone just like
I am here and I think that's a great
bonus that the iPhone 5 has over the 1s
and here we have the front-facing camera
as I said before there's a huge gap in
quality you see here the iphone 5s
front-facing camera is
quite respectable in regard to kind of
quality you'll get from it while the 1s
will simply do what it's there to as you
can see in this clip the one else has a
harder time dealing with the sunlight
then the iphone 5 does and that causes
the clip to get very dark whenever
there's light facing it the one that
says camera won't impress anyone but it
will simply get the job done by showing
you your face clearly enough to video
chat or even use it as a mirror now
we'll take a look at the difference
between a few still shots up first is
the 1s and the first thing you'll notice
is that it's in a 16 by 9 aspect ratio
which basically means it's in a wide
screen layout like your HDTV while the
iphone pictures come out in a four by
three aspect ratio which is like a
standard television but more on that
later just like the video shots I found
that I like the way the 1s performs more
than outdoor settings and the iphone
more indoors but if you're going to
change a few of the settings on the 1s
you could get a close to or better shot
than the iphone does indoors as well and
that leads me to my next topic HTC does
phenomenal work when it comes to the
camera software as you can see me play
with my settings a bit here you can see
that there's a ton of options to choose
from from resolution to exposure to
timers to white balance and so on and so
on unfortunately I don't think the
average consumer will care to jump into
all those settings but luckily it takes
great pictures without you having to
change anything and this alone gives the
one that's a huge leg up over the iphone
as you can see here these settings are
all the iphone's camera offers as well
as your options for flash the camera on
the iPhone offers almost no real
settings so customization is very
limited here which is very Apple esque
luckily for us like most of apple's
products it just works so you don't
really have to worry too much about
those settings in order to take good
pictures or video now to show you how
fast they take pictures
that was pretty fast in my opinion the
speed that HTC's One series takes
pictures has always been a big selling
point but check out the iphone 5 even
faster right I was very impressed that
the iphone 5 was so much faster than the
one s with single shots but it doesn't
hold a candle to this and that bird shop
captured 20 pictures in that short
amount of time very very fast and that
pretty much wraps up my comparison of
the cameras of the iphone 5 and the HTC
One S i believe the camera on the 1's is
pretty similar to that of the other one
series phones in HCC's lineup overall
there are both grey cameras with
different strengths depending on the
situation luckily for the one phones
they have settings that can combat
unappealing situations or even make use
of them to make a good shot better
without the use of settings though they
are both great cameras and I'm sure the
average consumer will be more than
thrilled with the quality of either of
them alright guys and I hope you enjoyed
this comparison if you did feel free to
give it a thumbs up leave a comment and
subscribe alright guys it's your average
consumer until the next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
