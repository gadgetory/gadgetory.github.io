consumed err and today I've got a review
for you guys of the brand-new Beats Tour
version 2 2013 2.0 whatever you want to
call it this is a new beat stores and
hey let's not waste any time
let's get right into it and alright guys
here we have new beats towards version 2
and I'm sorry I made you guys wait so
long for this review but it's finally
here
but first let's take a quick look at the
case that these come in it's a very
similar case to the old version it's a
hardshell case with a different logo in
the front and what you'll find inside is
pretty much the same thing as always you
have your earphones inside and when you
remove those you'll see that it has a
little pouch that you can store extra
earbuds or even the new little some
secure fit wings that the new toys come
with so it's pretty much the same stuff
it'll offer good protection no surprises
here and taking a look at the earbuds
themselves you can see that it has a
completely new design and you can see
that it has a semi clear casing around
where the L and the arse are you can see
through it and you can see a bit of the
internals a little red cable inside so I
think it has a nice little touch to it
looks pretty good and when you remove
the ear tips you can actually see that
it has a little red speaker grille so
that's a nice little touch as well I do
like the way it looks it looks pretty
nice now one of my favorite changes of
the new design is the actual angle that
the ear tips go in so in the old version
you'll see that it can go upward but
this one it doesn't go upward it goes
inwards so it's kind of hard to describe
but if you look at the ear tips of the
old one it points upward while the new
ones it goes towards your ear canal so
it'll hit the eardrum a lot better
that'll provide better sound quality and
it's an overall better fit so it
definitely was very happy with that
and speaking of fits these come with a
secure fit wing tip so that you can add
this on to have extra security when
you're using these and I found that
these did work very very well I was
actually very surprised at how good
these were so when using these you can
walk around and not worry about it
budging at all
but to be on
Vishu with the new design I didn't have
an issue with the slipping out anyway so
it was really just an added bonus
and I felt that I didn't need this
pretty much most of the time so very
good stuff here and I like that they
went the extra mile and what's great
about these is that they actually fit
pretty well as you can see inside my
ears I've had no issues here I can move
around move my head and you see a stays
in place so that's really good stuff on
there and very glad that they came out
with that now looking at the actual
inline remote you'll see that they got
to the new design now no longer do they
have the old button that was silver now
they have what looks like a standard
Beach remote so no surprises here but
glad to see that they updated this some
go with the rest of the line and in case
you were curious what it looked like
compared to the old one here it is the
old one was just very square very out of
place in comparison to the new things
that have come out from beads now one
thing that was a blessing in disguise to
me is how much smaller they made
everything from the cables to the little
parts that are actually on the earbuds
everything is a lot smaller and this
makes a world of difference when walking
around with these every day
when comparing it to the old one you can
see here that this little piece it made
it a lot heavier when walking around
with it and it made the ear tube fall
out of your ears where this one you
don't have that issue whatsoever the new
version has taken care of that maybe is
a lot lighter and a lot better and they
also included a new input Jack where
it's a lot more raised than before so to
work with more cases definitely a fan
now of course to talk about the sound
quality I really do like the sound
quality that I got from these it was a
bit of an improvement in comparison to
the old ones if you're a bass head the
bass is a lot more present here than it
was before and what's great about this
is it didn't sacrifice sound clarity so
you'll be able to hear instruments and
vocals and things of that nature with no
problem but it does have a bit more bass
so if you want a less bass you can go
for the old versions but these new
versions definitely do have a bit more
they're pretty much like a cleaned up
version of the urbeats
the urbeats had a ton of biggest but
sounded a bit muddy in when come when
you're listening to vocals and things of
that nature but you won't find that here
which is definitely a thumbs up for me
and that pretty much wraps up my review
guys one thing I do want to note is that
I did encounter a short in my wire when
I first got these I actually had to send
it back to beets because my inline
remote went haywire and that was just
crazy so that might say something about
durability but a lot of people that I
know who have the new tours didn't
encounter that also mine could have just
been a defective one but I wanted to
make you guys are wherever nonetheless
but that's about it for this review guys
