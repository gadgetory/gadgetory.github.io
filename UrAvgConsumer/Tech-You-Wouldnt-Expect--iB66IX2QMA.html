consumer and as you can see I'm a long
way from New Jersey in my studio I'm
actually on a 17 thousand acre farm in
Missouri but they've got some surprising
tech here
now you guys know me I'm from New York
I'm a city guy and I think most people
would assume in a city where there's a
population of 90 that there's not a lot
of tech here and we're gonna try and
debunk that myth
since this farm here works with US
Cellular to bring a lot of cool tech
that you wouldn't expect here our first
stop was to check out some goats
this problem is 2,000 goats and it's
pretty cool that they're able to keep
track of all of them using wearables
that's right wearables for goats these
ankle bracelets are scanned with one
device so farmers can track information
about them like their age vaccinations
milk fat percentage and a ton more and
US Cellular's networks allow the farmers
to access this information from anywhere
using iPads and smartphones it's really
cool to see how the tech that we use on
an everyday basis is applied in a
different yet creative way over here and
next stop was the tractors now I'm not
gonna lie when I think of tractors I
think of these very archaic slow-moving
machines but these john deere ones were
on another level these tractors are
pretty much self-driving which is insane
and there's like this the command center
near the driver's seat and all farmers
need to do is choose the appropriate
setting from an ipad and boom the
tractor will drive itself and plant the
crops this tech has increased
productivity substantially with the
farmers planting over 4,000 acres in
under a week and you'll see throughout
the video that iPads are a pretty big
deal on this farm especially being able
to access the farm tech remotely using
US Cellular's Network the farm manager
can access the whole fleet of tractors
and other farm tech right from his iPad
from anywhere he can see which machines
need maintenance turn on and off water
pivots and a lot more and this is a big
deal because of efficiency
imagine having to drive through 17,000
acres
every time you needed to check some of
your equipment and I gotta be honest
guys I was a little nervous at first
because I had no cell service and
apparently very few of the typical
companies provide service out here
because the population of people is so
small but US Cellular has changed the
game over here and as you can see
they've contributed to moving the tech
and efficiency forward on this farm and
in this town and it's pretty fascinating
to me to see how advanced this farm was
and all the ways they track and manage
the different
that make up this business and I'm a
Goliath has definitely changed my idea
of how a farm looks in 2017 and all
right guys that pretty much wraps it up
and I don't know about you but I was
pretty surprised by some of the tech
that they have out here
so from self-driving tractors to iPads
that control an entire fleet of tractors
to even wearables on GoPros it's just
mind-blowing but it's all possible
thanks to US Cellular so huge shout out
to them for sponsoring today's video and
taking me out here to debunk this myth
and if you guys are interested in me
debunking any other tech mists
let me know with a comment down below
what techn if you would like to see me
debunk and if I choose your idea you
have a chance at winning a gift card or
a cool piece of tech so be sure to leave
your Instagram or Twitter handle so we
get in touch and work it out but
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if
you did be the cool guard girl that
gives it a thumbs up I'll catch you guys
in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
base can you believe this has a
population of 94</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
