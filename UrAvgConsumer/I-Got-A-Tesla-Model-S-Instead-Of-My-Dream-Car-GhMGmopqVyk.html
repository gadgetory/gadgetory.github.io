and this right here is my very first car
this is the Tesla Model S and I will
start off this video by saying I never
thought I would buy this car ever if
you've seen some of my videos in the
past you might have heard me say that
the BMW i8 is my absolute dream car and
it really was until I actually got
inside of one recently and that dream
fell apart and ironically this guy right
here which wasn't on my radar became the
car I fell in love with after I got
inside of it and I will say I think I
picked the absolute best possible name
for this car
it's called Kilwa that name just works
in so many ways I'll throw up a list
just so you guys can see it my anime
fans out there I know you'll get a kick
out of that but let me show you guys the
exterior and what we're working with
here so this right here is the midnight
silver metallic exterior color I think
it looks really really good and right
here I got a special option for the rims
these are the black arachnid rims and
they look amazing these are like
performance tire so it has a nice cold
room to go with it and in terms of the
interior before we even get to the
interior look how you get inside guys so
I've got my key on me all I do is touch
this handles pop out and boom you got
access to the inside and our interior
right here is actually the black and
white with the white seats I know crazy
and it also has the carbon fiber
interior it feels really luxurious and
premium inside of there the black and
white is just awesome and actually Tesla
has some really high-quality leather
that they use and it's very durable I
was actually watching my man John
renderers video on his Tesla Model X he
went with a white interior and he has
kids if it survived kids I'm pretty sure
I'm not gonna beat this thing up I even
keep some
keep some baby wipes in the back got
that CVS brand ultra soft baby wipe just
to keep the seats clean now something
that's actually pretty surprising with
this car is when you just look at it
especially from the back you wouldn't
expect it to have a lot of trunk space
but it surprisingly does so check this
out when I go in the back here there got
a lot of space like way more than I
really thought this would have here you
can store even more stuff and it doesn't
stop there this is an electric vehicle
that means there's no regular engine
inside of this guy and since it has no
engine that means you can actually go up
front and you got even more space now
with no engine no gasoline no anything
like that you're probably wondering how
does it go but like I said it's electric
and right here you have the charger you
can actually install a charger in your
home or you can go to one of the plenty
super chargers that are all around the
country and for me there's some growing
pains with this whole electric system
it's not all butterflies and rainbows I
don't have the charger at my house just
yet so what I've been doing since I got
this thing is pretty much just heading
over to the superchargers to get a full
charge once I get that thing installed
into my house I won't ever have to worry
about gas stations through the chargers
unless I'm doing like some crazy road
trip but yes that is all of the exterior
stuff let's talk about the insides and
kind of what makes this thing so special
so guys we are inside of the car and I
gotta say it feels really cool to be
inside of here not only do you have like
giant displays on your right you got a
digital display up here as well but it's
just it's really comfortable and like I
said I went with the black and white and
it just feels so so nice to be inside of
here
I had to sit in the back yet so I don't
know what passengers really feel like
but the few that have been in here told
me that this feels pretty solid but one
thing that the passengers do get to
enjoy is this panoramic sunroof oh you
guys can see there's a sunroof right
here it's all glass and
little button right here you see this
this is for the glove compartment you
just press it and then you see that
thing come down and I will say the glove
compartment yeah I mean for driving SUVs
and that's pretty small but let's talk
about the performance guys this is the P
100 D so it is an extremely fast car the
acceleration is bonkers so this car can
go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 2.3
seconds which is absolutely insane you
guys can actually see right here on this
big tablet looking display you can
actually go into driving and in
ludicrous mode you have access to zero
to 60 and 2.3 seconds and honestly this
is one of the things that really steered
me away from the IE
I like to have a lot of tech inside of
my stuff Tesla is all about tech and the
i8 just it felt so dated it didn't feel
like a very high tech car and it being
an electric vehicle you kind of expect
that you know the I just couldn't wasn't
doing it for me and this one was it has
all kinds of stuff that I'm not even
gonna go into into this video but it has
a lot of lot of smart features biggest
smart feature being the auto pilot so
that means it will accelerate for you
you can set the speed that you want it
to go in and you can also do slight
turns it is actually a legitimate
experience guys the thing really does
Drive for you but that's only on
highways like you're not gonna take this
thing into the city and expect it to
drive for you it doesn't do that it's
pretty much like cruise control on
steroids but I will say I do not 100%
trust the system it's a moving vehicle
going really quickly but like I said
earlier what really sold me was the
driving experience I'm not a huge car
guy
I like tech more than I like cars a car
that a lot of tech this really got me
and I don't really care for hearing that
engine rev up and do all the crazy
things that real car enthusiasts enjoy
but this one doesn't have any of that no
fake car sounds thing is quiet alright
this is a stealthy car
not to mention this thing is a smooth
ride even when I was accelerating
testing out the 0 to 60 I had a lot of
control over the car and that just wowed
me I'm
right now I'm good I'm in love with
this thing right now but that's all I
really wanted to do in this video kind
of go through all the things that kind
of made my decision on why I wanted to
purchase this car but let me know what
you guys think hopefully you enjoyed
this video again we got a welcome
kilowatt into the family and I'll catch
you guys in the next one
so Dennis your average consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
