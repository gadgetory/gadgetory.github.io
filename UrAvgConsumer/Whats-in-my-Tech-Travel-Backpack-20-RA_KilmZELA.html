and today I've got another what's in my
tech travel backpack 2.0 and this time
I'm featuring the ojio bandit 17 now you
guys saw in my what's in my gadget
backpack 3.0 that I used the Ocho
renegade 17 and that was an amazing
backpack it's still my favorite gadget
backpack to this day but the Bandit 17
is awesome
because it has like a ton of
compartments like the renegade and I
think even more and it has a smaller
more compact body which makes it perfect
for traveling but to be honest I think
this guy would give the renegade a run
for its money because it comes in at a
lower price point and it has just as
many compartments and a slimmer profile
so it can actually do both get you a bag
that can do those and this is why I
chose it
so less gets right to it let's see
what's inside so we're going to start
off with the bottom here and down here
we have the rx100 mark 4 now you guys
have heard me talk about this all the
time this is an amazing point issue
camera it can shoot video in 4k for
about five minutes but I use this for my
vlogs I shoot everything in 1080p now
just so I don't have to deal with the
stupid 5 minute limit that this has it's
been working out really well the footage
is excellent and it takes great pictures
so nice compact cost a pretty penny
though but that's what I've got down
here and one thing I really like about
the ojio backpacks is that you guys can
see right here a little stitching with a
picture of a camera and it gives you
little suggestions and labels of what
you can put in all of these compartments
so I think that's really awesome so if
you want to fill out your backpack with
a ton of different tech there's got a
ton of different tech options and labels
so that you know what you can put inside
of here so that one was a camera so
that's what I've got down there now
moving on to the next compartment right
above it I've got let's see I've got a
couple things I got some pens here a
pencil typical stuff and at the bottom
I've got this guy this is a case for the
Nintendo 3ds XL and if you actually see
here this is an improved case from what
I've been rocking before because it can
hold it through the SXL and it can hold
up to 24 different game
and some accessories it has another
pouch up top so it's a bit on the bigger
side but it's well worth it if you have
a lot of stuff for your 3d s so I had to
do it I loved playing my 3d s so a solid
case is a must
so I've links to this if you guys can
have a 3dsxl that you want to get a case
for I have links to this down below in
the description as well as everything
else I mentioned in this video down
below now a lot of you guys know I love
my PlayStation Vita but I haven't been
carrying it around with me and that's
simply because I didn't have mini game
options to play now the Vita has
recently come out with a couple of RPGs
that I really got into liking to so I've
been carrying it around with me that's
what I've got up here so I can carry
both no problem travel pouch Vita boom
carry both now now this little area can
hold a lot more you got a spot for your
keys you can put whatever you want in
this little pouch here but what I've got
in here is actually my samsung t1 SSD
this tiny flat little SSD holds a 1
terabyte so I use this to put all my
footage when I'm editing so I can edit
on my macbook or my iMac I can switch
back and forth between these two and not
have any issues so that's awesome that's
what I carry here and this thing can
hold like I said hold a lot more that's
what I've got down here now you've also
got four compartments on the sides two
at the bottom two up top now on the
bottom I have let's see I usually stick
chargers and whatnot in here so that's
what I've got here my macbook charger
spoiler alert and that's about it I
don't think I've got anything in this
side because this is a travel backpack
I'm not going to fill it up to the brim
but one thing that you guys usually ask
me a lot is are these slots made to
carry water bottles and stuff like that
this is actually going to carry a water
bottle so you can do that I never carry
water with me so I don't use it for that
now this guy on the side has the iPhone
se because I've been using it to do my
review so I've got this here I got a
video on this coming up soon so the
iPhone se
Department over here now on this other
side I've got a battery case for the
galaxy s7 I actually have the s7 right
here in this top compartment this
compartment is actually able to hold
some glasses sunglasses whatever you
want
I don't rock some glasses or regular
glasses so I hold my phone there so I
put that there and yeah this galaxy s7
battery case is pretty cool it actually
charges it wirelessly so I can just
throw it in hit the button and it'll
start charging it so that's a really
cool option for some of you who want
extended battery life only thing is it's
super bulky so if that's gonna be an
issue if you don't like a really thick
phone you might not want this but it
doesn't trick
2700 milliamps and if you're looking at
my galaxy s7 like what the heck is you
got on there well I've got some slick
wraps so I teamed up with slick wraps to
test out a couple of the different skins
that they've been coming out with with
the galaxy s7 so I've got this one on
here right now and looks pretty dope if
you guys are interested I'll of course
have links down below in the description
for you to check that out but yeah these
are the 200 rocking this has been my
daily driver I've been using it for
about a month so you guys can expect the
video about what it's like to own one of
these and that should be up like pretty
soon so that's what I've got there and
let's see that's it for the side
compartments right now do the top and
let's see what we got here man
throwback pad this thing's got a lot so
first things first let's get this out
the way this is my tech survival kit now
if you guys have not seen my video about
the tech survival kit I'll have a link
down below in the description and you
can probably press that little button on
the right side and you can go and watch
that I must have if you call yourself a
techie I made this and I think it is
awesome a lot of you guys have made it
to after the video and I've got tons of
pictures on Twitter about it so
definitely check that video out if you
haven't made one of these yet super
worth it I'm not gonna tell you what's
inside go off the video
okay so let's see what else we've got on
this flap we've got a couple of slots
and over here I have a notebook this is
of course Zelda theme I'm a geek you
guys know that I love my games love my
anime but I got the Zelda book so it's
my little notebook whenever I want to
jot down notes looks good looks clean
got it from Gamestop it was super
expensive it's like 18 bucks so that's
an investment for a notebook but Zelda
theme and it looks amazing so I had to
pick it up now over here you've got a
slot for your mouse I'm rocking the
Logitech g600 Mouse now you guys know
this is my favorite Mouse for editing I
love using it and I've got a Mac Pro on
me so of course that's my like editing
machine and this thing works wonders all
the macros on the side you can use all
these buttons that you see here you can
program them to do certain things so I
have mine all men thought for editing
stuff and it is a dream I love using
this guy it's amazing now when I turn
this around you guys can see they did
not skimp out on the labels at all so
they've got that here they even got a
little spot for headphones which is
actually pretty interesting it can work
as two different slots altogether or you
can use them to house your headphones
like this so you just pull them out and
these right here are the sony xba-40 bt
that you guys know i love but i'm trying
out the little brother seeing how that
works it's usually a toss of what I
carry nowadays between this since I'm
testing and also be here on wireless
headphones those I've been rocking for a
while so I don't have them here I know
what they sound like but I'm gonna have
a video about that soon if you love bass
and you don't want giant headphones like
a 950 BT these are the like
seriously legit but um I'm gonna have a
full review on this one as well
bass lovers Sony is not disappointing us
at all now again I gotta say it's
awesome that this thing has a spot for
headphones in case you don't have a
travel case like this guy this guy
doesn't come with a case so throwing it
in here kind of protects the ear cups
very nice and let's see what we've got
here over here we've got gritted now
this is a recommendation that you guys
made in my last gadget backpack video
and you guys said you saw me with my
stick block bag trick with all my cables
and stuff like that and then I said I'll
get a grid it I was like oh that makes
sense I'll do it so I got a grid it and
this thing is awesome because you can
throw whatever you want on this grid and
as you guys can see here I've got a
couple of different things now this
right here is a file headphone amp now
this is legit guys I love using this
because you might not have the best
sounding headphones but with this you're
boosting those headphones the sound
quality of those you can up the bass you
can up the volume it's a really really
nice touch if you don't want to go
invest in a new pair of headphones or
maybe you have multiple headphones and
you want them all to sound better this
right here this is a good look and I've
got some cables of course some earbuds
just in case I don't want to use the 950
of the 650 BTS I've got some earbuds
right here from RHA vi the s 500 I I
recently had them in my top five
favorite earbuds so I've got to have
them here they're great sounding earbuds
not a lot of bass but sometimes I'm okay
with that I've got my Apple watch
because I do carry around an iPhone 6s
plus in case I want to swap out this
moto 360 and I got a surface pen and
some chapstick we might be techies but
we can't be walking around with no
chapped lips so got that on here as well
uh and yeah this is the grid it it is
amazing you can customize this as much
as you want has lots of tabs so you guys
can swap in whatever you want I
definitely work too and it's cheap it's
like less than 20 bucks now I've also
got this guy right here this is my
organizer that
calendar if you guys need to get some
organization in your life worth it
definitely definitely worth it this
thing sets you up in so many ways so I
suggest looking into that if you want to
get organized and my little Bluetooth
speaker this is the Amazon tap now with
this guy you can use this as a Bluetooth
speaker and it has a built-in Amazon
echo into it all you got to do is hit
the little microphone button and you've
got access I'm having trouble connecting
to the internet for help
go to your Alexa app anywho you got you
use this with a hotspot and you have
access to Alexa wherever you are which
is pretty cool my favorite thing about
Alexa is a home automation but it's
still pretty cool to ask it questions or
mask it to play certain songs whenever
you want so pretty cool stuff I've been
testing this out and I'm liking it so
far you guys know how to feel about the
echo and it's nice to have it on the go
so that's what I've got right here and
right here I've got in this little
tablet pouch I've got the pixel C and
I've got it's a keyboard attachment it's
got some great hardware it's the latest
Android tablet but what really sold me
is the fact that there's a new yugioh
game that you can play on here and
playing on a tablet is much better than
playing on your phone
geek life will suck so that is why I
carry the pixel C so awesome tablet but
I'm not gonna lie that's the primary use
for it right now and I've also got this
action monopod that I used with rx100 to
do my vlogging it's easy to vlog like
that and since is the lightweight camera
I can do it pretty easily get some wider
shots it's a glorified selfie stick but
I'm okay with that
so I've got this here as well but that's
about it for this pouch here and I guess
the last one is this guy and that is the
MacBook Pro 15 inch and as you can see
I've got this bamboo skin on it from
slick wraps and I got this huge dent on
my macbook and it was terrible it was
ugly
slick rocks hooked me up they covered it
up and now
legit and if this looks awesome too by
the way just using this it looks great
lights up you can see right through the
cutout it looks great so that's what
I've been rocking and that is what's in
my tech travel backpack pretty much this
is it
shoutout through this bag uh-oh Gio's
definitely not a sponsor but this thing
is legit it's only 70 bucks which is a
lot less than the renegade 17 that has
more compartments slimmer profile this
is this is my favorite backpack right
now so I highly suggest picking this up
and it's adorable so good stuff love it
and this is everything guys hopefully
you enjoyed it if you did be the cool
guy or girl that gives this video a
thumbs up subscribe to the channel for
more content from me and I'll catch you
guys in the next one till then it's your
