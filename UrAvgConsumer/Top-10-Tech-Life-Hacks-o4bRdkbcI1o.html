consumer now there are all kinds of life
hacks out there but here are 10 tech
life hacks I think you need to know so
let's get this lets started with an
oldie but goodie if you're like me and
it's hard for you to wake up in the
morning then you'll like this here's an
even better reason to use the familiar
phone in the cup speaker trick keep a
cup at your bedside and throw your phone
in it at night and this will amplify the
phone alarm and hopefully force you out
of bed in the morning and if you want to
go nuts
you could even spice it up a bit with
two cups are you addicted to emojis but
think you're limited to using them on
your phone actually if you have an Apple
computer simply press ctrl command and
spacebar and the emoji keyboard will pop
right up
now you can include all of your favorite
emojis whenever you post something
online instead of having to resort to
the old-school keyboard emoticons and
sorry PC users I don't know if any cool
keyboard shortcuts that you could use
but I'll have some options that you can
use down below and this next hack you
already know if you're a fan of my
gadget backpack series or my room tours
I use ziplock bags to organize all of my
various cables that I store and while
it's not the most attractive it does the
trick it keeps my cords from getting
tangled and it's super easy to grab the
cord that I need since the bag is
transparent this is clutch when I'm
searching through my drawers for a
particular cable a bottle to squeeze out
the last bit of juice on your phone
battery well if your phone is on its
last leg you can speed up the charging
process by throwing it in airplane mode
now this means won't be able to use your
phone wallet charges but it's a nice way
to get a boost in juice when you're in a
hitch this works especially well if you
don't plan on using your phone while
it's charging now this one might sound
like a no-brainer but it's interesting
how little we take advantage of airplane
mode tired of guessing which earbud goes
in which ear we all know that looking
for that tiny little L&amp;amp;R can definitely
be a pain but fear not here's a cool
little way to jazz up your earbuds while
knowing on site which should go where
and all you've got to do is change up
one of the colors of the ear tips and
you're good to go
and again for my Mac users who've ever
had to take a screenshot of something
you know the struggle of taking a
screenshot and then having to go
back and deleted off your desktop well
here's a quick shortcut that will
eliminate that last step
simply press command control shift 4 and
select exactly what you want to be
screenshotted the image will be copied
without leaving a trace on your desktop
and you can simply paste it to wherever
you want and boom you're done and
because I love shortcuts here's another
one especially if you're a YouTube
addict press J on your keyboard to
rewind the video easily and L to quickly
fast forward tap either key for short
jumps or hold them down for longer
scrubs through the video k is your pause
button and what's especially cool about
these keys is that you can be anywhere
on the screen and these shortcuts will
work you might be wondering why use
these over the spacebar or the arrow
keys but like I said they'll work no
matter where you are on the page because
we all know sometimes hitting that
spacebar just doesn't work if you're on
a desktop click anywhere on this page
and try it out now this tech life hack
is especially useful if you're one of
those people who often runs out of cache
or miss places your wallet
simply take a $20 bill and store it in
your phone case for emergencies phone
cases can do this without adding any
extra bulk or changing the fit of your
phone and if you're not ballin throw one
in there cuz something is better than
nothing and trust me you'll be happy you
have it there when you need it if you've
ever bought a plane ticket online then
you probably notice the price is always
changing and it's usually in the wrong
direction airline websites usually track
cookies that will often alter your
search results and show a higher price
for your search than what they might
have been for someone who hasn't been
searching for that particular trip as
much as you have and they do this to
make you buy sooner rather than later
but you can get around this by using
private browsing or using incognito mode
this go if you save a couple of bucks on
your upcoming spring break trip and for
one of my Instagram or Twitter followers
then you've heard about my recent
tragedy
this is the current state of my MacBook
after my beloved fs7 fell on it if
you're accident prone or have people
around you who are clumsy then you know
my pain re luckily there's a much
cheaper solution than having to get it
repaired slick wrap saw this catastrophe
and hit me up with some options while it
doesn't fix the ding it'll cover it up
perfectly so out of sight out of
it also adds a little flair to your
device broken or not and as you can see
I'm rocking the brand-new bamboo design
that they just came out with and if you

own dents I'll have links down below in

whenever I go home and I found that 90%
of the problems can be solved by one

Squad trust me it usually works if you
