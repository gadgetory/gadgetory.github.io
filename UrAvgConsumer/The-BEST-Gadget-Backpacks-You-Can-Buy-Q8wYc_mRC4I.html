consumer and you've asked for it so here
it is these are my recommendations for
some of the best gadget backpacks now
we're going to break this down into a
few categories and we're gonna first
start off with the heavy hitters these
are the gadget backpacks that you want
to fill to the brim like I always do and
bring all your tech with you but then
we're going to move on to the travel
friendly backpack which is going to be
good for a day trip maybe you want to
bring some tech along with you but you
don't want a big heavy backpack weighing
you down this is going to be the
backpack for you and then we're gonna
take a look at an all arounder which has
a couple of compartments for tech as
well as a large enough space to carry
anything else you might want to bring
with you so we're gonna start off with
the heavy hitters this is my category I
love to bring around a ton of tech and
you guys know that and we're going to
start it off with this oldie but goodie
and this is the og o band of 17 now this
I love because it has a ton of
compartments and I mean a ton and what's
great about them is that they're labeled
so you know exactly where to put all
your tech so if you need to find a spot
for your portable charger you go and
look for the label that has it so this
is one of my favorites because it just
has some awesome durability great size
tons and tons of compartments and it's
just a tech oriented backpack that looks
good and it's super functional and this
one retails for about 70 bucks the price
varies but you usually find it in a 17
dollar range now if you hear 70 and
think that's way too much money we've
got this amazonbasics backpack over here
now this guy retails for about 30 bucks
I think $29.99 now the difference here
is that you I think you're trading off
some looks you're not this is not as
stylish as the band is seventeen over
here but it definitely gets the job done
as well now this has a ton of
compartments so you can fit a lot of
stuff and it's pretty flexible this is a
pretty large bag so if you want to stuff
a lot in here that's not gonna be a
problem
now something I really like about the
Amazon backpack while it has a ton of
tiny compartments for things like
flashdrives pens and all kinds of the
little gadgets
it also has very
large compartments as well so you've got
one over here
another right here and even another
right over here
so if compartments are what you're
looking for and a budget price the
Amazon basics back packet is definitely
something you want to look into this
thing will carry all the tech you need
for sure now if you're looking for
something a bit more stylish than these
two and you got a little bit of money to
spare you're definitely going to want to
take a look at the incase icon backpack
this is the most recent version of my
gadget backpack and it's currently my
favorite favorite one and you can
actually get them in multiple colors so
you don't have to go with this blue or
typical black you can get like silver
Reds all kinds of different colors which
makes it very nice and a cool little
thing about it is that it can stand on
its own with no problem but even better
is that this thing has so many storage
compartments I think it even has more
than these two so look here you've got
compartments compartments compartment
compartments apartments compartments and
even compartments on the sides so you're
not running out of space with this at
all now if you're wondering about the
price of the inkay's backpack I think it
typically retails for 200 but I've seen
them as low as a hundred bucks at stores
like B and H so I'll have links down
below in the description to the best
prices that I can find where you guys
can pick this up if you're interested
bonus for this guy
huge choose slots for the water bottles
something a lot of you are interested in
I know that and now we're going to take
a look at our everyday backpacks and
these are both from tiger new so we've
got some standard stuff over here in the
front and up top here we've got a few
pockets to put in all kinds of stuff we
need and what I really like about this
one
got a nice soft material feels like a
cloth like material and jumping into the
sack you can see that you've got spots
for portable chargers phones books
tablets now obviously all the backpacks
mentioned in this video our laptop
backpacks and I think they can all fit
15 inches or less so if you want to
check out the backpack compartment here
you flip open the arms and you have
access over here which is pretty cool if
you don't feel comfortable having their
zipper exposed maybe you're afraid of
someone stealing it this is a nice way
to make sure that there's going to be no
theft when this thing is on your back
now its counterpart over here is
actually waterproof now first difference
you'll notice is that it has a huge
compartment going down right here
compared to the little compartment that
this guy has right here now when you go
up one you can pretty much see that it's
starting to be the similar layout to
what's over here and the same goes on
for the rest and there is more padding
here so if you're worried about your
laptop hitting the floor when you put
your book back down or something this
should give you a little bit more
protection and more comfort overall but
either way these are both very
lightweight solid backpacks that don't
take up a lot of space aren't too huge
and can still carry a good amount of
tech without looking overdone travel
backpacks for just someone on the go
making day trips who wants to bring
around their stuff so this one right
here is our all-arounder now in terms of
the name I'm not sure it is branded sin
paid all over it but on Amazon is called
cooler PEC or something like that either
way this is the backpack and I'm calling
it the all-arounder because look at it
this thing is kind of big now what's
great about this is that it has some
spots for your tech so if we take a look
at the very front
you can see that you can put your
standard stuff over here no big deal and
you go in one more you've even got a
spot for your tablet now for the next
compartment you've got this huge huge
space now why I think this is really
cool is that you can bring along your
laptop right in here pop this open throw
in your laptop but maybe you're taking
this to school maybe you're gonna go
hang out at a friend's place later you
can bring along gear tech gear clothing
all kinds of stuff I don't think they're
limited to anything with the way this
thing is shaped it's also waterproof so
if you aren't traveling to someone spot
you don't want to get your clothes wet
you don't want to get your gear wet this
is going to protect it this gives you a
ton of flexibility while still giving
some attention to those tech items that
you might want to bring with you I can
definitely see this for like a student
athlete or someone who likes to go to
the gym you can bring around shoes water
bottles because look at the size of that
I just think this is a great all-around
backpack for those of you who like to
bring around some tech but also want to
bring around other things you don't want
to be like me who only carries tech in
this backpack and nothing else hopefully
you guys enjoyed it I'm going to have
links to all the backpacks mentioned
down below in the description and if you
want to see some of these in action
these were some of my gadget backpacks
so I'll have videos to those so you can
see how I packed it up myself but till
the next one guys travellish consumer
