consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day in the life with the
Google pixel 3xl now for those of you
who have never seen one of my real day
into live videos you're pretty much
gonna be spending a day with me as well
as the pixel 3xl and we're gonna be
testing things like the performance the
battery life camera and all of the cool
smart features that it has so here's how
it did okay guys so we're officially
starting our day is about 11 a.m. and
we're shooting right now with the
front-facing camera of the pixel so this
is the video quality that you can expect
as well as the audio quality but one
thing I will say this does look a bit
crop there's a perfect time to take
advantage of that second lens that's on
the front-facing camera see if we can
get a wider shot alright and here we
have a wider shot now this is so much
better I wish there was more
functionality out of the lens but this
is so good like if I wanted to go ahead
and vlog like this this makes it so much
so much easier yeah this is a way to
shoot with the front-facing camera but
guys we do have a lot to do today I got
should a video got a couple places to go
so you guys will see all of that and how
the pixel kind of survives during the
day alright guys so first stop we're
gonna make is actually to our old
apartment we have to pick up the razor
phone too unfortunately it got sent to
the wrong address but before we had any
where I gotta talk about the body of the
pixel 3 and pixel 3 XL it honestly guys
just feels like the best pixel that's
come out yet the feel in the hand is
really nice it just feels like a quality
quality phone so this is clearly white
but it actually has the mint button it's
as close to teal as Google is gonna get
so I'm okay with that now the body is
great feels good in the hand the only
thing is that not sucks obviously
everyone knows it is a really deep
knotch and after using it for a couple
days it really takes some getting used
to but we'll talk about the knotch
later one thing I'm noticing while I'm
outside right now though is that you
really need the phone on max brightness
to be able to see anything and let's see
this together if a bright of wallpaper
makes a difference and this isn't bad
it's not bad let's turn the brightness
down to let's say 75 let's see
that's hard to see in the that's hard to
see in direct sunlight I mean you can
use it no problem but you might squint a
little bit and it's a little unfortunate
alright guys so right now we are driving
over to get the phone we've been driving
for about three minutes we got seven 14
minutes left on this Drive it's at 88
percent which is a little surprising I
definitely expected to have more battery
left but you know we'll see what the
stats are once we get out the car also
streaming some music and you know just
got a little drive to do we'll give you
an update so we're looking at about 83
percent battery left so - like a 5
percent hit on that's what 17 minute
ride let's go get this other phone
though alright here we have it now it is
time to get some more stuff for you but
yes so we got back from ups we're headed
into a studio but check this out guys
tons and tons of boxes gotta bring it
all on the side now so you guys got to
see a couple of video samples but the
big deal on the pixel is of course the
camera and we got to get some picture
samples I really want to try out the
portrait mode because that's like my
personal favorite feature of the camera
so I'll just top this little flower
right here this now this is a big test
because this thing is thin and it has a
lot of edges so we'll see how that edge
detection does it's so good
so check this out guys when you zoom in
it looks completely bird in the
background but the little plant itself
everything is in focus that's amazing
guys you are able to still change around
the things that are in focus so you guys
can see as I'm tapping around different
things in the photo you come in focus
and it's doing a pretty good job at
keeping the things that I want in focus
but not that B that B didn't stand a
chance
okay so we've been messing around with
portrait mode a lot but let's just take
one normal photo with just a straight up
camera BAM so this is actually pretty
nice because in the shadowy areas we're
not losing a ton of information we can
still see the leaves on the inside it's
just not super dark that's actually
really good and all of the white petals
you can see them very clearly so the
dynamic
change on the pixel you get really
really great dynamic range even the
areas with the direct sunlight like over
here not washed out completely you still
get a lot of information and in terms of
sharpness if i zoom in quite a bit still
a ton of detail but something I do want
to test this top shot all right so I've
got my buddy here Malcolm and basically
what top shot is it's going to identify
the best picture after taking a few
shots and if Malcolm blinks or something
it'll know and pick a shot like right
before he blinked so we're gonna see if
that works
even with his little glasses on or
whatever it's I got you and focused so I
want you to blink in three two one and
let's see if Top Shot actually works
here oh you and you held your blink for
a little while - it works with blur -
three two one go yeah that is cool cuz I
definitely took it after you move one
more time one more time just for the
sake of science here one pixels pixels
too fast for you dad Wow
so top shot is legitimate okay guys
sorry I just wrapped up a voiceover so
that's going to be for another video but
I just want to give you guys a quick
battery update it is 4:18 yes I'm still
wearing my Apple watch because I don't
want to go watch lists but it has about
60% battery left at 4:18 and we've been
using it for an hour and 50 minutes so
40% for about two hours of usage okay
not the best when you actually jump into
the settings the top of the battery
settings will let you know just how long
you'll be able to use it for it so it
says the battery should last till 10:30
a.m.
based on my usage I don't know what what
they're using to factor that all in but
10:30 a.m. sounds crazy only got an hour
50 so far so we'll see alright guys so
we are back on the road again
we got a 17 minute drive ahead of us
we've been driving for about 7 minutes
now so we'll see how the battery's
impacted we're currently at about 58%
but one thing that I am noticing guys if
you're someone who doesn't like to have
your phone at 100% brightness
you might struggle a little bit when
you're outside cuz even right now I'm
looking at this thing and it's a little
Dart
I can make out what it's saying but I
think I need it at like above 85% in
order to see it clearly so we made it to
Best Buy where I headed in got some
stuff I want to get from for my switch
so let's see if we can find something
and maybe check out that google lens
okay so I've never seen this before it's
an adjustable charging stand for the
switch this thing is like really small
so you know the switch has a terrible
USBC position so having something like
this could be really nice that's only 20
bucks but it doesn't hurt to see if I
can find online for a little bit cheaper
so we'll try it and see if we can
identify it dang in no time it found it
so they give you which website actually
has a picture of it up so fries has it
for 20 bucks as well and try and use the
price matching isn't really working now
but google lens is doing its job and
showing all kinds of websites and
finding the products pretty quickly so
that's that's really nice and one thing
that's always impressive with Best Buy
is of course their lights so they got a
ton of good lighting in here but there's
a perfect chance to try out the selfie
camera not for video but a straight up
selfie so we're gonna try it and it
maybe post it to Instagram so let's see
what we can come up with in here so we
got a quick shot and I'm not gonna lie I
think this is pretty good guys got some
pretty good detail here this is good and
I still think it is so crazy how well
you can mess with that depth effect so
this is with nothing that's what
everything such a massive difference
alright so now I got a posting to
Instagram of course
my guys the typing experience is pretty
good here I can actually type with one
hand with no problem I can use this
one-handed and with no real issue and
this is a bigger phone
I think the feel is nice and grippy so
it's not gonna slide out my hand I have
no problem moving this thing around and
this is a bigger display so it's
actually kind of surprising for me hi
guys so right now we're in target just
picking up a couple of things some light
bulbs I think you gotta get some stuff
for cookie right now I'm just checking
out
battery and it just we're at 36 percent
which is still a little bit lower than I
expected
we'd have about three hours of screen on
time though something interesting is
that area where it told us that we would
have it until 10:30 a.m. now says the
phone is being used more than normal and
the battery may run out soon I think
this thing has a 3400 milliamp hour
battery I don't know this is so good
alright guys so right now Ares actually
calling me perfect time to try out the
screen call feature so let's check this
out I'll just hit this so right now
Google assistant is telling her that I'm
using the screen calling feature so this
is I'm calling because I need to know
which music file we want to use for the
video so I can finish up to get it so
tell me more so she can we can see
everything that she says as she's
talking to it I don't know which one you
want to use thing this is pretty clear
let's ask her if it's urgent if she's
probably gonna get so pissed
hey how'd you like the screen calling
okay yeah she didn't find it as funny as
I did but that is awesome so for
telemarketers all that kind of stuff
that's really really cool that is easily
one of the best features on this phone
being able to see what someone wants
before you actually pick up the phone
it's clutch alright guys so right now we
are headed to our favorite spot bot and
ramen I got my lovely assistant Anna
over here these they're sisters they
just be giggling always behind the
camera so they'd like in giggle mode so
we're gonna compare it to the iPhone 10s
Macs
both are pretty good when it comes to
the light in the back the pixels a bit
more blown out in comparison to the
iPhone so I don't know alright but
enough camera test let's get some food I
know these girls are waiting okay guys
so right now we're in rotten Ramallah in
the restaurant perfect time to try out
the flip to shush feature if I just go
like this it should be in silent mode
now sorry you want to call me and give
it a shot it's the ring
me because you're my favorites list
can you call from private yeah yeah go
for it are you calling okay so then you
try to use flip to shush depending on
your settings your starred contact
favorite contacts they'll still be able
to come through I guess they're
important so you don't want to miss
their call but for regular people do not
disturb will make sure that you don't
get any calls well you don't want to be
disturbed now you guys know I gotta take
a picture of this food and damn let me
take a picture of honest too that looks
really good right alright guys so now we
are getting some bubble tea after our
ramen you know how we do but we've
gotten 11 percent battery left at 9:50
p.m. so this thing is on its last leg
and in terms of screen on time over here
we have 4 hours and 9 minutes I
definitely expected more since pixels
usually have really really good battery
life but this one is just ok now
something you guys might have noticed is
that I don't have the notch being
displayed right now if you make yourself
a developer you can actually jump into
the settings and do not display cut out
and then you can hide the notch if you
want this is what it looks like without
it this is what it looks like with it
there so I think I actually like having
it gone quite a bit more it just feels a
lot better looking to me and that pretty
much wraps up our day now before the
phone died on me I got to check it and I
had about four and a half hours of
screen on time battery life has been
pretty ok it's nothing amazing it's
pretty standard battery life it honestly
didn't improve much compared to last
year's version for my usage I would have
been a bit happier if it had a bigger
battery and it got us to that 5 hour to
6 hour mark that would have been ideal
especially since a lot of smart phones
these days are really getting us past
that 5 hour mark these real
day-in-the-life videos we've been seeing
phones blow past that 4 hour mark and
this one only did it minimally even
though it has three thousand four
hundred and thirty milliamp hours I was
hoping for a little bit better battery
life but thankfully this thing has some
really fast charging which kind of makes
it
basic battery life now Google's claimed
to get from zero to 50% in 30 minutes is
completely legit and honestly before the
real day in the life video I forgot to
charge my phone so I was able to
actually throw it onto the charger and
get it charged up right before the
normal times that we usually start these
videos and speaking of charging one
thing we weren't able to cover during
the real day into life was the fact that
it now has wireless charging so
thankfully the pixel now has wireless
charging thanks to that glass back which
we will touch on in just a second and
that new dock that they called the pixel
stand things actually pretty cool and
Google actually added a few smart
features so that the pixel is functional
even when it's docked in I'm talking
photo frames Google assistant to even
alarms that brighten the screen as you
wake up there's a lot of cool things
about the pixel stand but let's get back
to the pixel the pixel feels very
comfortable to hold in the hand honestly
is one of the best feeling phones that
I've used in a while but the glass bag
does seem to be a bit scratched prone on
that and that side and it was something
I was a bit concerned about when I went
to the pixel launch event I saw a couple
of phones there that had a few scratches
and based on a couple of other reviews
that I've seen today it does seem like
some other people did have that issue so
you're definitely gonna want to use a
case to protect it overall this is a
comfortable premium feeling device and I
feel like Google made a lot of right
choices here except with the knotch
for those of you wondering why the notch
is so big it does seem that google has
packed a bigger camera lens inside of
here
so that might also mean a bigger sensor
and a bigger lens meaning better
pictures better low-light performance so
you'll get a better overall camera out
of this so that's the trade-off with the
notch you get some really good selfies
but you do get that cut out in your
screen but either way it's one of those
things that you just got to get used to
if you really like the overall package
which I personally do and you got to
remember what this overall package
includes from great performance as it is
running the latest and most optimized
version of Android an amazing camera
that absolutely kills every aspect of
smartphone photography Google's machine
learning is just absolutely nuts and
produces some amazing stuff this camera
has easily won a spot in my pocket for
taking pictures because you get great
dynamic range sharpness colors this
phone is honestly the king of taking
pictures and it's pretty much ruined
every other smartphones camera for me
but let's be real guys
this phone worth the money I absolutely
think it is yes some people will call it
ugly yes that notch is ugly but is this
something you can look past I definitely
think it is and Google allows you to go
ahead and jump into the settings and get
rid of the knotch
it makes the overall screen smaller but
there is an option but aside from the
notch it is a very good phones used it
is extremely fast that's great for
performance even though it doesn't have
the best specs out there kind of reminds
me of the iPhone how the iPhone is
optimized to run its software with lower
specs you're pretty much getting the
same with the pixel the while
performance is great for navigating
through the phone and of course playing
games was also really nice is the
ability to watch content the screen
looks really good of course they've got
those improved speakers which are 40%
louder so you get stereo speakers here
front-facing and they do have a bit more
clarity so it is definitely enjoyable to
watch some content on here if photos are
a big deal for you this is a no-brainer
if you love the latest version of
Android again no-brainer this is just an
overall really really good phone it gets
my recommendation but I will tell you
guys make sure that you get a case and
make sure that you're okay with that not
unless you want to go for that pixel 3
which doesn't have a notch at all but
that about wraps it up for this video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it the pixel
3 XL is going to be in my pocket for
quite some time that camera I I can't
let it go y'all it's that good but till
the next video guys to drive which
consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
