consumer and as many of you may know
Apple has wrapped up their WWDC 2014
event and at that event they announced a
couple of new features for iOS 8 as well
as Mac OS 10 and some developer features
as well but in this video we're going to
be talking about the top 5 features of
the newly announced iOS 8 so let's not
wasting time let's get right into it
Bobby Bobby I bagged up and all right
guys to kick-start this list at number
five we have checking your app battery
usage now this isn't a feature that was
really spoken about during the keynote
but it's a really awesome feature that
impacts our day-to-day lives because
battery life is something that we all
have to deal with so now you're able to
go into your settings and actually see
how much of your battery is being
drained from certain apps now this is a
great feature because if there's a
certain app that was using a lot more
battery than you expected you can go
ahead and delete it or maybe manage how
much you're using it and definitely save
yourself some battery now this is an
awesome feature that's been available
for Android for quite some time now but
it's definitely great to see it come to
iOS 8 and I think it's really going to
be helpful to a ton of people in their
day-to-day uses so that's why we have
that battery usage at number five and
four number four on this list is being
able to call out to Siri by simply
saying hey Siri so no longer do you have
to double tap the home button to call
out Cirie now all you have to do is say
hey Siri and if you will pop up and you
can automatically start asking a
question or saying some kind of command
now this is a really cool feature
because now you don't have to touch your
phone in order to call out to Siri you
don't have to double tap or anything but
well you look at that I said hey Siri
and it called out to Siri but yeah so
now you can actually do that instead of
pressing the home screen so that's
really convenient so this is really cool
and it's very similar to something that
Android has been doing for quite some
time with Google now you can actually
just say ok Google and start asking
Google now your question and it'll
answer you in the similar fashion the
only caveat to this feature is that in
order to use it your device has to be
plugged in without it when you call out
hey Siri it's not going to work but
either way it's really cool
Apple has implemented this feature
because you no longer have to look for
your phone and DoubleTap the task at a
question you can actually just ask it
from wherever you are as long as you can
hear you without even touching it so
that's what we have at number four and
for number three on this list we have
widgets in the Notification Center now
this is a really cool feature I think
because it now allows for third-party
developers to make widgets that will go
into your notification center and what
really what that really means is that
now you can interact with certain apps
without actually being within the app so
that's a really awesome feature you can
do different things depending on what
that widget will allow and by doing that
you're able to you know interact with a
nap by not opening it now one of the
examples that they show during the
keynote was an ebay widget that allowed
you to adjust your bid during the actual
bidding session and this is really cool
because if someone outbids you you can
simply pull down your notification
center and outbid them right back or
adjust your bid do whatever you want and
that's really awesome because you can
interact with a nap without being in the
app without having to leave the current
app you're in so let's say you're typing
an email you can pull down notification
bid on the item and pull it right back
up and get back to your email so that's
really really cool and this is another
feature that Android has had for quite
some time but it's so cool to see it on
iOS nonetheless and that's what we have
at number three and four number two on
this list is the new quick type keyboard
with the quick type keyboard you can
type up a message and on the top of your
keyboard you'll see predictive text so
if you're having a conversation about
movies or dinner your keyboard is
actually going to give you automatic
responses so that you can actually just
talk about the dinner or the movies or
anything that it sees on the screen so
it's smart enough to actually analyze
the conversation but Apple has said that
all the information is being stored on
the phone so none of your keyboard
things are going to NSA maybe but it
none of it is supposed to be going
anywhere it's supposed to be all kept on
the phone so while it's predicting and
reading all that stuff you don't have to
worry about security because it's
supposedly all on your phone so it
learns how you talk it learns how you
type and who you're typing too so it
actually can tell the difference between
you talking to your boss or are you
talking to your friend so that's really
really cool and it's going to be able to
predict all the kind of things that you
normally say with that individual it's
also really cool and very uh Napa like
is the ability to have third-party
keyboards Apple has stuck with the same
keyboard for a very long time until they
updated it in iOS 7 but they always
always had the same keyboard and they'd
never really allowed anyone else to make
another keyboard so now they're allowing
third-party developers to make keyboards
so you can eventually see swipe on the
iphone which is just pretty nuts so this
is really really cool stuff on the
keyboard is going to get a lot of
changes so I'm really looking forward to
that and this is something else that
Android has been able to do but a lot of
these features are all things to end
route has been able to do at this point
but it's really cool nonetheless iphone
and ipad users are going to be very very
happy and this is why we have it at
number two and now for number one on the
list we have interactive notifications
now I think this is one of the best
features that they announced because
notifications can sometimes be a pain
especially if it's a text message you
have to leave whatever you're doing and
go into that text message and respond
and then jump back to the app that you
areand before now if you get a text
message you can actually respond to it
by simply pulling down the notification
a bit and then typing a message out and
then sending it and you never have to
leave the actor in so this is really
cool or if you get like a count
calendar-- notification you can respond
right there so it's really really
awesome stuff and this is probably one
of the best features I think because it
doesn't slow down the process of using
iOS 8 no longer do you have to jump
between apps but you have whenever you
get a notification so I think that's
really cool this is something that and
never mind anyway it's really awesome
feature I like it a lot and that pretty
much wraps up my top 5 features of iOS 8
now I know there were a ton of cool
features that i didn't mention here such
as being able to opt out of group
messages I know you iphone users have
been dying for that but also being able
to access your favorite contacts by
double tapping the home screen also
there's a ton of new features but let me
know what you guys think should have
been on this list if I didn't mention it
and if you guys want to get your hands
on iOS 8 beta before it's available to
the general public you can check out
early iOS calm and by going there you
can register
your udid in order to get access to iOS
8 before everyone else so definitely
check them out and that pretty much
