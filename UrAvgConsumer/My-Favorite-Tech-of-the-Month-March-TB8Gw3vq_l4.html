Club so March is coming to an end and I
found myself using some pieces of tech
more than others this month so welcome
to my favorite tech of the month for the
month of March now the first thing I
found myself using a ton this month is
this portable gaming monitor for the
Xbox one X from G story I talked about
this monitor a little while ago and
recommended it as a must-have Xbox one
accessory and then this thing has been
clutched since the day I picked it up
it's an 11.6 inch 1080p display with HDR
and while 1080p doesn't sound amazing
it's a compact enough screen where
everything still looks incredibly sharp
colors look great on it and from an
overall performance standpoint this
thing has been awesome whether I've been
using it to game or watch regular
content what I also really like about
this screen is that it has built-in
speakers but if you're looking for a
more private gaming or viewing
experience it has not one but two
headphone jacks in case you're watching
something with someone I've personally
been using this thing a ton and he
followed me on Twitter you might have
seen her post about me using it in our
bedroom since we don't really have any
furniture in there right now and this is
my way around that I just love the idea
of being able to take my xbox to pretty
much anywhere in the house or even
outside of it maybe to a friend's house
and still be able to play my games
anywhere and it's also available for the
ps4 so if your team Sony you don't have
to worry and for those of you wondering
why you need this over something like a
gaming laptop there are tons of console
players out there who aren't really
looking to become PC gamers not to
mention how much you need to spend to
match the gaming performance on a gaming
laptop to something like the Xbox one X
now the reason I've been using the Xbox
so much these days is apex legends and
yes I do include software in my favorite
second among videos and this game
absolutely deserves a spot I haven't
really been a fan of many of the battle
royale games that have come out over the
past couple of years but all that has
changed with this game I can spend hours
playing apex even though I'm not a big
fan of first-person shooters but the
creators of my favorite first-person
shooter titanfall actually made this
game and they've got my number because I
love this game just as much as titanfall
now there's a couple of different
characters with various abilities and
you work in teams of three tool
other teams and be the last one standing
and I'm not that good at it just yet but
I'm getting there and of course things
like developers know what they're doing
by adding characters that you can unlock
I like the ability to have different
characters with different play styles in
this game so that's definitely a nice
touch and even if you don't have an Xbox
you can still play apex legends on ps4
and the PC but if you're on Xbox holla
at me we could probably team up now if
you're not a fan of battle royale games
but you like first-person shooters give
this one a try trust me
it is definitely worth at least trying
out a few rounds and the best part about
it all is that this game is free which
is kind of mind-blowing considering the
quality that you're getting here but let
me know if you guys download it and what
you think of it in the comments section
below now up next is yes
the iPad Mini now I've only had it for
about a week and change but honestly I
haven't put it down since I got it I
recently started using these moleskin a
Productivity and then it is a nice
experience I really like to write down
my ideas for videos with a notebook and
pen which is why you guys usually see me
carry one around in my gadget backpack
but these apps and the form factor of
the iPad Mini completely changes my need
for those notebooks especially now that
the iPad Mini supports the Apple pencil
and let's be honest the design looks a
bit dated with the larger bezels at the
top and bottom and while I wish it
looked like the iPad pros and could
support the second generation Apple
pencil this thing still has all the
power it needs with Apple's 812 chip in
it so I can game watch anime read manga
and use it as my planner slash
creativity notebook with no issues I
will say this thing has surprisingly
been making a strong case for staying on
me at all times and actually covered my
time with the iPad Mini in another video
if you guys are interested in seeing my
thoughts I'll have that link down below
in the description
now another favorite of mine is the
suteki travel charger adapter that you
guys saw me unbox and one of my most
recent massive tech unboxings
I love the earlier version with one USB
CPD port and now that there are two
there are a lot more possibilities you
can now fast charge your phone while
simultaneously charging something more
demanding like a MacBook Pro now this is
a charging station and not a portable
charger so you do have to plug it into
the wall so even though I take it with
me on the
go I think it's better suited as a
staple for like a desk setup sense it'll
be plugged in all the time and you'll
always have access to those ports now do
you think it would be kind of amazing
this attention we're able to bring these
ports and this much power over to a
portable charger so specially if you're
listening I'd buy that in a heartbeat
now I've actually got another item from
the massive tech unboxing that actually
was pretty excited about when I unboxed
it is this super clean leather mousepad
that not only looks good but it actually
has some nice functions as well as a
built-in Qi wireless charger and at
first it may seem a bit gimmicky but
trust me it's not I noticed myself more
and more dropping my phone on the
wireless charging space anytime I was
using the computer and not using my
phone and at this point it's just
natural for me to drop down my phone let
it charge it up a bit instead of just
kind of placing it on the desk where
it's not getting any juice at all and
this isn't the first mouse pad to exist
like this but the difference between
this and the ones that I've looked at in
the past is that this thing looks
absolutely gorgeous doesn't have
anything crazy like RGB it has a very
sophisticated look and not only that but
it retails for just 40 bucks and it even
comes in a few colors like brown grey
black and blue so it can match your desk
setup with no problem I absolutely love
this guy now that's been my favorite
tech of the month but we got to give you
huge shout out to today's sponsor Dollar
Shave Club now fellas we've all heard of
Dollar Shave Club and they've got some
awesome kits for keeping a clean shave
but their kids actually cover more than
just shaving right now they've got an
offer where you can get their shave
shower and oral starter set each for
only 5 bucks they sent me all three
starter kits and I'm not gonna lie that
oral starter set comes with this dope
weighty toothbrush not only does it look
like it was made for me but also feels
really premium and it also comes with
this travel sized version of their
toothpaste you guys can join the club
with one of their starter sets for just
5 bucks and after that the restock box
ships with regular sized products at
regular prices now if you guys want to
jump on the deal head on over to
dollarshaveclub.com slash jugnu which
I'll also have link down below in the
description but that about wraps it up
for this video guys everything mentioned
in this video will be linked down below
in the description
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
