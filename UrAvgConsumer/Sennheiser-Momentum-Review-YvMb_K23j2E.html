average consumer and today I've got a
review for you guys of the Sennheiser
momentum over your headphones so let's
not wasting your time scare right into
it
and all right guys here we have the
Sennheiser momentum over ear headphones
Sennheiser is a very popular brand
amongst audio files but not so much the
average consumer the Sennheiser momentum
is their way of changing that so let's
take a look and see if it's right for
you Sennheiser really didn't hold back
in the quality department of these
headphones upon closer examination you
can see the premium qualities and
materials put into these cans as you can
see we have a very flat stainless-steel
headband with leather padding and some
great stitch work I like having a flat
headband like this because it decreases
overall size of the headphones
especially when wearing them the holes
in the headband also give tons of room
for the ear cups to maneuver in and the
design and flexibility of the band will
allow any head shape or size to fit
within it and its ear cups and speaking
of the ear cups the ones found on the
momentum are great they have a stylish
look to them with a matte finish on the
outside while the cushions are made of a
genuine leather and are very soft to
touch you can definitely see Sennheiser
took their time with the design and
overall look and feel of these ear cups
now while these ear cups are very nicely
designed I noticed some people complain
about the overall size and comfort they
offer during long listening sessions I
thought they were going to be too small
for me at first but my ears fit in
nicely I did notice however that I
needed to give my ears a chance to
breathe when wearing them for extended
periods of time
I have average sized ears so if you have
larger ears this might be something you
want to take into consideration a great
feature on the Sennheiser Momentum's is
the ability to lock the cable into the
headphone so once you have it in you can
twist it and you can see here that the
cable won't budge one thing to know is
that the input that goes into the
headphone is smaller than the one that
goes into your audio device so you won't
be able to use just any detachable cable
with this and now for my favorite thing
about these headphones altogether is the
actual input as you can see it's a very
nice dirty input and it has
Sennheiser logo but the best thing about
it is that it's able to go into a 90
degree angle and this is perfect for
using with mobile devices or any other
device you can actually just pick how
you want it to be so your cable won't
break or anything like that which i
think is really great and now here we
have the remote this can be used with
Apple devices with no problem and it
also works for Android devices but
you'll only be able to take advantage of
the play and pause button and in the
back you'll find the mic as well as some
more sennheiser branding and overall
this is a nice cable it's not a thick
cable but it does get the job done and
it has some really nice features and of
course here we have the case this is a
hardshell case so you'll definitely have
some good protection for your headphones
it is a bit on the large side but it
definitely isn't too hard to carry
around and when you open it up you'll
have a little velcro piece that you can
remove and this is a nice little spot
that you can store accessories like a
cable or your 1/4 inch adapter so it's
very low key you can just throw things
in there and have the little velcro keys
go in and secure it and now for the most
important part of this review the sound
quality as I use more sennheiser branded
headphones I'm really starting to see
how well they do in the clarity
department this is a very clean and
clear sounding headphone and it does
have some bass to it but nothing that
would overpower the music that you're
listening to instruments and vocals
alike seem to come through pretty
clearly as well these definitely have a
very balanced sound to them and I think
that the Momentum's are a great
investment for the average consumer
looking to invest in a pair of high-end
headphones that will do well with most
genres of music even as someone who
enjoys head rattling bass I found these
quite pleasant to listen to if you're
interested in picking up a pair
definitely check the link down below for
pricing and availability but of course
now it's time to show you guys what it
looks like on alright and now to show
you guys what looks like on so here it
is well as on as you can see it's very
low-key can't really see anything with
it it's very very low-profile and around
the neck and I gotta say guys I really
do like these headphones I definitely do
think they're worth it if you want to
make that jump
into a high-grade the Sennheiser product
so definitely good stuff here and it's
got the looks down it's got the sound
quality I do recommend these these are
really good so hopefully you guys
enjoyed this review and I'll catch you
guys in the next one until then is your
average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
