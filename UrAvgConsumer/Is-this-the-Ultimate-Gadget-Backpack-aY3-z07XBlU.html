consumer and you guys know I love me a
very nice backpack that's able to hold
all of my tech but I found a very
promising backpack at CES that has a ton
of tech already built inside of it so
let me introduce you guys to the looms
AG I feel like this was one of those
hidden gems of CES this year and this
one that I got to check out was a
prototype so things will probably change
by the time it's actually ready to roll
out but if they're able to execute
everything that they're promising this
is definitely gonna change the game at
first glance this looks like a pretty
standard backpack with nylon and leather
materials used to outfit it but I was
told there would be different versions
coming in the future made with rubber
and nylon which I honestly think I'd
prefer over the leather versions that I
got a chance to check out since they're
more in line with what I'm used to
wearing already and based on the renders
I think it'll just straight up look a
bit better but either way these bags are
made to be weatherproof and have
anti-scratch materials within them which
definitely help with durability and
keeping the things that you carry inside
with you a bit safer and speaking of the
things you're carrying this bag looks
like it'll have quite a few well laid
out compartments now they did tell me
things will probably change in this area
as they add sensors to this section but
it looks like they've got the right
thought process in mind in terms of the
overall layout and the amount of
compartments they made available now
you're probably like sensors for what
well the bag is supposed to be able to
detect whether or not you forgot to pack
your important items so if an important
item of yours is missing or you forgot
to pack it when you leave then you're
gonna get an alert to your phone through
the app that lets you know you got to go
get it my backpacks tend to be organized
chaos so I think that this would be a
really useful feature you even get a
built-in LED light in the main
compartment if you need to look through
your bag in the dark which is really
useful especially if you're looking for
something at the bottom of the bag and
the back actually got its name from this
feature you know it illuminates inside
of the bag so it's called the Loom zag
not sure about that part though this
attic but back to those sensors the
pockets aren't gonna be the only things
that have them the zippers will also
have sensors that lets you know if
someone's trying to get into your
backpack and what's even more amazing
with this feature is that it works with
a built in camera that we've got in the
back here so if someone gets inside of
your bag
it'll take a picture and let you see who
it was but honestly can you imagine
walking out late at night and feeling
like someone's walking behind you with
this bag you can basically look to see
who's behind you without actually
looking over your shoulder by jumping
into the app and taking a look at the
camera
so you basically have eyes behind you
and if something suspicious is going on
you can call the police or maybe start
running whatever it may be but you can
take action without alerting the person
behind you that's really awesome it also
features a remote anti-theft alarm that
you can activate from your phone so if
it happens to go missing you can use
that alarm to go find it
or someone swiped it you can actually
scare them into dropping it and if they
did drop it this thing also has a global
tracker so you know exactly where it's
located at all times you can pinpoint it
right from the app using the map which
is really really cool I think one of the
most common comments I get in all of my
backpack videos are what if somebody
steals it or what if you misplace it
well I don't usually worry about that
kind of stuff but what's a bag like this
I was definitely not worrying and
obviously to make sure all of these
features work you're gonna need some
juice
so inside we've got a 10,000 milliamp
hour battery so that you can use to
charge up your devices kind of like
we've seen with other backpacks there is
an external USB port from what I've seen
and there will be some cables and such
in this compartment right here so
hopefully that's where you go when you
need to charge up your device or the bag
itself and if you're taking this thing
camping and you don't have an outlet or
something to charge the bag it comes
with a solar panel that you can use to
charge it with the Sun and if your phone
supports wireless charging you're in
luck because there's a little pouch on
the shoulder strap that you can place
your phone and have it charged
wirelessly this is one of those features
that I actually got to try at the booth
and I'm not gonna lie I was pretty
impressed to see it actually work and
for a feature like this I think they
managed to not make it look completely
hideous and they even mentioned the back
having a Wi-Fi hotspot feature I don't
know how they're gonna manage to make
that work and all the logistics behind
that but it'd be great if your devices
in the data but I just want to see how
they make that happen
seems like a tall order but it would be
pretty cool if it works this is easily
the most feature packed backpack that
I've
ever seen or heard of and a lot of them
can be accessed with the companion app
which will be available alongside it as
a backpack lover it is hard to believe
that this thing is even being worked on
but the looms AG is supposed to be
hitting Kickstarter right in February
and there's gonna be two versions a 22
litre and a 17 litre version so you can
take your pick at the size you want but
I want to know what you guys think is
the backpack with all of these features
something you'd be interested in do you
only care about typical backpacks let me
know your complete thoughts would a
comment down below guys and I also have
them linked in the description if you
guys want to go ahead and check them out
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy girl that gives
this video a thumbs up and I'll catch
you guys in the next one so then it's
your average consumer face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
