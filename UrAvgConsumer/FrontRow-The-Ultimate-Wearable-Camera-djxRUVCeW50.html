and today we're gonna be checking out
the front row camera now this is
supposed to be a life capturing entirely
new design to take on the camera and
I've got some really interesting ideas
on how I want to put it through its
paces today but huge shout out to
front-row for sponsoring today's video
and I'm gonna be giving away one to one
of you guys so if you're interested in
that giveaway definitely check the links
down below in the description so real
quick here's what you get in the box
you've got your paperwork a clip mount
you also get a USB type-c cable with a
USB a adapter so that's awesome and you
also get a lanyard because this is a
wearable so you'll be able to throw the
front row right onto this and it even
comes with this little attachment so
that you can use your own chain if you
want tons of different ways to wear the
actual camera itself but yeah this is
the front row so a little bit about this
guy you've got an 8 megapixel wide-angle
main camera and you've also got a front
facing five megapixel camera for selfies
and livestreaming but I've heard some
really good things about this screen so
I'm gonna power this guy on and see what
that looks like
this is actually a really nice looking
display and its really responsive it's
running its own version of Android so
that makes sense but taking a look
around the device you'll notice up top
that you'll have a media button so with
one press you'll be able to snap a photo
with a long press you'll be able to
record some video and a DoubleTap will
start this story mode so if you're
wondering what story mode is the front
row will essentially take pictures
throughout the entire day and create a
time-lapse for you so you can go back
later and see all the cool things that
you did so like I said I've got a lot of
cool stuff planned for this guy so let's
jump into that alright guys so right
here I've got a prototype of something
called a scooter board now I don't know
how to ride this very well so I'm
probably gonna be shaking like crazy but
the front row cameras have optical image
stabilization as well as electronic
image stabilization so we're gonna see
how that comes into play here and if we
can get some really smooth video even
though I'm about to kill myself
who
as you can see I'm still trying to learn
this thing I've done better on other
things but not so bad but uh it's fun
though it's fun it's a it's a smooth
ride so right now I've got the perfect
subject behind this I'm gonna take a
couple of pictures and selfies with it
which is gonna be pretty easy all I
gotta do is hit that media button and
then I'll feel a haptic feedback
whenever it takes the picture so let's
get some cool shots all right so to take
the picture all I have to do is hit the
media button boom got the shot and now
I'm gonna take a selfie here boom and
there's even a gallery so if you want to
check out what you just shot just swipe
to the right and you can see everything
that you captured all in one spot and it
even breaks it down into videos time
lapses or stories and just photos and
some of your favorites so you got a lot
of options there and if you swipe down
you can even see how much storage you
use so we spent some time with the front
row camera did a ton of testing and I
gotta say I'm pretty impressed the image
stabilization was good but sometimes it
did get a bit shaky depending on how I
moved to fit around my neck but
thankfully it came with a clip and it is
magnetic so I was able to mount it on
quite a few different things and even
being on my electric skateboard I was
able to get some really smooth footage
when I had it mounted to my shoulder
strap of my backpack and I even spent
quite a bit of time on story mode like I
mentioned earlier this mode is when the
camera captures a ton of pictures
throughout your day and automatically
creates a time-lapse of your day and it
even has a story editor that allows you
to edit shorten or remove certain clips
before you go ahead and post it on
social media and story mode was actually
pretty cool
it was awesome to be able to look back
and see my full day with this thing and
it has a nice little feature where it
uses an accelerometer and the optical
image stabilization to make sure that is
taking pictures at the best and optimal
moment and even though it's doing all of
that you don't really have to worry
about battery so much because it has a
USB type-c connector that allows for a
really quick charging so even though me
and aeri were shooting a ton of stuff
while we were visiting these homes
between those visits I was able to juice
up whenever we got
the car and one of the key features of
the front row actually happens to be
live streaming I feel like almost
everybody is live-streaming these days
and front row actually allows for a
pretty hands-free experience for
streaming through YouTube Facebook and
Twitter and if you follow me on Twitter
you probably caught the periscope that I
did when I was testing it out on the
camera the cameras are definitely good
enough for live-streaming and if you
don't follow me on Twitter or Instagram
the places where I'm most likely will go
live in the future you better be sure to
go do that I'll have my links down below
at your average consumers pretty simple
and of course it did regular things like
take photos and videos pretty well and
you can review content from the front
row and even hear the audio you recorded
since it has a built-in speaker using
the back camera to take a selfie was
nice senses a wide angle and it also
senses you taking a picture in that mode
and automatically sets a three-second
timer so taking any photos were pretty
simple
checking photos and content was pretty
easy too because of the app you can see
everything you took from the front row
on a larger screen through the app and
you can also make stories save your
photos onto the device and even start up
a live stream on your front row right
from your phone you basically a complete
remote control of the front row right
from the app overall I think the front
row is pretty cool and it's so rare
these days to see a gadget that does
something a bit different than everyone
else but if you guys want to get your
hands on it definitely check the links
down below in the description I'll catch
you guys in the next video hopefully
enjoy it if you did be the cool guy or
girl there give this video a thumbs up
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
so then it's your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
