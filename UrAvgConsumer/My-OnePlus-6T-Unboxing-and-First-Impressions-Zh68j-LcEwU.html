and today we have a very special box
right here this is from one plus now I
feel like it wasn't too long ago that we
were unboxing do one plus six and you
might imagine what this is so let's see
what we've got inside this guy is the
phone we've got another over here I'm
not sure what's inside of here and we
got a microfiber cloth yes and this one
is surprisingly empty and for those of
you who've never heard of one plus where
you been uh-huh but they are a value
brand in terms of Android devices that
are really good but don't cost a ton of
money now that's been changing a little
bit over the years they have gotten a
bit more premium but we'll see what
happens with this 16 okay let's do this
reveal hmm oh hey guys I did a really
good job as staying away from rumors
although I couldn't miss some of the
pictures that were out there on the
internet but the knotch
that they went with with the 60 it's a
little teardrop notch so this is cool
this is the midnight black version of
the 60 and man I cannot wait to power
this thing on but we have to put it to
the side and see what else we get inside
of the box right we got a bumper that is
always always welcome and some paperwork
who cares right but you also get a -
charger guy is that what I think I saw
no one plus what is this why it's an
adapter y'all for the headphone jack
well another one bites the best alright
well you got your - charger here and
your adapter for your headphone jack at
least it's a good-looking adapter it's
you know white and red
like one pluses whole thing the theme
man this is a real disappointment right
there so we've got our accessories over
here we've got the phone over here as
well but I want to know what else they
sent over some cases so one plus is
really good at providing some nice cases
so you got a pretty standard plastic one
that came in the box with the phone but
over here we've got some nice ones as
well they got some of the best cases out
there them an apple they've got really
good first-party cases and we've got the
oneplus type C bullet earphones let's
take a look at these I'm guessing these
are like yeah these are type C earbuds
since you know there's no longer a
headphone jack see what those actually
look like okay got a little metal finish
to it and they remind me of Dera
bluetooth ones overall design but it's
got a cable and a USB type-c input so
that you can plug it into your phone
alright those are all of the accessories
that we have here now let's go for the
main attraction we gotta jump into the
phone
alright so now someone take a look at
the actual phone okay guys this thing
has an in display fingerprint scanner
and that is exciting no I don't think
I've used a phone yet that had this
feature so there's like the vivo those
vivo phones that had that ability I've
never gotten a chance to use those so
this is going to be my first one and
it's coming to consumers as soon as this
is available so that is awesome
so listen with power this thing up and
set that up now for those of you curious
about specs this thing's still rocking
the snapdragon 845 processor eight gigs
of ram and i believe is the 128 gig
model so you got quite a bit of storage
here and men that display this display
is nice you see that's the little
teardrop from facing camera so with that
single camera it is going to have that
same quick face unlock and this is
actually a six point four one inch
display so it's a huge display this
actually the best-looking not I've seen
so far this is closest to the essential
phone but this one the way they've made
that curve I think I like this one a bit
more okay so I'm all logged in but I
to add my face data so let's see how
that goes boom that was like really
quick I'm gonna have to move now it's
the fingerprint part guys I'm excited so
when the fingerprint pattern appears at
the bottom of the screen simply press
with your finger on the fingerprint
indication area to use the fingerprint
function alright so here we go I'm gonna
set this up oh this is crazy it's a
display how does it display even doing
this I gotta say I like the feel in the
hand this thing this is the midnight
black version Oh first time isn't
fingerprint hold up boom works like a
charm
we're in guys this is the oneplus 60 and
just so you guys can walk away knowing
all of the specs here this thing's got a
16 megapixel front facing camera as well
as 16 megapixels in the back here
not to mention this guy also has a 3700
milliamp hour battery capacity I would
have been happy with 4000 but one plus
get some really good battery life so
seeing an increase in the battery
capacity here means good things you of
course still get that USB type-c
connector at the bottom down firing
speakers I don't believe there's any
from firing speakers yeah so down firing
speakers at the bottom it really hurts
to see the headphone jack leave this guy
now I know everyone is going into
bluetooth route these days but it would
have been nice to just have the option
but hey you can't really knock them
every manufacturers doing ad space now
we got the specs down but in terms of
new features of course that fingerprint
scanner is the biggest one but there's
also an improved camera so we're
supposed to be seeing better low-light
photography with this and we also have
this thing called smart boost so with
smart boost you're going to be able to
open up apps quite a bit faster between
five and twenty percent faster from cold
starts so basically what that means is
when you leave an app for a while and
you jump back into it it's supposed to
load up a bit faster but we'll see how
that does after a few tests but so far
guys this phone is looking really really
good this display man I'm very very
happy with what I'm seeing right now
this is nice
but I just wanted to give you guys a
quick sneak peek into what you're
getting with the oneplus 60 with this
quick little unboxing there's definitely
going to be a real day in the life video
to let you guys know how this
handles being outside in the real world
but let me know what you guys think of
the oneplus 60 with a comment down below
if you enjoyed this video be the cool
guy or girl that gives it a thumbs up
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then it's your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
