Mobile what's going on guys your average
consumer and it is finally that time of
the year is summertime so you know that
means vacations being outdoors going out
having fun so let's talk about some cool
tech that's gonna be great for all of
that but we're also gonna be talking
about the phone cleanse which is a
challenge that helps you evaluate your
relationship with your phone so stay
tuned for that and the first thing that
we've got is of course a portable
charger and hear me out this one's
actually really cool and it's great for
summertime because this thing is solar
powered so if you're gonna be outdoors
and you don't have anything to plug this
into if you need some juice son is all
you need baby this thing has a solar
panel up top so you don't have to worry
about it running out of juice and it's
got 15,000 milliamp hours so you'll be
able to charge your phone someone else's
phone many times over and this thing was
made for the outdoors has got a really
rugged design it's also got a flashlight
in the back so if you're out hiking or
camping doing whatever you can just go
ahead and hit the power button and turn
this thing on give yourself a extra
little light so you're not using up your
phone's battery life and this thing's
even waterproof which is nuts take this
come to the pool you'll be alright
and next up if you know me you know I
love me some backpacks so right here
I've got this really cool one by two
code now I think this is a really good
backpack especially for vacations or any
big trips that you might have over the
summer inside of it you get a ton of
space so you'll be able to put clothing
in here tech whatever you need this
thing is definitely big enough to hold a
lot of stuff and this thing is tech
oriented it has a built-in USB port so
you can plug in a portable charger to
this guy similar to what we just saw you
can have those two work together plug it
into here and then whenever you're
traveling all I got to just plug a USB
cable into your backpack and charge your
phone without having to dig around and
look for a portable charger or anything
like that and it's less than 40 bucks so
that's a win now next up we've got this
phone case by moment they actually have
these cutouts around the lens so then
you can add on special lenses that fit
whatever you're looking for so right
here we've got three
Lenz's this is an 18 millimeter
wide-angle lens
you also have a 60 millimeter telephoto
lens and a 10 millimeter macro lens if
you want some really tight shots and
these things work very simply all you do
is take off the lens cap here grab your
phone case put it in and then twist and
boom your phone is officially outfitted
to take some photos so if you want to
capture your memories in the best way
possible while on vacation without
carrying a separate camera or crazy DSLR
or anything like that this is something
you definitely want to look into and
next up is something you see me talk
about on the channel before and that is
these power adapters for multiple
countries all you have to do is plug in
whatever you would typically plug in at
the top hit this little switch down here
and boom this gives you access to the
plug that you would need to use in
Europe and it also works in other places
over here you have China and what's
great about this is not only does it
give you access to a plug at the top but
you also get three USB ports and even a
USB type-c port so if you have one of
the newest Mac books or maybe even the
newest Android phones or something USB
type-c baby it's necessary now you know
you're not gonna get away from a
vacation video without we're talking
about that portable charger and a
Bluetooth speaker so right here we have
the Logitech Ultimate Ears wonder boom
now that is just that's just an awesome
name wonder balloon really but this is a
really cool blue speaker because of a
few things the one it has really great
audio quality it is very surprising
considering its size and I really really
was impressed with the audio here and
the fact that it's so compact and
portable you can throw this thing into
your backpack with no problem
and it's great because it's waterproof
so if you take this thing by the pool
you guys are hanging out you want to
play some music if you happen to splash
on this guy while you're in the pool you
jumping in you're not worried about this
thing getting messed up and it's only
around 50 bucks a little bit more
depending on the color that you go for
it but it's very inexpensive so I just
love this as an option for vacation
because of the performance and it's easy
to take around and next up is something
that's
actually pretty new to me and there are
a ton of different versions out there
for those interested but this is a
tablet holder for your car so if you
happen to have little Rugrats and you're
taking them on a road trip this is gonna
be great if they love their tablet and
you don't want them to hold it in the
car maybe they have butterfingers or
something you can just prop this up on
the headrest of the front seats and have
them throw their tablet inside of here
and they can watch hands-free I really
like the idea of being able to get a
tablet or a switch or whatever it may be
onto the back of your headrest without
having it actually installed when you
purchase the car so I think that's
really cool and perfect for the occasion
with little kids now you can always go
for the typical tech that we usually
talk about for your vacation but I think
this could bring a little something
different if you really want to be in
the moment in your vacation and this is
the Xfinity mobile phone cleanse now
this is a seven-day challenge that I
actually took if you follow me on
Instagram you might have seen me talk
about that and kind of how I went
through with it all but this is a really
cool way that allows you to have a
different relationship with your phone
don't let the word Cleanse scare you
here
this isn't about disconnecting with your
phone and not using it ever or you know
weaning yourself off of it and just so
you guys could get an idea of some of
the challenges that you'd have to do
during this cleanse and one is going to
be perfect for vacation it's called
storage war which calls for you to free
up some space on your phone and this is
gonna be great so you can take pictures
and videos of your vacation and capture
those memories another one is the
24-hour notification fast and this one
challenges you to turn off your
notifications for 24 hours so you
control when you look at your phone
versus being distracted by all the
things and buzzes so these are really
cool interesting ways of kind of
learning about your phone and how you
use it
I think this was a very interesting
experiment I had a really good time
testing my limits and kind of learning
how I use my phone so if you guys want
to try it out I'll have links down below
in the description especially if you're
going on vacation you're gonna want to
be able to be in the moment kind of take
advantage of everything that you've got
going on on your trip that about wraps
it up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if there were some cool
pieces of tech that you could recommend
some of the other viewers leave comments
down below leave suggestions but I'll
catch you guys
next one till then is your average
consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
