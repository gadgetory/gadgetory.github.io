consumer and unless you've been living
under a rock you probably know that
Apple has announced a new iPhone 6 and 6
plus now today I'm going to be going
over the top 5 features of the iPhone 6
and 6 plus and now all the features on
this list might not work for both
devices some features are for 6 plus
only but hey let's not wasting time
let's get right into it by my ipod my
god and a kick start this list at number
5 we have Wi-Fi calling now by no means
is this a brand new feature Apple didn't
invent this this has been out for quite
a few years and quite a few phones have
been able to do this but now seeing it
on the iPhone is actually really cool
because it's going to be a lot more
mainstream now it's going to be starting
rolling out with t mobile phones so if
you have t-mobile service there's
actually going to be for you now this is
really cool because if you're in an area
with no reception or really bad
reception but they have Wi-Fi signal you
can actually get on the Wi-Fi signal and
make a phone call with no problem and it
sounds really crisp and clear so that's
an awesome awesome feature and what I
really like about what Apple has done
with this is that now when you actually
leave the area with the Wi-Fi signal and
move to an area where you do have
reception the connection doesn't just
shut off like it used to in the past
now the data actually transfers right
over from Wi-Fi over to LTE I have
experience with Wi-Fi calling and it
always sucked when I had to leave my
area with Wi-Fi to somewhere else and
I'd tell the person I have to call them
back with this you don't have to so
continuous talking even in an area with
bad reception definitely a thumbs up and
I like how Apple handled this so that's
why they get Wi-Fi calling at number
five now number four on this list is
something that pertains more so to the
iPhone 6 plus than the iPhone 6 and
that's better battery life now of course
with a much bigger display you get
better battery life because there's more
space in the phone to have a big a
bigger battery now the iPhone 6 does
have a bit better battery life than the
iPhone 5s but only marginally it's not a
huge difference you get a little bit
here and there but the iPhone 6 has some
major major improvements so you get
things like being able to listen to
music for twice as long so instead of 40
hours you get 80
hours you can watch for hours more video
on the iPhone six-plus then compared to
the iPhone 5s you get a couple more
hours of web browsing and you get a
crazy whopping 16 days of standby time
nuts so if you leave your phone around
for a bit you're not going to get your
battery drained like that it's going to
last quite some time and the iPhone and
iPod touches apples always been pretty
good with standby time and to see them
push it this much kudos so that's why we
have increased battery life at number
four and for number three on this list
we have landscape mode now this is
another one of those features that's
going to work more so for the iPhone 6
plus then it is going to work for the
iPhone 6 so when you actually tilt your
iPhone six-plus into landscape mode
you'll get a lot more options than in
comparison to portrait mode and this is
actually really cool because it also
works for the keyboard you get access to
even more characters than you typically
would so it makes typing just a bit
easier and if an app supports it you can
get way more options in landscape mode
than you can in portrait mode and an
example being like the mail app you can
actually see a list of your mail on one
side and the actual content of one of
the messages on the right now something
like this makes the iPhone six-plus
really fit into the phablet category so
something with this bigger size you get
way more information way more options
way more controls depending on the app
of course so in and it also helps that
the six has such a bigger screen because
in other apps even if it's in portrait
mode you still get a lot of content that
you normally wouldn't get like on
something like the 5s or even the six
now one of the examples Apple use is in
the messages app you can actually see
the messages as well as the profile
picture for someone who's sending you
the message so you get to see their
little thumbnail as well as the message
that they wrote so definitely a nice
little touch there iPhone 6 plus is
definitely looking like my favorite of
the two because you get way more options
with it and you get to see a lot more
detail and that's why we have landscape
mode at number 3 and for number 6 on
this list we have Apple pay now Apple
pay definitely surprised me I didn't
think Apple would cave in and go with
NFC on their iPhone but they did and it
actually turned out to be a really good
system that Apple created so with Apple
pay you can use your phone to go and pay
for different merch
at a bunch of different retailers Apple
provided a list of all the different
retailers that they're working with so
like Macy's Bloomingdales even a
McDonald's drive-through of course the
Apple store itself and tons and tons
more you can actually use your phone and
instead of looking and fumbling for your
credit card or change you can actually
use your phone to pay for something at a
register with no problem you just tap
your phone onto it and boom it's paid
now for those of you worried about
security it uses your touch ID so
someone can't just pick up your phone
and pay for something you have to have
your fingerprint so that you can make
the purchase also there's no information
stored on the device or Apple servers
whenever you're using that card so your
credit card number isn't stored in the
device Apple actually created a dynamic
security code that changes every time
you use it so it doesn't have that
static single code that the back of your
card has so essentially this makes it a
bit more secure than your actual credit
card so it changes every time you use it
nobody can track it and you know steal
your information because it's always
changing so that's definitely very very
awesome it seems like apples really
trying to get into a lot of different
fields here and I like the way they're
working it so good job Apple and that's
why we have Apple pay at number two and
for number one on this list is the
camera now the camera is probably the
biggest deal besides the operating
system for me when it comes to a cell
phone it is definitely a make or break
there are lots of phones that I've
passed up on because I wasn't crazy
about the camera but we all know that
iPhones take amazing pictures and Apple
seems to have improved the image quality
yet again with the iPhone 6 and 6-plus
so definitely one of my favorite things
now they've also worked on the video
side of things to provide better video
and also it actually has image
stabilization for the iPhone 6 plus so
if you're out there shooting with the
iPhone 6 plus you don't have to worry
about shaky videos the optical image
stabilization should actually make that
very smooth and very nice to look at and
it can shoot video in Full HD at 1080p
at 30 frames per second or even 60
frames per second and last year Apple
introduced 120 frames per second to slow
down and you slow motion now Apple has
introduced 200 and
forty frames per second so you get even
smoother and crisper slow motion video
and with what they shown it actually
looks really really awesome definitely
some good stuff I'm definitely a fan
there's no 4k but I don't think that's a
problem not something people have 4k TVs
or monitors just yet maybe in the iPhone
6s or maybe iPhone 7 but there's
definitely no rush for that now and for
all your selfie lovers Apple has
introduced a better FaceTime HD camera
so you can actually take burst selfies
and take tons of selfies if that's what
you're into and I know a lot of you are
so that's awesome there and it actually
is a lot brighter should be a lot better
but overall I'm very happy with the
cameras that Apple has announced and
features that they've introduced so
definitely good stuff and that's why I
have it at number one and pretty much
that's about it from my list guys that's
my top 5 features of the iPhone 6 and 6
plus if you have a different feature in
mind that you think should be on this
list leave a comment down below and let
me know what that is and I'll catch you

thumbs up and subscribe to the channel
