consumer and this is Ari and today you
know what time it is
we've got another shopping challenge
this time we are doing it in B and 8th
and shout outs between each response in
today's video and letting us film in the
store this place is a massacre and we're
lucky because vnh is in New York and
it's close to us but if you don't live
here you could always check out their
site which has a ton of tech and they
usually have some pretty good sales too
so I'll be sure to link them down below
in the description anyway
25 minutes to find something really
awesome tech we're gonna have a limit of
$1,000 and we have to have a theme so
the items that we picked up have to have
synergy they have to work well together
we'll pick our own theme you guys let us
know what you think works best we've got
the better haul and go alright guys so
we got a lot to choose from
got some headphones over here we gotta
find backpack
a backpack always seals the deal so I'm
gonna find a really good one
I happen to know where they are so let's
go over here and see if we got something
that I haven't seen before so we're in
the Apple section I'd like with $1000
how could I not pick up an Apple product
so let's let's see maybe have to use
them but do you guys sell used Apple
products here upstairs
that's why should be thank you Wow so
having a thousand bucks feels crazy
because it gives you so much room to
work with what's this bag though this
bag looks kind of cool they have a lot
of compartments
Oh a little servo hold on oh this is for
clothing would have been nice to make
like a tech survival kit with in the
backpack oh there's a lot of cool stuff
in here what brand is this GoPro okay so
being each it's called be an H photo and
video but it's more than just a place we
get photography equipment and
videography equipment you can get actual
really cool tech here as well so my
thought from my theme I think I'm going
to create like a beginner's equipments
like backpack or something for people
who want to like start with like video
or like maybe making a nice cool
Instagram maybe I will do like a tech
survival kind of thing where I have all
of the essentials inside of here so no
matter what's going on in your day you'd
have everything you need
cover your all your bases so here are my
thoughts my thoughts are something like
an iPad to edit on and I think a rode
mic would be really really cool too
because it's kind of cheap well budget
you know boom but yeah we're going to
try to find something like that okay a
hard drive 2 terabytes Western Digital
for only 61 bucks that is a really good
price and a capes just to be safe oh
this is this is too much budget this is
too much but I'm gonna crush this my
timer I'm not even gonna lie okay I did
so if I want to create like a beginner's
youtuber guide are like a beginners like
Instagram or guide I would need like a a
cheap Michael budget Mike
and something to edit on it honestly I'm
kind of like stuck after that I really
don't know what to do beyond that but we
will figure it out as we go along
Oh a tripod yeah it's like something for
your smartphone because beginners would
definitely not like by the full a full
crazy camera you can use your smartphone
and get away with that for now I like to
start with so I'll use my smartphone and
get a tripod for our smartphone I want
to cover all bases for nearly like your
laptop and your cell phone
yeah the main two pieces of tech people
take around with them so let's make sure
you're fully equipped with those this is
like a selfie stick and mini tripod I
know selfie sticks make people have like
really strong reactions but I'm gonna
hold on to this until I find something
better
all right now we need to find the rode
mic what I like is that even though it's
like a really big store it's organized
like you have your tripods and your
plethora of tripods here and you know
kind of know you're in the camera
department so I need to keep on moving
saying this department to find the mic
whoo imagine if I got a laptop - okay so
B&amp;amp;H has a ton like they have pretty much
everything you need
laptops monitors but I want to see if
they have like a specific section for
affordable laptops all right guys so I'm
looking for a budget laptop I've got my
buddy Greg over here who's in the
computer section I'm looking for a nice
budget-friendly laptop budget-friendly
yeah you guys have like a section or oh
you know it would be good also getting a
portable charger if you're using your
smart phone for all of your video you
might need to have be able to juice it
up so let's find a portable charger as
well keep that on my mind is the dead
end okay I like this guy over here yeah
so got a it's got a Radeon graphics and
the processor inside of it yeah
now my cue the graphics on this is
integrated okay so it's not even a
dedicated so it's gonna borrow from this
memory right main system memory to do
whatever you need to do in an extra
portion of it I actually think this idea
is pretty good I think I might win this
one my guys don't be biased I know you
love him but like vote for who's better
okay let's try fine I used iPad here
doubt it
and doubtful this video is nothing
without the iPad I need ya alright guys
so we've got a little less than nine
minutes left on on the clock I don't
know I haven't seen area at all but
there's still so much store to look at
do you guys happen to have used iPads to
an 18 iPads ok type that your cheapest
one fingers crossed that we can find one
that's like 700 bucks
how cool is whether you're ordering
something from the site or maybe you're
getting something from behind the shelf
you can have it all go to one cart and
you see this little conveyor belt there
are actually a bunch of carts that just
fly through here throughout the entire
store picking up your items and it takes
it all to checkout which is just the
craziest system I've ever seen for any
store it is really cool look at that's
actually let's see how much time we've
got left
three minutes less than three minutes
what all right so I could split we're at
$750 but we just added on some
headphones I think we're good guys I
think we're good
is it timer off already what alright
guys so I'm like severely severely under
budget man thousand dollars a lot to
spend in just this short amount of time
when you have to be really thoughtful
about each thing you're picking up so
hours should be around here somewhere
but she's a cheater so she might still
be looking around alright guys so Harry
was actually just getting help but I
think we both agree we need at least
five more minutes
and I'm like severely under budget right
now I am
okay so we need five more minutes I did
we fully agree to that
yes we'll shake on it five more minutes
all right let's do this
I was being kind to Jed I didn't need
that extra five minutes I'm just gonna
give it to him
let's go online so I got in 7:15
so I have 250 I can afford in this so
what happened might have to take some
stuff away sees mouth comes volley to me
to ball out I think we got a solid Hall
here should pretty much have everything
you need when leaving somewhere I don't
know I think it's all right one of the
best things about being a CH guys they
have these little candies over here they
always say you can take as much as you
want and I'm so scared whenever whenever
I go for one but they're so good
997 okay let's go with that so I don't
know if you guys can see it but those
conveyor belts right here those are what
go all around the store so that at the
end you can get the items that you
picked out I think I'm gonna win I hope
I win I hope you guys vote based on who
has the best overall package over who
you like the most
yo are you guys done okay
alright guys we are back how you feeling
I feel good I always felt dead and it
always will so doesn't matter how I feel
how do you feel
yeah honestly I don't know we'll see
though we'll see but how I am happy to
say I am under budget so my 997 dollars
and thirty cents
nice 991 27:91 yeah good job there's a
person I think both of us did pretty
well we're gonna spend more than $1,000
yeah I guess we'll go one at a time yes
and show everything that we've got talk
about our theme and you guys can kind of
decide who did a better job at sticking
to their theme cool every eyes like a
really cool thing that's it yeah okay so
you wanna go first yes
so my theme was all about the beginning
creators so people at the early stages
of their creative careers you know if
you wanna be a youtuber as you want to
be an Instagram where people do some
really cool things with Instagram these
days so my thought is that you would be
capturing most of your content with your
phone and to go with that would be a
tripod or a selfie clip which is a
tripod and selfie stick I know selfie
sticks are like super good like realize
but it's helpful like we can't deny the
fact that is helpful if you are a
one-man team not everybody's fancy like
you joke with all these people here and
then to go with that since you are
capturing content with your phone we got
a shotgun mic that goes right into your
phone so it's by Road and I know this
because Jeff has featured these before
and he like has talked about the good
quality and that was a rode videomic but
they had lightning in 3.5 millimeter and
I feel like this kind of you know would
be more useful for more people the
reason why this works because you can
also capture content on drumroll nothing
came to the drum roll but on an iPad how
much is this how much you spent on this
one isn't used yes okay so I made a work
for your boy yeah took advantage of the
use department so I think was $501
really it was I've had pros five hundred
and seven dollars so it's an iPad pro 64
gig it's 2018 and Wi-Fi so you can you
can cop to capture some content like you
can undo your audio whatever you can do
that from there anyway I got it mainly
for your video editing so you can be
able to video edit on this you record
audio with this and you can set up your
camera on a tripod or do it selfie style
and then to make it easier to edit and
stuff I got this so it's a keyboard and
holder for the iPad yeah and a lot of
people I've been doing really cool
stuffs like using loom before even
iMovie for at the beginning stages of
your career you know this is good to use
and then again if you're going to be
using your phone to capture most of your
content your charger right so like if
you it's gonna be you're gonna be
burning through your battery and this is
a 10,000 milliamp hour quick charger
from Ankur I also got just a little bag
to keep everything all together the
broom print I mean I just discovered
them today and interrupting my little
Freddy here with a Fenian dice so you
also have the bag we can put in all the
stuff seek with you okay so you have
your cover here and then you can add all
the rest of these things to go on your
back and then when you're editing I for
one like to have a lot of a lot of focus
while editing so you have a pair of
headphones at B&amp;amp;H the guy recommended
these these are really good studio
headphones 80 bucks by Sony the monitor
yeah these are exact yeah he said like
you'll never go into studio not find
these like illegitimate and as my very
last item because you'll be doing all
your editing on your iPad what's your
little thing is expandable storage so
it's 64 gigs and this one works
specifically for iPad iPhone so you can
be able to a chance for yourself between
64 gigs I have an additional 64 hmm and
so I think as a complete package of
you're someone just starting I think
this is really good because even you can
use an iPad for more than just video
editor you can use
or your know your media consumption
everything I think it's a really nice
package for someone just starting out
alright alright guys I'm sure you guys
all brand-new stuff alright alright well
for me my theme you guys know me I like
to be prepared for every situation and
so that's pretty much how I seemed my
haul here this is a really really nice
backpack
I was actually extremely surprised when
I came across it lots of compartments
lots of storage lots of space to hold
things and because we're gonna be
carrying around so many different things
I forget this would be perfect to have
around just so that you can take
everything with you on the go alright
shaking with the big guns right now so I
got me a laptop a full-blown laptop from
Lenovo
it has an MD rise in 3 2200 2.5
gigahertz eight gigs of ram 128 gigs of
solid-state storage and it's only 450
bucks look at that this thing is metal
chassis this is must be Lois green it is
absolutely metal look at the ports has
an HDMI USB it even has USB C as well as
a headphone jack another USB C and
another micro SD card all these animal
SD cards on this side now of course
since this has a USB C port I figured
why not get a dongle here so if you want
to add more USB ports you can do that it
has a micro SD card slot as well as a
regular SD card HDMI so you can have
multiple monitors hooked up to this guy
we also went for a 2 terabyte storage
yeah I can't work with iPads right
exactly
the iPad limiting but you got yourself a
2 terabyte hard drive over here from
Western Digital so you get even more
storage on this guy even though it has a
solid-state I had some more storage over
here alright so right here we've got the
logitech g502
hero edition so you got one of the best
mice out there all right so we got a
portable charger here it also has
wireless charging built into it so you
don't need to walk around with a cable
so we have that we also got this really
cool accessory called the Grippit pad so
if you happen to have one of these
wireless charging portable chargers or
even your solids or your hard drive
what's it what's cool about this is that
you can attach it to it and when you
place it on the desk it's not good you
don't have to worry about it sliding off
maybe somebody bumps into it or
something this thing is gonna grip onto
it so that it doesn't move around keeps
their stuff nice and safe I also got a
little lightning cable here from vent
--iv this one is actually really durable
figured why not you want to make sure
you have everything you need with you
that's that whole idea here had to be
able to get some music listening in as
well so we got JBL's free earbuds so
these are truly wireless earbuds over
here now what I like about these is that
they're not just like the weird designs
you can fit nicely inside of your ear so
it's gonna be very comfortable you get
truly wireless and music and we even got
this right here this is a shutter add-on
for your smartphone so this is really
cool because you just add it onto your
smartphone and you can press this button
to capture your content it's actually
really nice if you want to take selfies
because it makes it so much easier to
just hold on to it look like this move
around with it talk whatever do what you
got to do I think I think that's it so I
think people will walk walk rather walk
away with this than what you got going
on over that wasn't the the challenge a
challenge was to have some that was
creative ideas a creative theme with
great execution let us know what you
guys think is it team Judd or tu AC or
team re
this is an easy one I was worried but
for no reason what do you guys think let
us know what total next video guys B&amp;amp;H
thank you for letting us use your store
to find all of these goodies and for
sponsoring today's video it's so much
fun let's all just like run around I
couldn't even see the whole story yeah
we needed to be long there but total
next video guys hopefully you enjoy it
if you did be the cool guys nose I guess
if your dog comes up I'll catch you guys
in the next one so then it's our average
consumer please oh I worried</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
