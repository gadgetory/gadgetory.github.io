consumer this is my fiance Ari and
obviously we're not in our living room
right now
we actually got invited by Comcast to
view x1 from Xfinity which is super
exciting so I've done my research I
doesn't quite know much about it so I
decided I'd show you guys what it's all
about so let's not waste any time let's
get right into it so this is the x1 box
it's a pretty standard looking box but
where all the magic happens is with this
guy it's got a ton of cool features now
one of my favorite things and it's gonna
be yours to voice commands nice so you
can call out whatever you want and it
should pop up I'll check this out anime
safe oh c'mon awesome alright I could
live here this is this is everything for
me yeah I think they have like the new
Pokemon CX Y like that then free up so
ya know what's crazy is I wouldn't even
know where to go to find anime on normal
television just like that right yeah so
having it all right here perfect so I
can just search anything yeah look up
your favorite actor/actress whatever you
want all right don't get mad at me now
Morris Chestnut really yes by Oh awesome
and you can even see all the other
things that he shows up in other movies
that he's played in so now one thing
that he might like is if you go into the
guide you've got your standard grid of
shows and channels that you can watch
but if you get the Xfinity button you
can go on demand and this is something
we're familiar with so we can see all
the shows that we like recently recent
TV shows
Sunday night Saturday night it's Friday
to go Thursday so I'm gonna stop you at
the Thursday one because you guys know
the Thursday night lineup is on point
we got blacklist and scandal right there
this is probably where we'd stay and
watch a ton of shows oh yeah it's
comprehensive that is awesome
well I must go to skin let's see what
happens okay so they have a nice little
summary you can watch the episodes oh
you can go in to actually see the cast
list yeah and then you can actually
actually click on click on that guy the
guy we just passed Huck yeah so you can
actually see all the shows that he's
appeared and you got a bio over there
and you can see what other shows he's
played in right for many days and weeds
yeah but if we go back to scandal
because you like this show so much you
can actually go over to the right
favorite it and then you can access it
whenever you want right from the menu so
you can actually go into the save
section and then you have the for you
and you can see shows that you've
recorded so obviously this is what thing
that you want to watch later recently
watched favorite channels you know I
have to add cards mommy okay what can I
say and you can even see the top 100
shows that's yeah you know that you have
saved so you've got access to a ton of
different content all from this menu
that's really cool
smells like just personalized for you
yeah so you've got your TV shows but you
can actually go to the on-demand section
move over to movies and see a ton of
different stuff here as well you got
your featured most popular so you've got
a lot of content you got the big cover
art let's you know what's playing
Jurassic world we haven't seen naked on
that I need to watch this known as you
like this for we always take forever to
find a show when we're trying to like e
ready but then we take forever funny
movies so this is gonna this should help
a lot and what also helps is that you
know you can see the recommendations
right at the bottom that's like the
Rotten Tomatoes
yeah you've got Rotten Tomatoes and you
got critic ratings so it gets to go with
that and you can actually see what's
trending which is a really awesome
DoubleTap the Guide button and then you
kind of get this filtered list of you
know different things you want to see
so keep the HD favorites but we're
looking for trending so we'll go with
that
it was gonna be like in the know so
right now you can see what's trending on
Xfinity so things that people are
watching the most right now and you see
was trending on Twitter
that's Hussein they search hashtags
so if everyone's talking about a certain
show you're like what is this show that
everyone's talking about you jump right
here and figure it out so this is pretty
cool now it wouldn't be New Tech without
some apps naturally so you've got a
couple here you've got photos sports
vivid traffic that's cool yeah
horoscopes Pandora so you got a couple
of stuff here now one thing I like about
the sports is that you can access this
and still watch something at the same
time nice so if you got your scandal on
yeah I can still see the score on the
Cavaliers game so that's gonna be pretty
cool so boom that's the x1 from Xfinity
how do you like it I like it a lot it's
really cool yeah there's a lot of cool
features definitely some awesome stuff
here yeah whatever you like about it is
that if you don't have a smart TV you
don't have to like rush to upgrade if
you get one of these you have some of
the same features yeah definitely good
stuff but that's about it guys hopefully
you enjoyed it if you did give it a
thumbs up and leave a comment down below
what you think of the features and we'll
catch you in the next one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
