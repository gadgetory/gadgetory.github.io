going on guys Travers consumer and today
we've got another backpack video this is
one of the harder' backpack series that
I do this is the minimalist setup you
guys know I'd love to carry around some
text so a minimalist setup is usually
pretty hard but we got a really cool
backpack and gear inside of here but
first off just talking about the
backpack itself this is the in case
staple backpack this is a 15-inch laptop
backpack you can hold a 15-inch laptop
it's got a few compartments not a ton
you guys know I like to have a ton of
compartments for all the tech but this
one is like super slim it's got a pretty
low profile you guys can see how slim it
is not too much gear inside of here
and it's comfortable so I just throw it
on like this
you guys have it nice simple backpack
but let's take a look at what's inside
of it I like the two-tone look too I
think it gives it a little edge in
comparison to other plain black
backpacks that I typically have but
let's open this up actually we've got a
compartment in the very front so inside
of here I've got a Mophie case or a
power case and this is for a pair of
earbuds so inside of here I can just
open this up and I've got a pair of
Bluetooth earbuds these right here are a
pair of Sony earbuds they've got a crazy
model number what is it
the WI 6p 600 N either way these are a
pair of bluetooth earbuds that are
actually great for working out because
they're sweat proof their IP 4 resistant
so sweat you don't have to worry about
that
but what's nice about these is that
they've also got active noise-cancelling
built right into it sound quality is
actually pretty good on these these are
from the extra bass line and you guys
know me I love me some bass so be sound
really nice but only thing I would have
to say as a complaint of mine is the
fact that it has this big remote on the
side so when you're actually using it
and you put it on you got this giant
remote dangling right here now it does
come with wing tips so that'll help with
securing to fit in your ears but still I
do wish it was a little bit smaller but
it only cost about 80 bucks
so that is a really good price for some
pretty solid here but
especially if you don't have to worry
about sweat and for this backpack I like
for my things to have multiple purposes
so that I don't have to carry around too
many things and this one having active
noise-cancelling even if you don't want
to listen to music you just want to
block out your surroundings you can
actually do that even without listening
to music that way you just focus on
whatever it is you're doing it also has
an ambient noise feature so if you do
want to hear things around you you can
activate that and you can switch all of
those up with the Sony companion app you
get a lot of control there so these for
me are a really nice buy now
they were sitting inside of this multi
power case and what's nice about this
case is it will protect your ear buds of
course but it also has a portable
charger built right into it so that you
can charge these up when you're not
using them and that's what we've got in
the first compartment nothing else over
there and that's honestly like it's one
of the only compartments in this
backpack I think there's like a total of
three but into the next big pouch I of
course I got to have a notebook guys I'm
pretty old-school guys if I want to take
down some notes really quickly I can
just pull this out and maybe jot down
some ideas and I don't have to worry
about draining my battery when I do it
good old pen and paper I do have some
pens and pencils in here to go along
with it stuff that I typically carry
around every backpack that I have so of
course those are here as well now we're
gonna do things a little bit differently
this time guys usually I like to show
the laptop last but a lot of these
things that are inside of here worked
really well with it and I want to be
able to explain it with some contacts so
right here we've got the laptop guys
this is the world's thinnest laptop the
Acer Swift 7 first of all just check
this out
this is absolutely insane this it's like
holding a tablet guys it's nuts but this
is a really awesome computer and what's
nice is that even though this is a super
thin portable laptop it's not like some
tablet or anything
it's full-blown Windows with everyday
software powered by an Intel Core i7
processor to get just about anything
done now not only is this the thinnest
laptop out there but this also has some
really cool features that make taking
this on-the-go just amazing but let's
talk about the i/o for a second so on
the left side we have two USB sea ports
as well as a headphone jack and on the
right side you've got your power and a
nano-sim car
a lot not only is it super thin but what
makes it extra portable is the fact that
this thing can work with 4G LTE and
we're able to get that LTE connection
thanks to intel's built-in modem inside
of this guy so you haven't always
connected pc I think that is a game
changer guys can you imagine a laptop
that doesn't need Wi-Fi or need to get
on public Wi-Fi or use a hotspot from
your phone draining your battery you
don't have to worry about any of that
this thing has its own cellular
connection which i think just it's
amazing and the latest Intel modems are
available with pcs that have Intel
seventh generation or if generation
processors in a minimalist backpack I
feel like this laptop just works out
perfectly super portable lightweight and
I can just pretty much do whatever I
need to in terms of getting work done
and personally I think being able to
access the internet wherever I am is a
clutch feature so if I need to run and
upload a video right after a keynote or
something this thing is going to be able
to help me do that without having to run
to a hotel or some coffee shop or
something and use really bad Wi-Fi real
quick let's talk about the body of this
laptop
it's obviously super thin I have a 14
inch display with very very little
bezels except for the bottom chin but
what's also nice is that it has a 1080p
touchscreen which is actually one of the
best screens that I've seen in the while
this is a really really good-looking
screen not super high res but it
definitely does the job and what's also
nice is that it even has a built-in
fingerprint scanner right here on the
left side so with this guy you can login
to Windows by just putting your finger
on it you get right in so that right
there is also a really nice bonus and if
you guys want to get your hands on a
laptop that's always connected like this
one you can run into any tech store and
just ask whoever's helping you for a PC
with Intel's 4G LTE connection and they
should be able to help you out now that
you guys have seen this let's take a
look at what else we've got inside of
the backpack
now the laptop has a 256 gig SSD inside
of it but right here I've got an
external SSD and this is the Samsung x5
now with the x5 you get insane insane
read and write speeds and also uses
Thunderbolt 3 so if you haven't done the
ball through compatible device this
thing is going to be the fastest SSD
that you can get externally there's
here is the two terabyte version so if I
need to put any videos or any kind of
work on here this thing is going to be
able to hold on to it no problem and
like I said it works perfectly with this
since this has USB type-c I don't have
to worry about any adapters or plugs
just use the cable plug it right in I
got access to 2 terabytes of storage and
this nice compact body now listen we
need to use something that isn't USB
type-c I've got right here of course a
dongle this one is by Satechi
and this is probably my favorite USB
type-c donghwa out there because this
thing has a ton of functionality so we
get access to an SD card slot a micro SD
card slot another USB type-c port as
well as two USB 3.0 ports on the other
side a mini DisplayPort and an HDMI port
and on this last panel you also get
another USB 2.0 port as well as an
Ethernet port definitely not something I
need with this laptop over here since
I'm always connected with the LTE
connection but if you ever need that
this is probably the best dongle that
you can get out there for any PC that
uses a USB type C or Thunderbolt ports
now of course we've got a laptop over
there so we also need a mouse and I feel
like it's kind of a cop-out since this
is like one of the most popular Mouse's
out there but it just works so well this
is the Logitech MX master 2 a great
mouse super comfortable to use and if
you were to carry multiple devices this
thing can switch between them with the
press of a button you can pair up to
three devices with this so this is a
really nice Mouse and it's a no-brainer
why so many people use it now we've also
got a couple of other things that are
just essentials so right here we have a
power brick for charging up my laptop
and anything else that I may bring
around with me
this is anchors power port Plus this has
five USB ports for normal USB type 8
ports and a USB C PD which is power
delivery port which can provide a little
bit more juice so I can use it to charge
my laptop or maybe fast charge some
devices with USB type-c and of course I
got the power cable to go along with it
but having something like this means you
can charge up anything from the mouse
laptop earbuds whatever it may be
to charge it all up with this guy this
is a clutch thing to have I've also got
one of nomads
rugged USB cables now the one I have
here has USB type-c on both end
but if I need to use a regular USB port
I can actually throw this extension onto
it so it works with USB type a and it
also has a micro USB adapter as well
since I'm only using USB type-c and
micro USB is here this thing is perfect
for this little backpack setup and Nomad
makes some really awesome cables they're
a bit pricey but the quality that you
get out of them it's just a 1 and you
thought I forgot but I did it
got a microfiber cloth here it is an
absolute must
there's no way walk around without a
microfiber cloth you got to keep your
stuff clean keep your screen clean on
your phone
yeah nice touchscreen laptop you got to
have it guys
you know me and that's pretty much it
for the backpack but there's just one
more compartment which I'm very happy
about give me 3 compartments and I think
I can survive but this one back here
this is like more of a security
compartment so if you want to hide
something important you can throw it
back here but for me I just doing a
portable charger this one is actually a
pretty large one this is by nimble they
make some really great portable chargers
this one is actually 20 6800 milliamp
hours I believe that's got that right
but this one allows you to charge with
USB type-c and three regular USB ports
but this has USB type-c PD so power
delivery means I'm going to be able to
even charge my laptop with this guy but
the laptop does have solid battery life
so you probably won't need it but it's
nice to have just in case this is a lot
of juice to carry around with you and
having the power to charge your laptop
right from a portable charger that is
super clutch and if 26,000 milliamp
hours is too much for you they got the
smaller ones as well these are just
really really well-built solid portable
chargers so I definitely like to carry
this one around and that pretty much is
it guys these are all of the things that
I'm including in this minimalist
backpack definitely very different from
what I typically do a lot less things
here just the essentials for getting
work done listening to some music and
being productive but that pretty much
wraps up for this video guys hopefully
you enjoyed it if you would do anything
differently let me know if a comment
down below if you liked it definitely
hit that thumbs up button and I'll catch
you guys in the next one
till then is your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
