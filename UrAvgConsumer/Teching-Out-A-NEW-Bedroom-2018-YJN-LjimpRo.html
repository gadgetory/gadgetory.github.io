ravage consumer and today we are back in
Brooklyn because we're going to be
checking out an entirely new bedroom now
the reason why we chose this location is
because it is a bit dated it isn't quite
as modern as some of the rooms that you
guys have seen on the channel so far and
we figure not a lot of people have
really modern rooms anyway so we figured
this could be a great way to show you
guys some awesome tips but of course
first we have to the owner of the space
Eric's cousin Michael know that we were
gonna be doing this and give him a heads
up and he's a hard-working guy with two
kids and him as his wife share the space
with the kids so we figured we'd make it
a nice getaway even after he gets out of
work and after a solid day's work moving
a few things around and adding a few
lights this is the end result so the
first thing we had to do was upgrade
their TV to something in the 65-inch
realm so we hooked them up with this
Hisense h9 + 4k u LED TV and shout out
to Hisense for sponsoring today's video
and making this whole idea come together
with this TV they'll be able to watch 4k
HDR content thanks to the wide color
gamut it offers and it supports 4k
upscaling for regular HD content and of
course it's a smart TV with access to
apps from a ton of streaming services
and even the remote has dedicated
buttons for apps so when he needs to
throw in my videos that YouTube button
is right there and this TV actually has
a 120 Hertz panel with ultra smooth
motion 480 so watching sports will be
great as well as gaming and this is
actually a pretty great TV if you're
looking for something with all the
latest features on a TV without breaking
the
bang and if you want to check it out I
have links down below to it and
everything else mentioned in this video
down below near description and we've
got the TV mounted onto this TV stand we
found in Walmart it provides a built-in
stand to mount the TV as well as three
shelves to place things like your
consoles cable box and I actually like
this stand a lot more than I thought I
would when I first picked it up because
it made hiding the cables a cinch and it
felt pretty durable as for what we
packed on the stand Michaels pretty big
on Xbox so we had to upgrade his
original Xbox one to the Xbox one s and
we even added a power a charging stand
so he could charge his controller once
he's done playing and have a nice place
to put it and he also needed a pretty
good gaming headset to play with his
xbox so we got him the HyperX cloud x
tons of comfort great sound and a great
price made this an easy choice and since
he hasn't cut the cord yet he still guys
cable box appear as well but in front of
that we've got this uncle dolby atmos
sound bar I'm gonna be real with you
guys I wanted this because it seemed
like a nice entry-level sound bar with
Dolby Atmos which is a great feature but
after going through the setup process
and actually trying to use it I honestly
don't recommend it it was pretty
confusing and I just didn't like the
whole process so we do plan to swap this
one out but I'll include some options
that I personally enjoyed down below in
the description and it wouldn't be
enough to just upgrade the TV area so we
had to make this place smart with a
Google home to control all the various
lights that we added to the room as well
as answer any of their questions or
music requests and if you guys are
wondering what lights we went with these
are all from lifx
we use their bulbs in these Walmart
lamps that we got on the sides of the TV
and the side table lamps near the bed
the lamps can now change color at a whim
and they're completely controllable with
Google home to voice commands which is
something I really wanted them onboard
with and to help with a decorative look
of the lamps we also added small fake
plants and salt rock lamps as they're
actually very good looking as well as
functional to help those who suffer from
asthma symptoms which one of the babies
has and the side tables also have these
sleep therapy speakers by iHome that
plays white noise or relaxing sound
while having an array of lighting
options and even functions as a
Bluetooth speaker but back to the TV
stand we've got one last thing and
to Google Wi-Fi router which is actually
really useful in apartments like these
that tend to have thick walls we also
added this small desk from Ikea for a
dedicated workspace because as a techie
you know I gotta have a desk in there
somewhere but we threw in a laptop on
top of this small laptop stand to give
us some extra height and since this is
an area for work we even got the kids
this leapfrog ultimate pad which is
great for learning and is built to
withstand drops and damage that he knows
gonna happen and we even added a nest
outdoor camera and mounted it onto his
wall so it could act as a baby monitor
so whenever they're out the room they
can check on the crib and see what's
going on right from their smartphone and
to add a bits of the aesthetics we of
course have to throw in a light strip in
the back and we even added the digital
picture frame which was actually his
wife's favorite piece of tech in the
entire apartment earn all the lights
purple although we think it came
together pretty well and the family
seems stoked about the changes hopefully
you guys enjoyed the video and got some
good ideas on how to check out your own
space and make it work for you and if
you enjoyed it be the cool guy or girl
that gives this video a thumbs up and
I'll catch you in the next one
so then it's your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
