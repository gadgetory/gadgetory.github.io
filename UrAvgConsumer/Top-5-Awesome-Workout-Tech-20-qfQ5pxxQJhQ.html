and it's officially 2017 and with every
new year comes resolutions about getting
fit or healthy and we've got some cool
tech to help out with that but first I
got to let you guys know that since it's
January CES 2017 is right around the
corner and I'm actually going to be
there from the 5th to the 8th and I'm
gonna be working with whirlpool and
checking out some of their cool home and
lifestyle tech so if you guys are out
there be sure to come to the booth say
what's up to me but if you can't make it
out there you guys can always follow me
over on Twitter I'll have links down
below in the description so you guys can
see what we're up to but now to kick off
this list we've got the Moy kick cup
time - that's a terrible name now one of
the biggest things you could do to
improve your health is up your water
intake and this guy helps you to do that
it's a rechargeable smart cup that has
an LED screen which shows you your water
intake for the day and remind you with a
beat or vibration when you need to drink
more to meet your water intake goal and
what's great is that it has an app that
displays different data regarding your
goals and your water drinking habits and
if you already have a Fitbit or jawbone
you can sync up all the data together
and have it all in one place and if you
don't that brings us to number two on
this list
the Fitbit zip now the Fitbit zip isn't
your typical fitness tracker I think it
goes for about 50 bucks on Amazon and
has actually got a clip-on design but it
does have an LCD screen that displays
vital information like steps distance
calories burned and even the time but
it's a lot more discreet you can clip it
onto your pants or under your shirt if
you don't want the whole world to know
about your new resolution and if you
work a more professional job in fitness
bands just don't match your attire this
will solve that problem all in all it's
inexpensive and it's perfect for those
of us who aren't hardcore athletes and
want to track the basics in a very
discreet way one of my favorite ways of
getting in cardio back in the day was
actually jumping rope and when I saw the
smart rope at Best Buy
I had to snatch it up the smart rope is
a jump rope with sensors that tracks
your jump count and their calories
burned but the biggest highlight with
this jump rope is the fact that there is
23 LEDs embedded into the rope itself so
as you jump your jump count is displayed
right in
of you and it's pretty amazing and of
course there's an app that the smart
rope syncs with that allows you to track
your progress the rope comes in three
different colors mine is black but
there's also chrome and gold
there's even five different sizes for
those who range from four five all the
way to six eight it's also super
portable and comes with the case so you
can take your jump rope with you
wherever you go using a jump rope is a
great workout and it's even better with
a little tech involved next up are the
LG tone actives which are retractable in
your buds that are designed to keep your
workouts as interruption free as
possible their sweat and rain resistant
so if you happen to sweat profusely oh
you're not gonna damage these and that
makes working out in the rain also not a
problem and it's got that around the
neck design which I was never too crazy
about before but working out is the
absolute best place for it and since
these are Bluetooth earbuds they've got
a play and pause button as well as track
control so you can control your music
and even a call button and mic so you
can answer some calls with these you
don't have to worry about a dangling
inline remote or having to stop your
workout to reach your phone and of
course this wouldn't make the list if it
didn't sound good so I think that
anybody who gets their hands on these is
really gonna like it as a workout buddy
and fits on the list is an app called
packed packed is an app that helps you
stick to your goals using one of the
biggest motivators out there money you
weighed your money on whether you'll go
to the gym or complete a workout and the
app checks if you hit your goal by
making sure you check into the spots you
want to go to for your workout if you
don't then you've got to pay up whatever
amount you wagered but if you do then
you can actually earn some money I know
I hate losing money so that'd be a huge
motivator for me especially considering
most people drop off their resolutions
around March and April
so those slackers I'll have to pay up
now that about wraps it up for this list
guys hopefully you enjoyed it good luck
with sticking to those resolutions I'll
catch you guys in the next one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
