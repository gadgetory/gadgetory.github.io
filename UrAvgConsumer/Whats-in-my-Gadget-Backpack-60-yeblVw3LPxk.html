consumer and today we finally have this
year's what's in my gadget backpack
video this is 6.0 it's been six years
almost this is insane and this action
this backpacks from Swiss I got it from
Best Buy I just randomly picked it up I
was having a really hard time finding a
replacement for that incase backpack
that I featured last year that was a
really good backpack but this is this
year's and we're gonna just jump right
into this so up top we've got a zipper
right on top with this flap and in here
we've got some ear buds you guys know I
like to travel with some and we've
actually got two of them so this very
first one these are the shore se215
these are one of my favorite in ear buds
I find them to be very comfortable
this color is dope you can actually
replace the cable if you like you can
get one with an inline remote all that
good stuff but I absolutely love these
and I've been using it for years and our
next pair of ear buds are actually
inside of this multi power capsule case
now you guys have been seeing me talk
about this case for a few different
videos and now if you have a pair of
bluetooth earbuds these have a power
bank that can charge them while they're
inside of here so that's why I have it
and inside we've got a pair of beats X
and they're currently plugged in but
they've been charging inside of here now
I actually really like the beats X
they've got some pretty good sound
they've got that neck band that I like
so it's really easy to stow these in and
not worry about the ear buds falling out
and one of my biggest reasons for having
this is the inclusion of DW one chip I
have a few Apple devices inside of this
backpack so I'm able to switch between
them without having to pair them all
over again this just makes life a lot
easier with good sound and they're very
comfortable but as for this Mophie case
like i said in two other videos it's
definitely worth it it's only like 40
bucks if you got Bluetooth earbuds
you want to pick this up and I've got
the two different earbuds one I like to
use bluetooth primarily but for any of
the devices that don't have bluetooth I
have a wired option as well
oh yeah this is yeah I mean this is what
I do people listen everyone's gonna say
in this video that everything is
overkill you don't need this you don't
need that listen I like to have options
baby didn't say in it for years so
that's what's inside of this little flap
here so I can open this up and you get
access to the other compartments so
we'll start off with the very first one
I'm actually pretty surprised that Swiss
made a bag like this this is a pretty
nice bag it's got a lot of compartments
so it's definitely good for techies so
the first thing you'll probably see are
all the various pens and pencils that I
like to carry around with me apology to
skirt toga pencils right inside of this
pouch I've got a portable charger but
this one's a little different so this is
the Nomad power tile I believe it's
called no it's called a power pack so
this is a 10,000 milliamp hour battery
but with the tile feature built into it
in case I misplaced this backpack or I
just don't know where I put it I can
actually make this portable charger ring
with my phone or actually just locate it
with my phone but in terms of ports you
got a regular USB port as well as a USB
type-c port so it'll support any phone
that you need to charge now over here
we've also got some headphone jack
adapters this is the Apple version and
this is a USB type-c version from the
razor phone this has a dock I believe in
it so I use I like to carry this one
around but that's in case I can't use my
bluetooth headphones and I want to use a
regular headphone gotta have adapters
that's a sad thing but you gotta be
prepared and right over here we have
this thing called the eye roller this
does a really good job of cleaning up
devices you really just roll it on the
screen back and forth a few times and
you've got a completely clean screen I
think this is awesome I was shocked at
how good it was and I definitely say it
can replace a microfiber cloth but I
ain't no traitor so I keep a microfiber
cloth on me anyway spuds microfiber
cloths these things are amazing I keep
it on this little red hook here but
that's an eye rollers dope but you got
to have a microfiber cloth just do both
now inside of this larger compartment I
have a few things for my laptop and they
usually have to do with data and
transferring things so let's start off
with this
got this anchor 4 port USB hub this
thing has 4 3.0 USB ports so in case I
need more ports usually with a lot of
these new laptops you will so I got this
guy here and I've also got this Belkin
Thunderbolt 3 cable it's usually hard to
find a Thunderbolt 3 cable that you know
works for data and all that so this is
one from Belkin it's legit it's got a
pretty decent length and I actually use
this with this guy over here this is the
samsung t5 hard drive this is 2
terabytes folks 2 terabytes in this tiny
tiny body it's got pretty good data
speeds I can do editing right off of
this if I need to transfer a bunch of
files or maybe keep some projects on
here this is definitely my solution and
next up let's see we've got this hyper
drive for the MacBook Pro now a lot of
you guys know I use the MacBook Pro to
do all of my work for the YouTube
channel so a lot of editing and stuff
happens on it and it's missing ports
like we all know it's missing a bunch of
ports so this is a hyper drive hub that
provides a ton of different ports you
got two USB 3.0 ports an SD card slot a
micro SD card slot you also get two USB
type-c ports and I believe one of them
is Thunderball and you also get an HDMI
port right at the very top it gives you
everything you need for your mac books
and I think the last thing we've got
inside of here is this loop world
adapter plug now this has a ton of
different ports so if I'm traveling
outside the US I like to have this on me
so I am NOT as so well when I'm out
there so this thing pretty much gives me
pure confidence that I'm gonna be able
to charge up my stuff it also has two
USB ports now obviously I'm not using
this all the time but I like to keep it
in the backpack just so I don't have to
remember to pack it now let's go to this
main compartment and this is where we
have a ton of stuff this is where the
parties act so first off we've cut an
Xbox controller this is for the Xbox one
of course yeah yeah because I do some
gaming now in one of my laptop so this
is what I take with me this is a
customized version using their design
labs and this is the one I've got inside
of here right now I've got a ton of
different options in terms of
controllers but I like the way this
looks obviously because I made it
so this is what I'll be carrying with me
whenever I want to play with money
laptop in alright and over here up front
we've got the tech survival kit you guys
you guys gotta have the tech survival
kit if you haven't seen that video which
it should have I'll have a link down
below in the description but this is in
case of a tech emergency let's say I
forget to pack one of the essential
things of this backpack
I'll have it inside of here for sure I
don't have to worry too much I think I
should do an updated version what do you
guys think let me know whatever comment
down below if you'd like to see that and
behind that we've got my headphones of
choice you got I'll give you guys a
second to make a guess pause the video
make a guess in the comments section
it's Eric do you know this is Sony what
oh hopefully you guys got it before she
did these are the sony MDR xb 950 and
ones get it together re so these are
amazing bluetooth headphones it has
noise canceling features now which you
can actually control you can actually
control the bass inside of here as well
so if you want to bring the bass down
depending on what you're listening to
you can do that but uh these honestly I
can recommend this without batting an
eyelash great comfort great sound tons
of features that you can get with the
app this is just a really safe buy for
the money so listen if there's anything
you're gonna buy out of this backpack
let it be DS and that's for the travel
case this isn't the travel case that
comes with it
it does come with a travel case though
so you'll at least be protected there
we've been looking at this guy for quite
a bit this is my Nintendo switch inside
of a travel case I forget the exact name
of it I don't think it's a deluxe travel
case but I'll of course have a link down
below anyway and inside of it we've got
my baby my customized Nintendo switch
the guys over at kala we're actually
made this as you can see it's got the
UAC colors that teal white and black so
this thing looks awesome I absolutely
love the Nintendo switch this is a must
if there's anything that I would need to
carry inside of here is at least this
right now so
man listen this is my baby right here
but come over I did an awesome job with
the Nintendo did an awesome job with
this this is just honestly one of my
favorite things of the year so we've got
the switch here and of course of course
of course I got them hands so we've got
our switch and this is the Nintendo 3ds
XL this is the same one that I've been
rocking for quite some time now this is
the Pokemon Sun and Moon Edition with so
Leo and Luna
nothing too special here you guys have
seen me talk about this one quite a bit
I've got all of my games inside of this
case as well so same stuff pretty much
and of course we gotta finish the
trifecta with the PlayStation Vita which
I still love I still got some games on
here that I need to finish but just so
you guys can see it this is the white
version this is imported from Japan and
this is a pretty good case for it - I've
got my games inside of here cables all
that stuff and of course right here
you've actually got my iPad pro you guys
know I love my iPad pro this is the 12
inch model and it's in one of those
leather sleeves that actually holds the
Apple pencil as well so I'm pretty much
just using this nice big screen to watch
some of my favorite shows without having
to use something like my laptop to enjoy
it
and over here inside of this little case
I've got a little tool set this is the
Jacana me I think right is that what
it's called I think we try to figure out
how it was what it was called last time
either way it's a joke Emmy I'm calling
it that dikembe tool set that actually
has quite a few options here with this
little screwdriver I can switch between
all of these now personally as a techie
I just like having this here in case
something breaks down I can probably
take it apart and see if I can fix it so
I think this is like a must and next up
I've got about two more things inside of
this compartment I'm gonna lay this down
now but over here I actually have a
Harman Kardon bluetooth speaker but this
one I really really like because it's
super compact you guys can see how flat
it is is pretty much the same as
carrying a portable charger and funny
enough it actually has a built-in
portable charger feature so if I want to
charge one of my phones or anything like
that I can do that here
but this has great audio quality a great
size and overall I just really like
bringing it with me and even though
we've got a portable charger here and a
portable charger in this bluetooth
speaker you know I had to have a serious
more legit portable charger hanging the
backpack baby so this right here is the
Omni charge 20 and this is hands-down my
favorite portable charger ever this
thing is just a beast it's got two USB
ports of course as well as a wall outlet
right inside of the portable charger so
if I need to charge up my laptop or
anything like that I can do that with
this with no problem it also has an OLED
screen here giving me all kinds of
information about how hot the portable
charger is if it's done charging
something like the laptop how much juice
I've got left how long it's gonna finish
taking to charge it this is the best
part of a charge that you can possibly
get it even has wireless charging built
into it so if I throw something like the
iPhone on top of here it'll wirelessly
charge it so all the features you could
possibly want in a portable charger
right inside of this guy and while you
can use this little wall outlet to
charge pretty much anything it also
comes with a ton of accessories to
natively charge things like MacBooks
surface books or surface laptops doesn't
come with this pouch though this is like
from Sennheiser or something now for
some of the big boys in here we of
course have my macbook pro and this is
one thing I like about this backpack it
has some components for multiple laptops
this is where I do all of my final cut
editing this is pretty much my main work
machine and I've also got one of my new
favorites
now the backpack has to go down here
because this table is pretty full but
this is the surface book too now I I
love this laptop not only is an awesome
laptop it has a 15 inch display but it's
also got an NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics
card inside of here so I can do some
light gaming I actually I could do some
pretty hardcore gaming with high
settings with this with no problem
honestly I just love this
love this for creative use as well I've
been using this to edit photos and
things like that and that's what I'm
using with this Xbox one controller
since this is a surface book I can pair
it up no problem I don't need that
little wireless adapter so this is what
I've been using guys and I love this
laptop and inside of this compartment
there's also another little spot with
the laptops I have this surface arc
mouse this is one of the newest ones so
it's got the little touch panel on the
top and it can go from being super flat
to being bent like this and this turns
it on and you can just start using it
however you want and packing this thing
has been great because it's so flat it
doesn't take up any space but I also
have a more legitimate Mouse for
whenever I'm using my macbook to do some
editing and that is of course my
Logitech g600 2 I've been using this for
years this is the one I gravitate
towards all the time because it's just
super comfortable it's wireless
it has macro buttons that I can
customize it's a great Mouse and there's
actually a case that's made for it so if
you want to pick this up I have a link
to and last but not least this is just
one little accessory since I like to
travel with this backpack I have this
portable dock for the Nintendo switch so
this is the dock that I like to take
with me the one that it comes with is
just too big to put in the backpack and
I've also got a Belkin HDMI cable this
is a legit one so it does like 4k and
all that good stuff but they're all it's
just a nice HDMI cable but this is
everything guys it is yeah everything
absolutely has a purpose here without
about wraps it up guys this is an
awesome backpack it's not wait a minute
there's something else inside of here oh
there's more stuff inside of here
alright I'm not gonna go crazy into
detail with this but I've got a bunch of
Nomad cables this is the cable that I
use with all of my portable chargers
this is a lightning cable that has a
built-in portable charger in it and this
one can change from a micro USB to
lightning to USB type-c it's a little
pricey but their quality stuff and worth
it but that's it no more we're done I
think I have some tape some chargers for
like laptops and stuff
and I think a fast charger for the
iPhone which is better than the one that
Apple sells since it has an extra port
and it's cheaper alright but that's it
uh-huh this is the gadget backpack 6.0
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if
you did be the cool guy or girl you know
give it a thumbs up and definitely
subscribe if you want to see more videos
like this but so the next one guys is
Traverse consumer peace now I gotta pack
this all up before we go home that's
going to be a lot of fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
