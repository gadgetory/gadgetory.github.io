headphones for this one so right now you
probably hear me in your left ear and
now in your right ear cool right well I
got that audio using the Sennheiser AM
Bo smart headset which are awesome pair
of earbuds that also have something
that's new to the channel 3d audio
recording a huge shout out to Sennheiser
for not only sponsoring today's video
but introducing me and a lot of you guys
something completely new so if you look
at the AM Bo you can see on the left and
right side of the ear buds you've got
some microphones now these have been
deliberately placed here so it can
capture audio just like whoever's
wearing it hears it now guys you guys
check out this next clip and I really
hope you're wearing headphones of our
intern Jesse getting a shape up
now first up tell me that wasn't cool
hit that like button if you enjoyed it
and what you guys just heard was a
binaural audio recording binaural audio
basically describes how we normally
perceive sound now sound reaches each
ear at slightly different time volumes
and timbre which is how we're able to
locate each sound that we're going to be
hearing in the upcoming clips so when
the razor passed on his left you heard
it in your left ear and when it passed
on his right you heard in your right ear
and it's crazy because that's exactly
how Jessie heard it too
and using the earphones is pretty simple
all you have to do is plug it into your
iPhone and use any recording app so he
just went into the camera app hit record
and it automatically got that audio in
3d now it's currently for iPhones but
there will be an Android version coming
out later this year so it's really just
plug and play no need for any special
apps any app that records audio using
these will record it in 3d and I like
that we're seeing tons of advancements
in video when it comes to our smart
phones and I feel like Sennheiser
stepping up to the plate to make sure
the audio creates a more immersive
experience like we're seeing with 4k 360
video VR all these things that help with
the visual side of things and it's nice
to have something now that can create a
very immersive experience with audio but
let's hear some more clips
drama
and I really hope you guys went and got
your headphones so you can experience
this the way I did that love that you
can record 3d audio with this and anyone
with a pair of headphones can experience
what you recorded and that really makes
it perfect for those of you who like to
do a lot of mobile videography and you
like to share your special moments it
really just takes it up a notch and
allows the listener to feel like they're
in the room where it happened and I just
can't stress enough how cool I think
this concept is you guys got to see it
and hear it for yourselves but what's
really awesome is that this isn't just
an audio recording device it's actually
a pair of earbuds as well so you can
listen to your music from it they sound
great they even have active
noise-cancelling and it's also got this
transparent hearing function so if you
want to hear the sounds around you while
you're listening to your audio maybe
you're jogging outdoors you can go ahead
and do that they're very comfortable
they've got the ear hook design so as a
pair of ear buds they definitely stand
on their own they just have that extra
bonus feature where you can record audio
in 3d which is a bonus that you cannot
complain about but you guys let me know
what you thought of the experience down
below in the description if you want to
check out the Sennheiser ambience I'll
of course have them linked down below
for you guys to check them out but
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl and give this thing
a like I'll catch you guys in the next
one till then it's your average consumer
