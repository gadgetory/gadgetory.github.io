consumer and today I've got an unboxing
of the Nexus 4 wireless charger so let's
not waste any time let's get right into
it and all right guys here we have the
Nexus 4 wireless charger and this
retails for about $59.99 so it's like 60
bucks but with you know tax and all that
stuff it comes to around 70 on the
Google Play Store and as you can see it
says original accessory here by LG and
this looks like a half of a Nexus Q
which is pretty funny if you don't know
that is that some some weird thing that
Google came out with but kind of shut
down early anyway that's off topic but
enough of my blabbering let's unbox this
we've got a piece of tape here so we're
gonna use the unboxing knife to kind of
get this open and let's see here
okay so it's like this boom alright so
now that that's done put this away and
let's pull it out so here we have it
open it up here and we can kinda just
pull this out
and let's see what we get inside inside
here you'll find the Quick Start Guide
and the limited warranty information so
we can put those backs and kind of
boring and what else we have the micro
USB as well as the wall adapter so here
you have those two of course the same
thing they seem to be exactly the same
as the Nexus 4 so no surprises here and
the actual device itself which is
extremely dusty all my Nexus products
seem to come out with some dust it's
really crazy I don't know why but let me
give you guys a quick close-up and all
right guys here it is now like I
mentioned before all my Nexus products
that I've purchased come with this some
kind of dust or dirt on it but it's fine
this is really small compact as you can
see it fits in the hand very easily and
they had like a rubberized feel to it
and back here you can see this is where
you plug in the micro u.s.
speak Abel and let's see if we can get
this plastic off the top so I can kind
of pull this off and here we have it so
this is what it looks like this feels
very um sticky for it with for lack of a
better word so this is so that your
Nexus device does not slip off and fall
because the Nexus 4 is a very slippery
phone so this will definitely hold it in
place for sure now one question I have
is with whether or not this will work
with the bumper so we're gonna try that
out now this is all there is to it guys
this is the close-up not much more to
this device so now let's clear some of
the stuff out the way really quickly put
this over here and I mean I guess we
might as well try out the Nexus 4 and
see how it fits so here's the Nexus 4
throw it on here and yeah it's not
slipping off it's not touching the
bottom and wow this is the first thing
it actually comes up with the I think
it's got like some kind of suction maybe
no no suction but it does stick very
well as you guys saw when I pulled it up
sometimes you can take it with you so
you don't have to worry about this
sliding off very secure now what I
wanted to know is whether or not it'll
work with the official bumper case that
you can purchase on the Play Store as
well and mm-hmm it seems like you can
fit but I don't know if it'll charge so
what we're gonna do is I'm gonna plug
this in and run a few tests and alright
guys so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna place this down see if it starts
charging and it does so that's not too
surprising is what you would expect now
let's see if how if there has to be any
special position to charge so this is
putting it too high this will not charge
it down the middle
definitely charges it putting it pretty
low it doesn't charge it so it really
does have a bit of a sweet spot you
really want it to be right in the middle
so that works now let's see if so you'd
have to actually be pretty careful not
to just
throw it up there and you know you have
to make sure that it's right in the
middle boom so you know just dropping
your phone on there hoping it'll charge
now we're gonna put the bumper and the
phone see if the charge is there and it
works very glad to see that it does work
with the bumper now it's gonna be the
same deal can't put it too high can't
put it too low I'm sure it doesn't even
work too low so boom get it right in the
middle walking by drop it and it works
and that's about it guys this is the
unboxing of the Nexus 4 wireless charger
and we ran a few tests just to see how
well it charges depending on position
and if it works with the case and that's
about it for this video guys hopefully
