and it's time to check out my favorite
seconds a month now this is where we
check out some detect I use on a daily
basis whether it's new or old some of
the things I love so let's actually
start off with this guy so this right
here is the Corsair k95 platinum now I
had the original Corsair k95 I really
did like it it had a bit too many macro
buttons for me didn't really use them
like that so I decided to go something
like this that offered just a little bit
more than the normal one did so with
this one you only have six macro buttons
but it also has this cool LED strip at
the top it also has a USB port in the
back so if I need to plug something in I
can just go ahead and do that there and
I like to look a bit like the field
Cherry MX brown switches so they have
that nice when your type so it's an
awesome keyboard I love the look and of
course you can customize it to fit a
second set up because of you know all
the RGB lights and whatnot so this is an
awesome keyboard I think this cool
little LED strip is kind of Awesome I've
never seen that on a keyboard before so
good job Corsair alright good and right
next to it we've actually got these
earbuds from Sennheiser you know the
Sennheiser HD ones you guys know how to
carry around those Sony here in wireless
earbuds with the neck band and all that
but this one I find to sound a lot
better has better features a better
battery life it's an all-around win the
only thing I'm sacrificing here is that
teal color man it's gone but this is
still pretty good it's black like I said
it sounds great I love the fit and neck
bands legit so if you're actually
looking for an awesome pair of earbuds I
can highly highly recommend these they
definitely get my vote now I know what
I've got the next piece right on it is
my Galaxy s8 now I don't know maybe this
one is an obvious choice because it's
new but I actually like this enough to
make it my daily driver right now I'm
running some tests
seeing if I can actually make this a
daily driver the iPhone has been put
backburner I have my clothes with it
like a mannequin life's not perfect for
me
just yet but I'm making it work and I'm
really enjoying it I'm sure you guys are
seeing tons and tons of reviews about it
it's got a it's got an awesome camera
the design looks great honestly if you
guys got to pick up an Android phone
this is like the phone to go with or the
g6 but my vote is all on the SI now when
doing is really interesting I didn't
think I could use a bone without a nice
SmartWatch to go with it I use my Apple
watch and my iPhone together those works
like staple for me I always my
SmartWatch not a lot of people do but
that's okay but I picked up the gear s3
and I got to say I was surprisingly and
surprisingly in love with how the state
functions I thought it would be one of
those clunky Android wear watches now it
doesn't have Android wear but I haven't
been too crazy about most of the Android
smart watches but this one has surprised
me it's got the Tizen OS but it's really
really good so this combo seems like
you're good enough replacement so far
for the iPhone 4 it's not out yet though
and if you didn't know give them away in
SK and si plus video link in the
description oh yeah I'm also giving away
a custom Nintendo switch that ain't in
Dec or they'll be playing it but custom
content will switch by color we're all
linked in the description go check those
out but the next piece of text that I am
in love with are these Electric
skateboards not not so much missing
board more so this booster board now
your body probably knows about the
booster board right now but this is an
amazing electric skateboard they both
really are now my problem with the V
board I got this thing it's so heavy
like this is I think this is 25 pounds
this is a workout folks so you see it's
got the giant battery all this big motor
stuff it's very heavy
while this one it's super lightweight
easy to walk around with you
transport so this is like my preferred
way of getting around when is somewhere
close especially since it's about to be
summertime it is the best time to have
one of you then take them out get around
town do whatever you got to do when I'm
going to get a haircut among this guy
instead of siding because it's just that
much fun to just use I love it now
hopefully be bored to comes out at some
point that one's supposed to be a lot
lighter or something like this I can't
wait to get my hands on it if you guys
are interested in seeing some electric
skateboard action let me know what it
comment down below but I think that's
about it for now you guys get to see
some more tech next month so that's
about it hopefully you enjoyed it be
sure to introduce a little giveaways
I'll catch you guys in the next one
till next time use your average consumer
