and we have finally got another what's
in my gadget backpack video this time
though we're working with a $500 budget
but Eric actually piloted this kind of
serious
she started with their $300 graduate
backpack video if you haven't seen that
I have a link down below in the
description now with a $500 budget I got
a few more items than Eric and honestly
some might be better quality but over
here we've got our backpack now this is
actually from Amazon
if you luxr bag series back the brand
now this is an awesome backpack because
it's made of this nylon material so with
this when you're out in the rain you
don't got to worry about your gaps
getting all messed up from the water
this thing it has water resistant now
something I really like about this
backpack besides it being water
resistant and having a pretty good
looking design is the fact that it has a
USB port right on the side so what that
means is you can plus up a portable
charger right to the backpack and if
you're on the go you don't have to worry
about holding a portable charger in your
hand or your pocket you just plug it
into the backpack and you're good to go
kudos to you for finding this cool
little feature area that's all you get
and another cool little bonus here is
that you've got this handle to actually
hold your backpack if you don't want to
have it on your back you got your
typical loop here if you want to hang it
up somewhere but this makes for easy
carrying in one hand if you want to now
you get all of this for just 36 bucks
which is a deal in my book but let's get
inside I feel attacked
so first up in our little compartment in
the front we've got a few USB cables now
we just got standard cables for all this
stuff that we have inside of here but
something you'll notice about these
cables is that they're covered with
these velcro straps now these velcro
straps I picked up from Amazon for about
seven bucks and this should help with
cable management now one of these cables
is actually a special cable that I got
from ravpower
this is a USB type-c cable it's a very
durable cable while it has two USB
type-c ends it also includes a USB tie
a and just in case we need to plug your
device into something that doesn't have
a USB type-c input so you've got some
versatility here and I wanted to plug my
Galaxy s8 into something I don't really
have to worry about what connection they
have since this thing covers all ground
now I've been about 10 bucks for this
and it goes with my Galaxy s8
but if you guys have other phones out of
course have some alternative link down
below in the description and if we take
a look in the back you can see we have
this little zipper over here that way to
a low key secret compartment so if you
want to have all of your velcro straps
on you or anything else you can throw it
in here so if everything that I've got
you'll find spend about fifty three
bucks so we got 447 left and if you
happen to be worrying about these other
cables don't worry they came with the
stuff that's inside of here so we'll get
to these later so that was the first
small compartment now into the main
compartment there are a couple of cool
things first thing we're to talk about
is the portable charger now this one is
by jakhary
is twenty thousand milliamp hours it has
two USB ports I have a nice construction
a very very durable feels premium and
while there they have a ton of features
and outputs it has enough juice in here
so throw into the backpack without
having to worry about recharging the
portable charger over and over and over
again and just ramming about thirty-six
bucks and next up we got this this is
the rocket book wave smart notebook now
you're wondering how can a notebook be
smart but this is actually a really
really cool product now with this guy
you also get a little friction pen so
what's cool about this combo is that you
can actually go ahead and write all your
notes in this little notebook no problem
right and it can sync two different
kinds of notebook applications so things
like Evernote and I think there's a
couple more now not only going to do
that but once you've filled up the
notebook you run out of pages don't
worry all you have to do is throw this
guy into microwave and yes I said
microwave and it'll erase all the stuff
that you have written inside
that is awesome isn't it so you can
actually reuse this a few times I'm not
sure how many times over you can use
that little microwave future but I think
nonetheless that is an awesome awesome
feature is great for students and guess
what 27 bucks so over here we can see
you guys we have a couple of cool items
but you'll notice that and talk about
storage yet so over here we have an
external hard drive from Western Digital
this is the Western Digital My Passport
one terabyte super tiny and it has USB
3.0 so you can store whatever you need
to your student or your homework and
whatnot photos whatever it's a hard
drive you guys know what to study for
this one cost about 56 bucks one
terabyte that's a good deal for me and
next up we've got one of my favorite
things in this backpack and that is this
portable speaker by zelich now this is
an awesome speaker because it has a
rugged design very solid quality
waterproof so you can take it to the
pool when summer comes and it only cost
30 bucks now it has good sound quality
and it also also works as a portable
charger
and another bonus is the fact that it
supports microSD card so you can throw
some music on your memory cards put it
in here
and you don't even have to worry about a
bluetooth connection in order to play
some of your favorite tunes I love this
30 bucks
this is a win that's it video over go
buy it but no we got some stuff on the
side here folks so let's see what we got
in here
alright right right so I got me a mouse
he was missing a mouse in her backpack
video oh so we got a mouse over here
this is great for it it's only what
which was this one only 14 bucks but
what I like about it is that it has a
dongle in here that you can plug into a
computer and use it wirelessly and it
runs just on a single double-a battery
as a few buttons also so if you like to
have your back and forward buttons on
your web browser you got all that you
can control the DPI blah blah blah so
good mouse for 14 bucks now over on this
side we've got boom this is a Belton
search detector if yet another portable
charger built-in so you got two outlets
over here and you have a USB port so
this comes with 3000 milliamp hours so
we've got a lot of juice here on the
table folks so but what this guy is
pretty cool if you need to charge
multiple things you want to have your
laptop hooked up you want to have
something else going you want to have
your phone going you got a lot of
options with this guy now what's cool
about this is that it charges when
you're using it normally so you can just
unplug this from the wall use it as a
portable charger can't beat that
and it only cost about 19 bucks so
that's pretty inexpensive now you guys
want these backpacks usually have a
little slot of top so that you can put
things like sunglasses
or whatever you want we've got some
earbuds in here and these are actually
the sony xba-1 the best by shopping
challenge that I did with Ari but they
actually have it on Amazon as well
or a little bit cheaper matter
but this has awesome bass great sound
quality especially for the price range
definitely seen good sound that has
features like NFC their Bluetooth so
definitely good stuff so it made the
list so with everything that we're
looking at over here we spend about
three hundred and three bucks so that
means we have a little less than 200 to
get something else so you know we have
to get our hands on a laptop so we do
have a laptops inside of here but this
is a cool little travel case from lack
dude this is probably one of the best
laptop cases I've ever seen I've got an
awesome material it has some slots so if
you want to carry just this instead of a
backpack maybe you're running for class
in college or something this is actually
a really cool little laptop suite and it
has our laptop so over here we're
actually looking at the Asus Chromebook
now this is a really nice Chromebook I
gotta say it looks pretty good it has a
rugged design so maybe you're getting
this for it maybe someone who's younger
maybe you're in high school maybe you're
clumsy it is running Chrome OS this is
good for students you don't have to
worry about putting all your documents
on external storage like flash drive or
anything like that it is all going to be
saved to the cloud and if you're
wondering about the port we've got an
HDMI port which is awesome definitely
great for college students who want to
hook it up to a TV and we also got two
USB 3.0 port as well as a headphone jack
SD card reader with this guy over here
that's a speaker grille okay and your
Kensington lock and of course you can
charge it this was only about 170 so you
can get a very solid computer for not a
lot of money and oh I know somebody's
gonna bring it up where's the charger
for you didn't show it
we got the charger too so boom this is
our $500 wait a minute
