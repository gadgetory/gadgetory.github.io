going on guys the giraffe which consumed
right and we've got another massive tech
unboxing you got tons and tons of things
to open up over here but first of all
you guys know what you got to do
grab your snacks grab your drinks hit
the like button and let's get started
re make your pick this one right here ah
the little guy the underdog so this is
from tech armor talk and charge oh okay
so this is a pair of Lightning earbuds
that also allows you to charge them
while you're using your phone so you've
got your lightning cable right here as
well as a little port so that you can
add another lightning cable to charge
your device while you're using it I
think that's pretty cool I wonder how
much these go for I'll have a little
caption that tells you guys how much but
this is actually a really cool idea now
we got to see how they sound too so
let's see what we got here this is a box
from incipio so this was sent to my peel
box out I have no idea what's inside of
here I'm gonna take a guess and say
phone cases since the s9s 9 plus just
came out BAM
oh snap they send a lot of cases whoa I
thought this was a heavy box the jeez
these are all cases folks stats and
facts and facts
all right oh but there's actually some
good-looking cases Wow they've had
they've got all kinds so but I'm gonna
do guys I'm gonna look through all of
these I'm gonna have them link down
below something I think I was a very
very best but some of these look really
good I'll just have their their main
site link down below and which ones I
think look the best Oh
all right this is nothing really special
actually got a screen protector for my
rx100 mark 5 as well as in a little
attachment grip so that you can hold on
to it a bit more easily so if you've got
an arch 100 I think there's some pretty
built accessories worth picking up I
actually just did a video on the arch
100 and how good it is for vlogging so
if you guys want to see that I'll have a
link down below as well
Oh treasure chest of some sort okay so
it's like some kind of interesting
treasure chest
Oh see if these see if these just came
out okay so I know this is from Xbox so
let's see okay so we've got a picture of
a pirate ship and a certificate of
authenticity let's see what else we've
got this is a shirt for sure hey that is
awesome
ooh I don't even want to pop this open
what is it for oh okay so this is like a
journal of the pirates and they even
this is a comic book oh that's pretty
cool so they even got a comic dang this
is this game is a lot bigger than I
expected man it's like a flag it's a
flag
that's awesome what's in here the it's
like a message in a bottle but when it
goes you know the Odyssey see what's the
message oh okay
whoever finds this message see you on
sea of thieves it's a game code BAM
somebody just got SIA thieves okay got a
little figure or a toy and grog had
instructions on how to make raagh
alright so this is this I love the
packaging that they usually come out for
with these games man
yeah this looks awesome
oh-ho-ho I know who this is from check
this out re the Dyson supersonic not a
sponsor so that's something some cool
stuff and iris had her eye on this
forever so this is all you boo oh ok so
here we have it okay Ari why is why is
this special
set those curls advantage okay well you
heard it from her first guys yeah for a
hair dryer
yeah but it but it works well yeah
alright you saw that too Dyson for
sending this out to arey so this right
here is from bheem so it's basically
like this little button that you can put
on your backpack your shirt whatever you
want but it has a screen that you can
throw things like little video clips or
gifs on to so this is actually really
really cool shoots out to Ken for
putting me on to this it actually has a
magnet piece in the back so it connects
like that so let's say you stand for a
certain cause that's like kind of their
selling point
if you stand for a certain college you
really want to show that off you can
have that right here just play it on to
the actual beam I'm gonna find something
interesting maybe like I've done them I
can't help it and have that that's my
cause or maybe a UAC logo maybe that's a
little bit better I'm gonna have the
information link down below this is
really cool and I think it's unique
ok protective cases for flight oh I owe
the iPhone 10 protective cases these are
some really cool cases actually I was
like what is this but these are some
really cool cases because they actually
have frames around them that are similar
to the iPhones actual design and they
have a clear back so if you want a case
that needs to look like your iPhones
naked but it's not this is definitely
the one to do that
alright let's get this a little bit
lower Oh baby
you gotta be kidding me
this is stupid this is so crazy ya guys
this is amazing so my boy curio Ventura
of course he strikes again this is a
Lloyd the model kit for all those people
who knows IDEs the lag or zero Jaeger
oh you outdid yourself my friend guys
you guys gotta follow him
I'll have him link down below in the
description he does amazing stuff like
this all the time you guys have seen him
in other massive second boxing great
stuff link down below here we've got a
little something interesting this is a
3d pen so if you've been interested in
3d printing maybe drawing some cool
stuff with 3d printing this is actually
a really inexpensive option to do that
so this is the pen right here this is a
little key it's a small pen and here you
guys have all the stuff you need to do
whatever 3d art you would want so it
goes in through here to the pen and the
pen just kind of makes it so if you want
to have like a standing stick figure you
can draw that out with this pen I think
that's really cool and it comes with a
few other stuff to really mold it out
and charge the pen and all that good
stuff so I like this I want to see how
it actually works but we'll probably
save that for another video and next up
we've got some PC fans from Corsair
these have RGB lights on it and you
probably wonder why you got that good
well you probably saw the case already
this is a giant Corsair case I'm going
to be building my own gaming PC I'm not
sure what kind of PC if it's gonna be a
workstation PC or a gaming PC but I'm
building a crazy PC nonetheless so we've
got some RGB fans over here and we've
got this giant case this is the crystal
570 X all right the unveiling oh this
looks awesome but this is a nice looking
case so this is my first time going out
and getting pieces and parts for my own
PC so it's gonna be interesting to see
how this all comes together I
the last time I did a video about
building a PC was with Austin yeah that
was interesting but this is going to be
all me this time and he said call it all
investment stuff Ari that's foul let's
get back to what we were doing before my
wife tried to play me the legato Arc a
pair of bluetooth headphones this one
has the neck dance style I wonder how
much these costs but it's actually
pretty cool to see spigen come out with
the pair of ear buds
okay oh nice so these have retractable
earbuds I really like that
I thought the LG's are the only ones
that actually went this route okay cool
and boom they're back in I like these
I'm going to give these a try
ASAP little devil rose gold so this is
from the PIO box as well oh it's just
like a bluetooth speaker so this is a
little devil bluetooth speaker we get
some really interesting things in the
peal box so it's a bluetooth speaker it
has a mic you can answer phone calls
with it it even has a little shutter so
if you want to take pictures with your
cell phone it has a shutter button so
maybe if you're doing selfies err you
want this Oh hold on this looks awesome
so this is the SteelSeries rival 600
oh this looks really cool SteelSeries
have been showing the channel some love
lately and i appreciate that thank you
still theories this looks really really
good so I already know what I think I
want to use for a mouse in terms of this
new gaming PC that we're going to build
over here
this this looks so cool alright I
actually really want to open this up you
look no honestly this looks perfect the
design matches perfectly with the case
oh wow yeah and you're right even
without the lights
feels pretty come all of this is nice
this is nice I'm gonna hook this up and
see how it actually is to use it but
this is really nice so far and it's
lightweight I still series thank you but
you know what SteelSeries actually sent
something else I throw out the box that
it came in because I opened it up and
didn't know what it was but they
actually sent over the apex M 750 TK l
okay oh I like this now this doesn't
have a number pad on the side this is
more of a minimalist keyboard I like
this though okay so this is their qx2
linear mechanical switches and I
actually like the feel of this a lot all
right so we've got some really good
options in terms of this gaming PC I'm
excited and by the way guys if there are
some things that you want to see with
this gaming PC you want to see happen to
it let me know as a comment down below I
would love you guys as input you know I
don't do the gaming PC thing like that I
don't build them all the time or ever
less so I would love to have your input
down below okay this is a tall one this
is also from the pl box selfie stick and
tripod oh excuse me
mighty selfie stick and tripod so this I
mean it feels high quality for a selfie
stick this is like a bat right here
right okay oh snap now this is oh oh
this is this is no joke oh it's still
going how wide of a shot do you need
this is if you're like trying to take a
picture like if you're a celebrity I
need to take a picture with an arena
I respect that I don't know how many
people you're trying to take a picture
with behind you but I respect it though
mighty indeed okay and it has an
attachment here so you can throw this on
just like that okay and then this thing
can obviously extend well beyond this
ceiling so that's pretty cool I actually
like this I'm not gonna lie I like this
it's it's a selfie stick but I feel like
I don't know sound about it I like and
last but not least whose just our
friends over also be look with this our
friends over at Microsoft sent us
another controller so guys this is their
combat tech Xbox one controller Oh does
this have the grip yes got the grippy
texture in the back you can't beat that
it's comfortable usage right there but
this is the last package guys this is
our haul I guess all the stuff that we
got in today's massive tech unboxing
