and today I've got a comparison video
for you guys that you've been requesting
so today I'm going to be comparing the
new Beats Studio versus the v-moda m100
so let's not waste any time
get right into it bah blah blah blah
blah and alright guys here we have the
new beat studios and here we have the
v-moda crossfade m100 these are both
really great headphones on they retail
for $300 for the beats studios and 310
for the v-moda crossfades now it's only
attend our different so it's not going
to be a make or break so but the V
motors are a little bit more expensive
buy you know ten bucks but that aside
let's talk about the design of these
headphones now you can see that they're
very different design I'm a fan of both
of the designs I like the studio's
because it's a pretty simple really nice
new design from the line as I said in
many of my other videos
these are hybrid of like a couple of
different beats products that are out
there
well the v-moda crossfades they just
have a nice compact design while still
looking very industrial I really do like
the different arm designs that you can
actually have on this you can actually
take this plate off and put a different
one on and change up the design have a
different plate that says something you
can customize this quite a bit
so the crossfades have some really nice
stuff going for it I am a fan of how
compact it is it's got a real small
footprint and when you have this on it
doesn't look obnoxious it doesn't have
like a really huge design so this fits
quite well on the head and I really do
like how simple it is it while still
looking pretty cool I think so I think
in the design department to each his own
I really like both of them I can't even
pick one over the other I'm a huge fan
of Beats and their designs in general
and I really do like the v-moda
crossfade m100 so both of them have a
really high rating in my opinion as far
as the design goes so it's really up to
you on what you think looks better now
as far as comfort goes
I definitely have to give this to the
beat studios the beat studios are very
very comfortable while the em1 hundreds
are pretty comfortable but sometimes if
you wear them for long periods of time I
found that they can get a little tough
to bear um after a while this does have
some clamping pressure on the head after
a while so um after long periods of time
my ears start to hurt when I'm wearing
these and I'm talking about a long
period of time so I definitely have to
give it four give it to the beat studios
in that regard now the images aren't
straight up uncomfortable these aren't
like the beats mixr's or anything like
that but similar to like the beats pros
they're fine for a while but after some
time it does clamp a little so it will
be a little bit hard to bear after some
time now as far as durability goes I
definitely have to give this to the m1
hundreds the m1 hundreds are quite
durable you can bend this in all kinds
of ways do all kinds of stuff to it
these are things I wouldn't even attempt
with the beat studios this is really
really nice so it's a very very durable
pair of headphones and I just really
love it it's um definitely a lot more
durable than the studio's because the
studio's do have a plastic design and
whereas this may not crack easily or
anything unless you like sit on it or
like you stomp it something I don't know
but regardless of the fact whatever
you're going to do is whatever might
happen to this I'm sure if you put this
in the same situation it's not going to
break the band because of the material
that it's made out of so definitely in a
durability Department 100% that
definitely goes to the V motors now as
far as features go the Beats Studio has
active noise-cancelling which is a plus
and a minus the fact that it has active
noise-cancelling is nice because it's
noise cancelling but it does affect the
sound quality a bit of course some
people who aren't familiar with noise
cancelling headphones they kind of
wonder what's that white noise in the
back that I hear when I have these on
well that's the active noise cancelling
with the v-moda m100 you're not gonna
get that and it still has some pretty
good sound isolation
so it's not really a downfall that this
doesn't have noise cancelling and I do
think that because of that the sound
quality sounds just a bit better here
but we'll go into sound quality in a
second
also the beat studios have a power on an
off feature because of the active noise
canceling this doesn't work without
batteries so that's a big minus in that
department compared to the V motors the
v-moda stone Traverso you just plug them
in and you're listening to music no
matter what so I definitely think that's
a huge huge bonus for the V motives
now the studios because it has you know
power it has a mute button on the side
that you can mute your music if you want
to listen to someone or you're talking
to someone you want to you know put your
music on mute for a second you can
actually just do that here so that's a
cool feature but these bullets have
inline remotes where you can just kind
of pause your music anyway so it doesn't
really make that huge of a difference
and like I said this has plates that it
can change up so that's a nice feature
that this has over the studio's arm as
far as any other features that this has
this does have a battery indicator well
that's not really a make or break in
this department because the V motors
don't need a battery indicator to they
don't have a battery now one thing I do
like about the V mode is that the
studio's don't have is the fact that it
can daisy chain and daisy chain means
you can put another pair of headphones
into these headphones and listen to the
same audio source so if you're listening
to your iPod and then someone else wants
to hear your music as well they can just
plug their headphones right into this
some empty headphone jack and then keep
listening while you're listening so both
of you can listen at the same time and
what's really cool with the V motors is
that it comes with a cable that you can
actually daisy chain yet another um
headphone so you can listen with three
different headphones to one audio source
at once potentially if you need to
not sure what three people are going to
be sitting looking around that one
autumn one device that needs you know
for audio but if you're on a bus or
something or maybe you're on a car trip
and you're sharing
it with like your friends or whatever
hey this could come in handy
so this can daisy-chain up to three
people
this doesn't arm and really that's about
it for the features um I really think
that the durability should be counted as
a feature since that's just amazing how
adorable these are and one thing I
didn't even know to notice about the
design guys is how compact this thing
can get um that's definitely a huge plus
in the design department not the
aesthetics as far as looks but the
overall design and the functionality of
these headphones the fact that it can
get this small means that it's very very
portable
now the studios can fold up just like
this and you know you can put them in
their case and you know this is pretty
portable as well don't get me wrong but
it's not this this is tiny this is
fitting in anything really this is
really great I love that about the V
motifs so definitely have to give it up
to the V motifs they're in that regard
now the next thing I want to touch on is
the cases that they both come with this
comes the B Studios come with an egg
shell case well it's not that special of
a case it's a hardshell case but that's
about all there is to it you can fit the
studio's inside but there's no pouches
inside here so you can't store any
accessories or if you do store
accessories they're going to flap around
inside but that is the case and it does
a decent job of protecting it so there's
no issues here hard shell cases are
great now the same thing goes for the V
motors this has a hardshell case but one
thing about this because the V motors
can get so small this thing can them
really fit anywhere because it's so
compact so this is a compact shell case
in comparison to these studios you can
see that it's quite a bit smaller so
definitely a thumbs up here and also
what's great about the V motives is that
it's able to store your cables with
these little straps that it has inside
of here so you can get the cables to
stick inside here with no problem and
you won't have anything loose running
around so that's really good too overall
they will both protect the headphones
just the way you expect them to
so definitely a thumbs up for the V
motor since it has the straps and the
small compact size but they both do
protect the headphones the way you need
them to and now of course to talk about
the sound quality now they both have
great sound quality in my opinion but
like I said I do have to give it up to
the V motors because they don't have the
active noise canceling and that kind of
makes the sound quality sound even
crisper than the studios
so knowing no white noise in your music
and when I listen to them they're both
very bassy they both sound really great
and clear but the active noise
cancelling can be heard when comparing
them directly on its own the active
noise cancelling isn't so bad listening
to it you really won't notice it unless
you you pause your music or have it at
really low volumes but still when
comparing it to the v-moda is the v-moda
sound a lot better now there are people
out there who really say that the V
motors are going to destroy the studios
no matter what now don't get me wrong
these do sound better there in most
regards they do sound a bit better but
not enough to say that these will trash
the studios now I'm not an audiophile
and I'm not going by audiophile
standards something for the average
consumer when you're comparing the two
the probably the biggest noticeable
difference you'll find is one that the
active noise-cancelling isn't present in
the V motors so it'll sound clearer and
also the base on the V motors you can
kind of feel it a bit more the cushions
on the V motors are a bit harder than
the studios they're not as soft so you
can kind of feel the vibrations from the
bass quite a bit more on the V motors
and for the bass heads out there I know
that's a really nice thing to feel when
you really feel the bass thumping so
there's a bit of a difference there in
the sound quality as far as the bass
goes you can feel the thump a lot more
on the V motors than the beat studios
and you get that nice crisp sound due to
the noise noise cancelling so definitely
a thumbs up now this is my first time
really comparing active noise-cancelling
to no active noise-cancelling and i
gotta say guys it does make a pretty
good difference and I really do like the
fact that this doesn't have it so in the
sound quality regards I do give it up to
the V motors they
just more my style they're very Chris
they're a lot clearer and they have more
thumping bass which I do like
then the studios not to say the studio
is lacking me but you just kind of feel
it more with the V motors so if I had to
choose between the two I would
definitely go with the V motors it's
more compact it's easier to walk around
with it's a lot more durable the sound
is better um overall I do think that the
V motors are a better value than the
studio's now if you're a beats fan then
the studio's are definitely not a bad
option at all I like them both very much
so it's really up to you and personal
preference my personal preference though
is the V Motors I think that there are
better overall value and they just have
a lot more going for it as far as
longevity and the sound quality and
alright guys that's pretty much it for
this comparison I do like the V motors
more please don't kill me for saying
that the V motors aren't leaps and
bounds better than these studios as far
as sound quality goes for the average
consumer I did that I do want to note
that it is better but not the way I see
it in comments where people are like
it's going to uh turn Eve destroy the
beats to do this it's not that drastic
it's really not but it is better but
alright guys that's it till the next
video is you have a consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
