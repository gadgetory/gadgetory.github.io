some really cool shots and if you head
on over to the Sony action cam YouTube
channel you can see that they attach it
to an eagle and got some really awesome
footage and it even features image
stabilization so if you're doing
something crazy you're still gonna get
some really smooth shots so if you're
interested in this camera definitely
check the links down below in the
description what's going on everyone in
Traverse consumer and today I've got a
video for you guys that you've been
requesting for a couple of years now and
that is my top 5 favorite ear buds now
not all the ear buds on this list have
been featured on the channel before so
you can definitely expect to see full
reviews of those coming soon also this
is a list of my personal top 5 favorites
it's not a list of the best because
sound is subjective and what may be the
best to me might not be the best to you
but hey that's not wasting time let's
get right into it
and all right guys to kick-start this
list at number five we have the
Sennheiser momentum in years you might
be familiar with the momentum headphones
but now Sennheiser has brought the line
to the in gear category when it comes to
design these are amongst the best
looking earphones I've ever used
Sennheiser went with the black and red
color scheme that so many of us love and
they executed it pretty well here they
have a curved design so they can deliver
music straight into your ear canal with
no issues and they also have a
polycarbonate and stainless steel
housing so you can expect some great
durability now one of my favorite things
Sennheiser did with these is that they
created two separate versions for
Android and Apple users this is great
because you're no longer limited to the
controls you have access to just because
of your device although it seems to work
with a bunch of Android devices it's not
guaranteed that it's gonna work with
every single one because some
manufacturers do things a bit
differently now let's talk a bit about
the sound the first thing that stood out
to me when I tried these is how smooth
the vocal sound the bass is pretty tight
and controlled so don't expect any head
rattling but it's definitely there and
it's pleasant I found the sound quality
to be pretty dynamic and it works with
mini genres this is definitely this kind
of sound quality that you would expect
from a well known brand like Sennheiser
you can surprisingly find these for a
hundred bucks on Amazon and I have links
down below in the description and I also
have links for all the earbuds mentioned
in this video down below as well but
overall these are more than a solid pair
of earbuds that's the hundred dollar
price range and that's why we have the
sennheiser momentum in years at number
five and for number four on this list we
have the beats for 2.0 now I'm very very
aware that tons of people dislike Beats
but I don't think that the second
generation of their products should be
overlooked and I'm not the first one to
say it
in typical Beats fashion these are
good-looking earbuds and they're well
designed for comfort they come in a
variety of colors ranging from black and
red white and red gray and Allred they
come with a flat tangle free cable which
is pretty important for ear buds since
they're pretty much all cable I've
stated in some reviews that I have some
pretty oddly shaped ears which caused
ear buds to have a hard time staying in
for me but I've had no issues with the
tour 2.0 as they're designed to fit
pretty nicely into your ear canal they
also include optional wingtips that make
it pretty impossible for them to fall
out my ears
now when it comes to sound the Beats
Tour 2.0 are right up my alley they've
got some great bass but it isn't as
gloomy as the original version but it's
also not as money because they turn down
the bass you can hear vocals more
clearly which leads to a better overall
listening experience the Beats Tour 2.0
retail for about 135 on Amazon which is
pretty far from the most expensive
headphones on this list but I definitely
think it's worth the price for what
you're getting if you're looking for a
good looking pair of earbuds with some
nice bassy sound and great comfort the
Beats Tour 2.0 are definitely worth
looking into and that's why we have the
Bistro 2.0 at number four and for number
three on this list we have the shure
se215
now I took a shot in the dark when I
picked these up but I gotta say I was
pleasantly surprised the shure se215
feature an adjustable over the ear
design which helps a ton for keeping
these in place and I've got to say not
including the addition of wingtips or
any modifications these stay in my ear
better than any earbuds I've experienced
they come with a pretty sizable
assortment of ear tips so you can get
the perfect fit for your ear you can
find them in this see-through black or
clear design and I personally think the
black looks pretty good my only
complaint with the design on these is
that sometimes it gets pretty confusing
as to which side goes in your ear due to
the rotatable cables
however those rotatable cables are a
huge bonus unlike other earbuds if
anything happens to your cables you can
replace them as their detachable from
the earbuds themselves I would have
liked to see a smaller body around the
input since the current one it may be a
little hard to work with some mobile
device cases I also wish it came with an
inline remote but that isn't a
deal-breaker for you as for the sound
quality on these guys they sound great
they aren't that bassy bull with a
simple change to a larger ear tip you
can definitely change that and that's
one of the benefits of using in earbuds
vocals come in very clearly as these
offer some great clarity and if you're
looking for well
sound these are a must-have you can find
these on Amazon for just under bucks and
I think that's a steal this price is
what led me to be surprised with the
quality when I first got my hands on
these so if you're looking for something
very comfortable decent looking with
some great balance sound that won't
break the bank
these are the ones for you and that's
why we have the shure se215 at number
three and for number two on this list
and boy was it close to being number one
we have the RH 80 10 hi now if you
watched my vlogs you know I recently got
my hands on these and they easily climb
to the top of the list of my favorites
are ITA earbuds are always well
constructed and have a premium feel to
them these are no different the t-ten I
have quite the industrial look as they
feature a stainless steel construction
molded to fit nicely into your ear thick
durable cables and an overall very solid
build they have an over-the-air design
with color-coded cables so you can know
at a glance which side goes into what
year the band that goes over your ear
are adjustable and make it quite
comfortable to wear these one of the
most amazing features of these earbuds
besides the amazingly solid design are
the interchangeable attuning filters
with these you can change the sound
quality delivered from the buds which is
a very awesome feature and I'll tell you
these filters have quite the impact on
sound you're given a pair for bass
treble and the reference pair which is
meant to be more for a neutral sound the
sound deliver from the t-ten is simply
amazing the soundstage on these are
something to experience but those not
familiar with the term soundstage the
soundstage will give you the ability to
visualize the placements of musical
instruments and vocalists and any sounds
you hear in your music I've been jumping
back and forth between the reference and
the base filter and reference has enough
bass to make me happy but with the base
filter I get that head rattle in action
I look for the treble filter is also
very nice if you want to listen to
something with more vocals or higher
pitch sounds no matter what filters you
use the rh at10 i produces amazing sound
and i'm very happy with it overall now
these are premium earbuds so they're a
little on the expensive side and it
comes in at about $200 but honestly i
think it's completely
worth it it's a solid investment on a
versatile pair of earbuds that will
surely last you a while and that's why
we have the AR IH 8010 eye at number two
urban number one doe and my number one
favorite pair of earbuds are the
Jaybirds blue bud ex anyone who knows my
taste in headphones and sounds
definitely won't be surprised by this
the blue buds ex are a pair of bluetooth
earbuds with some great sound quality
since these are bluetooth you don't need
to be wired to any device to use them
which makes them super convenient and
liberating which is also why love
Bluetooth headphones these also have
controls on them that allow you to play
and pause music control your volume
answer and hang up calls they're
lightweight design allows them to be
very comfortable when one and the buds
have such a small footprint that it's
easy to use or carry around without them
being a bother at all now these are made
with an active lifestyle in mind so they
have a sweat proof coating and also come
with some wind tips to make sure they
stay securely in your ears while working
out or doing any physical activities you
get a solid eight hours of battery life
which is actually quite good considering
how small these are they've got great
range so you don't have to hug your
phone in order to stay connected now
while these are extremely convenient
they also have wonderful sound quality
they offer some great clarity while
still being superb AC if you're in the
market for a basic pair of ear buds
these will definitely do the trick for
you
many have purchased these based on my
recommendations in the past and it seems
everyone feels the same way about them
as I do these typically retail for about
a hundred and seventy dollars but on
Amazon you can find them for 130 and I
gotta say guys that is a must must buy I
highly recommend these as they were my
go-to here but every time I left the
house until the t10 I came out but I
don't think I use any air buds more when
traveling and that is why we have two
Jaybirds bluebloods acts as my number
one pair of ear buds
alright guys that pretty much wraps up
my list of my top five favorite ear buds

description if you want to check any of
these out and full reviews are coming
