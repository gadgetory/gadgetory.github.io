so CES 2016 and you know I've got to
talk about some of the coolest
headphones I've seen out here if you
know the 80 HM 50s you know audio
technica and here we have the 88 msr7
which aren't new but they have a new
noise cancelling version and to be
honest this is actually the first time
I've heard about these they look pretty
awesome and the noise cancelling was
super impressive especially considering
out on the show floor where there were
thousands of people all over the place
they also are super comfortable and have
a premium feel to them Audio Technica
also has a smaller version called the
ATH sr5 bTW these pretty much like a
miniature msr7 but they feature
bluetooth and you know I love me some
Bluetooth it's smaller so it's super
portable and still have all the controls
you'd expect on a pair of bluetooth
headphones as well as features NFC if
you guys want to see me review these
definitely hit the thumbs up button down
below but next up we've got the jaybird
freedom now these took me by surprise
since the extras were released not too
long ago but I don't think these will be
a direct replacement for them it's got a
much smaller design than the blue butts
X or the X 2's which is a huge statement
in itself since those things were super
tiny and portable they've got the same
size drivers as the X twos but these
actually feature a design which allows
them to fit better in your ear canal and
in order to make it smaller they had to
move a bunch of the tech like the
batteries and the charging port from
inside the buds themselves over to this
the remote this thing has an even
smaller footprint than the X 2's and a
ridiculously slim profile but that comes
at the cost of some battery life with 4
hours of playback but you can easily
attach this little charging clip to the
remote that'll give you an additional
four hours this can be pretty useful if
you decide to carry multiple and I can't
lie I want this and I also got to check
out some of the cool stuff so he just
dropped and I was pretty excited when I
heard about the xB 650 BT since they're
smaller on air version of one of my
favorite headphones the xB 950 BT these
were cool and have some solid bass
performance since that's what they're
all about
but what really caught my attention
was to hear on headphones I almost
completely missed these until I took a
closer look at this teal version and man
I'm glad I got to check these out these
are noise canceling Bluetooth headphones
with all the controls you'd expect on
the ear cup but there are some wired
options as well now the noise canceling
feature on these is insane the booth had
some big speakers playing loud sounds
from an airplane and with the noise
canceling feature on these things
completely blocked it out it was like I
was in a completely different place when
I put them on and I'm not exaggerating
needless to say I was extremely
impressed they also had some great sound
quality and come in a variety of color
options but what sealed a deal for me
was finding them in my favorite color
teal you can expect me to review these
as soon as I get my hands on them and
this list wouldn't make any sense if I
didn't talk about Sennheiser's $50,000
pair of headphones the Orpheus now these
are probably one of the most magnificent
pair of headphones I'll encounter for a
very long time and even getting them out
of the case is quite the experience not
only is it housed in a glass case but
it's also on top of a solid block of
marble which is used to fend off any
potential noise that can be made from
the surface that it's on when you're
ready to use the Orpheus and power it up
the glass casing rises as well as the
tube amp that power this guy the
presentation here is on point but what's
better than that are the actual
headphones themselves they're super
premium and have some heft to them so
you'd know it's the real deal and when
you finally put them on and start
listening to them you'll be amazed the
first thing I noticed once the music
started playing was the amazing sound
stage and how clearly you can hear and
visualize all the instruments around you
if you want to know what it's like to
have your own personal concert and
you've got 50 G's burning a serious hole
in your wallet these are something you
need to try out my buddy John made a
video of a bunch of our reactions
listening to the Orpheus if you want to
know what a few of us think of it it's
definitely worth checking out now you
might think the Orpheus is a tough act
to follow but here we've got some
amazing pink headphones with some custom
golds but now I'm kidding guys there's
nothing that can really top the Orpheus
but hopefully you enjoy taking a look at
the coolest headphones at CES 2016 and
if you enjoyed it be the cool guy or
girl that gives this video

total next video is your average
consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
