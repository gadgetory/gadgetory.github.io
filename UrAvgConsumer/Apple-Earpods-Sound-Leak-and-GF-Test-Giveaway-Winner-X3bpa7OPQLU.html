yeah we love doing it's so much fun for
us my way of saying thanks to you guys
for making part of the channel and here
is a comment right here from Webster
shout you out yeah now let's get on with
the test so here we have the Apple
earpods and what we're going to do for
the Soundwave test is we're going to
play music from my phone from volumes
about 50% 75% and then 100% just so we
can get an idea of how much the sound
leaks from the ED phones when you're
listening to music so we're gonna start
it off by 50% you ready yep okay and hmm
actually due to this there's not loud or
anything but I just I hear that she's
listening to music not in crazy leakage
but I do hear a little teeny bit so your
lyrics no I just hear that you're
playing music all right and now we're
gonna go to 75% and see how much more
music we can hear from there you ready
yeah
all right so 75% I still can't make out
lyrics I kind of know a song to this now
after hear lyrics but it is leaking a
good bit here I don't think it'd be a
bother to anyone though to be honest but
you do it does leak quite a bit there
hundred percent you ready let's go let's
do it hey guy that don't recommend
listening to your headphones out a
hundred percent it's bad for your
hearing but we're gonna do is for this
test
ready all right
and here we go
that's pretty clear I'm not sure if you
guys can hear it but I have it pretty
clearly I have the lyrics everything not
too surprising being 100% but um it
wasn't very loud I'm used to much worse
than that
well there are Apple you're providing a
little you're buying cell but overall it
did lead quite a bit um didn't really
hear any news any lyrics or anything
like that but I did hear that she was
listening to music I am right next to
her and this was outside maybe it
wouldn't be as um dressed because it is
right now but I was able to hear it and
at least in a good bit so now that we're
done with the sounding test we're going
to do the girlfriend test know it's
about yes
so the girlfriend test wing kaneki's the
girlfriend text is when I do something
that will that usually annoys him and
he's gonna see if his headphones can
block it out then it also lets you guys
knows that know if you'll be with luck
out other annoying sounds for you too
yep and we're gonna do this of course
add volumes of 50% 75% and 100% just
like we did the sound leak test okay and
today I'm going to be doing what I
usually do when I'm I'm trying to you
know learn some more Spanish here so
I've gotten was at a stone and sometimes
the noise moves a little bit with my
pronunciation and such so yeah that's
what they don't think that's gonna be
about today alright so we're gonna start
this off at 50% are you ready are you
ready for you later Lily Potter saga
piketty's are not forget that every part
oh all right that this is did absolutely
nothing for sound isolation fifty
percent did nothing at all in credit I
heard completely clearly so we're gonna
try to solve now at 75%
yes Elgar got back a piece in la
furgoneta le part o el cargo pockets and
okay but um I I still heard it pretty
clearly um you know my music was louder
but everything else still got in not not
so good so now we're gonna do it at 100%
and see how much if you can block out
anything at all I'll transport the
package it's enough for the net all
right so that did block I wasn't able to
hear the computer but I was able to hear
her um she's right next to me so I can't
make excuses for this isn't really
isolate any sound that whatsoever I
don't I mean they go in your ears but
they're not really like out of though
these are my voice sounds so so you
wouldn't be using that to defend against
any of my singing on my violin player
okay guys like this videos so um yeah
that's about it guys
um I mean I can't you can't expect too
much from these these are just 30 bucks
they're Apple you know Apple your
earphones um
the sound leak wasn't wasn't that great
and the girlfriend test was absolutely
terrible so I will say they're very
comfortable at least they can't stay in
my ears but within yours but that's
about it for this video guys hopefully
you guys enjoyed it learn a little
something about these headphones and um
