and it's that time of year again
time for a room tour
and in my typical room tour fashion I'm
going to be starting off at my dresser
which I like to call the pending dresser
there's typically products here that I'm
either going to be bringing to the
channel or stuff that I'm just testing
out and right now you guys might notice
that I've got something from TiVo a name
that you probably haven't heard in a
while
but they're coming back with a new
product called the TiVo Romeo OTA which
is the one I'm testing out right now and
with this you'll be able to control and
watch TV from your HD antenna you'll be
able to have DVR features with that and
which is pretty cool for people who
don't have like a cable subscription or
anything like that so right now I'm
testing that out I prep it from solar
here and it's pretty cool because you
can watch Netflix you can go to Hulu
Plus all those kind of streaming apps
they offer a couple of cool things they
got even apps and games you can watch
your photos and music so I've got this
hooked up to my Playstation 3d display
which was kind of retired until I got my
hands on this so this thing actually got
some has some use now I can actually
just watch TV while I'm in here so
that's pretty cool
and over here we have the TiVo stream so
that you can actually send all of the
stuff that you record from your from the
DVR right here over to you like your
iPhone or your tablet stuff like that
they actually came out with a couple of
ads on YouTube with like a mom giving
birth to a Romeo but I'll have links
down below in the description if you
guys want to check that out right here
I've got the Dropcam Pro now this guy is
what's protecting all of my equipment
and this entire room I can use this to
check in on my room whenever I'm not
home I can just use the app pop in see
what's going on and I get alerts if you
know what's in the room
so that's pretty awesome and this is the
main thing that it is protecting and
this is my baby my second love after re
the fs7 now I've got it rigged out with
a shape rig now this thing is pretty
awesome because it gives me some
flexibility when it comes to doing run
gun with this guy I have two arms here
so I can carry it pretty easily a better
shoulder pad so this thing just makes it
really nice and easy to use and in the
back here I've got the Shogun the animal
Shogun attached to it so this is a
pretty insane rig definitely not
something you need to do YouTube but I
want to do high quality videos so that's
I made the investment and this is my
boom mic this is everything here this is
my recording tool area pretty much I've
got my slider some tripods some monopod
over there a monopod over there my boom
mic that's a Sennheiser MKH 416 so
pretty solid stuff this slider actually
has a motor that my daddy got for me so
this thing is pretty awesome but yeah
this is all the gear I use pretty much
to make my videos not all of the gear
but the main gear that I use all in one
corner right here I used to have guns
and boxes clean that up put those there
much better and over here I've got my
futon and on it right now is my white
balance card this is what I use to get
accurate colors in all my videos if you
make videos this thing is an absolute
must you got to have that makes your
life a lot easier
and over here I have my bookshelf that's
packed with everything except books but
I do have one book this just not a real
book and it's about titanfall but either
way this is what I have in my bookshelf
a lot of you guys asked me to show my
Gundam collection well here is there's
quite a few of these guys they take
forever to build I've links down below
in the description to all the stuff that
I showed here all these Gundams you'll
be able to find them right
the description so these guys are all
here I've got a huge one right here this
is a perfect grade this thing is
gigantic in comparison to all the others
and right next to it I have my 100,000
subscribers plaque for a hundred
thousand of you awesome guy subscribing
to my channel
almost at five hundred thousand so we're
on our way to a million so we just got
keep on going and shout out to anyone
who can identify which Gundam I am
currently in the process of building if
you guys can guess that much kudos to
you and up here is where I have all of
my games as you can see in my ps4 games
Xbox 360 Wii U yada yada and some more
little figurines this guy's from Final
Fantasy 14 I've got some amiibos some
Pokemon little figures androids of
course and bear Gaia I rebuilt below all
of that I have a ton of ear buds these
are a bunch of gear blood cases some old
PlayStation games but a ton of earbud
cases right here GoPro Hero 4 uh this is
the audio recorder that I used back in
the day the dr-60d this thing pumps out
some awesome audio but uh that's i7
pretty much handles that now so I don't
really have to worry about audio and
these are a bunch of portable batteries
this business night is one of my
favorites
but I do have another one in my travel
backpack right now so it's on the
sidelines but it's a great portable
battery so super old PSPs and down here
we have some headphones tons and tons of
headphone cases down here now I did T's
on Instagram a while ago of the
potential of a video with all of these
guys from the ear buds to all of my
headphones my entire headphone
collection if you guys are really
interested in seeing something like that
give this video a thumbs up to let me
know I could work on that if you guys
want it uh below that I do have a drone
this is the iris plus this thing is
amazing it's taking forever for me to
make this video too but this thing is
nuts look at this crazy controller this
thing is ridiculous but it has
gotten me some awesome footage so I
can't wait for you guys to see that this
thing is pretty nuts over here I've got
my Z board you guys know how in love
with this I am I actually got some new
wheels on it they sent me some new
wheels and this thing is way faster now
than it was before
but this thing is nuts I am in love with
the Z board and down here we've got the
games Vanguard so if you play console
games and you want to play it on the go
this is your best bet
this little suitcase actually has an
entire monitor inside of it so here it
is this is it's got a display on the
inside this thing is pretty nuts it's in
720p display but it's definitely gets
the job done
you put your system right down here you
take this wherever you want pretty
pretty interesting invention right here
moving on from that over here I've got
another Gundam this is the one that you
guys probably saw in the last vlog that
I had sprawled out across my desk
finally built it with the help of re we
got it done and this thing looks awesome
it looks amazing so that's the latest
one and over here we've got some
Bluetooth speakers we got quite a few of
them you can imagine what I'm about to
do with these guys over here and over
here
the main attraction this is my desk
where all the work gets done everything
happens right on this desk now to the
left of this desk I actually have a
little area with all my portable stuff
I've got a MacBook Surface pro 3 MacBook
Air MacBook Pro physically where
whenever I want to be portable this is
the spot I go to I've even got some
portable gaming over there with the new
3ds through the XXL I've also got the
Vita and a couple of hard drives quite a
few hard drives actually so this area is
like my mobile station and yeah so over
here is the main desk I've got another
little Gundam this is Gundam astray the
smaller version of that giant one that
you guys saw just a bit ago but over
here is the lap the
monitor that area got me this is the LG
I think it's the UC or UN 97 so this is
it I'll have links down below in the
description in case I got it wrong but
this is it right here this thing is
awesome especially for editing because
you can see your entire timeline this
thing is wonderful for that so this
thing is great and I've got a 5k iMac so
I recorded in 4k so of course I want to
have monitors that can display that
entire content and this is it this is my
editing mouse of choice the Logitech
g600 G 602 this thing is amazing
especially for video editing because
it's a gaming mouse about all of these
buttons these macros are great for
editing shortcuts so this thing is
awesome
I love it and this is a logitech easy
switch keyboard you can actually connect
up to three devices here you can switch
between them right here so right now
it's connected to my iMac of course and
to the left of that I have my v-moda
m100 I love these guys they've got the
UAC reviews branding on it because you
guys know you can customize the shield's
to have whatever you want on them so
mine say your AC reviews of course and
the black and red so that's awesome and
for those of you who have not seen my
previous room tours everyone tends to
get a kick out of this and one of my
drawers here I keep all of my cables and
little Ziploc bags so that I can know
exactly where they are pretty nice way
of organizing it so just wanted to share
that little tidbit with you guys I've
got let's see some lenses on the sides
this is a Rokinon lens this is a 12
millimeter lens with f 2.0 aperture this
thing is pretty nuts it's very wide and
the youtubers favorite the Sigma 18 to
35 another insane lens my favorite lens
of all time and pretty much this is it
my speakers are of course the Logitech
z5o 6 I'm planning on upgrading I'm not
too sure if I should since these are
pretty awesome
they're super inexpensive definitely
worth checking out if you want surround
sound and you're on a budget awesome
stuff right there down here I've got an
iPod Touch one that I'm actually giving
one away on Twitter so if you're not
following me yet you should be then I've
got a Samsung Galaxy s6
as well as a iPhone 6 plus so these are
like my daily drivers my main daily
driver right here and my backup and a
little note pad for whenever I am
jotting down ideas you don't always have
to type everything I like writing stuff
down sometimes above my desk of course
is where I have all of my headphones
well my main headphones the ones that I
like the most as well as my gaming
systems so this is the ps3 ps4 um the
Wii U and Xbox 360 no Xbox one here
because that is permanently in my living
room I take my ps4 back and forth
whenever I want depending on where I
want to play it but my xbox one
definitely stays out there all the time
and over here I have the winnings home
this little guy is another security
camera this is like keeping a bird's-eye
view of all the stuff that I've got
going on here just like the Dropcam but
uh that one is stationed in here and
it's very inconspicuous you can't really
tell it's there because it matches the
design and up here are where I have all
my headphones a m50x bluetooth Studios
2.0 Sony mdr-1r a clear dynamic custom
one Pro loves Logitech UE 9000 Samsung
level over here headphones the sony
xba-40 bt this is the House of Marley
legend and see the Sony pulse wireless
headset and some urban urbanites
so boom
that's everything right here this is my
setup guys not much has changed except
for a couple of things as you guys
noticed like the monitor a couple of new
pieces of gear definitely some camera
upgrades right here so yeah that's
pretty much it
hopefully you guys enjoyed it this is
probably hopefully going to be the last
room tour in this apartment so hopefully
after next year when we never get
married I have a new in a new house
that's the plan fingers crossed but
that's about it for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed links will be down
in the description if you saw anything
that you like and I'll catch you in the
next one
