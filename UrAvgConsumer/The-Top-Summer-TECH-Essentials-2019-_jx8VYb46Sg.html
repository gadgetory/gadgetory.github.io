consumer and it is summertime as you can
see I am dressed for the occasion
uh-huh but we got some awesome summer
tech to talk about for all those cool
summer activities so of course we have a
portable Bluetooth speaker and what
we've got right here is the LG X boom go
pk7
and huge shots of LG for sponsoring
today's video and for sending out this
exclusive version of the X boom this guy
right here is an awesome Bluetooth
speaker because as you can see it's not
gigantic but it has crazy loud sound and
you also get Meridian technology and
basically what that is is when you're
playing music and you're cranking up the
volume you're not getting that crazy
distortion where it sounds like your
speaker is muffled and it's messing up
this thing plays it very clearly even at
100% but one thing that's really close
this Meridian technology also allows it
to give you some options to control your
sound so if you need having a party you
can boost up the bass with this enhanced
bass feature but let me show you guys
what I'm talking about so this thing
gets crazy loud and we are outside and
this thing packs a crazy punch even
outdoors so indoors you know this thing
is going to absolutely fill a room and
one thing that's really cool is right
here you can see the bass bumping that's
crazy
that's insane not to mention this thing
also has some cool RGB lights so if you
haven't itself a little party you've got
a little light show going and the thing
is I px5 water-resistant so if you're
trying to take the thing by the pool
that's not gonna be a problem you could
get a little wet not a big deal so if
you guys want to say 50% off on the
speaker I definitely suggest checking
out the prime de deal i'll of course
have links down below in the description
if you guys are interested but check
this out if you're out at the park and
you're just riding around summers when
people are most active you're gonna need
yourself a really good helmet and this
is like the smartest helmet I've ever
seen so this guy right here is the live
all smart helmet and this thing has a
ton of features features I've never
expected to see on a helmet before so
biggest thing for me let's check this
out in the back you've got these light
indicators over here so that you can
show the person behind you maybe cars or
something when you're making a turn so
it's pairs with this little remote that
you have that you can put on like a bike
or something and with this guy you can
just hit the left button and you got
indicators showing you're going over to
the left it's subtle but it could really
help out so that ain't getting hit by no
cars but not only can it do that this
thing also has built-in speakers right
here which are very very subtle these
guys right here will connect to your
smartphone so that when you're playing
music it'll play right from the helmet
obviously it's close to your ear so it's
kind of like a headphone experience but
you don't have anything sealing your
ears so if there's cars coming behind
you or something you'll still be able to
hear all that while listening to your
music now we're having speakers like
these is really convenient is being able
to make calls right from your helmet so
if someone's calling you you don't have
to dig in your pocket while you're
riding on the bike you can just answer
it right from the helmet using this
little remote and I think that is really
cool in terms of safety so you're not
fumbling around while riding but
something that I really was interested
in when I picked this thing up was the
fact that it can contact an emergency
contact in case you fall off of your
transportation vehicle and you slam the
helmet now I'm telling you guys having a
helmet is so important I just recently
on July 4th it's
perience falling off my boosted board
without a helmet hit my head on the
floor
I got dinged up pretty bad over here as
well as a bunch of other parts on my
body so I wish I wish I was wearing this
I had it in the studio so shame on me
nice things like 120 bucks on Amazon
right now but honestly I think is well
worth it I think there's a lot of cool
smart tech inside of this that
definitely makes having a helmet a much
better experience and over here we've
got this awesome smart water bottle now
this is a dope water bottle because not
only does it look like a standard water
bottle but it can do a lot more than
just provide your water now this thing
also has built-in RGB lights so if you
want to get a little light action going
you can have some special colors
customize the look of it you guys can't
see it right now but we'll throw up some
b-roll but this thing is cool because
when you don't drink enough water in the
summer you can get dehydrated but this
bottle will actually give you reminders
to let you know when you haven't drink
water in a while so you can go ahead and
take a few sips and get your 8 cups a
day but what's also cool is that they've
added a Bluetooth speaker right here at
the bottom now of course this thing
isn't gonna compare with the LG X boom
but if you want a little music while
you're on a jog or something this thing
will definitely do the trick this is a
really really good buy and it's so
inexpensive perfect for the summer now
next up if you know me if you guys
really know Judd you AC you're gonna
know what I'm picking next I'll pause
the video let you guys leave a comment
down below and let me know what you guys
think is gonna be but it's over here
we've got a portable charger this is a
solar powered portable charger which is
perfect for the summer if you're gonna
be spending a lot of time outdoors why
not let it juice up while it's outside
and what's cool about this is that it's
a rugged design and so if you happen to
drop it or you're throwing your backpack
down you don't have to worry about this
thing hitting rocks or anything like
that
it is going to be well protected and it
has a 20,000 milliamp hour capacity so
that means you're going to be able to
charge up your
many many times over now since we're
talking about summer and being outdoors
this is gonna be important to you've got
this flashlight right here got an LED
strip this thing is crazy bright you
obviously can't tell right now since
it's daytime but this thing is really
really bright so it has two normal USB
ports and a USB type-c port so it'll
charge multiple devices at once and let
me guess you thought that was it you
thought that was all the features this
thing had nope wrong this thing also has
the ability to wirelessly charge your
device boom just like that so you can
charge a ton of devices at once I think
this is probably one of the coolest
portable charges that you can get for
the summer it really just covers all the
bases and it's even water resistant so
you got that too and speaking of water
resistance we got one more thing guys
but this is like a small reminder we've
all seen these right this is what you
put your phone inside of when you're
headed to like the pool or something so
that your phone can be used underwater
you just throw your phone in just like
that
these things are extremely extremely
common but my little advice to you guys
is pick one up off Amazon like right now
if you plan on doing anything this
summer we actually went to Hawaii
recently and we did some excursion some
activities and purchase these while
being tourists and it caused an arm and
a leg and it hurt my soul because I know
how cheap these things are and you can
even get these bigger versions that kind
of work like fanny packs but it can hold
a lot more so if you want to travel with
your smartphone and maybe some very
personal items and you just got to keep
it nearby maybe you're going whitewater
rafting or something and you want to
keep it all safe they're a little bit
bigger but they can hold a lot more now
the last thing I got to show you guys I
can't really show outside so let's take
it back to the studio and finally guys
the last thing that we've got here is a
bit on the smart home side of things and
we've got a smart Wi-Fi plug that allows
you to plug in three different things
into a single outlet now the reason why
this is cool is because it's also
waterproof and
built-in Amazon Alexa and Google
assistant integration now my thought
process for something like this is if
you have a backyard and you guys spend a
lot more time in the backyard during the
summer you'll be able to have cool
things like these outdoor lights that
you can turn on right from the switch or
through the app now check this out you
can either use the app or a voice
assistant to just hit a button and
you're able to turn on things like a
nice outdoor light you can have maybe
some music playing whatever it may be
you can control all of that with just
the flick of a switch and you can even
set up a sprinkler system to this it's
summertime so you're gonna want to get
those sprinklers going and being able to
access those with a voice assistant
that's pretty cool but that pretty much
been our quick little list guys
hopefully you enjoyed the video and got
some good ideas for things that you're
gonna want to keep around during the
summer I'll of course have links to
everything down below in the description
but until the next time guys is your
average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
