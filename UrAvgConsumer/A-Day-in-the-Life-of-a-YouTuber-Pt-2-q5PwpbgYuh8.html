headed to the gym to do some shooting
I've got the ff7 with me lugging this
thing around sucks
but I'm headed to the gym gonna do some
shooting I'll kind of show you guys what
I'm shooting and how I'm doing it all
right so right now
and I've got this camera set up on a
treadmill kind of ridiculous to be
honest those legs are so close to
falling off but either way right now I'm
getting some b-roll
and what b-roll is is the footage that
goes over me talking during a scene so
it's usually the footage with the pans
and it tilts and stuff like that so
that's what I'm getting right now guys
to try to find some dynamic shots things
that's look interesting on video so this
is kind of what it looked like here's a
bit of a preview I've got the Shogun in
the back so you guys can see what I'm
doing I'm gonna do like a little tilt
okay not at all I'm a little pan here
and you guys can kind of see the makings
of this video right now just definitely
do it for the shot type of stuff the
hard part is actually trying to find
ways to make these shots look interest
so I'm gonna wrap my brain a bit around
this gym and see what I can come up with
so right now I'm trying to dumb this
drink an app on camera and it's a lot
harder than you think especially when
you're working with a shallow
depth-of-field it's very easy for items
to go out of focus especially something
like a smartphone so right now I'm
shooting at 1.7 so f 1.7 is really
shallow the slightest movement will get
you out of focus so right now I'm having
a little difficulty it's a little fun
fact I don't know if I'm the only
reviewer who deals with that but it
takes it takes some time to nail the
shot just to keep it inside the camera
and in focus so instead of keeping my
hand in midair I just found a little
cheat I can use this camera arm to keep
my arm up while I'm shooting in front of
it I don't know why I never thought of
this before
alright guys so I left the gym I shot
about two products down there now I'm
working on the third I'm in my kitchen
so I'm working with this guy this
blender and I actually have a sponsor on
this video so I'm throwing that in there
as well the process is coming along it's
taking its time though and I am
exhausted actually pulled an all-nighter
I can't even talk I actually pulled an
all-nighter last night so I am beat but
the video has to get done so back to
work it is and you know I'm actually
pretty excited for you guys to see this
video there's some pretty cool stuff in
it that I'm a huge fan of so you guys
definitely have to check it out when it
comes out can't wait for you guys to see
it so much we're going into it so much
sleep being lost for it and of course I
have to stop to walk the dog even though
I've got a ton of work to do but duty
calls
if she would just go though alright
thanks I've always kind of asked her
because there's always packages for me
I've got a double check so I end up
having to come back to the gym and shoot
more b-roll decimals
that's the worst part when you go to
edit the video and you notice you just
don't have enough b-roll and you got to
go back and shoot some more so I spent a
couple more hours in here getting some
stuff finished but I think I'm finally
done it's wrapped for the gym still had
a couple of stuff upstairs but I just
want to get to editing at this point but
um you know while I'm here I've got the
camera in front of me got this big giant
mirror I might as well take a picture
for Instagram ever really been posting
on Instagram much so I need to get a
little more active with that so this is
the perfect opportunity well none of us
been opposed to stay Instagram hopefully
have fun and get to editing so just got
back inside and found this at the door
love these aha I think what this is is
de moto pure and though I customized one
and instead was going to ship out on the
14th but it's a bit early so I might
have to go and pick this guy up aa day
doesn't end man so I'm finally getting
ready to import the footage but check
this out so I've got some cards here
these are three 64 gigabyte cards I
believe just they're almost all about
full so two of them are full for sure
and one of them I have a few minutes
left and this is a 500 gigabyte solid
state drive this thing is full that just
goes to show you how much footage is on
here I've got at least 600 gigs worth of
footage and that's not counting some of
the stuff that I've done already so
taking a quick look here you guys can
see that this is the finished voice-over
part as you guys can see I use my phone
with a script so I can do a lot of the
talking fun fact about my videos no
matter where you pause I will have a
funny face look at that look at that
look at that
there's no beating back so no matter
where you pause is a funny face um but
yeah so this part is all done I think
this was one single file and it was a
hundred gigs so that just goes to show
you how huge 4k files really are these
things are massive but I've got to
import these now which will take quite
some time in the meantime I guess I'll
start doing something else while I work
on this video you guys can actually go
and check out a video that is complete
and it's something I did with pivot TV I
got a chance to show them around New
York and Brooklyn where I'm from and we
actually checked out a really cool
composting program and you guys can
actually learn a bit more about it in
that video you guys are definitely going
to want to see this so use the links
down below to check it out so I'm still
editing that means no going to FedEx to
pick up the Moto pur I'll have to grab
it tomorrow but at least look at this
guy I'm pretty happy that this came in
these are the V motocross bait and 100
you guys know I am in love with these
but check this out down here now they've
got 3d printed shields available I
haven't been able to make a video on
this yet but I've been meaning to v-moda
now has even more customizations you can
actually use 3d printed shields to
customize your crossfades
however you want so let's take a look at
this one look like a little unboxing
here even though you guys have probably
seen what a mm1 hundreds come with it
ready this is one handed by the way so
not the best hit but here we have it I'm
actually pretty excited I got a chance
to demo these before they were released
and they have some crazy stuff they may
come in platinum guys you can 3d print
in platinum which rm100 both insane geez
check this out ooh I like these they
feel solid man then 100 's are a solid
pair of headphones and these they add to
it man ah I love that I'm 100 if you
guys haven't tried a pair of these yet
you need to these things are great
unless you over here I've got another I
think these are some
more 3d printed shields so let's see
what we've got in here by the way if
you're hearing squeaking that's because
Ari is playing with cookie or cookies
playing with her to lay so that's what's
that noise so here we have the other 3d
printed shields guys it's pretty dope so
these are just like the ones I have you
over here but in orange that's pretty
cool with the orange cable I can see
some nice color combos I just happen to
have orange going all over the place
right now
I hope but this looks pretty cool I like
this you can get them all cut you can
get all kinds of customizations I think
their website has a ton if you guys are
interested I'll have links down below in
the description for you to check it out
and oh yeah these actually dropped in
price I think they go for 250 or
something like that yeah I think they
drop 50 bucks so that makes them ultra
worth it I thought they were great at
300 but if they're even cheaper now
that's an even better deal for anyone
who buys them so here's something I've
been thinking about lately I've been
doing YouTube for about three years now
and the channel has obviously grown
quite a bit um and my pending dresser
has grown way more than I've ever
expected there are tons of things on
that I can't even show you guys right
now it's so crazy it is insane over
there but I've got tons of stuff that I
want to do videos on but it's just kind
of hard to keep up with the quality that
I want to produce and cover all of these
products all at once it would just take
forever so honestly lately I've been
considering getting someone on board to
help me out with it I don't know how it
go about finding that person I hope that
they can man a camera or it maybe edit I
don't know but either way I think I'm
gonna start looking to have somebody
help me out because I've got so many
great ideas and so many different things
that I want to do and show you guys but
it's kind of hard to just do it alone
and still keep that quality that I want
to do the videos would just take forever
to come out and it keeps piling up it
kind of snowballs after a while and
that's kind of what I'm dealing with
right now so many things I want to do
just not enough time to do them all so I
think getting an extra person helped me
out I think that do wonders
arrey helps out when she can but you
know she's got a full-time job she's
busy too so I'm gonna figure this out
hopefully I grab somebody pretty soon
and we could pump out some content so
I've already shown you guys kind of
behind the scenes stuff with me holding
my phone and you know talking into the
camera but before that comes this
dreadfully long process for me this is
right here this is the script this thing
takes me forever to write it always
takes me a really long time because I
had to make sure that I'm giving the
right information and I'm getting
everything that I want out about the
product so this takes me forever it
takes me a long time getting all the
notes down to you know make a video this
is the heart of a video right here and
then it comes into like you know the
editing the recording the b-roll all
that stuff so I write the script first
that's the first thing that happens this
takes a long time as I mentioned and
then after that what I do is I'll go and
read it in front of the camera just like
you guys see and Final Cut Pro here so
I'll do all of this and then after I get
this part down I go and grab some b-roll
because I know exactly what I want to
shoot since I already have a script I
basically have the blueprint for all the
different shots that I'm looking for so
this tells me what I have to do and then
I go ahead and edit put the b-roll on
top of me talking with the phone in my
hand and pretty much that is what makes
a video and after that after I lay down
all to b-roll to the correct spot so you
have to color it so that it pops and
looks good I like to make vibrant videos
so I try to make it as a highly
saturated as possible very vibrant so
that's kind of what I go for but um it's
just a process man quite the process
definitely think I need somebody to help
me out but that's about it guys
I just wanted to give you another day in
the life video of me doing what I do
with YouTube and kind of letting you
guys see a sneak peek at the workflow
and the different kinds of things that
goes into making a video that's about it
guys hopeful
you enjoyed it I'm going to actually
grab the Moto pur tomorrow I haven't
done an unboxing in a long time I'm kind
of iffy about unboxings nowadays I think
a lot of people are but if you guys want
to see an unboxing of the Moto pur let
me know I can make accommodations for
that I can make the unboxing happen but
let me know if you guys are interested
or if it's not a big deal
we'll see but till the next video guys
hopefully enjoyed peace if you're a
master editor in Final Cut Pro or you
know how work camera really well and
you're into New York New Jersey area let
me know I'm just kidding but I don't
know maybe let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
