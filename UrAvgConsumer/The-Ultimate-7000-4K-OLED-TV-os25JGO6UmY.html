consumer and today we're taking a look
at what some are calling the best TV
available this is LG z six oled TV LG
was cool enough to sponsor this video
and send one of these out for a
completely honest review but that's an
easy ask when you've got one of the best
TVs on the market this is a 65 inch TV
so of course it came in a massive box
but unboxing it was pretty simple and
once you get the base plate screwed on
you're good to go but in the middle of
unboxing it don't be surprised if you're
completely floored by how thin this
thing actually is oh this TV's display
is made up of an incredibly thin o LED
panel attached to a glass sheet which LG
calls its picture on glass design and it
literally looks like that this TV is
extremely thin and when turned on the
bezel seemed nearly invisible but the
entire panel isn't this thin towards the
bottom half is where you'll find the
housing for all the internals and for
those of you who don't want to use this
on a TV stand this is also where you'll
mount it on the wall using a base amount
at the stennis point it's just a few
millimeters thick which is crazy now the
thickness of the TV doesn't add or take
away from the picture quality but man it
is worth mentioning that this thing
feels like a work of art now on the
bottom of the TV is the stand which
contains some powerful speakers but
we'll get to that later now let's talk
about that picture quality even with my
lovely fs7 it's pretty hard to capture
just how amazing the picture quality of
an OLED TV is since the colors are
extremely vibrant and the blacks are
true blacks no matter where I was in
relation to the TV the viewing
experience and quality stayed the same
and since this is a 4k TV you get to
enjoy some amazing 4k content this is a
smart TV so Netflix and other apps that
support 4k are all ready to go so you
don't need to buy anything extra if
you're looking to watch those high-res
shows I have been using the Xbox 1's to
play some games with 4k upscaling with
games like Forza horizon three and even
Gears of War 4 and even though it's 4k
upscaling it
looks amazing you also get a ton of
control if you like to tweak your color
settings to get an image that's to your
liking
I honestly found some of the stuff I
watched to be a bit dark but I was able
to change that by increasing the o LED
light settings this probably won't be
the brightest TV you come across but
once I got into those settings I was
able to fix it to a point where I was
pretty comfortable the e6 also supports
HDR content from apps like Netflix
Amazon video and more HDR stands for
high dynamic range and what that means
is that you won't lose details in images
that are really dark or bright an HDR
capable TV like this can produce
brighter more realistic images with
vibrant colors but the content you're
watching has to be HDR capable the e6 is
packed in webOS 3.0 and comes with an
app store which doesn't have a massive
library of apps but it does cover all
the essentials and then some I wasn't
sure what to expect from the interface
but it was pretty user friendly and very
smooth switching between different
sources and applications felt really
simple and paired with the remote you
get access to a cursor which makes it
even easier when you want to select your
options and it eliminates a bunch button
pressing an option that was really
surprising to me was the ability to
activate 3d now I know 3d isn't very
popular anymore but I was very surprised
at the implementation here because the e
sticks can essentially turn any content
into 3d content I was playing some
titanfall which isn't a 3d game but turn
on the 3d feature and it suddenly was
you get two 3d glasses with the e6 so
two people can try it out at once and
while it isn't a game changer it's a
pretty cool feature you can use to
switch things up when you're gaming or
even watching regular TV now the sound
that you get out of this TV was equally
as impressive there's a built-in Harman
Kardon speaker system that's super crisp
and honestly it's like having a built-in
sound bar on the TV now I'm not gonna
lie
not too crazy about the looks but the
sound is impressive enough to make up
for it it gets very loud and offers some
good bass and clarity
especially for TV the other
brought back that comes from having this
sound bar like speaker attached to the
panel is that if you plan on using an
outside speaker system its kind of stuck
there for no reason but if you don't
have a crazy home theater setup with
external speakers you'll be happy with
how great the sound is and it'll
definitely save you the cost of having
to go out and buy a sound bar for it
looking at the TV as a whole is the
ultimate package with amazing picture
quality sound and features but it does
come at a really steep cost which is
probably the biggest con if you're
interested in picking one up if you want
to check it out for yourself hit the
link in the description but I can
wholeheartedly say this is the best TV
I've ever used watching the NBA Finals
will never be the same again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
