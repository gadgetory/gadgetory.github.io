going on guys - Joe average consumer and
yesterday Samsung announced a crazy
micro LED television which is modular
where you can control the size
resolution aspect ratio pretty much
being able to customize your TV and it
is pretty cool so guys check this out
you can see right here how its modular
before there were just two panels we
just added a third and that's kind of
the whole concept behind all of this and
this is still very much a concept it's
gonna be interesting to see what shapes
these actually come in but the idea here
is being able to add very easily panels
onto your existing micro LED TV and then
just kind of change the shape depending
on what you need now I think this is
actually really cool because I read I
have been struggling with figuring out
what TV size to get for our house we
have some pretty interesting walls in
there but this is gonna be a game
changer because we can actually
customize the TV to fit the wall itself
so this could be exactly what we've been
looking for you guys check this out we
got some other youtuber friends right
here Zack my man what's up what do you
think about the micro LED TVs man pretty
awesome they can combine they can take
all that technology and shrink it down
and it's they were talking about the
light inside of it
and 100% of the light is by projected
outwards so there's like no light loss
meaning that it's incredibly efficient
which I like yeah I mean who wouldn't
want that save energy especially when
you're adding a bunch of panels yeah you
don't have to worry about as much energy
consumption it's awesome pretty cool
Magnus magnets baby now we don't want
Zach bending any of these panels okay
definitely don't let that Sara so you
got the new studio what do you think you
gonna add some micro LEDs to it oh my
gosh I would love to have just a wall
all screen the wall yep we just happened
to be standing in front of over there
Jake look at the wall yeah yeah
so guys right here they're kind of
showing some examples look at the aspect
ratio of that but when you add a giant
panel to it it gets even wider which is
just nuts could you imagine being able
to completely control the size of your
screen and how you want it to look
exactly we haven't seen that yet this is
jinking honestly okay guys so what we're
looking at right here is a 146 inch TV
can you imagine that that's bigger than
my projector at home which is just nuts
so this is basically all those little
micro LED modules that we saw come
together to create a 146 inch panel and
yesterday we saw a 219 inch panel what
just goes to show you you can just keep
adding and adding and adding on to this
you can have an entire wall outfitted
with this and I could just imagine the
possibilities Man 146 I get rid of my
projector in a heartbeat for one of
these and there are tons of things that
were announced or are going to be
announced
Michael LED has really caught my
attention but the next big thing which
is really big is a K TV now to be
completely honest with you guys I have
yet to see an ake a TV in person they've
been a CES forever but I've never
actually stood in front of one and here
we have one I'm looking at it for the
very first time
this is a cake content that's crispy
look at all my gosh and this is detail
you don't really see with regular Full
HD but man aka John you can see all the
fine hairs on a bumblebee at that you
know this is crap I need this in my life
I can make my own 8k content I need one
so right here we've got standard
definition content but Samsung is
actually working on AI upscaling that
makes it a lot clearer so this is 1080p
on a 4k display or a 4k TV this is 1080p
on an a cave TV can I see a difference
oh you can oh wow yeah look at what
they're pointing out oh yeah you can see
some artifacting over here while over
here you don't see that at all
it looks just clear as day very very
impressive re help me take this down
speaking of AI and upscaling to a ke the
Samsung TVs actually have a quantum
processor 8k inside so the processor is
using AI and machine learning to do
things like detail creation so all of
those soft images where it just lacks a
lot of detail it's gonna use machine
learning to kind of fill that in and
make it look a lot nicer and also does
edge restoration which pretty much means
those blurry edges that we usually see
on standard definition content they're
gonna look a lot sharper I probably my
favorite feature is noise reduction I
hate seeing a lot of noise when I'm
watching something and basically for
those of you don't know what noises it's
pretty much those little little dots
that are flashing a lot of different
colors I'll show you guys an example
with some b-roll but this pretty much
gets rid of that and that is awesome and
guys that quantum processor also works
with AI sound so it enhances the audio
that you can hear when you're watching
whatever you're watching so they've got
some examples right here this is a
sports guy this is soccer being played
right now this is with the football and
this is with TV AI sound off and let's
see let's do TV AI sound
I send a media difference oh I can hear
the crowd a lot more you can hear them
clapping let me turn that off and I re
actually just pointed this out this is
exactly what I just described it's
actually enhancing the background sound
so like the crowd the realism of the
broadcast is what a saying and that's
exactly what I heard there before you
can read that so that's actually really
cool cuz we did what it's supposed to do
now let's see a movie so let's turn it
all off let's try a movie here oh what's
this
I like robots G is this specific room
Pacific room - that's that's your jam
man okay so this is just no AI sound
that's really impressive from the TV
let's try this from the sound bar
alright guys this is impressive I just
want it all Samsung just give give it
all to me please
alright so earlier we were able to check
out some of the AKG V's that Samsung had
but today they officially announced the
98 inch version of that and guys this is
massive and equality look at the detail
the pores on his face we just got used
to 4k and they already doubled it or
quadrupled it it's nuts and the fact
that this is a 98 inch TV it's just
mind-blowing I feel like the most we
usually see is 75 inches like in regular
stores but this is gonna be available
for pre-order today but not only do they
have ninety eight inch options but they
have 85 80 to 75 and 65 all in 8k so
guys we saw a lot of cool Samsung TV
stuff today
but there's still so so much more stuff
to check out and if you guys are
interested in what else dancing has come
out with I probably have some stuff in
other videos
there's a lot more CES to cover
but if you enjoyed this video be the
pool guy girl that gives it a thumbs up
few shout out to all the youtubers who
jumped in and gave some opinions but
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then it's your average consumer peace I
need a K baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
