and today we're going to be going over
some back-to-school tech if you're on a
budget now all the tech is inside of
this backpack and it's good from you
guys in high school and under but also
for you guys heading off to college so
what we're looking at here is a case
logic backpack it's got some weird model
number as a name but this is an awesome
backpack that I've been using for quite
some time and it's actually under 40
bucks so it's a really great value and
it has a lot of compartments and stuff
so that you can pack your books pencils
and a bunch of tech it's pretty
lightweight and durable so it'll make a
good companion for the rest of the year
now let's actually check out the tech
that's inside of this guy and you guys
can get a look around the backpack as we
go through it
so first thing we're going to check out
is the front pocket and this has a
couple of things that are absolutely
necessary so first off being a portable
charger if you're a techie you've got to
have one of these and this is the aki 12
thousand milliamp portable charger and
this guy will definitely charge your
phone a few times over so let's say you
forget to charge your phone at night you
can throw this in your backpack along
with your phone while you're in class
and charge it while you're learning it's
also got two USB ports so you can charge
multiple devices at once and it's even
got a little flashlight if you need it
don't think you will but it's a nice
little bonus and it only cost twenty
bucks so it's not going to break the
bank for some awesome utility and next
to it we've got the Microsoft arc mouse
now this has a very unassuming design
because it lays completely flat which is
great for storage but what's cool is
that you can turn it on simply by going
like this and then you can actually
start using it just like this and it's
actually really really comfortable so if
you need a solid mouse and you're
worried about space in your backpack
this will definitely perform well as
well as save you a lot of space since it
has this nice slim design and it's just
pretty cool that you could turn it off
like this now as we dig inside a little
zipper over here your core is going to
need a flash drive now you're going to
want to transfer some files let's say
you wrote an essay you need to print it
at school or the library you can do that
here this is a 64 gig Standish Drive but
what's awesome is that this is an OTG
flash drive and for those of you who
don't understand that you can basically
plug this into your phone if it has a
micro
usb-port most Android phones can use
this kind of feature so if you want to
use it outside of school like maybe
bringing your favorite shows when you
have some downtime at school if you're
in college then you can actually do that
and it's 64 gigs and it's cost like 15
bucks very inexpensive for a lot of
space this will definitely hold any
documents you need for class but top
here we've got another compartment which
has a microfiber lining so you can put
your glasses on glasses or anything that
you feel needs a little bit more
protection or a little more safety you
can throw it up top here and you'll have
quick access to it I've got some earbuds
in here because you know I love audio
and these right here are the NRG
synchronized 3.0 now these are some
solid earbuds they've got amazing build
quality for their price and they sound
pretty good if you like bass you'll
definitely be happy with these and
they'll be a nice upgrade from the
earbuds that come with your phone and
these are really nice quality for
something that only cost 25 bucks now if
you're like me and you prefer bluetooth
I've also got these and these are by Aki
their Bluetooth earbuds and as you can
see they're a lot easier to carry around
since they don't have the dangling cable
like a regular pair of earbuds but these
only resell for 20 bucks they sound
pretty decent and I think that's a solid
solid price for Bluetooth earbuds but
what's also great about these is if
you're not using them at the moment they
have this magnetic clasp so that you can
just go boom and you can just let them
hang around your neck for whenever
you're ready to use them pop them in
your ear and you're good to go
so these are a solid choice and for 20
bucks you really just can't beat that
awesome now over here in the side
compartment we've got some USB cables I
actually got put onto these by my
sister-in-law and they are awesome
they're 10 feet long they've got these
nice strong braided cables so they're
very durable you can find them as
lightning cables or micro USB so you've
got options depending on your phone but
if you want solid USB cables that'll
last you a lot longer than the ones that
come with your device these are a very
solid investment for 10 bucks I would
invest now let's check out what we've
got in the main compartment over here we
have the House of Marley champ mini now
this is a very tiny Bluetooth portable
speaker but what's cool about it is that
even though it's small and compact
it has some awesome and very loud sound
so if you're hanging out with your
friends after school no need for an aux
cord you guys can hook up with Bluetooth
and have a little party hanging out
it'll definitely be heard wherever you
are and it even has a little carabiner
clip so you can attach it to your
backpack and if you're walking around
you got some nice music playing
definitely very happy with this and this
thing retails for 50 bucks and for a
quality Bluetooth speaker that's a steal
and if you're not crazy about earbuds or
Bluetooth speakers you've got the sony
MDR 450 AP these are some regular on-ear
headphones but as you can see here i've
got the blue and they've come in a few
different colors so if you're trying to
stun on your friends you can definitely
do that with these and they're part of
sony's extra bass line so if you really
like that dump you can get that with
these but the low low now we've got
quite a few things here that you can use
outside of class but you're going to
need to get some work done
so here we have the Acer Chromebook 13
now I'm not super crazy about
Chromebooks but I think students get the
absolute best use out of these the Acer
Chromebook 13 gives you access to two
USB 3.0 ports an SD card slot and even
an HDMI port so that you can hook this
up to a TV if you happen to have one in
your dorm room or maybe at home and
you've even got a 1080p display which is
a pretty standard resolution but what's
really awesome here is that this guy has
11 hours of battery life and it charges
pretty quickly which is a very nice
bonus now the reason why I think Chrome
OS works really well for students is
that everything is internet and
cloud-based so if you're working on a
paper and the battery dies on you you
can rest assured because everything's
already been backed up online that's
really useful because that gives you
access to your documents anywhere you
are and what's also cool if you pick up
this Chromebook is that Google gives you
100 gigs of free Google Drive storage so
you can have a ton of documents and
files saved to your Google Drive account
and have access to them anywhere you are
definitely very cool for students but
that's about it for the back to school
tech guide that I've got here hopefully
you guys enjoyed it this is the budget
Edition and we're going to have a little
something more high end coming soon so
stay tuned for that but the whole next
video guys is your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
