and as you can see here we've got a ton
of packages now you guys seem to like
the last massive tech unboxing so I
figured why not do another one show you
some of the stuff that I'd be picking up
or things that were sent to me so let's
get into this so it's only right that I
let you pick the first one since I kind
of played on the last one where you want
to pick one nah it's like so go ahead
and pick this guy all right now what's
great about Amazon boxes is that you
don't really need an unboxing I you kind
of get it open oh okay yeah so this
right here is a shock or I guess stand
whatever you want to call it but it's
pretty much a dock for the MacBook now
I'm gay I got this because I plan on
doing a setup with the new MacBook just
my little spin on what the ultimate
settled would look like for it so I got
this in hand this about twelve style so
the packaging is pretty decent oh this
is super light huh and it also comes
with a few little slips here so that you
can use other MacBooks with it so if you
might have the MacBook Air or the
MacBook Pro whatever you might have they
got other little slot but uh what better
way to test it then to actually get the
MacBook I have a MacBook
all right where's well enough what this
big box I'm going to use my unboxing
light because I just liked it alright
little recipe okay okay so this right
here guys I don't know if you guys have
noticed but I have collected collection
of Xbox one controllers and now I bought
these stands to go with them
so I have so many actually displayed a
couple of pictures over on Instagram but
I actually have so many that I'm going
to have them on display in the gamers
paradise
so I'm going to make a cool little thing
out of it I actually got some that match
certain controllers that I have so
that's a typical black this is from the
halo 5 Edition line I've got a couple of
white ones
and what's this more black okay
can't go wrong with black King I'll
probably need a couple more but we're
getting there
oh snap we're not even done folks this
is oh okay so this thing I picked up
this is actually a carrying case from
the Nintendo switch now I have I already
have a couple of different cases but you
know no one's on the hunt for the best
way to bring around your stuff I was
either with them so I picked this guy
that because it looked like you were
able to bring around your Chargers in
this net up top that's actually pretty
cool so I can have my game cartridges
over here some cables need some chargers
and then the switch right here
it's a hardshell case this thing was
like super cheap please like maybe like
ten bucks Scotty's weird little punk
stone so I feel about that but uh yeah
I'll try it out now let's see what this
guy who's like oh I was waiting on this
one
and this is by nomads so nomads went and
created a portable charger with tiles
technology so basically if you lose this
thing you'll be able to locate it
so just to read off some quick facts
this thing has nine thousand milliamp
hours
it has fast charge technology it's got a
super ultra rugged construction on the
food that's life so let's pop this open
now another cool thing that re actually
just mentioned is that this thing is
awesome to have that Cal technology
because you typically carry your
portable charger in your backpack or
maybe your purse and if you happen to
misplace your bag of something we can
track it down what did but the thing is
nice it's got like a rubber texture
supposed to be really durable as you can
see it supports USB see I also have a
regular USB so the things should be able
to charge with any device actually
really liked it's one factor to those
shots nomads thank you for sending this
to me I can't wait to test it out now
I'm also got good hi let's open this
stuff and okay so these are the Aurora
nano leaf is actually the expansion
packs you might have noticed I got some
pretty built lights on these are the
Aurora and analyse definitely a really
cool way to spruce up a room this is an
expansion pack I have another set coming
like an actual set of nine this
expansion pack has three I'm going to be
making another set up somewhere else
kind of give back to life but yeah these
are awesome
a little expensive but they're really
really cool let's see what if you
actually just picked this up from bet
biphobic this is the Samsung gear s
three frontier dishes and okay so let me
explain why I picked this up now of
course everybody knows Thomson Galaxy s8
and recently came out I'm actually
trying to make that my daily driver I'm
kind of stuck on the iPhone but I need
to have a SmartWatch to go with it
I always use my Apple watch and Samsung
can't work with the Apple watch which is
currently why I'm wearing a normal watch
right now because I've already gone and
made the Galaxy s8 my daily driver so
let's pop this open and see if it will
be a good suitable replacement to the
Apple watch does not preclude this
actually looks pretty good okay so this
thing has like a little dial feature
here where you can kind of just turn
into selecting
kind of like the crown on the iPhone or
the Apple watch rabbit so you got this
thing here but this looks way higher
quality than I expected but let's
actually take a look at what else is in
the box so first things first over here
we've got this little charging cradle so
this thing's heart is wirelessly you
throw it on there broma charges and
let's also you have in the box
okay alright so we've got a cable to
charges with a micro USB cable Samsung
come over another
well another band in case you are a
small dress cool and then most
accomplished oh okay wall out a wall
adapter I am really really excited about
the s3 I want to make that work because
I like the phone so much um I think this
should help now we got this probably I
think it had to roll dramatically
so we've got what three big boxes left
look at this scare wife yeah okay so
this one not as exciting their skies is
a paper shredder
uh still attacked right uh
actually free god this is not be up here
this is for the office risk
unlike you're dropping stuff so this is
it the powershred six before CB review
big box little boxes are you gets two
together little box little box okay
little much oh that's for you guys I
like it okay now I already told you guys
that I've been rocking the s8 lately so
I got a couple of cases not much just
two speeding cases I got a clear one and
this black one over here so I'm going to
be trying these out let's just take a
look at them now I kind of like spigen
because their cases are pretty decent
and they're really cheap they're like
not cheap in terms of quality they
usually plastics like it's inexpensive
so this is what we've got over here I
think I'm going to like the black a bit
more this one seems pretty thick here's
what it looks like not bad at all and
add some grip so let's see what this
clear one looks like nah guys I'm gonna
have to pass
one is cool and all but it takes away
from the sleek black was got the a has
an IMAX palette on that one
and we still got more in this box this
is the joy conference our geing dock so
I got this thinking oh this is going to
be cool check out all the accessories
data this was going to come out with
this been income tools like now so it's
quite a bit after the switch got
released but it was so hard to get
things in stock that is only now came to
me and I don't even think it primitive
that useful none of that I'm using the
switch I know the droidcon never died on
me so it's kind of pointless but
whatever we've got our last thing here
are you guys ready for it I'll probably
be more excited than you guys here I got
my so now this is just a more of a
selfish thing here another model kit
yeah cool right now damn thing is big
this is probably going to be food aid to
even try to get into a video as a prop
but uh okay this is though I like it it
looks cool right
giant jetpack right cool oh yeah really
didn't say I wouldn't have complemented
so pretty much guys these are the spoils
for today so we got some things that are
going into different kinds of setups
some gaming stuff me trying to switch
over through the SK as a daily driver be
sure to look out for a video on that you
know I got a document it hopefully you
guys enjoyed it if you did these are
cool guys well that give this video a
thumbs up I'll catch you guys in the
next one
so that is your average consumer piece
I'm also giving away and that's aid if
you're a know links in the description</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
