right now and I've set it in previous
videos but if you don't know the house
is under construction and one thing that
we discovered when we moved here
unfortunately
the spot our house is in has like no
cell reception so we're gonna be relying
a lot on Wi-Fi calling and as of right
now this is my setup so we've got
optimum and we've got one of those dinky
routers that they give us the modem and
the router is just it's not the ideal
situation so I was really excited when
Asus reached out and wanted to sponsor a
video and hook us up with a mesh
wireless network and if you aren't
familiar with mesh Marlys networks I'll
explain in a second but this is going to
hopefully change everything in terms of
getting service and getting our Wi-Fi
spread throughout the house and the
solution they sent over is the Asus
library trio so this is the mesh
wireless network I was talking about and
for those of you who don't know what a
mesh wireless network is pretty much one
of these is going to act like the router
we're gonna connect this to the modem
and this will work like your typical
router would but what makes this mesh
wireless network special is that these
are going to now be speaking to each
other to increase the range within the
house now for me personally I'm a big
fan of mesh wireless networks in my old
apartment the walls were super thick and
I just had so many dead spots because of
it and it wasn't even that huge of an
apartment but once you include a mesh
wireless network it kind of fixes all of
that so I'm really excited to get these
in here but before we set this up I'm
gonna show you guys what my situation is
in terms of my cell service and my Wi-Fi
range so check it out I got one bar
perception LTE right now but don't let
the LTE fool you the speeds are actually
terrible so if I would have just hit a
speed test right now
check out the kind of speeds I'll be
getting
now this is actually good before it
wouldn't even hit one make a bit so this
is actually on the higher end of things
and in terms of uploads yeah that's what
I was seeing for downloads before and
this is pretty much what it's like
inside the entire house so the Wi-Fi is
a really big deal for me and when it
comes to our Wi-Fi signal we currently
get around forty something down when
we're actually close to the router but
once you go upstairs to the second floor
we're seeing speeds in like the teens
and the same goes for the basement so
now we're gonna go on to set up the Lyra
trio and see how it affects these dead
spots in the house okay so it is time to
get rid of whatever it is optimum sent
me and then put this guy in it it's a
really simple process all I got to do is
unplug this from the modem simple back
can't even unplug an Ethernet cable
alright so I get rid of this I'm gonna
unplug this guy okay so now I can plug
this in and then plug in this Ethernet
cable this and we're pretty much good to
go
as far as setting up that's all there
was to the hardware part of things and
now for the software setting up the
router what's cool about this system is
that I don't have to go into my browser
and type in an IP address or anything
like that there's an app and I've
already downloaded it so now I could
just jump into this and start the setup
process alright so this is pretty cool
the design of this thing is it got an
interesting design it looks much better
than this but when you power it on it's
got like these lights on the inside
which look really awesome I can't wait
to set the one of these up from the
basement alright but now it is time to
set this up using the app and it's gonna
be a pretty simple process check this
out okay so I'm setting this up for the
first time
gonna hit next boom here it is I was
connecting to it so when you're setting
up each Lyra you can designate which
room it's in so we're just gonna start
off with the living room continue and
now it's gonna search for the modem it's
gonna hook it up and then when we get it
all together all right so I just set up
the first Lyra and now I can set up the
next one and then I have to now go and
place the next one in the location of my
choice now this is what's important you
want to be able to cover all the bed's
bus that you have within your home so
those areas that I showed you guys where
I had a different speed those are gonna
be ideal locations for me to place them
I was pretty nice in terms of setting it
up the next pieces is that it'll tell
you how far away you are from the first
limit you set up so I've got a pretty
good connection here so that means they
should be able to communicate and spread
the Wi-Fi with no problem and this is
gonna be a pretty good spot for the next
one I'll just go this way here all right
and then I'll just hit next and I'll go
through the same set up and then all
three should be all good to go
and now with some speed test you guys
can see the benefit of a meshed wireless
network we finally have consistency
throughout the entire house and that's
awesome because those would sometimes be
dead spots then I'm gonna need you guys
to not make fun of my speed we haven't
moved into the house yet so we didn't go
crazy with the internet package so this
is what we're working with for now so
now that I have the entire house covered
in Wi-Fi I can use Wi-Fi calling without
any issue and not worry about it
dropping on me so that is going to be a
huge lifesaver so if you guys have any
questions about mesh wireless networks
definitely let me know what to comment
down below if you guys have similar
experiences let me know but hopefully
you guys enjoyed it and hopefully this
helped but till the next one guys your
average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
