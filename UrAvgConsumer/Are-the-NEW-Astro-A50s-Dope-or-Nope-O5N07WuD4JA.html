and today we've got a doper note of the
2016 version of the Astro a 50s
these a fifties are the latest addition
to the Astro line and it's safe to say
that upgrades are welcome but we've got
to see if the latest generation is worth
the crazy price tag my eight fifties are
the ps4 version and as I mentioned in
the previous video that's what I've been
playing a ton of Final Fantasy 15 on so
they have this black and electric blue
color scheme the ear custom headband
have a matte black finish which is nice
since it balances out the really shiny
plastic blue on the side on the right is
where you'll find all your controls like
your party and game rocker and that
allows you to adjust the balance between
the two I switch the power of the
headset on and off a button for Dolby
virtual 7.1 surround sound a 3-way eq
switch which has software to customize
your gaming experience and a dial for
volume control and on the left ear cup
we have an adjustable mic that's able to
be raised up so that it mutes the
headset and this is great in case your
parents or your nagging wife comes in
and tries to tell you to turn off the
game you can raise it up to the rest of
the party that's add to hear it and
there's also an xbox version that comes
in gray and green now if you happen to
own both consoles instead of having to
buy two completely new headsets
all you'll have to do is buy the base
station for the other consoles and
you'll be able to use your headset
between both systems now the separate
base station goes for about a hundred
bucks and I was able to order mine today
so I think they're officially available
and speaking of the base station I think
one of the most notable features about
the new a fifties is just that the base
station has a really clean look to it
and will most likely have no problem
being display it on a standard size desk
or TV stand but looks aside the dock is
actually really useful when you're done
gaming with the headset you can simply
dock them in and recharge the battery
which is super easy since the ear cups
also contain magnets that helps to stay
in place the station also contains a
switch that allows you to use your
headset seamlessly on your console or PC
it also contains a battery life display
which should help to avoid those
situations where you end up hearing that
warning beep because you didn't charge
your headset enough with this it's easy
to see if the headsets ready for use and
just how long you've got before you need
to throw it on the charger
and something that Ash will put a lot of
effort into here is making it seem like
the HPPS are always ready to go and that
comes in the form of easy charging and
some new battery saving features the new
way CFCs have an accelerometer which is
a really good move with this it can
detect when the headset is vertical and
in use on your head and also when the
headset is rested on inside and in those
moments the headset will turn itself off
in about 20 seconds or so so imagine
you're in the middle of playing and you
want to go make yourself a snack or
maybe go answer a call instead of having
to go and put these back on the dock all
you have to do is rest them down and
they'll shut off and what's great is
that when you come back the heads it'll
turn on and reconnect itself by the time
you lift them up and throw them on your
head which is honestly really seamless
and probably one of the coolest features
on the FFPs and what's great is that it
has all of this and a 15 hour battery
life and I've been able to have some
pretty long gaming sessions without
having these dire on me so with a 15
hour battery life easy charging and that
accelerometer feature it's no surprise
that these things feel like they're
always ready to be used I find these to
be really comfortable they feel pretty
average in weight and the ear cups while
plush provide a very nice feel for some
immersive gaming but something to note
though is that these ear cups have a
cloth like material around them so I
could imagine someone complaining about
their ears getting hot after a really
long gaming session but that hasn't been
my experience and if the ear cups just
don't work for you you can always switch
them out for the leather ear cuffs on
the $40 mod kit these ear cuffs will add
some extra noise isolation which is nice
but wasn't really necessary for me I
personally really like to feel to 850
and rank them pretty highly in comfort
now as for the mic I'm not really too
sure what to think I got a ton of party
cats and everyone said I sounded pretty
good but when you look online there are
tons of people complaining saying the
mic sounds like straight-up trash and
even though nobody complained in my
parties I still wanted to hear the
quality of the mic for myself and I did
a couple of recordings and I gotta say
guys for $300 gaming headset I
definitely expected more the a fifties
also have a noise gate setting that
allows you to keep the outside noises to
a minimum so if you've got kids running
around on some music playing in the back
you don't have to worry about your party
members hearing it and based on what
I've been told in my test it works
pretty well now of course we've got to
talk about the sound I think this sounds
great for gaming but not much else and
I'll explain why in a second and as I
mentioned before the hex that comes with
three different EQ modes there's the
Astra mode that's tuned to give you
precise bass and pretty balanced
everything else and these are the
settings for Astral's chosen to give you
the best audio experience they think is
available and then there's also the
studio mode the studio mode has a pretty
flat EQ and they intend for people to
use this with listening to music and
watching movies and last but not least
we've got the pro mode that's tuned to
give you less bass so that you can hear
things like footsteps and enemies all
around you and that's supposed to help
with that surround sound feature so if
you're a professional and let nobody can
go up on you so it's cool to switch
between those three settings and
honestly I really do like to audio
experience you get from these but really
just the audio experience for gaming and
it's cool to ask your included escutia
mode for listening to music and watching
movies but I wasn't too crazy about the
listening experience for music if you're
looking for a game you had said that
will also work as a pair of headphones
I said look somewhere else it's safe to
say I really do like these with a three
hundred dollar price tag though that is
a lot of money especially considering
there are cheaper headsets out there
like the logitech g930 threes that can
do an awesome job for about half the
price if you have the money burning a
hole in your pocket and you're really
bad about keeping your headset charged
then this heads is for you so for the
everyday person and it really hurts for
me to say this but I'm gonna have to
give you the note now these are
great-looking headphones they sound good
decent mic on them but there's no real
groundbreaking features it does have the
base station which is cool in terms of
charging it but when you've got these on
which is what really counts you're not
getting anything that you can't find on
another less expensive gaming headset
personally I think these are solid the
base station is cool but $300 is a lot
to ask for especially considering you
can get a console for less but that
about wraps it up guys hopefully you
enjoyed this video if you did be the
cool guy girl that gives it a thumbs up
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then it's your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
