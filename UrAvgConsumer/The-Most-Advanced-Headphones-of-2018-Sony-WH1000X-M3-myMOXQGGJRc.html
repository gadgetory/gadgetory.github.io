and today we're gonna be taking a look
at one of the most advanced Bluetooth
headphones on the market the Sony WH
1000 X Mark threes and let's give this
video a thumbs up if you love some good
all your average consumer headphone
videos it's hard to believe Sony's
already on their third version of these
headphones especially considering how
good the first two were but Sony
improved on a lot of things with this
one and here's what it's all about and
design wise these look pretty similar to
the last version although Sony did add
some copper accents to this black color
I think Sony has this new love for
copper accents we've seen it in a couple
of their new products I'm not mad at it
not something I would have expected but
it doesn't look bad
Sony went and changed the fuel the
materials that they used on this one to
make it quite a bit lighter and more
comfortable and to me that's something
this headphone needed to make it a bit
more attractive in comparison to
something like the bose qc25 2's which
we're extremely comfortable so Sony
focusing on the comfort here is a really
good thing now these are lighter than
the previous version because they seem
to forego some of the metal pieces and
just went straight up plastic which I'm
not mad at these don't feel cheap and
they're quite a bit lighter they also
changed around the ear cups they made it
a bit bigger so that they fit completely
around your ear which is something I
absolutely welcome it's nice to have
just plush ear cushions sitting right on
the ears like to me right now this is
nice
I could do this for hours and guys while
you still look like an extremely premium
pair of headphones I gotta say the mark
twos they just had a nicer look to me
they had these leather ear cuffs on the
sides these are now smoother so you
don't want to have that leather look
there's just some of those nice touches
that the mark twos had and made them
seem like an extremely premium pair of
headphones that the mark 3 is just no
longer have and it's not a big deal
unless you're comparing these two
side-by-side but coming from the mark
twos
I do kind of miss those accents and one
thing that's also been changed is that
the mark twos had this little gap that
you guys can see between the headband
and my head while the mark threes kind
of make that gap a lot smaller I can
barely get my finger in as I did with
the mark 2 so that is a nice addition as
well if you care about looks like that
so design wise I think Sony made a lot
of the right choices in terms of comfort
and durability but I do wish it had some
of those premium touch
that kind of made it feel like the 350
dollar headphones that they are now in
terms of features these pretty much
share the same tool box as the mark twos
with the touch panel on the side where
you can control your music so you no
longer have those weird buttons around
the ear cuts but I know a lot of people
aren't huge fans of them but it works
for me and for those of you who have
never seen these headphones and you
don't know about the controls there's a
touch panel so that you can swipe up to
increase the volume or swipe down to
decrease it and you can swipe forward to
skip to the next track and it's right
back to go back a track you can also
double tap to play and pause music as
well as answer calls there's also this
other cool feature where you can palm
the right ear cup and turn on the
ambient sound which causes the
headphones to drastically decrease the
audio of whatever you're listening to
and it turns on ambient sound so that it
can hear everything that's going on
around you so maybe if you're on the
train or in a park somewhere and you
kind of hear something funny but you
don't want to take off your headphones
whatever the situation may be you can
just put your hand over that ear cup and
kind of hear around you so that you know
you know what's going on I guess that's
honestly one of those things where I
probably wouldn't use the feature that
often but it's only where to take it
away it'd probably be a little upset and
with that noise canceling button you can
actually toggle between that or Google
Voice and you can do that in the
settings in your app but for the noise
canceling let's talk about that for a
second hands down the best noise
canceling on headphones you can find on
the market right now and these actually
go the extra mile and not only have this
one dedicated sound barrier for noise
canceling it can actually adapt to
whatever environment you are in using
the app it has this noise canceling
optimizer which is just absolutely
insane
so it'll adjust its frequencies to
really cancel out wherever you are and
it works very very well
best I've ever heard on a pair of
headphones so if you are a frequent
traveler this is going to be a godsend
if you are on the plane and you just
want to cancel all that rumbling out
this is going to be very very very nice
and there are other features like the
ambient noise features where it uses the
mics all over the headset so allow you
to hear what's going on around you while
still listening to your music so if you
want to be aware of your surroundings
you can definitely have
an example that I love to give is that
when I listen to my music while I'm
shooting or maybe even cleaning or doing
whatever it may be an area is calling me
I'll be able to hear her because I have
the ambient noise feature on so whether
it's your wife or your parents who are
calling you all the time and you don't
want to miss out on that call so they
don't yell at you in a few minutes you
can definitely have that feature on
which I think is a nice touch one thing
I will say though that is really really
annoying to me like I feel pretty
strongly about this guy's is that that
feature turns on when you're making a
voice call which makes absolutely no
sense I would only want noise cancelling
on so that I can only hear the person
that I'm speaking with but when it's
that ambient noise feature I can hear
someone else's conversation while having
my own conversation and I can hear my
own voice while speaking to the person
I'm speaking with it's just a very very
weird sensation and I've been trying to
turn off that feature for ever now since
I got my hands on these headphones but I
haven't been able to find where I can
turn that option off I can't find it in
the settings I can't find it on the
headphones so if one of you guys know
please enlighten me with a comment down
below but if there is no way to turn
that off I really do think that it will
be frustrating for someone to answer
calls while being out and about and
there's a lot of noise going on because
that will all get in on your voice call
I'm telling you guys it's it's pretty
annoying and you still have that NFC on
the left ear cup so if you want to pair
this to a device very easily something
with NFC you can just tap it to it and
impair it very simply without having to
jump into the settings and all that
crazy stuff and as I mentioned before
you can also map that noise canceling
button to be your Google assistant
button and I'll be honest with you guys
I haven't taken advantage of the Google
assistant very much with these
headphones but it is really cool to have
it there because this thing can read
text messages it can tell you what
upcoming events you have can read
notifications those kind of things that
you all have in your Google now it'll
give you access to all of that which I
really do like but I honestly just plop
my phone and just kind of look instead
but it is cool to have it there maybe if
you don't have your phone nearby
definitely a nice feature to have now
one of the other cool features is the
fact that this thing has a companion app
that allows you to customize and change
a lot of the stuff going on with the
headphones you can change the ambient
noise feature to include more outside
sounds
even less you can actually control just
how much you're letting in you can also
change the quality of your music with
the EQ so you can change it if you want
to have more bass more vocals whatever
it is you want to hear more that's
pretty standard stuff it's an EQ but you
can also change the soundstage so if you
want to feel like you're in a concert or
maybe if you're in a hall you can
actually change the sound time to give
you that feel so that you feel like
you're in a concert since these aren't
closed back headphones you're gonna be
able to get a wider feel if you want
it's it's all digital and whatnot but it
is a pretty cool effect not one that I
have ever used but it's there and since
these are player bluetooth headphones
the app even gives you an option to
prioritize sound quality or connection
quality so if you happen to be I don't
know playing basketball in the gym and
you've got your phone down on the side
you can prioritize that connection
quality since you'll be moving away from
your headphone so having that kind of
flexibility is really nice to see here
and Sony also has this D seh X option
that you can turn on or off and for
those of you who have no idea what that
is but pretty much this is going to be
able to push those mp3s and make them
sound like high resolution audio
basically it's going to improve the
sound quality you can turn it on to see
how it actually impacts your music but
it's supposed to be able to upscale it
and make it sound better and one thing
that are also really like is that it has
this automatic power off button so if
you're not using the headphones for like
5 minutes or 10 minutes you can set it
to whatever you want it'll automatically
turn off the headphones that way you're
not wasting battery so with the mark 3
is one of the biggest changes that
they've introduced is the inclusion of
USB type-c
and fast charging and total you'll get
about 30 hours of battery life using
these wirelessly and if you quick charge
it for just 10 minutes you get 5 hours
of playback and that is a very very nice
addition let's say your batteries die
while you're at work if you charge it
for 10 minutes right before you leave
you'll be able to use them right before
your commute back home and USB type-c
just makes it one less cable to carry
that I really really like that addition
so we've seen improvements in some of
the features charging and the overall
design but what about that sound quality
and I gotta say guys I am happy to
report that these also sounds awesome
but I don't know how Sony does it but
they've also improved on the sound
quality here in comparison to the mark
twos you're getting a very balanced
sound out of these and that's not to say
that these sound mediocre in any
department they actually sound
good base isn't super crazy it's not one
of those head thumpers they had the 950
and ones for that but the base is still
very present here pretty punchy but
vocals come in nice and clear it is a
really really good sounding pair of
headphones and honestly these are
probably gonna be my go-to in terms of
sound quality unless I'm looking for
some really thumping bass which I will
always always go to my 950 and ones for
I'm a guy who listens to a really wide
variety of music and I got to say these
have performed well for pretty much all
the genres that I've thrown at it I
think having that amazing sound quality
all those cool features and the improved
comfort have officially knocked these
off the bose qc25 s as my easy to grab
go to headphones whenever I'm traveling
it is going to be them 1000 X mark
threes always until something better
comes around the corner now we can't
ignore the elephant in the room you'll
want to know the price these are very
very pricy headphones they go for three
hundred and fifty dollars absolutely on
the high end when it comes to headphones
although some bluetooth headphones do
range around $400 if you go really
premium I feel like these at the 350
range are priced just right there at the
upper echelon in terms of sound for
Bluetooth headphones in terms of
features and now comfort so you are
getting your money's worth now one thing
that's great is that this thing also
comes with a solid case I'm not too
crazy about the way this case looks
there's a lot of colors going on from
the copper zipper handle to the gray
body and the blue mesh net there's just
a lot going on with this case not the
best looking in the world but it does
definitely get the job done in terms of
protecting your headphones and that's
what's most important and that about
wraps it up guys these are the most
advanced bluetooth headphones out right
now I definitely enjoy using them but
hopefully you guys enjoyed it hopefully
this helped you make a purchasing
decision whether or not you want to pick
it up but leave a comment down below on
what you guys think of it I'll have it
linked down below in the description as
well but total next one guys it's Rob
with consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
