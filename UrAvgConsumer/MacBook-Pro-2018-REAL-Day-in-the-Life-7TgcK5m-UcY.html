consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day in the life with the
2018 MacBook Pro and for those of you
who've never seen one of my real
day-in-the-life videos you're pretty
much gonna spend the day with me and the
MacBook Pro while we test out different
things like the battery life performance
all that good stuff and this is the i9
model so let's see how that goes all
right guys so right here we've got the
2018 macbook pro now this is the maxed
out version so I'm talking I 9 32 gigs
of RAM 4 terabytes of storage the bells
and whistles y'all so we're gonna unbox
this thing first and take a look at it
now personally guys I'm pretty excited
for this I've been editing on a MacBook
Pro for I think maybe like almost two
years now I only recently stopped
editing on it when we got the iMac Pro
so this is something that's very
exciting to me because when I'm on the
go I might be able to start using my red
cameras and have no issues in terms of
editing on this guy I'm hoping so we're
gonna see and I just want to put it out
there I did see Dave two these video
about the i9 MacBook Pros so I am a
little concerned but I'm going to put it
through its paces in the real world I
know I know how benchmarks and numbers
work but I want to see how it actually
impacts me on a day-to-day basis for the
things that I do with it and yeah looks
like a MacBook Pro ok so this has the
butterfly 3 keyboard so this is the
latest version of the new keyboard with
these butterfly keyboards I feel like
some people either love it or hate it
for me it's it took some getting used to
but this one definitely feels a bit
different so when they say it's quieter
it definitely is oh yeah that's much
quieter alright guys so we're actually
new house right now as you can see where
it got a lot of stuff going on it's
under construction
but I did want to get some product shots
of this new router system that I'm gonna
be putting in here it's one of the first
things that I'm putting inside of here
so I want to get some footage of that
with this camera I got to see 200 right
here so we're gonna be transferring all
of the footage that we shoot over to the
MacBook Pro over here this is 4k raw raw
light but we're gonna see if it can
handle that with no problem now this is
Final Cut Pro I'm gonna see how mine
handle is working with raw footage
hopefully it's not too bad I want to see
how it performs in the real world it
sucks that the benchmarks and everything
that it's doing so far in day's video
don't look too good so I'm a little
worried but we'll see how it actually
does once I get all this stuff
transferred over so took a little break
it is a super nice day outside
I just been typing on some emails and
alright so for the butterfly keyboard it
definitely does take some getting used
to but for the third iteration of it I
do like how silent it is like it's not
something that's going to change your
overall experience it doesn't feel any
better typing on it but it is quieter
which is pretty much what they're going
for
so is it comfortable that all depends on
your level of experience with it but I
can appreciate the subtle change alright
so I'm still outside decided to wait a
little bit watch some anime cuz I got
some food come in so I'm just shown for
a little bit one thing though that I
noticed is that the screen looks great
Mac books always look good in IMAX the
screens are always nice looking it gets
plenty bright for using outside but
something that's new with this Mac Book
is that it's got that true tone feature
so right here outside it's pretty warm
sun's out looks pretty good but if we go
inside where I have a much cooler light
you'll see that it's gonna make a little
shift so let's actually go test that out
and for those of you who don't know what
true tone is basically the screen will
adjust to make the colors seem more
consistent depending on your
situation so in a really warm room like
this
just eyeball testing it I have an idea
of what this looks like the screen is a
bit on the warmer side if I take true
tone off it looks much much cooler so
it's got a little bit more blue compared
to that orangey look when it's a much
warmer and if I go to a room that is a
lot cooler you'll see the difference so
now we're in a much cooler room you guys
can see the lights up there
these are a lot cooler and honestly it
looks the same to me even though I am in
a much cooler room now if I take off
true tone in here it got a little bit
bluer but not as much as what I saw in
the other room
that's actually really cool is one of
those features that I always take off on
my iPhone I don't really like true tone
on my iPhone but for here I feel like I
feel like I'd leave it on the MacBook
and just to hit you guys with a bit of a
battery update this one's a little bit
different not like using my phone for a
real day in the life because there are
some programs here that are way more
intensive than others like final cut
right now but just to give you guys an
idea of the kind of battery life that I
saw today we're at 66% I would say I've
been using this thing for like an hour
and a half maybe and with using Final
Cut Pro testing out a couple of
different things you know that
definitely does hit the battery quite a
bit but you know I also was watching
some anime like I said and just some
regular web browsing as well so you know
if you're gonna be using programs like
Final Cut or Adobe whatever it may be
anything that's going to really be
taxing on the computer you can expect to
have to plug this guy in ok guys so
right now I am doing a short little edit
of the unboxing that we did earlier just
some quick shots that I just wanted to
snap together kind of see how the
MacBook Pro handles that and just by the
looks of it it you know scrubbing
through pretty quickly as doing it with
no problem I will say though guys after
editing on the I'm
Pro for a bit I absolutely miss editing
on a Macbook because the touch bar on
Final Cut Pro is amazing the tool that
you get here where you can just kind of
chop certain pieces away the touch bar I
think people need to love it or hate it
I personally love it I think it offers
some good flexibility you get to do more
things than you could with just a
regular the regular buttons that are
there so I really like to touch bar and
especially in Final Cut Pro or forget
about it I love it Apple if you are
listening please make a make a keyboard
with the touch bar built into it a
separate keyboard that we could use on
the iMac or any other MacBook oh god
that would be so amazing
please alright guys so it is finally
time I fired a Final Cut Pro I've got a
4 minute and 12 second
for my timeline so we're gonna see how
long it takes to render this out and
export it so I got my little stopwatch
over here and just so you guys can know
what the CPU frequency is right now is
showing 1.37 okay so now that it's
rendering let's see it's at two point
nine two point nine five two point eight
eight alright guys so I just finished
rendering out the project took 11
minutes and six seconds to render out
and the CPU frequency jumped around
quite a bit you can kind of see the
usage right here so it's kind of got
this little it's a little spiky not
anything super drastic but this is it
right here this is when it started to
render out the project now I'm going to
export it and see how long that takes
alright so it just finished the export
in 2 minutes and 15 seconds and I gotta
say guys oh wow set three point eight
seven right now that's random but I
gotta say that was very consistently
staying at two point nine it did dip
ever so slightly a couple of times but
for the most part it stayed very close
to that
and a two-minute export for a
four-minute video that's not that's not
too bad now I do want to just compare it
to what I'm typically used to so I want
to see what that's like with my older
MacBook okay so this looks rather
sporadic just like this guy was so we'll
just see how long it takes okay guys so
it is officially the same time that the
render finished here so 1106 we have 56%
rendered for this older macbook pro 56%
so already this thing is almost twice as
fast so that's a you know good sign for
this but it also makes me feel like this
isn't the best comparison so I I think
instead of using a 2016 i7 we need to
get our hands on the 2018 so yeah go
ahead
alright guys day 2 now over here we've
got the i7 I went and picked it up and
we of course have our I line from
yesterday and we're going to do a render
comparison probably start them up at the
same time just so you guys know the base
clock speed on the i7 is 2.6 and this is
of course 2.9 so it looks like they're
neck-and-neck 13% 14% 14 14 and in terms
of the CPU frequency mmm this one
they're both pretty sporadic to be
honest if you're looking at this right
here
you can see they're spiking quite a bit
so something that I am seeing on the i7
you we've definitely got lower
temperatures here we're in the 70s for
Celsius and the i9 is still running
around the 90s so low 90s mid 70s on
this guy so I 9 definitely runs a bit
more hot so the i9 is done and the i7 is
at 92% 93 now okay so that's it looks
like the i9 finished 50 seconds faster
than the i7 and the i9 did run quite a
bit more hot it was between 15 20 to 15
degrees in different Celsius
so it was hotter of course but it didn't
throttle it enough to make this seem
super comparable they seemed to come out
the gates pretty close and then the i9
still was able to pull away so that was
pretty much my day and then some with
the MacBook Pro and this MacBook is
largely the same laptop we've been
seeing for the past couple of years but
with some changes more so under the hood
the overall design is the same and the
keyboard has been upgraded to be a bit
more quiet and protect from dust
entering underneath and one of the
additions that I like with the new
MacBook Pro that I didn't really get a
chance to talk about during the real
day-in-the-life
is the addition of Siri well at least
being able to call out to Syria by just
saying hey Siri so right from your
laptop you can call out to her and have
her answer questions
pull up websites and even open folders
which i think is a really cool feature
now we've gotta get sweat everyone's
talking about and that's the performance
is throttling present on the i9 version
yes it is now I've done a bunch of tests
with the i9 MacBook and it beat every
other MacBook that I put it up against
but when I took a page out of my boy
Dave's book and put it in the freezer I
did get even more performance out of it
so that does prove he is impacting the
performance mildly enough I did the same
thing with the i7 version of the MacBook
by putting it in the freezer and got
similar improvements to my results so
that leads me to believe that whatever
we're seeing happen with heat isn't
exclusive to the i9 processes now I
don't say this to say all 2018 Mac books
have brought owing issues but more so to
say that the i9 isn't acting any
differently than the i7 does in all
situations that I've tested so far so
throughout all of my tests the i9 and
the i7 behaved very similarly the only
difference was that we did see better
performance from the i9 but it also ran
quite a bit hotter now does that mean I
think the i9 version is worth the extra
$300 and for this question I felt like I
had to take a step back because I am a
content creator who works with large 4k
raw files and I had to take a step back
and kind of think about who's purchasing
this if I had to help a cousin or a
friend make a decision who wants a high
spec MacBook but isn't planning to work
on crazy projects like some of the stuff
that I work on or maybe some kind of
engineer then I would tell them go with
the i7 because honestly with
everyday tasks you're really not gonna
see the difference between the two and
at that point you could just save your
money and get some accessories or
something I do think it kind of sucks
that we won't get the maximum benefit
out of the i9 in our MacBooks but if you
really do like mac books you like the
style or maybe you exclusively use Final
Cut Pro like I do I do think that it is
going to be the best MacBook that you
can possibly purchase to get those kind
of things out of it if you don't mind
shelling out 300 bucks for it for my job
I personally would go with the i-9 but
that's not something I widely recommend
to everyone if you're not doing
demanding tasks it's not what you need
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully my little bit of
insight can shed some light on these new
laptops but if you enjoyed this video be
the cool guy or girl that gives it a
thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in the
next one so then it's your average
consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
