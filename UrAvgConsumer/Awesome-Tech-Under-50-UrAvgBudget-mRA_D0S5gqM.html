it's time for another episode of your
average budget this time with some tech
under 50 bucks now in my previous top 5
tech under 25 video a bunch of you like
the Audio Technica headphones hanger but
we're still looking for that perfect
headset stand well your wish is my
command
here we have two Satechi headset stand
this beauty is made out of aluminum and
comes in space grey silver and gold
perfect for matching with Apple products
which is definitely what they're going
for on the back you've even got a cable
organizer so it can keep the sleek and
clean look when displaying your favorite
pair of headphones at 35 bucks it's well
under our $50 budget and bonus it also
has a USB hub this hub has three
separate 3.0 USB ports which is great if
you just want to charge some devices or
you need some extra USB slots for your
computer you really can't beat the
functionality of having two products in
one and since most of us keep our
headset stand on our desks already you
might as well have some USB ports to go
with it now I could not make this list
without including the PNY 128 gig flash
drive now this is your typical flash
drive but it's got 128 gigs USB 3.0 and
you can find it for under 30 bucks for a
flash drive that's a lot of storage and
since it uses USB 3.0 it transfers data
super quickly and since that's a lot of
storage for a little bit of money ads
pick up two for myself so if you like
walking around with your favorite movies
or music you can do that with this
without it taking up too much space or
having to carry an external hard drive
it also comes in white for a couple
bucks cheaper and I'll of course have
links down below in the description if
you want to pick up your own and for my
iMac users who know the pain of having
to go to the back of the monitor to plug
something in here's the segment for port
USB hub this is an option that allows
you to access some of the ports from the
front and essentially turns one USB port
into four and it's the same silver color
as the iMac so it's super discreet and
all the USB ports are USB 3.0 because I
know you guys would accept no less at 30
bucks I feel like
every iMac user should have one of these
because it feels like quite the upgrade
now if you've been following me for a
while you know I love voice control and
that's pretty much why I picked this
next product this is the Amazon fire
stick the fire stick is a great option
if you don't want to watch cable TV but
you're down for some Netflix or Hulu or
any of the other popular apps out there
if you haven't jumped on a Smart TV just
yet the fire stick will definitely help
you hold out plug this guy into an HDMI
port and you've got access to all the
apps at the fire state offers what's
pretty awesome here is that you get a
suite of features Amazon offers from
shows to games
access to apps and if you take advantage
of their music streaming or cloud photo
service you'll be able to use that here
too now for me the game changer is
having that voice remote it's pretty
cool to be able to search your favorite
shows control what you're watching or
switch between apps with your voice and
the press of a button and it definitely
beats typing in the name to your
favorite show with one of those
on-screen keyboards now you guys know I
got to include some dope earbuds on this
list or this wouldn't be a video by me
I get countless questions about the best
affordable in ear buds and the RHA s500
eye is one way you get the most bang for
your buck now these actually made it
into a list of my top five favorite ear
buds so I have to let you guys know
about them for your average budget now I
kind of cheated with this one since
Amazon sells it for about 54 bucks as of
right now but it's worth the extra 4
bucks a promise now there aren't a ton
of bells and whistles with this guy but
it's a sturdy and dependable option even
though it's less expensive than some of
the other ear buds I'd like to talk
about it still has a premium feel and
clean design it comes with a black
braided cable with an inline remote and
ear tips that allow you to choose your
best fit I've been very happy with its
solid sound but bass heads you might be
a little disappointed here but at around
50 bucks you really can't beat the value
I definitely think you should pick this
guy up if you're looking for an upgrade
from your ear pods but you don't want to
break the bank and that about wraps it
up for this episode of your average
budget with some tech under 50 bucks
hopefully you guys enjoyed it and if you
be the cool guy or girl that gives the
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you
guys in the next video
soll denn is your average consumer proof</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
