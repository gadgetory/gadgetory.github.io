and this right here is the 2018 out eq7
and huge shout out to Aldi for not only
sponsoring today's video but also
letting me hold down this q7 for a week
so I can have fun with all of the tech
inside now jumping into this car the
first thing you'll notice is the amazing
cabin not only is it insanely spacious
but it's also packed with LED lighting
which makes getting into this thing and
driving at night feel like you're in the
future not to mention the panoramic
sunroof really adds a nice touch to the
interior as well but you cannot ignore
the display that comes right out of -
right here when you turn the car on this
thing is awesome now this is my first
time driving an Audi vehicle and I gotta
say guys it is very very smooth the
suspension system in here is great
because I drive around Newark a lot and
there are some potholes here and there
so it is a bit of a bumpy road but this
thing handles it like a champ so if you
happen to be in an area where you get
dealing with bumpy roads a lot the
things gonna be able to take care of it
now in a situation like what we're
seeing right now guys where there's a
ton of traffic the q7 has an awesome
feature called traffic jam Assist and
what this basically does is allow the q7
to get some control while you're in
bumper-to-bumper traffic which basically
means it's going to hit the brakes
whenever it's dealing with a car in
front of it you can actually set the
distance which is really nice right
right now this thing is breaking and
going all on its own of course I still
want to be very aware and cognizant of
what's going on around you but it's
great to have the assistance so you're
not constantly hitting the gas and the
brake gas brake gas brake let the car do
that and not only is it accelerating and
braking for you but it also has Lane
Assist where it gives some slight
adjustments so that you can make sure
you stay in your lane
now this isn't fully autonomous or
anything but the slight adjustments that
you're seeing to the wheel is the Audi
doing it itself of course I've been
keeping my hands on the wheel because
you want to be able to take over at any
point but it is cool to see it
nonetheless so right now saying please
take over steering it gave me the
warning so now I can just jump on and do
what I have to do and now I can't you
see that being very useful for like
those morning commutes where you know
you're always dealing with rush-hour
traffic
it would be very nice to just kind of
lay back just a little bit more than you
typically would now let's talk about
some of the actual tech inside of this
thing and the q7 is packing a ton from
different sensors and cameras used for
parking and the traffic jam assist
feature to the virtual cockpit behind
the wheel this thing has a ton of
information readily available to you and
it's all customizable and you can jump
into it very easily here you've got a
large display that tells you everything
you typically see on your dashboard and
then some you can change the view from a
standard look to one that expands and
gives you a bit more info and the
ability to have your map right here in a
large view is definitely useful and I
can appreciate this thing running at 60
frames per second because it makes going
through the menus smooth especially
considering how much were all used to
our smartphones and speaking of
smartphones this car has that pop of
display that provides a ton of tools and
software that you can control your ride
as well as gives you access to apple
carplay this is actually my first time
using it and it's nice if you're looking
for a simplified layout of the apps you
don't want to access from your car and
there's actually a pretty responsive
touch panel in the center console that
allows for easy navigation through the
menus now hands down guys my absolute
favorite feature on this car is honestly
having the speedometer right on the
windshield now I know this isn't some
kind of brand new feature or anything
but it's the first time I've ever used
one and it is mind-blowing I love not
having to look down at my dashboard to
see my speed it allows me to just keep
my eyes on the road and what's even
better is that the speed limit is right
above my current speed so I don't have
to look around for any science to see
what the speed limit is the car will
basically always tell me and even
updates to let you know when you're in a
school zone so when you have to be
really careful you have it right in
front of you now looking down at your
dashboard check your speed isn't really
a big deal but that's what I love about
tech you're able to make what's
seemingly a small change and really
improve the experience like my driving
experience right now is so much better
because I don't have to look down
constantly to check my speed I like that
and of course we've got parking assist
here so we've got cameras set up all
around the car and what's kind of cool
with the q7 is you can kind of change
the angle of the cameras that you're
using so if you want rear cameras of
course you have that as an option you
can even see what's on the edges of your
car so you got a bit of a wider view
there you can also see what's in front
of you and the edges of the front of the
car but my favorite has to be being able
to see what's all around your car so
it's like a top-down shot this thing is
just amazing being able to see what's
around your car completely all in one go
that's good stuff
and just like that look at this I'm not
worried about hitting the car next to me
I'm not worried about hitting the little
thing behind me
perfect now this right here is a feature
at which my car had I am finally parking
don't don't get me wrong but it'd be
nice to see a top - out of the car - and
you've also got the bells and whistles
like these amazing Bose speakers which I
fell in love with but there's a ton of
features here guys if you want to learn
more I'll have links down below in the
description so you can check out the
Audi q7 this car has some amazing tech
and it's a really smooth Drive and Audi
I am on to you I know you want to make
me buy this car and I'm mad that it's
working but that about wraps it up for
this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
if you did be the cool guy or girl that
gives this video a thumbs up and I'll
catch you guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
