consumer and today we finally have the
return of the yurevich budget segment
where I go over tech items that can
pretty much fit the average budget which
aren't really expensive and they're
pretty cool gadgets that might not be on
your radar so today I'm going to be
going over the initech 3 port USB hub
now this has a lot of cool little
features so hey let's not waste any time
let's get right into it and alright guys
so first thing I had to do is let you
guys know the price since this is your
average budget so this retails for about
$20 you can find them on Amazon I'll
have links down below in the description
for you to check it out but $20 for this
guy isn't bad at all
this has USB 3.0 so it has 3 3.0 USB
ports and typically when you're buying
USB hubs usually find those that are 2.0
so they're not gonna give you the
fastest data transfer speeds so I think
that 3.0 ports on this guy in that $20
is definitely a great deal now there are
also different models of this USB hub
this one happens to have the SD card
reader which I think is a huge bonus
there's also another one that has a
Gigabit Ethernet port so if you're
somewhere where there's no Wi-Fi you can
plug this into your computer and you can
get internet through the ethernet port
also there's another one that provides
for 3.0 USB ports instead of 3 but you
don't get like the SD card reader or you
don't get the Gigabit Ethernet port so
there are three different variants I of
course think that the SD card reader is
the best because I use my camera quite a
bit so if I want to check out some media
on my laptop or tablet whatever I want I
can do that with this now you might have
noticed that I said tablet and that's
because this also functions as an OTG
cable so if your device has a microUSB
port you can actually plug this in and
it can read external drives so if you
have a USB Drive you can plug this in or
a hard drive you can plug this in and
you can actually read it on your Android
device or maybe your Windows Phone
whatever you want to use to connect this
to it it'll work pretty well
now I haven't tested it with a Windows
Phone but I did try it out with my
windows surface and I actually don't
need the micro USB part because
does have USB port but what's really
cool about this in my opinion is it can
turn a laptop that only has maybe like
one or two USB ports and I say one
because the surface pro 3 has only one
USB port and you can just plug this in
and you pretty much get all these extra
ports so if you had to before it becomes
four if you only have one you get three
and you get the SD card reader in case
your device is too small like a MacBook
Air 11 inch can have four USB ports an
SD card reader 20 bucks definitely good
stuff in my opinion and I think just
being able to you know have access to
all these ports on a laptop or even your
Android device is really great so if
you're dealing with a device that
doesn't have a lot of storage and you
want to bring like a flash drive or a
hard drive this is definitely gonna be
good stuff you can actually use the SD
card reader as well whatever you want to
do there's lots of options here and I
think this is really great fast transfer
speeds you can't beat this for 20 bucks
I really like it actually you had to get
two of these because I got one for my
girlfriend so she could use with her
surface pro 3 and I think that this is
pretty much a really really good value
for anyone who feels like they're
lacking in USB ports but they don't want
something huge that'll take up a lot of
space this is definitely very very good
stuff now as for the build quality of
this thing it's not too crazy it's made
of plastic here it's got a nice brushed
metal on the top but um you might get a
little couple a couple of scratches
depending on where you leave this but
the overall build quality is really
solid and the only other thing is that
the part that turns it into an OTG cable
is hanging on by a small piece of
plastic here it's nothing too bad but um
I do you just have to be careful not to
like rip it off or anything like that
but overall guys I really really like
this product and I think that it's very
useful so definitely check this out if
you're looking for more USB ports or you
want an SD card reader on your laptop or
if you want to connect media to your
tablet without putting sway Sting all
the storage on your device so this is
definitely good stuff guys you
absolutely have my recommendation I love
this thing and that's about it for this
your average budget segment guys I'm
going to have another one in about two
weeks so stay tuned for that and I'm
gonna be featuring all kinds of products
guys all kinds of stuff whether it's
headphones things like this just wait
for it it's gonna be good stuff promise
let me know what you guys think about
this in the comments down below and I'll
catch you in the next video till then
it's your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
