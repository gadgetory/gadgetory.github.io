who you were expecting but we decided to
switch things up a little bit today and
I'm gonna be doing the real data life
with the pixel three Axl now I'm sure
you guys have heard about it it's
Google's new budget ition of their pixel
three lines so I decided I would just
take it out take you guys along with me
and just have a little fun with it so
we're gonna test it out the battery life
picture quality of course you know we
have to and a ton of other features that
come on the pixel three Axl so let's see
how it did so right now the video you're
seeing in the audio you're hearing is
coming right from the pixel three Axl oh
we didn't really decide well in advance
I'd be doing this video kind of last
minute so I have no equipment on me but
I figure it's the perfect time to at
least test the front-facing camera it
feels really really close so the pixel
three Axl we don't have that second
camera to do the wide selfie right group
selfie so I'm kind of just stuck with
this if I have an option I definitely
would push it back it just feels like
you guys like all my face oh my gosh but
you guys are in the bathroom with me
right now because I am getting ready for
the day I have to do my makeup and
listen to music while I'm doing my
makeup so I will check back in when I
finish all that so one thing I think it
used to is navigating an Android phone
it's not that difficult it's just having
it used to it after using an iPhone
right there that's not baby yes but it's
not that difficult it's just you know
sweetie it used to a little bit okay so
makeup is done oh this is kind of light
here umm I finished my makeup and I'm
heading down to walk cookie and then
feed her I was listening to music for
about uh about thirty minutes do a
makeup because the job before percent
which isn't that bad at all I don't
think it's that practical for me every
morning to be listening to music on my
phone but you know four percent that's
really not that bad
Wow this is not good looks like my old
myspace pictures anyway while cookie
eats in her princess bed ridiculous
well she um I sit here and I just
usually just scroll social media if I
leave she won't eat so I have to make
sure that I'm sitting right here because
she's spoiled so I'm gonna be just
scrolling Instagram and you know waiting
for her to finish this gray hair well no
it may be great
I've been graying since that I was in
college so don't come for me don't call
me old but I think it a little bit
sidetracked
I was watching YouTube of course cookies
definite done eating so I need to get
out of here and get on with the rest of
my day
so what Hooper's on its way but I just
realized is I can't really easily pick
my earpods
and this does have a headphone jack so
I'll just use my like little airplane
headphones today why not start now I'm
headed to the studio I'm in an uber and
I've been watching YouTube the entire
time it's been what about 15 minutes so
I've been watching groomsmen and dances
and Bridal dances I don't know but
anyway I say all that to say that the
viewing experience is great so even
though this is a less expensive phone
assilex what's a version of the three
you still get that great OLED display
you get full HD plus so it's just nice
that you can have to compromise on that
with the cheaper phone and shout out
through this headphone jack pretty cool
that I can just plug in and listen I
mean honestly I don't feel like it's
necessary once you have a truly wireless
pair of earbuds or bluetooth headphones
that are already set up to your phone
but I mean it's nice you know keep some
emergencies kind of thing why not and
just a quick update of course the
batteries at 80% and a screen on time is
an hour and twenty nine minutes I think
is really good I'm excited to see what
this will do after an entire day so I'm
finally at the studio we are no longer
having to use this pixel 3a for our
video camera but I do want to talk about
the colors here so this is white ish
which is like fine it's basic but
purplish is really nice I feel like if I
were meaning this phone I'd make this my
this would be my color that I choose
because it's pretty nice it's not like
in-your-face purple it's a purple-ish
and earlier we talked about not really
having to make many compromises even
though you're getting a really nice
price tag and that's the same thing here
so you can still have your squeeze to
activate
assistant just like on the pixel three
you squeeze it what is the temperature
tomorrow so yeah you have that still
accessible to you but this time with a
nicer price tag right now I'm gonna go
back to answering some email there but
so many hours in the day and Jed has a
lot to do so when it comes to email and
pretty much its ghostwriter so I'm just
gonna go out there and do that right now
beside okay so I just devoured some
delicious Chipotle and I was still
answering email as I did that so I think
it's good to talk about now feeling a
hand when it comes to this phone in
particular like the 3/8 XL I don't
really like the feel on my hand and
that's muling because my hands are
smaller
I don't like larger phones so even when
I have like my iPhone 8 I still got the
8 and not the plus I just don't like
plus versions of phones it just makes
things a little bit awkward so while
answering email or texting today I kept
feeling like I wish I had my iPhone with
me because I'm so used to just like
typing really fast so I've been kind of
like slowed down today I'm using this
this phone but if I could choose to
start the day over I definitely would
just go with testing the pixel 3a
instead of the Excel it's just not very
comfortable for me at all but in terms
of whether it's like solid or slippery
it feels neutral does it feel slippery
or doesn't feel super solid I still want
a case but it's because I'm used to it I
don't feel like I'm gonna drop at any
moment alright but how does it compare
to the original pixel 3xl in terms of
the body how's it feel initially it
feels like a little heavier but doesn't
feel like less or more premium than this
one no this one is not feel cheaper to
me at least flip it a couple of hours
I'd be using the phone here and there
just did some shopping for massive tech
on boxing and now we are about to watch
a video while it renders I figure I'll
have my resident game player give us
this perspective give us his perspective
on game playing the processor hey
everybody
on whose channel is this oh nevermind
alright guys so we're gonna start up a
game really quickly so doesn't game I
like to play a lot it's called regalia
law you might have heard me talk
about it but I feel like this is going
to be a good indicator on whether or not
that processor which is a Snapdragon 670
which is a bit weaker than the 855 that
the regular pixel 3 has in it so we're
gonna see just how this game holds up
hopefully it plays well let's check it
out now something that I'm noticing when
playing games is I'm getting a few drop
frames and for my folks who aren't
techies and who don't know what that
really means
it means I'm seeing the game skip ever
so slightly now I can play this no
problem and get by just fine
but I am noticing the performance
difference between this and something a
bit more higher-end
so the wolf pixel is really well known
for its camera so we have to make sure
we test out the camera in a bunch of
different ways right now we're gonna
talk about the selfie camera we'll do a
regular selfie then we do a portrait
selfie and see if it's comparable to
that of the three and the big thing here
is that you're supposed to be able to
still get that amazing camera but for
that nice nicer price tag so this is
this one isn't be done with their
regular camera let's take a look
oh that looks a little bit blurry oh
wait hold on I spoke too soon it was
processing so now it's good now that
looks really good so that's one thing I
noticed it does take a little bit more
time to process than the regular pixel 3
does that's why you thought it was
blurry for a little bit yeah yeah I
would have definitely tried to retake it
so yeah this looks really good it's nice
and sharp I would totally post this
picture if I liked the overall image but
I think the quality itself looks really
really good
so now we're gonna go to portrait mode
and I'm really interested to see if it's
gonna have the nice blurring effect
especially around my hair sometimes
cameras really struggle with that let's
see hmm
okay so attempt number one was a fail
and let's do one more
ooh so that's nice let me zoom in you
know just to make sure it really got it
this looks great that looks really good
okay Porsche promote selfies a check I
mean even around the frizz in my hair
too though like yeah it's not so bad you
could definitely post that and we've all
seen the memes on the internet about
Android phones and Instagram and
snapchat and the horrible quality but
the pixel three actually has something
called the pixel visual core it allows
anyone who has a pixel 3 to take a
picture on Instagram or snapchat and
have a really nice
high-quality photo unlike those other
Android phones but here's where the
compromise comes in guys for the Florida
dollar price tag you do not get the
pixel visual core for the 3a so I'm
going to take a picture on Instagram and
see what kind of quality we're working
with now we have a pixel 3 XL and we're
gonna see if there's a difference if one
is better than the other all right and
this is the pixel 3 with pixel visual
core so I'm taking a look and I do not
see a difference whatsoever like at all
either way it really doesn't matter
because you can use your regular camera
for taking pictures and upload directly
to Instagram you would only really care
if you really need to use things that
the Instagram camera gives you like
boomerangs or filters or those types of
things which I don't really use so I
don't care and this can't be a pixel
video without actually taking a look at
the rear camera you know pixels are
known for their really awesome camera
quality so I figure this is a great
place to take a nice photo we've got
this nice Prudential Center here if
you're from New Jersey or especially
Newark you know the Prudential Center so
this is an awesome view alright so I
guess that's good now I am NOT a good
photographer like jet is so it looks
pretty good to me I would look at the
dark parts just to make sure we have
still some detail the dark areas yeah
you can even see the reflection in the
water yeah I'd say it's a pretty good
picture it's nice and sharp too
but now we're gonna get out of this rain
and get to a better environment and
Sochi because this isn't waterproof all
right so back inside the studio where
it's nice and dry weird take a picture
of this random figurine here I don't
know where it's from but it has a lot of
color okay well that that and then let's
also do a portrait mode one okay so that
came in closer yeah so this camera
actually
okay so this is the first one we take
the one that does not have portrait mode
and yeah I said it looks pretty good you
can still read out the engravement here
tells us Perea colors look good okay and
this is the portrait mode one it looks
really good too I think it's so crazy
that this is being done with software
yeah cut around that really well the tip
didn't get as much right here that
little edge it's a very hard piece to
get those from really really tiny all
right so it is nearly 1 a.m. we just got
home we're working very
on a video so I'm exhausted but the
battery is still going strong and this
thing is just not dying 39 percent we've
had almost 5 hours of screen on time see
you guys in the wrap-up I'm going to bed
I'm exhausted
so that was my day and first shout-out
to judge for doing these because they
are not easy he definitely some look
very easy whether or not but I really
did enjoy using the pixel 3a XL for the
day there were two things I really liked
about it the first was definitely the
battery life I'm something that is on my
phone constantly like I do email I text
all the time I'm always on social media
so it's really important for me to have
a really great battery life and I didn't
have to stop not once to charge it now
you guys know I use a battery case on my
iPhone and I honestly would not be able
to use my iPhone for the full day
otherwise so being able to have that
nice slim form factor that's not thick
like this and all-day battery life was
really really nice and my second
favorite thing hasn't been the camera
specifically the front-facing camera
which I know is kind of like a weird
comment to make sense builder typically
lower quality but any other Android
phone app tested that judges gotten into
the studio I've never been impressed
with a front-facing camera and this one
I think was better than my iPhone I'm
really surprised because nothing usually
beats my iphone to me to meet don't come
from and of course the rear cameras are
really good too I'm so impressed I've
been able to add that bokeh effect with
just software and we also compared the
pictures to the three and there's really
not that big of a difference to me and
another thing I really enjoyed was the
display I don't think we're really
worried about the bezels because they're
a little bit thicker than the ones that
are on the three but I really enjoyed it
and I didn't really notice them as much
they didn't interfere with me using the
phone that day so addition to the bezels
there are other compromises that do come
with giving the three a over the three
and one of them is wireless charging so
there is no wireless charging in the 3a
that did not impact my day at all so I
don't use wireless charging like that
but if that's something that you really
rely on every day Judd takes this phone
and puts it on the wireless charging pad
every night then that's not be something
you should consider before making your
purchase
but another drawback that might be a
bigger deal if you're someone who's a
really big tech head is the fact that
the processor isn't as
the one on the three it's a weaker
processor than the original and what
comes standard on today's flagships but
for me again I did not even notice a
difference but Judd did though when he
was taking pictures he saw that it took
a little bit longer to process photos
and when he was playing games he saw
some stalling a little bit so if you're
someone that spends a decent amount of
time on your phone playing mobile games
then this is not the phone for you
because I know after a while the
freezing and the stalling can get really
upsetting but even all that considered
if I have to choose an Android phone and
I want a budget I would definitely
consider the three a not that three a
excel though because as I mentioned
before the filming hand to me was just
not comfortable at all but overall nice
job Google it's kind of refreshing to
see a phone that gives like near
flagship like experience without having
to shell out a thousand dollars so if
you're someone in a budget and you
really want a great camera awesome
battery life and stock Android then this
is FAA phone for you to consider but if
you're a power user and you really value
things like a fast processor or special
features like wireless charging then I
probably doubt for other options but
it's really surprising we can get in the
four-inch dollar range but that's not it
guys hopefully enjoy Spang the day with
me and I happen to see good but if you
enjoyed it make sure you give this video
a thumbs up go follow me on Instagram
and I'll catch you guys another one
