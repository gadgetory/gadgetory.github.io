want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video he was going on guys
to Travers consumer today I'm going to
be doing a really quick unboxing video
of the beats by dre studios now I say
really quick unboxing because pretty
much everyone on YouTube has done one
already so a friend of mine actually
purchased these and I was able to
convince him to let me open it and unbox
it for the channel and I'll probably get
a little time to play with it so I could
give you guys a decent review as well
alright so let's not waste any more time
let's get right into it
alright so here we have the studio's a
quick look around the box you know
standard beat stuff and let's rip this
open plastic popping
there we are of course you can expect
this thing pretty much the same
packaging as most of the are beads a
little quick look at the box and when
you pop open the side when you pop open
the side you see the hardshell case that
your beats are in and the plastic that
it's wrapping so put that on the side
here and when you pop open this little
right here it comes with the two triple
A batteries that you'll need to power on
the beats as well as a cord um as well
as two cables one with control talk and
one without the black one being the one
with the inline remote use them using
control talk here you how to have some
airline adapters as well as this some
larger adapter for like I guess DJ use
and things of that nature
and you also have a box here with your
microfiber cloth and your manuals and
other products and stuff so we put these
back
I put aside the batteries already and
I'm going to grab the B table with the
inline remote close this up then we can
put this pretty much on the side and
inside of this plastic with the
hardshell case we will find the studio's
now this is a pretty nice hard shell
case um that it'll definitely protect
your your headphones it'll be easy to
carry around you can just throw it in a
little bag or something and this little
clip here makes it so that it can latch
on it's like a bag for your book bag or
anything of that nature open it up and
here we have the studio's now this case
also comes with a little pouch here that
comes out so you have the little side
pouch which I put in your I guess your
cables and things like that pretty much
there you are
it was a nice little kick when you flip
it up open here you have a little
plastic telling you I guess like little
instructions on how to put in the
batteries or you have to switch on the
right side and you know these are your
standard studios nothing new nothing
special pretty much everyone has them
and if you don't I'm going to give you
guys a quick little close-up nothing too
long just show you um what it all will
look like up close and pretty much here
they are on the right side you have the
on
switch and here's where you put in your
batteries on the left side a little
sticker that indicates how to do so and
pretty much that's it now I don't want a
pair of these myself really because I
don't like the fact that this needs
batteries to operate and that and that's
just pretty much a no-go for me and
pretty much that's it for the unboxing
guys I don't want to spend too much time
on it like I said because there are tons
of videos out there and I don't want to
spend too much time on something you've
probably already seen so if you have any
questions please feel free to let me
know please feel free to rate comment
and subscribe please definitely do
subscribe as it helps me out a lot this
has been your average consumer thanks
for watching till the next video peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
