and I was able to spend a little bit
more time with the new iPhone 10 before
it officially launches so I decided I'd
let you guys know some of my favorite
features as I got to play with it first
up we've got face ID now before you say
I know this one people were a bit
apprehensive about since this replacing
touch ID but as I got to spend a little
bit more time with the phone I got to
see how responsive and easy it was first
off setting up face ID literally takes
just a few seconds you just have to set
up face ID and pretty much draw a circle
with your nose so the camera can analyze
your face fully in 3d and even if you
happen to miss a spot while you're
setting it up all you have to do is
point your face in the direction that
needs to be filled in and boom you're
good to go
and I remember when I first set up touch
ID I never thought the process was that
bad but setting up face ID beats it by a
long shot instead of having to
constantly lift your finger and get a
bunch of different angles you literally
draw a circle with your face twice and
you're done and I still see a lot of
people asking how easy is it to fool
this camera well it's not easy at all
you can't use someone else's face you
can't use a picture or video heck
someone can't even take your phone while
you're sleeping and try to scan your
face it's not gonna work because the
camera will know that you are resting
you're sleeping and it will not unlock I
personally think that's really cool and
honestly it's just as fast as touch IV
when you want to unlock the phone I
thought it was gonna be a little bit on
the slower side since it has to scan and
then you hit the swipe button no as soon
as you pick it up you can swipe it open
because it's scanning your face as soon
as you touch it another cool little
tidbit about face ID is that if you have
notifications you can actually have them
hidden when someone else picks up your
phone but when you pick up your phone
it'll know it's you with the phone in
the hand and it'll show you the
notification so you can see the details
of every notification which i think is
really cool and now since we have those
fancy complex cameras built into the top
of the phone we can access to a very
important feature and that's an emojis
now I'm not the biggest emoji user out
there but there are going to be a ton of
people re included who are really gonna
love this the camera can detect 50
muscle movements to allow you to pretty
much create a unique exper
with one of the characters it has you
can even take a picture of your aunt
emoji and use it as a sticker in your
iMessage conversation which could
actually be pretty useful if there isn't
an emoji that gets your exact expression
at the moment and you can also record
messages with your aunt emoji so that
you can send that and I think those are
about like 10 second clips so it'll
record your voice and your facial
expressions so you can go ahead and talk
through poop as much as you want and
someone related to that is actually
snapchat now you can have more accurate
filters for your snaps that map onto
your face really well even taking into
account where the light reflects off of
your face so it looks more realistic
yeah I'm telling you Harry did not want
to put that phone down now another thing
that I'm personally really excited for
is that new big OLED display so I'm
pretty hyped to have this big beautiful
display on a smaller body than the 8
plus it was actually surprisingly easy
to use with one hand which is usually a
concern of mine when we're dealing with
these phones with the really big
displays and one thing that I can
appreciate about this new screen is that
it changes the dynamic of how we
interact with an iPhone for the first
time in years which leads me to those
new gestures now trust me I know a lot
of people don't like change and the idea
of having to get used to new gestures to
get around the phone probably doesn't
sound appealing to some people but after
being able to really sit down with this
phone and use it for a while I gotta say
guys it is really easy to get used to
since there's no physical home button
you swipe up from the bottom every time
you want to go home and even our used to
film for less time than I did and she
still felt like it was pretty intuitive
if you want to see notifications you can
swipe down from the left side of the
screen swipe down from the right side of
the screen to access the control center
and you can slightly swipe up from the
bottom of the screen and hold it and
you'll be able to see all the apps that
you currently have open or you can even
swipe from left to right at the bottom
of the screen to just jump through
different apps that you have open and
for those of you curious about how you
activate Siri all you have to do is hold
the power button and that will pull her
up
now you might be wondering if holding
the power button gets you Siri how do
you turn off the phone or restart it if
you need to well what you do is you hold
the power button and the volume up
button and then you have access to that
power menu if you want to turn off the
phone if anything I think that's the one
thing that's gonna take me some getting
used to
remembering that you have to use two
buttons to actually power it off and
last but not least we have that portrait
mode feature now on the front-facing
camera now I'm actually pretty excited
by this feature because I've been using
the pixel to excels front-facing camera
for portrait modes and I really really
like getting that effect for selfies
even though I'm not a huge selfie guy
but I think having that ability is
really nice but something that makes the
iPhone 10 sport remote a bit unique is
the ability to have those portrait
lighting modes so you've got the studio
light mode if you want to add more light
to the face make it look like a more
professional shot and you've also got
that contour mode which I know some
people will enjoy to get that contour
going on their face as well as the stage
light and stage light mono mode which
are still in beta
so there are some kinks to work out but
for the most part it's pretty cool to
have these features and it would be
interesting to see if Apple adds any
more going down the line if you're
serious about yourself you're getting I
think this is gonna open up a few doors
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys let me know what your
favorite feature of the new iPhone 10 is
let me know with a comment down below
and if you enjoyed it be the cool guy
girl that gives this video a thumbs up
I'll catch you guys in the next one and
you're definitely gonna want to stay
tuned for that iPhone 10 video that's
dropping on Friday trust me you're gonna
want to watch that but that's about it
guys til the next video is your average
consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
