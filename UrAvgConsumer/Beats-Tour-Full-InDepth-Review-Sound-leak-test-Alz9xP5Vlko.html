want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video what's going on guys
it's your average consumer today I'm
gonna be doing a review for you guys on
the beats by dre tours I know there are
a lot of reviews out for this already
but I figured since I've done so many
other beats that you guys would probably
want my opinion on this as well so
without wasting too much time let's get
right into it so here we have the case
of the Beats
Tours now this is a hardshell case and
it offers pretty good protection for
your for the headphones themselves and
it stands pretty tall as you can see
it's pretty wide here and this is good
because you can throw your toys in here
any kind of way and just zip it up so
because the tours are tangle free you're
able to just you know crumple mop throw
them inside here zip it up and you're
good to go so here we'll open up the
case and as you can see even though I
had this tangled up due to the tangle
free cord that the tours come with I can
just pull it out with no issues and it
just smoothes out no nuts no tangles I'm
good to go but back inside the case here
you have a little pouch to hold things
like you know your earbuds if you want
to put them over there and the clips -
you know clip on to the earbuds
themselves let me start off showing you
guys the big earphones themselves so
here you have the two beats logos on
both sides left and right and as you go
down you have your control talk which
allows you to rewind fast-forward um
skip a track go back a track um volume
up and down and you can answer calls if
you're using it with an iPhone things
like that
so the control talk is very good feature
and as you go down it a little more you
can see that this is where it kind of
turns into one cable here I'm not really
what you'd call this but yeah and here
you have the little adjuster for how
long for where you want the headphones
to split themselves so you know I'm
pretty much that's all there is to it it
has the flat tangle-free design which is
really nice because these things really
do not tangle as I showed you just now
inside of the case and you know has the
little gold-plated jack for the
headphones now the only thing was having
something like the control talk and this
little part here that you know joins it
and has the monster logo on it the only
problem with these two things is that
they tend to weigh these headphones down
a lot so this can lead to this can
potentially lead to the headphones
falling out of your ears
while you're like walking or something
like that now that can be very
frustrating some people I know a lot of
people don't like it when their ear buds
are falling out of their ears constantly
especially in ears which are made to
kind of stay in your ears but I gotta
give it up to monster as they do supply
you with the necessary things to combat
those like you know the way downs of
these two pieces they provide you with
clips to throw on to the ear
to them to the buds themselves you can
see that the way these are designed it
has this little skinny part right here
that can have this latch onto it without
any issues so you lassis onto it and
it's good to go to clip around your ear
now it's really nice about these is that
you can adjust it to fit the way you
want it to also along with these clips
along with these clips you also get this
little clip on piece right here now this
part can go directly under this big
heavy part of the headphones themselves
if I can just get it on now as you can
see here this will definitely make sure
that the headphones don't fall off here
you're sure
or anything like that now you might not
want to have this on because you might
not like the way it looks or you know
you don't feel you don't think that
it'll prevent these from falling out of
your ears
but it does make a huge difference
because as you're walking around in the
streets these will definitely way down
the headphones themselves and especially
your right ear as it has this and this
to kind of weigh it down so with these
two things weighing it down it's very
easy for it to like little by little
with every step you take slide out your
ear a little by little now what this
does this eliminates a big part of the
weight that is pulling on the headphones
themselves then I've experimented with
this as I walked in the street regularly
I had them you know just in sometimes I
had experience you know it's slipping a
bit and I'd have to readjust it which
can be frustrating but if you clip this
on I found myself not having to adjust
it or you know constantly push it back
inside my ears so it is definitely
enhancing the sticks the actual
experience of listening to these
headphones because you're no longer
experiencing the headphones moving
around in your ear so it's less
distracting and you get to just really
focus on the music itself and once you
have it in a good position and the bass
is you know hitting and all the sounds
are great you're really going to enjoy
them it's a good chance it might be hard
to run with but with the clip and the
well with both clips as far as the ear
clips and the clip that you can put onto
your shirt or jacket
honestly running shouldn't be an issue
and that's actually probably one of the
reasons why they have this because it is
a bit of a heavier build those clips
will definitely be good for the runners
out there you can't fall monster for you
know let's say like a poor design or
something along those lines as far as
you know them falling out because they
do provide you with the necessary
equipment to keep them in your ear and
you know keep the sound experience where
it should be
now as for sound these are definitely
one of my favorite pick these are my
favorite pair of in-ear headphones but
listening to these you surely can't
complain about the sound quality the
sound quality is of the best I've heard
four in-ear headphones so without a
doubt I you know I rate these really
highly as far as sound quality goes I've
really put that my soul use G's for
quite some time really once when I got
my hands on these because there were
just so much more convenient and I
didn't feel like I was lacking in sound
quality in the slightest so that just
goes to show you that I can you can
change that they're interchangeable as
far as sound quality goes I didn't miss
the solo into these when I you know use
these I might have felt like I neglected
them a bit but I can't say that I missed
them as far as sound quality goes
because this delivers just a good as
experience as the solos provided me the
only thing with that is you have to make
sure it's very important that you're
using the right ear buds to get that
sound quality delivered to you usually
the medium which is on this when you
first purchase it is what works with
everyone but that might not be the case
like your ears might be too big or too
small for these so it's definitely a
good idea to look into all of the
different ear buds that monster provides
and they provide a lot you have so many
here to choose from the only other thing
I don't really like about this as well
you know kind of goes with all monster
cords all of the beats cords rather is
that the red starts to fade a little
depending on what you're wearing I used
to wear this black jacket and I guess as
I wore this on the outside of the jacket
and it rubbed on it you know as I walked
and that led to the red losing its color
and starting and it started to get
really dark so I don't want to keep that
in mind when you have these you probably
want to keep them in your pouch or
something else that can protect them
from any other colors rubbing up on them
and these are very adorable
so give provides really strong cables as
you can see here it's not as flimsy as
like you know the iPhone headphones that
you get with your iPods or your iPhone
so you can definitely expect these to
last a while as they have really strong
cable and you know they're just of good
quality these are sold for one $49.99
and I think that's a decent price for
these some people of course will say you
know that's way too much that's over you
know that's overpriced but you know
there are Montt there are there beats by
dre what can you you know what do you
expect we all know that they're very
expensive but if you're looking to
purchase these and you you want to know
if you if it's gonna be worth your money
it definitely is worth your money I
would definitely recommend these to
anyone who's looking for a nice pair in
your headphones alright guys so that
pretty much wraps up my review for the
beats tours so I'm just gonna include a
little sound leak test at the end of
this video just to show you guys if it
leaks I know a lot of people are usually
interested on whether or not other
people can hear them when they're
listening to their music at high volumes
so keep watching for that and pretty
much that's it thanks for watching guys
is your average consumer please feel
free to rate comment subscribe
definitely subscribe as I can use all
the subscribers I can get and it helped
me out a lot
alright so the next video thanks guys
peace alright guys so now I'm gonna do a
sound leak test and I'm gonna show you
what it sounds like at a comfortable
volume and about a foot away from my
camera and I'm gonna show you how it
sounds as I increase the volume all the
way up to max but I won't have the
maximum very long as you guys know that
that will damage your hearing and this
it's not really that comfortable to
listen to it at that loud of a volume
anyway so I'm going to show you guys
right now so as I said slightly less
than half is comfortable for me on my
iPod touch
alright so here we go
and now I'm going to increase it
all right so I think that it's good
enough to show you guys what's a
different volume sound like as you have
it in your ears and my cameras like
about a foot away so if you're standing
right next to someone are sitting next
to someone like on a bus or something or
an elevator
that's probably what they'll be hearing
as well I'm not sure how well my camera
might have picked that up but I think
you can give you guys a pretty good idea
if you can hear the sound that means
it's probably pretty loud that should
give you a good estimate all right I'm
pretty much that's all for this sound
test and I'm just reviewed thanks again
for watching guys this is your average
consumer until the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
