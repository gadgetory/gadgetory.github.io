consumer and today I've got another your
average budget video for you guys and
this time we're going to be talking
about the Vivi's night portable charger
this is probably one of the best
portable chargers I've used so far so
hey let's not wasting your time let's
get right into it
I'm Bobby Cobb and alright guys here we
have the fittest night portable charger
now this is your average budget so I
have to let you guys know the price
first and this retails for about 37
dollars on Amazon I'll have links down
below in the description for you guys to
check it out but it's a pretty
inexpensive portable charger and it has
a very high capacity and if you guys
know me you know I love portable
chargers and that they're one of my
favorite gadgets to have around at all
times now what's great about portable
chargers is if you use a lot of mobile
devices whether it's a cell phone camera
tablet whatever it may be you can
actually use the portable charger to
charge those devices throughout the day
and it allows you to not worry about the
battery life of your mobile device now
one of the things I love about portable
chargers is that you don't have to look
for an outlet to charge your device you
can still have your device right next to
you and charge it and it charges devices
pretty quickly this is one of the things
that I love about portable chargers they
usually charge up your device really
quickly you don't have to be one of
those wall huggers that Samsung talks
about you can actually just charge your
device no matter where you are if your
phone is in your pocket you can charge
it while it's in your pocket I tend to
do that a lot so it just makes it really
simple and easy to charge your device
without even thinking about it
the vivid Knight has a 13,000 milliamp
battery capacity and to put it into
perspective for you guys something like
the iPhone 5s has about 1500 milliamps
so you can charge your iPhone quite a
few times over and not worry about it at
all that's a lot of battery capacity in
a pretty tight fit design what I love
about the villus night is that it's not
one of those big bulky portable chargers
especially at 13,000 milliamps this is
actually a very slender sleek looking
device now the only trade off here is
that it is a little taller than your
standard portable chargers it's a bit
thicker than a smartphone and probably
just as wide but it's actually much much
taller and I don't think that's a big
tray
you get a lot of battery capacity and
this actually looks really nice it
actually looks like one of the best
portable chargers I've seen so far and
this has a bit of a faux leather design
on the front and back so it has a nice
little texture to it has a nice feel and
it also has this gold looking trim R on
the side so it has this likes little rim
around it so it's got a very elegant
look to it I'm actually quite a fan it's
better than all those other thick crazy
power bricks that I usually carry around
so this is probably one of the
best-looking ones definitely not a
problem to put in my pocket so some cool
things about the Vista Knight besides
its nice design is the fact that it has
a built-in micro USB cable so you can
actually just carry the portable charger
itself and always be ready to charge
your phone with no problem so you can
just pull the micro USB cable out and
then plug it into your device hit the
power button and you're good to go
when it's not plugged into a device the
power button will light up the battery
indicators to let you know how much
battery you have left and when you'll
need to throw it on the charger now at
the top of the phone you have another
USB port to go along with the built-in
micro USB and with this you can charge
up any device that uses a USB cable so
if you have an iPhone the lightning
cable will have no issues here plug it
in and you're good to go now to charge
this up you just need a standard
microUSB cable and it actually comes
with one and it also comes with a nice
little travel pouch so if you don't want
the faux leather to get scratched up you
throw it inside of there and carry it
around with no problem and it's actually
a cool feature that when you remove the
micro USB charger it shows an indent
that you can place your cellphone and
start using it as a kickstand now this
is really cool because you can use your
phone to watch a video and charge your
device at the same time and this is
awesome for trips on the plane or a bus
and it's actually really convenient
because you don't have to worry about
your battery dying while you're watching
any of this content so this is really
cool stuff I like to watch videos on my
cell phone all the time and especially
while I'm on a flight definitely a great
companion so I don't have to worry about
my battery dying while I'm watching some
of my favorite shows but pretty much
that's it guys you guys have my
recommendation all your average budget
videos will be a recommendation from me
for a item that you probably don't know
about so that's about it for this video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it
definitely let me know in the comments
down below if you plan on picking one of
these up and I'll catch you guys in the
next video
if you enjoyed it be the cool guy that
has a thumbs up button and subscribe to
