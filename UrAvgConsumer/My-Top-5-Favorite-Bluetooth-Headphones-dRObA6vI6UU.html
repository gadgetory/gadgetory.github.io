headphone on our list and it's the House
of Marley liberate XL bTW but don't let
the name fool you these aren't that
large they have a pretty decent size and
include a foldable design made for
travel as with all House of Marley gear
you can expect some earthly designs like
the fabric materials you get on the ear
cups and headband and the logos engraved
on Neal bamboo and a nice nod to the
Rasta colors on the side while it does
have an earthy design this still
features a metal frame so it doesn't
lose out on durability and unlike most
Bluetooth headphones out there this one
features a foldable design so you can
pack it away in the included travel case
without it taking up too much space you
get an over ear design and the ear cups
and head then have a soft leather feel
to them which makes them very
comfortable like all other headphones on
this list you need a micro USB cable to
charge them since they are bluetooth and
a nice bonus with these is a battery
meter so you can find out just how much
juice you've got left and I've been able
to listen to music for hours with no
worries you can also use the auxiliary
cable that comes with if you want wired
audio and these don't have to be charged
if you want to listen to them this way
and don't worry I made sure this feature
was included on all the headphones on
this list but I do wish they'd use a 3.5
millimeter input on both ends of the
cable so it'd be a bit easier to replace
if you ever lost it you get all the
standard buttons to control your audio
on the right ear cup and then I found
them pretty easy to navigate but like
with most bluetooth headphones it'll
take a second to remember where all the
buttons are but once you get used to it
you'll find yourself rarely pulling out
your device to control your music now
about that audio I definitely enjoy
listening to these the vocals come in
pretty well and the instruments are
easily identifiable and the bass has a
nice bit of thump to it and trust me as
a bass lover I was impressed these work
from multiple genres I think they'll
really excel with music with a focus on
the low
next up on the list we've got the
samsung level over while on my hunt for
some of the best Bluetooth headphones
available I realized I never really gave
Samsung's level headphones a try and now
I'm glad I did the level overs have a
very simple look going for them and
we've got some pretty sweet low-key
features built into it has a nice
leatherette headband and ear cups with a
pretty cool stitch look going for it on
the headband cushion these are really
comfortable and great for long listening
sessions these will also fit completely
over your ears which creates a great
seal which is perfect combined with its
active noise canceling feature like most
bluetooth headphones I'm used to these
aren't foldable and due to their large
size it loses points in the portability
department but it does come with a
hardshell case so you can carry extra
cables and it offers as much protection
as you'd need one thing you might notice
about these in comparison to all the
headphones on this list is the lack of
buttons to control your music this is
where Samsung really surprised me the
level overs have touch panels on the
sides of the ear cups that work as a
controller using swipe gestures similar
to what you'd find on the paradesi
headphones you can swipe up or down to
increase or decrease the volume and as
you'd expect you swipe left or right to
jump between tracks and DoubleTap to
play and pause now to get the most out
of these features you can get the
companion app Samsung offers for Android
devices but I've been using this with an
iPhone with no issues a full charge will
get you about 15 hours of use which is
more than enough for a few listening
sessions now it's got some nice sleek
features but what about the sound I
didn't know what to expect when I tried
these out because Samsung isn't really a
big player in the headphone game but I
was pleasantly surprised vocals are
super crisp and if you're looking for
clarity these definitely have you
covered the best way I can describe the
audio is rich and clean I wouldn't
expect much thumping on the bass side of
things but it is still present combined
with some active noise canceling you can
really get lost when using these
and next up on our list is the beats
solo2 wireless now you might be
wondering why I've added beats says list
but I've got to give credit where credit
is due
they've managed to make one of the most
portable pair of bluetooth headphones
I've come across that isn't an earbud
while providing much better sound than
previous generations so for a second
let's ignore the brand and talk about
the headphones it's sleek and has only
one visible button on the body and
that's the power button you can also use
this button to check the built-in
battery indicator to see how much juice
you've got left these also feature a
great 20 hours of battery life so you
don't have to do much worrying there
these also have standard music controls
however they're very well hidden the
first being the beats logo on the left
ear cup press the B once to play or
pause and a double tap will allow you to
skip to the next song and a triple tap
to go back also hidden above the logo is
your volume up and below it the volume
down you'll find the standard rubberized
cushion on the headband which I find
pretty comfortable as well as some
leather ear cup cushions which are very
plush and considering these are on-ear
headphones that's very important now
some people may not like the pressure of
an on-ear headphone but I find them
pretty nice to keep them in place
especially if you plan on using these
when you're working out or doing any
other kind of activities now these are
sleek pretty low profile - the B and
very portable but what about sound these
have the same sound quality as the solo
twos but that's not surprising
considering these are the same but with
Wireless features and if you haven't
heard the solo Tunes have some really
awesome sound quality with these I
wouldn't expect an insane amount of bass
as they've cleaned it up to allow for
some more vocals and other details to
come in more clearly but don't get me
wrong though the bass is still very
present and enjoyable for someone who
loves bass as much as I do
I definitely enjoy using these when i'm
looking to enjoy music with some vibrant
sound now on to a personal favorite of
mine the sony xb9 50 bt now if you love
bass look no further
these have got you covered but we'll get
on that in a second the 1950 bt e has a
larger over ear design with some
extremely soft and comfortable ear cups
completely sealed your ears inside
making this great for long listening
sessions one gripe I do have with these
is the fact that they aren't foldable
luckily though the ear cups do have some
swivel action so they can be laid down
flat which makes transporting a bit
easier if you want to throw them in a
bag a nice feature that separates the
950 bt from the rest of the headphones
on this list is the inclusion of NFC
with this you can just tap a new
Bluetooth device to the air cup and pair
it without having to jump into any
settings and if you like long listening
sessions this thing offers up to 20
hours of battery life on a single charge
the music controls are pretty simple as
they're placed together on a button
slider that lets you hit rewind or
fast-forward when you slide the button
to the left or right and playing pause
if you push the button in in terms of
buttons you've also got your volume
control power and my favorite bass boost
and we can't ask for a better segue than
that so start talking about sound
quality as I mentioned before these
headphones were made for bass lovers but
even if you aren't crazy about bass it
still provides excellent overall
performance you got some nice clarity
while still having a very present and
deep low-end while I found these to be
great for multi honours I do at it as
you'd expect it works well for those
with an emphasis on bass like hip hop
dubstep ATM in the light and count on
Sony to take that base too just silly
levels with the bass boost button it'll
hardly matter what song you're listening
to with this feature on your head is
down to vibrate and to top off this list
we've got the Jaybirds
x2 now these are the new kid on the
block and before it came out I
originally plan to feature the Jaybirds
blue buds X these obviously aren't like
the others on the list since they come
in a very compact earbud form factor but
we can't talk about Bluetooth headphones
and not mention these the x2 have a very
similar design to their original blue
buds eggs but with some subtle changes
these are extremely comfortable ear buds
and I've had no issues getting these to
stay in my ears but if you want a really
secure fit you can use the included wing
tips that uses the ridges in your ears
to help them stay in place and with the
X 2's they even improve the design of
the
tips to give them some better comfort so
if you're big on going to the gym you
can feel pretty confident that these
will be able to hang with you during
your intense workout session and another
bonus for you gym goers or anyone doing
something that's really active is that
these are sweat proof so that's one less
thing for you to worry about when you're
trying to get those gains also these
things are extremely convenient in terms
of portability because they take up like
no space at all if you throw them into
your pocket and with the tangle-free
cable used to connect the two earbuds
you don't have to worry about them
nodding up but if you're extra cautious
you can use the travel case that it
comes with and that means you'll be able
to bring along the extra accessories
like the charging cable and the variety
of ear tips and wings and again j-bird
managed to squeeze eight hours of
battery life into this thing so if
you're using this to work out and you'll
only have to charge it about once a week
now how do they sound amazing the blue
buds exhaled a spot as my favorite ear
buds for a long time due to their
convenience and sound quality and j-bird
managed to improve the sound quality on
the X twos
you get some great clarity and some very
surprisingly nice bass considering these
are ear buds I haven't encountered any
songs I don't enjoy listening to with
the X 2's so I stand by the overall
performance you get out of these the X
crews are definitely at the top of my
list for favorite listening device you
can buy if you want to save some cash
though I can highly recommend the blue
buds X in place of these but either one
is a great choice so you can't go wrong
but that about wraps it up for my list
guys these headphones all range from
about 120 bucks to a max of 300 but it's
really hard to find good quality
Bluetooth headphones so I hope this list
helps you out till the next videos your
average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
