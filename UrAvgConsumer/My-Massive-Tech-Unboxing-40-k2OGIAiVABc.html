somewhere and today we've got another
massive tech unboxing and this time
we've got a lot of stuff from companies
that sent me things that they want me to
check out so we'll be seeing what some
of them have to offer as we always do
err you want to be the first one yes
envelope good gosh yeah okay this should
be pretty easy and this is from nomadic
so what we got here so this oh and I
forgot to remap watch today the one time
so this has been use silicon support
strap so this supposed to be swim proof
here you have it so if you guys are
interested in like the Nike band that
they have or anything like that you want
to do something a bit more active Nomad
came out with an option for that I
really wish I had my Apple watch here to
try it out but what I'll do is insert
some Bureau editing magic baby so this
is what it looks like you guys had an
idea I do like the stress though they're
light and they give it a bit more sporty
look actually if you look at it it looks
a lot like the strap on the gear s3 so
yeah it looks like it a lot but that's
good
I really like the straps on this so now
I have an option for the Apple watch
next I'm going to do I know this is oh I
know we're going to open this up alright
oh guy I know it's from culluh where we
got it especially and I'll switch
related where and hole me there you go a
very UAC style controller I love it
wow they really know you then they do
and listen guys I didn't design this
item figured these guys this know what
the UAC colors are all about so this is
what ended up looking like okay I'm very
very happy with this I can't wait to put
the you know I'm going to just insert
some more bureau all my color where
controller so you guys can see that
there that's awesome very very happy
so but if you guys haven't heard of code
where you guys customize and paint all
kinds of cool stuff
link in the description be sure to check
it out but this is a special edition
thing that we've got here
Oh hold old-school
what if it's hi so this is meant to look
like the NES so if I could oh to the end
yes
you got some joy cons that resembled the
controllers there okay so check it out
with the straps used to look legit this
is really cool man and they didn't
handle it everytime they really really
do these are because looking joy con so
if you love this old Nintendo you love
NES this is definitely worth sticking
out this is awesome whoo make it money
oh this gamers paradise is going to be
so crazy two point I was going to do
nuts man but Charlotte's a color for
hooking me up the right way all the time
so next up let's see what we've got here
also I know this is the sony MDR 1000x
now this one is in for me it'll be one
of you guys I'm going to be doing a
giveaway now right now right up to
Germany have to keep your eyes peeled
obviously I'm not going to open this one
up to show you guys but I talked about
the 1000x before it it's one of my
favorite headphones it's honestly like
the higher end of what Sony has to offer
when it comes to Bluetooth wireless
headphones I had that on a ton of
features great sound quality premium
materials got the leather on the ear
cups is just listen it is expensive and
it is worth it you guys should be high
now this one this one stands high degree
so at the very top we've got some old
gaming headset rather so this is from
their game series this is the game one
so it's open acoustic gaming headset now
open-back headphones are what people
love to use instead of like real game
they had said so this is kind of like
the best of both worlds you get an
open-back headset in the gaming headset
now I have the game zero
which i think is a bit different
man you can't you can't knock this this
looks good I think this is a noise
cancelling mic as well they always have
like really high quality mics with their
headset so this is awesome
now that's just one thing that they
spent is more yeah there's this it also
comes with so stay there's a lot more
actually okay I've got a little
Sennheiser hat in to switch it out right
so this is the shock mount for a mic so
if you're streaming you don't want to
bang your mic or have it you know if you
bump into the table have you hear that
jerkiness you can use this and you don't
have to worry about it it's going to
just be clean audio straight up so this
is nice this is the end case the MKS for
so what you do is you put your mic right
here in the bottom you screw it in and
then as it moves around you're not going
to hear anything because it's supported
well right in here a headset hanger oh
dang I just bought a headset hanger it's
in one of these boxes okay okay this is
fancy so this is like serious stuff of
course you know you screw this all the
way down and you can clamp it on to any
desk and then it kind of sits on this
this looks this is sturdy
it looks very right oh this one kind of
pretty skull open highly clingy
yeah and the last laughing now owe you
money so this is a condenser microphone
this is the MK 4 digital powered by
Apogee so this is awesome
- look cold man if you feel weight on
this thing this is so cool jet stuff
right here Joe this onto shock mount and
then you're like good to go I really
listen I really need to get on my twitch
game now like I have no excuses this is
also huge ahh Sennheiser
stop over all right so I just dropped
the box and made a mess for myself to
clean up good job so right here we've
got a IOT card charger a car mount this
is something that I think I've shown
this one on the channel before this is
probably the best caramel I've ever used
for my phone
it has wireless charging so if your
phone supports that with Wireless to
charging you can plug this up into your
cigarette lighter and then charge your
phone wirelessly so this is it it's a
super super flexible like I said it you
can extend the length as long as you
want it to be you can move it up or down
and you can also just move around the
actual holder itself so there's a lot of
rotation here so you can pretty much
customize this to fit exactly how you
want it in your car give you up on the
right angle so that you know you can
make sure you're viewing your GPS just
the way you need to so I have to pick
this up I gave my last one to my
sister-in-law honor Cece hope her phone
on her lap while she was driving as
dangerous folks get one of these okay so
here's the headphone hanger that I was
talking about I didn't know getting one
from Sennheiser just pull it out and you
pretty much to push this where I can
clamp on to any old bass or surface and
you just throw your headphones on top of
here and under that we have a new
backpack now I almost you guys know but
what do my guides a backpack 6.0 is
coming out in the future and I need a
solid backpack that I can depend on and
use for a while before I make that video
it is super hard to deform the one I'm
using now so I've been looking around
and this one is by cocoon so we can
actually under hit this Clemson already
this bag might be too small but hello
don't forget a built-in gritted right in
the front so instead of having a bunch
of pockets and you know little slots and
holes you can actually put everything
that you need to right inside of here
I like the idea behind it
I'm going to see if that can actually
replace a regular backpack for me oh
okay so Oh kind of nice so you got some
luck for your tablet your laptop the
inside is soft so you can not worry
about your laptop getting scratched up
or anything like that there's no solid
back packing but definitely more on the
minimalist side then what I use with my
guys are backpacks so maybe I'll find
another use for this all right so we've
got one last box now this one I know is
from autism we've got quite a few things
in here just like Sennheiser so let's
see what we've got inside all right so
these are active noise-cancelling
earbuds Bluetooth earbuds with a neck
end oh okay this actually looks pretty
good
not bad is this deceiving metal is it
okay it's plastic but it still looks
decent the looks looks wise I think it
got it this is nice but of course I'm
not - check out how they actually sound
I don't think I've ever seen them make
this before or this kind of product with
the neck band and everything so so the
pretty good-looking first try but of
course it's all about that sound quality
I'll let you guys know still about that
next up a sports action camera so this
is like their way of competing with
GoPro Wow
so this is like straight up you've got
the case and everything for it and look
at this guys open up this little box is
kind of accessories Wow
fire some accessories so I just looked
in the book on the specs this is 4k at
25 frames per second two point sound cat
30 frames per second 1080p 268 60 FPS
while blah and you've also got a hundred
and 70 degree wide angle lens and I
believe this lens is 12 megapixels well
I like about Aki is that they're pretty
inexpensive so that's a pretty
competitor to gopro it would be nice to
mention eclipse wireless speaker so
we've got a bluetooth speaker here okay
oh this looks pretty good it looks
pretty decent right yeah oh and you can
feel this this thing moves that means
when you hear that bass it's going to go
I finish right now hook it up okay let's
see the Aki at km 30 you guys that is
actually pretty good
Wow okay Aki stepping the dog get into a
bunch of things for you a dashboard
camera I want to one of these for the
car I'd like you playing that in my
conference no I got really excited about
that just now
did you yeah I don't know where anyone
right
I think so soon so this is interesting
now dashboard cameras are not something
that I'm too familiar with I've never
really looked up one I've always wanted
to put one into cars oh just in case we
never know
oh okay so here you got the lens oh and
you can angle it how you have however
you need so you can go like this okay
interesting so I am happy to have this I
didn't even know they made dashboard
cameras so it looks like they give you
pretty much everything that you need
here so you're pretty much set to go
this is cool
this is listen I made out like a bandit
today don't you think yeah I do you know
ask you all right so this is everything
