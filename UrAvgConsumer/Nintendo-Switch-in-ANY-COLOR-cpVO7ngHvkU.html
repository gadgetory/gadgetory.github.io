consumer and today we have a special
special package here and you probably
know what it is based on the title but
I've never gotten to see this so we are
going to share this unboxing experience
together so I've got my trusty unboxing
knife link in the description now I'm
actually going to be giving one of these
away so make sure you pay attention to
the rest of the video I'm super excited
for those guys but this is something
that's been in the works for a while now
so to actually have it in hand is very
very exciting for me now you've seen a
bunch of Nintendo switch unboxing before
I am very sure but this one's going to
be different now like I said we're gonna
experience this together so you ready
here we go so we pull this tab and I
noticed which is right at the top so you
ready for this area
I'm higher there alright alright where
do we start this is looking oh man if
you see this I got to pick up a pen oh
man so this is pretty much a teal and
white combo for the Nintendo switch her
the controllers oh baby so this was
actually done by kala where you guys
have seen me talk about them and feature
them a ton on the channel at this point
and this is just like their latest
creation and man oh wow they even got
under the kickstand perfectly I can't I
really can't find any issues this looks
so good now one thing I must say is that
it is very hard to get a Nintendo switch
right now so even color wear has had a
hard time getting some of these and then
putting them out there really so you got
a bit of a pre-order wait if you go and
grab this on their site but you can
always grab joy Kahn's right away
because these aren't stock like
everywhere so if you want to get your
Nintendo switch joy content in colored
or do whatever with them you can still
do that right now
they also have it in that or gloss so
whichever kind of style you want to go
for they've got the option oh I mean the
rest is let's see
Oh what am I saying there's more okay so
we got the cables of course somebody
really cares about the cable dating
paint bees we also have the joy Kahn
grips I think our use the circular icon
straps right and of course we've got our
joy con grip so you can take your fancy
new joy Kahn and get a whole new kind of
a controller for your switch now I never
do this but now that I have special
colors it's like why not dang so good
this looks so so good now of course
there's more to it than that you've got
our cables got the joy Kahn's got the
switch you can't forget about the dock
we've got to have this and this is
another part that's actually been
painted by color wear so let's see what
that looks like color we're just killed
it man dang so we've got all our pieces
together here now I'm kind of interested
in seeing what it looks like when you
set the whole thing up now you throw
this guy
awesome guys
so looking at it all set up I think it
looks really really good
I'm gonna have to kick out the old ones
or the new 1n one thing for sure I'm
gonna have to figure out how to do like
a system transfer so I can make sure all
of my stuff get up on this now I might
be the first person to have a completely
customized and colored Nintendo switch
I'm not going to be the only one I'm
actually giving one away to one of you
guys and all you have to do is make sure
you're subscribed to the channel you'll
leave a comment down below on this video

going to be selected but we are
announcing the winners over on Twitter

the winners over on Twitter so I highly
highly suggest you at least make an

when the winner is going to be announced

put this in the gamers paradise and kind
of see how it fits in so now we've got
it all set up over here and this is the
new Nintendo Suites with my custom
colors as you can see it kind of goes
with the rest of the gamers paradise

combos that you can go with with the
Nintendo switch lots of different parts
