average consumer and today I've got an
unboxing for you guys of the j-bird blue
bud X Wireless in here headphones and
she'd be really great for working out
but let's not waste any time let's get
right into it alright guys here we have
the j-bird blue bud Dex this looks like
a really interesting pair of headphones
or earphones rather they've got some
really sleek design as you can see here
there's not much to it the Denon 8hw 150
i unbox a couple of days ago are a lot
bigger than this and I just really think
that this is really cool that it's like
a small form-factor it's got some pretty
cool features it offers eight hours of
battery life it's got some stuff that I
can have a secure fit it's gonna it
should be able to be worn over the ear
or just regular like in regular in ears
so it's got some pretty cool stuff going
on with it is bluetooth so um alright
enough of my blabbering let's get to
some boxing so we've got a little tab
here we're gonna pull this open and wow
I haven't seen this before and this
looks pretty awesome guys in the case it
comes in got the blue buds over there
some decent packaging to some it's
actually pretty impressive here so let's
see if we can um how we open this up so
I've got some tape on the sides so I'm
gonna grab my unboxing knife and alright
so here's the unboxing knife got a slice
these two sides open the top side says
open other end so I'm guessing we're
gonna have to go from the bottom and
let's just see if we could cut these
open this one alright and alright so we
just finished that up unless if we can
pull these out so the first thing we've
got here we've got a little thing let's
see this is the get started guide and
here it is it's a pretty simple small
get started guide
cool so for those of you who don't know
how to pair a bluetooth headphones or
anything like that this is what you'll
be looking at and let's see there's a
little tab at the bottom here - you can
pull this out and here we have them and
I must say I'm really impressed by this
cape oh wow this just feels like a
really premium case guys better than any
of the previous cases that I've seen
before for in ear buds so let's see how
to open it now okay and inside of it
Leslie we've got the ear tips and these
um little things here to make a secure
fit for your ears and give you guys a
quick close-up and all right guys so
this is all one of those little things
that go over the earphone and they
supposed to sit securely in your ear
with this so that's what they offer here
they've got a couple of those in
different sizes and also I just want to
show you some of the ear buds that come
with it if they've got some pretty
interesting colors I'm actually a fan of
this um color scheme that they've got
going this black on green and even the
black on white if you like that instead
so some pretty cool looking ear buds
definitely a fan of the colors and this
little thing right here I want to see
how this fits in the ear if it really
does help so now back to this case the
last thing inside of here is the micro
USB cable which is actually pretty cool
it on its really flat and I guess this
is how you'll be charging it or
connecting it to the computer or I don't
think it needs to connect our computer
but this is how you'll be charging it
yeah it looks pretty nice I've never
seen the USB cable like this before so
thumbs up for originality there and then
this is just the rest of the case um
nothing inside of it it has this little
strap so I'm guessing this will hold
your ear earphones pretty soft inside
really really impressive case I'm
definitely a fan of this thumbs up for
this case so now let's move some of the
stuff out of the way
but for the star of the show themselves
let's see how do we get these out these
are in here pretty securely oh I don't
know if I'm going to actually need them
boxing knife again but alright you know
I just make this simple I will take out
the unboxing knife again so I think I'll
just slide down this cut this little
plastic part and alright guys and
finally got them all free of this
plastic so here we have the blue bud X
so let me give you guys a close-up of
what I'm seeing and here we are guys
these are them these are a little bigger
than I expected but they're nice-looking
nonetheless of course you know with blue
tooth they've got to have some stuff
these are very sleek design so I'm
guessing the batteries inside of here
it's gonna be really interesting to try
these out I can't wait they're very very
light there's just like nothing to them
really so it's gonna be pretty
interesting to see maybe I'll do a
comparison between these and those
dennings I unboxed the other day let me
show you guys what it looks like with
the ear tips on alright and here we have
them with those ear tips and so I'm not
sure if you guys notice here but it does
have a pretty slanted curve right here
so you will be able to get the ear buds
into the ear pretty easily and it looks
like it's gonna be pointing the
speaker's directly into the ear canal so
it's going to be pretty interesting to
see I also want to show you guys what it
looked like to have these things on here
and see if I can put one on right now
and pretty much this wraps up this
unboxing guys these are some great
looking buds I can't wait to try them
out get them paired up and let you guys
know how I sound and it comes with this
great case and a bunch of buds and all
kinds of stuff to make it a secure fit
and pretty much that's it guys
so if you enjoyed this video please feel
free to rate comment and subscribe look
out for the review of these soon and
I'll catch you guys in the next one
until then this Travers can
