paradise video you might have seen a
quick peek inside of this closet that
holds quite a few of my collections so
let's take a more detailed look inside
see what I've got
so all around here is where I've got all
my headphones you guys know I've been
doing reviews and videos about
headphones for years I think since 2012
and this is pretty much my collection so
far so over here the first little
section is the gaming section so these
are gaming headsets and I've got quite a
few of them now my favorite out of all
of these I gotta say happens to be the
Sony pulse wireless headset and that's
because it's very functional has a
couple of cool features and that Rumble
feature is just amazing it changes the
game so I'm really happy about that and
the controls on it are really nice so
that's like one of my favorite gaming
headsets I don't know if they still sell
them but they're probably like a hundred
bucks that's the last I paid for this
guy and the HyperX cloud twos I mean
come on if you guys are into gaming
headsets you probably already know about
those and over here is where I have some
of the more audiophile kind of
headphones now some people might not
agree with the audio Technica's being in
this little section here but these are
all what I use like say if I'm doing
some video work something like that
I don't mind grabbing one of these and
just throwing them on to get some stuff
done these Sony's that's where it's at
though for any video editing work these
are what you want but yeah right here
these are like the over ears more fun
kind of headphones throughout the house
of marley v-moda m100 you guys see that
I have like four of them over here quite
a few but these are like one of my
favorites of all time
we high-quality stuff here and they've
got the old UAC reviews logo I gotta get
these updated with the new UAC logo so I
got to do that and over here we've got
some Sony's some beats the bad word in
here they actually sound pretty decent
so I mean live with it
these Sennheiser's right here though
these are one of loking one of my
favorite headphones because these are
over ear headphones but you can actually
control the bass I haven't done a video
about them yet but these are awesome
they're a little pricey I think they're
pretty expensive in the $500 price range
or only $400 but the bass control is oh
I got some old school stuff that started
the channel like the sink by 50 Wireless
I think every one 50 cent made
headphones is bankrupt now um we also
got these boom phones which are terrible
they're garbage like I can't believe I
ever bought these the first thing I ever
got from a company right here and
they're all beat up too but these are
the audio technica ah what are they
what's the model number I don't remember
it's old gone man all that you hear all
of that when you put these on I love
it's cuz it's old or what but these had
extra extra bass they sounded really
good these were the first things ever
sent to me when I started YouTube and
over here we have the on ear headphones
which tend to be way smaller like look
at this v-moda XS these are tiny tiny
headphones I think my favorite out of
all of these it's probably these guys
right here these are from Bayer dynamic
now these are low profile very
comfortable I actually had this in my
top 5 favorite headphones 4.0 they are
high quality and they keep it low key
which is what these little on ears are
all about
and this is my section right here y'all
wireless Bluetooth this is where it's at
you guys know how I feel about these
right here you all know about these I
told you enough
the xb9 950 bt these are by sony they
sound amazing
these Bose headphones right here with
the best noise isolation nice noise
cancelling these are my winner right
here they're probably amongst the
cheapest well these are the lesser
versions so these are cheaper but this
is probably the cheapest amongst here
and probably my most favorite well this
has some nice features to the Samsung um
on me ear Samsung level on on level I
don't know something like that I'll have
a link down below in the description but
these are all those headphones so just
some of my favorites let me see if I
have to pick a quick three out of all of
these easily 950 BTS
see I won't pick my bluetooth okay I'm
gonna go with the v-moda m100 because
they're they're like the crossfade
Wireless but they have more flexibility
so I'm not gonna pick two bluetooth
headphones it's just to switch it up a
bit I'm gonna go with that and I'm gonna
go with these Wireless I'm gonna go with
these right here these Sennheiser's the
really expensive ones but these have
amazing features great bass control if I
don't want to hear a ton of bass I can
control that and it audio sounds amazing
and those are my top three now that's
not all that's in this room obviously
we've got Gundam boxes all over you guys
can see now all of these are not built
because
I'll have that much time I think out of
all of these I have about maybe 11 or so
that I still need to build not counting
these giant ones for each of these giant
ones
I'd say that's like the equivalent to
like surreal bees or for bees but I'm a
huge Gundam fan guys one of my favorite
animes if you're interested in a good
Gundam show to watch I highly recommend
Gundam double-o one of my favorites a
very very good anime so check that out
if you guys want to know why I love
Gundam so much and it's definitely worth
the time over here I've got some more
Gundam stuff stop the re-built see how
flimsy and weak these look yeah I don't
build those but I have some pokeballs
over here as well
just a bunch oh these are just like the
tools you kind of use for building the
Gunners okay I'm learning out a lot I
know so a couple of other cool things
that I have here I fix a toolkit this is
the tech survival kit 1.0 and then
moving on over here we've got a couple
of earbuds I got some more earbuds over
here as well so just a couple of them
not all of my earbuds this one now this
is worth mentioning I've got a video on
this coming out soon but I'm really
digging these I never was a fan of Visa
weird styled earbuds but I'm gonna
believer now and over here I've got some
Zoids now these are where I actually
started building model kits they used to
have a cartoon on Cartoon Network that
was on back in the day before school and
after school there was a Joyce cartoon
or anime and I used to watch that all
the time got me involved in the whole
model kit building stuff but yeah this
is something that's more years you guys
his speed not all of your anime freaks
like I am but these are the tech
backpacks and gadget backpacks travel
backpacks all that good stuff
these are all the ones that I've
featured in videos and some that I
haven't featured just yet my favorite
has to be this in case one the ojio
bandit really had it for
some time now but the style of this one
and all the compartments make this super
solid really really happy with this and
I even picked up a couple of new ones
like this guy just cause of the color I
can't help it it's perfect but uh let's
see over here I've got some lamps not
really important but these are nice
little props for videos these have like
special bulbs in them so RGB bulbs so
they can change colors and all that just
good stuff good props for videos pretty
much I think that's about it for this uh
closet guys you guys see all the
headphones I've got some of my favorite
ones a lot of good ones here all of my
Gundams over here I'm rambling so I'm
ending the video I'll catch you guys in
the next one if you enjoyed it let me
know as a comment down below thumbs up
