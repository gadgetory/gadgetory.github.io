we've been gone for a good reason and
happy first day of summer you guys it is
June twenty-first the first day of
summer also jay's birthday he the
quarter century old today's 25 years old
hypocrite 25 and like I said guys
there's a good reason why we haven't
been posting as much as we should have
been and that goes for the year average
consumer channel as well as the couple
vlog yeah so we know we've been
neglecting that with like I said for
good reason and that reason is we are

release yes so stay tuned for that and
then the second announcement is our big
announces is a big one yes it let you do
it so and as you guys can see we love
Phineas and Ferb and this is where I got
the idea to make not necessarily not
necessarily every day count but every
week count so every week throughout the
entire summer I'm gonna be doing a
giveaway to you guys just because I love
you yeah and just because we want to
follow phineas and Ferb's motto and make
every day or week in this case count yep

international anyone whatever but the
amount the announcement of who wins will
be on my new website UAC reviews you

right about over here and that's
actually the new website that I'm
launching it's still a bit under
construction it has some old posts but
it'll be updated more frequently a lot
more frequently and you guys can check
it out for you know different reviews

and stuff like that so definitely check
that out and stay tuned on there to see
