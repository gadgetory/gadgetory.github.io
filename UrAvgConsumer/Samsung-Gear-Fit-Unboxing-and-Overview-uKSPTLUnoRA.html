consumer and today i've gotten unboxing
for you guys of the samsung galaxy gear
fit there's one of Samsung's latest
wearable text so let's not waste any
time let's get right into it all right
guys here we have the samsung galaxy
gear fit one of the three new pieces of
wearable tech by samsung it the gear to
end the gear 2 neo were released
alongside the new galaxy s5 the gear fit
retails for 200 bucks but let's see what
you get inside when you purchase it when
you open up the box you're greeted by
the gear fit but let's see what else you
get inside you also get a micro USB wall
charger and it features a flat cable
design but it actually feels a little
cheap in the hand due to the thinness
also inside you'll find a cradle that
you attach to the micro USB wall charger
and this is what you'll use to charge
the fit and it's a bit unfortunate that
it comes with this cradle instead of
being able to be charged by a micro USB
cable because if you lose this thing
you'll probably have to contact Samsung
to get another also included is of
course some paperwork you get a quick
reference manual and you also get a
health and safety warranty guide so with
that stuff aside there's nothing else
inside of the box so now let's take a
closer look at the gear fit itself the
gear if it has a really nice and
streamlined design and I'm actually a
really huge fan of the look once you get
rid of the annoying plastic you can get
a better idea of how clean this watch
looks it's definitely one of Samsung's
better wearable designs inside you'll
see the pins that the cradle uses to
charge the device as well as the
built-in heart rate monitor the straps
on the band are kept together by these
two nubs and it actually provides a
pretty secure fit another cool feature
is that the bands are also removable so
you can customize yours with a variety
of colors but now that we've unboxed
everything inside let's take a look at
some of the features when you first turn
it on it'll ask you to download the gear
fit manager app that you can find in the
Samsung App Store once you've downloaded
the app it'll take you to the gear fit
manager and sync with your gear fit and
that's when it comes alive when you
finally turn it on you'll have access to
all your watch and
this features you'd expect as well as
access to phone notifications a media
controller the ability to find your
phone and settings what's great about
the fitness manager is that you can
change everything on the fly you can see
here that I'm customizing the look of
the gear fit simply by touching it and
it happens in real time you can even
change the clock back comes on the
screen so you can get all different
kinds of looks and even downloading new
ones takes only a couple of seconds it's
very customizable and changes happen
seamlessly and from the manager app you
can also switch the layout of the icons
so you can put the ones you'll use most
up front and as I mentioned before you
can get notifications sent to your fit
by simply checking them off the list in
the gear fit manager and what's really
great about this it doesn't need to get
extra support in the app can use it so
it's really nice another nice touch is
being able to change the orientation of
it so if you don't want it to go
horizontally you can make it go vertical
if that's what you like and that's about
it for this unboxing and overview guys
the gear fit retails for 200 dollars and
is only compatible with samsung devices
