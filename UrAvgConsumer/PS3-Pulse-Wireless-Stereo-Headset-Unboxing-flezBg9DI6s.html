average consumer and you know I'm pretty
dressed up again but you guys will
probably see me like this and some of my
unboxing videos if I purchase a product
right out of work so I don't want you
guys to be too surprised when you see me
all dressed up but all that aside I'm
going to be unboxing for you guys today
the new pulse stereo headset from Sony
for the PlayStation 3
so let's not wasting time let's get
right into it alright guys so here you
have the pulse wireless stereo headset
for the PlayStation 3 and here's a quick
look around the box up front shows you
an image of the actual headphones or
headset and as you know that it's
introducing base impact technology which
basically convert the sound into
vibrations so you should be feeling some
impact so I'm sure this has like some
crazy base at least I'm expecting some
crazy base and all that good stuff so
you should really be able to feel the
sound that's what they're promoting so
it's gonna be interesting to see and the
back you have some more information on
it this you know has some high fidelity
speakers for dynamic sound oversized ear
pads for comfortable gameplay easily
adjust the intensity of the base impact
so you can actually control how much you
feel the impact of the base through this
new technology so if you you don't want
it to rattle your brains out then you
can control that or if you want it to
you can you know do that as well and
pretty much that's all got around here
got some noise cancelling for the mic
7.1 virtual surround sound on-screen
updates so if you controlling your
volume and whatnot you'll be able to see
that from the screen and you can use it
with multiple to like mobile devices
because it includes a three point one a
people in five headphone jack so that
works with all devices and this retails
for one $49.99 so it's a $50 price
increase from the original headset and
you know considering this has a bunch of
new features and all that it might be
worth it alright so now I've talked your
heads off let's unbox this thing
got my hand then the unboxing knife slip
this right open pretty simple and let's
pop this open I want to destroy the box
now there we go alright the packaging
was pretty similar to the original and
if you haven't seen my original one my
original unboxing you can find it in
this over in this this video right here
alright so we'll move this out this way
open this up so the first thing thing
the first thing we've got here is the
3.5 headphone cable so you can plug this
into devices alright got that l-shape
for the input into your devices and this
is just regular so that's what you got
here we've got some instructions alright
good stuff and I see so before we get to
this here is the little dongle that
you'll be using to get this connected
with your whatever device you actually
want to this is going to be used for the
PlayStation 3 you plug this right into
the USB cable on USB port or your PC or
anything you plug it right in and should
work now this has a headphone jack I'm
not sure what this is for but that's
pretty interesting let me give you guys
a close-up and here you guys have it
this is the dongle and it's that little
headphone jack that it has here so I'm
not too sure what this is for but I'm
sure the instructions would let us know
and I'll put an annotation to let you
guys know as well there you go
so now
put the stuff to the side - I'll keep
McDonald over here and now the star of
the show
false wireless headset it's always
interesting to take the last one that
has the same kind of packaging plastic
all around they're not the most fun to
take off all right there we go now I've
got it still got a ton of plastic
covering it up now why not let's take
this off - all right this thing has a
ton of plastic all over covering up a
lot of buttons and you know volume
rockers all kinds of stuff so alright
it's finally all out inside the ear cups
is a little dirty but alright I like the
feel of this this is - this is
definitely nice let me give you guys a
close-up of what I'm seeing alright guys
in here we have the pulse wireless
headset for the PlayStation 3 and I got
to say it looks pretty nice the
materials feel great on it
this feels even higher quality than the
original so it's very impressive and
you'd expect that for 50 bucks more so
let me show you guys a quick close-up of
all the different little functions and
features that are actually on this
headset and the first thing we have on
the left ear Cup is the sound - voice
volume rocker right here and what this
does is it allows you to tune in on the
sound of your of your game or the voices
of your teammates or whoever you're in a
party chat with and you can kind of
control which one you want to hear more
if you want to drown everyone out you
can put those sounds all the way over
here or if you only want to hear your
teammates and just voice chat you can do
that as well so it's pretty cool here
you have the power on and off switch
so you can just turn it on you can say I
just wish hit
switch right there and this is the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack so I can plug
them in you can plug in the cable here
and plug it into any other device that
you'd like right here is the USB cable
for charging it and here you have your
mic mute sir if you guys can see that
here you have your mic mute and over
here you have your volume rocker so goes
all the way around so it's pretty cool
so there's lots of stuff on one ear cup
alone and then there's more even more
over here on the right side and on the
right side you'll find the based impact
so you have the volume rock the I keep
saying volume rocker but the rocker here
for to control that so you can go from
max to off and you know it's pretty cool
that they allow you to turn it off you
might not like the feature so that's
always good
I'm not sure what this mode is for they
have I'm sure it has like different
modes but I'll probably those you guys
know what that does in the future and as
VSS on/off I think that's the virtual
surround sound so if you want that 7.1
virtual surround sound that's where you
can control it and all this is indicated
on the actual PlayStation so you get to
see all those features as you're
controlling them and pretty much this is
it guys pretty nice feature is pretty
solid feel to it let me show you guys
quickly what it looks like compared to
the old one alright guys so here's the
old one here's the new now it's gotten a
lot smaller and just a lot better
looking in my opinion a lot more
condensed real nice what I'm surprised
to see here is that there's no real
volume I mean not volume but there's no
mic that extends to my knowledge I can't
seem to find one here I showed you guys
all around it and I didn't see anything
so it's pretty interesting what's also
pretty cool about these headphones and
the old one included is as well but the
actual ear cups they kind of have this
little deep side here so that your gauge
can sit in there comfortably so that's
pretty cool so so these are made to be
very comfortable and pretty much that's
about it guys for this close-up
alright guys and that pretty much wraps
up this unboxing of the pulse wireless
stereo headset for the ps3 and I'm going
to have a review on this and if you guys
want to see a comparison video between
this and the old one feel free to let me
know down in the comments below and I'll
get right to that so alright guys is
llaves consumer thanks for watching and
i'll catch you guys in the next video
till then peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
