consumer and this is my top 5 favorite
headphones 2.0 and these are all
headphones that I've reviewed on a
channel so far so if I hadn't reviewed a
certain pair of headphones then you'll
probably won't see it on this list and
if you want to see the full review of
these headphones as I go through them
I'm gonna have an annotation right about
here that you can just click on and it
will take you to that review so let's
not wasting your time let's get right
into it
and the kickstart this list here we have
number 5 the new beats studios now I
know a lot of you are probably going oh
my god beats are on the list yeah they
definitely are the new beats studios are
definitely worthy of being in my top 5
now these have been a huge improvement
in comparison to the old Studios I was
never a real big fan of the old Studios
anyway but these have definitely gotten
my stamp of approval and I think at
least gotten a lot of stamp of approval
out there because um a lot of reviews
out there saying that these are
definitely a good improvement so I'm not
the only one so these are really great
they are very stylish they sound good
they're very very comfortable these have
some great ear pads the only thing
anyone can complain about is the 300
dollar price tag now if you're in the
market for a pair of Beats headphones do
you know that it comes with that price
tag so there's no real surprises there
but overall I really do like these they
made some great changes I do like the
fact that they've included a
rechargeable battery so definitely some
good stuff here definitely worthy of my
top 5 so sorry for the guys who don't
like beats out there but these are
really really good and now it's time for
number 4 here at number 4 we have the
audio technica ath M 50s now some of you
are going marthy solo on the list
these are absolutely great great
headphones but I've encountered a lot of
good headphones lately so these got
bumped down a little bit these are
actually not my favorite kind in sound
quality as far as my personal preference
but these are really really good they
sound absolutely amazing they sound very
clear they don't have as much basis I
like personally I'm a bass
head butt he sounds really good and I
use them like almost every day because I
use them for my video editing they go
outside of just like listening to music
for me so definitely really good stuff
and these are only about I think 150 or
lower I think you can find them for
maybe like 120 or so online on Amazon so
these are definitely in a really good
price range for a lot of consumers out
there and they're good for a wide range
of purposes I know some people use these
for gaming um editing you know recording
all kinds of stuff so these are studio
monitors they sound really great they're
not my favorite as far as the looks the
department and as far as portability
because of this big cable stuff like
that but overall these are really really
great headphones so they've gotta stay
on the list these are really good and
these are the eight ehm 50s and now for
number three on the list we have the
Logitech UE 9000 now you guys know I
love wireless headphones and these are
the best ones that I've tried as far as
Bluetooth headphones go he's actually
knocked out the beats Wireless for me
after trying these the beats Wireless
they just couldn't compare in my opinion
so I'd really really do love these
headphones now the only thing I don't
like about these headphones well there
are two things I don't like about these
headphones one is the price tag these
are 400 bucks um that's pretty expensive
but I mean I understand because this is
some great build quality really great
stuff but that $400 price tag might not
be what a lot of people are willing to
pay so I don't blame them for that but I
really do love these headphones
regardless and my only other qualms with
it is that these aren't foldable
but aside from that these are amazing
bluetooth headphones now a lot of people
say that bluetooth doesn't sound as good
as wired connection but I think that for
the average consumer you're not going to
be able to tell the difference and these
definitely do very very well they
provide a ton of bass it's very base II
but what's great about these is even if
you don't want to use them wirelessly
you can plug in the cable and still
listen with no problem you don't need
any battery power to get these to go you
can charge them up and listen to the
marios Li and turn on active
nice canceling all that good stuff if
you want but you can also just turn them
off and you know just plug it into your
device and listen away so definitely
some versatility here that I really do
like I think these are amazing Logitech
has done a really good job with their UE
series so the UE six thousands are also
very very good headphones and I'm in
love with the UE 9000 these are my go-to
bluetooth headphones so these are number
three and now for number two on the list
I have the v-moda m100 now these these
are amazing these are some really really
great headphones I absolutely love them
if you're a basehead these are an
absolute must and what I love about
these even though there's a lot of bass
it's also got a lot of clarity as well
and it's not just that muddy bass that
overwhelming boom boom boom these sounds
really good really really crisp so I'm
in love with these and what's also
really great about these is a low
profile you can actually just throw
these on and they're not like huge huge
headphones can't really tell that even
you know got a crazy pair of headphones
on so I really do love these and what's
also great is that it's also portable
you see how small this is this is great
there's just a lot of stuff to love
about these headphones they're just
absolutely great they're very durable um
these are built like a tank even though
they're not that huge so I love that so
something as durable as the logitech ue
9000 those look good and feel good but
it's also a bit more bulky these are not
bulky at all and they've definitely done
a good job in the durability apartment
so there's like little to complain about
here aside from maybe having to pay 300
bucks for these but these are still
definitely worth the investment very
very good for any basehead out there my
only real gripe is that they're not the
most comfortable after a long period of
time these ear cups are actually a bit
small but I think v-moda is actually
coming out with the extra large pair of
ear pads for these so that should fix
that problem so I'm looking forward to
getting my hands on a pair of those so
these are definitely my go-to headphones
whenever I'm leaving the house if I had
to pick a pair of headphones sleeve this
is always going to be probably my first
choice
so definitely good stuff here I'm really
really loving these so there goes my
number two and now for my number one if
you guys know me I'm gonna give you a
minute to pause the video and actually
go down and comment section below and
let me know what you think this is go
ahead I'll wait alright so now that
you've commented what do you think these
are of course it's the pulse wireless
headset these are the best for bass head
for a bass head I'm a complete bass head
and these are the hands-down best bass
you experience you can possibly have now
the other headphones do beat this out in
a couple of departments as far as
durability goes and portability which is
you know pretty vital but as far as just
a listening experience goes I don't
think anything comes close to these the
bass impact technology that Sony has
come up with on these is absolutely
amazing this is going to provide you a
bunch of head rattling action it has
virtual 7.1 surround sound built into it
it's got an internal mic you've got a
bunch of little options here these are
Wireless you can make in you can
practically make any device that has a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack wireless
so that's absolutely amazing this is
I'm fan blowing the hell out of these
right now but that's okay because these
are just that great and I think you can
find these online for about 130 which is
relatively cheap in comparison to all
the other headphones I've listed which
are like the $300 price range and even
the $400 price range it - you eat nine
thousands so this has them be in a lot
of departments and you don't need
batteries to use these you can plug them
in wire with the wire and just listen
away so if you've got a cable you can
use it these are absolutely amazing like
I said the only complaints that I could
possibly see our durability and
portability so that's about it but other
than that these are the King I don't see
anything beating these until Sony comes
out with a 2.0 for this or a new version
because these are just absolutely
amazing bass impact is a must for a bass
head
so definitely number one here and that's
been my list that's my top five now of
course I'm sure you guys might have
different opinions but let me know what
you think down below and also I want to
note that we do have an honorable
mention a very very honorable mention
and that goes to the Sennheiser
Momentum's these are actually really
really good headphones
I love these you can check my review for
them right here as well now these are
actually very low profile and they
actually sound really really good you
can hear instruments and clarity there's
a lot of good stuff going for these and
I really do like these as a low profile
on kind of headphones they rank in there
with the beam motives for me and as a
pair of headphones for travel as far as
like going to work or something I would
definitely take these over any of the
other headphones I've mentioned even
though um the motors do like these in
the looks department a lot and the sound
quality is really really good so
definitely good stuff here definitely
worth to mention and alright guys there
goes my list of top 5 favourite
headphones that I reviewed so far and if
there are any headphones that I should
be trying out that will definitely knock
some of these headphones out of the list
let me know what they are down below and
hopefully you enjoyed it and I'll catch
you guys in the next video till then is
your average consumer base
