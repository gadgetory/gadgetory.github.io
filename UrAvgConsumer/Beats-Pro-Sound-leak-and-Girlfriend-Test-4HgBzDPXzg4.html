want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
everyone at your average consumer and
this is my girlfriend hello and today we
have another sound leak and sound
isolation test for you guys okay the
girlfriend test and we're going to be
doing this with the beats by dre pros
now you guys have been asking for this
for quite some time now so let's not
waste any time let's get right into it
so first we're going to start off the
sound leak test with 50% volume and then
we're going to bring it up 75% and then
of course 100% and because these are the
beats pros we went out and got some ear
plugs I'm so excited to use these we got
them just in case because these are
really loud headphones and you guys
suggested that we grab a pair just in
case so thanks for your suggestions you
guys are protecting my hearing
appreciate that yep so thanks a lot guys
all right so now we're going to start it
off with a 50% volume on the sound we've
test you ready yep okay so we're going
to start 50% and we're going to go
I don't hear anything I hear a little
bit now but I bet you can barely hear
anything so definitely good at 50% I
barely barely heard anything so we're
going to crank this up to 75% and see
how that goes
okay so I definitely hear this a bit
more now I hear it pretty clearly too so
it's a big jump from not hearing
anything to hearing it pretty clearly
it's not very loud but still hear
clearly now we're going to jump into a
hundred percent and now guys I recommend
that you don't do this don't try this at
home okay but 50 to 100 percent volume
can definitely you're triggering for
long periods of time so be wary of that
and we're going to try them are you
ready yeah okay so I know you guys can
hear that pretty clearly this is not
even the chorus there you go so 100% is
definitely pretty loud and overall for
the sound League test 50% I could barely
hear hear anything at all
75% I heard it clearly wasn't allowed by
did hear clearly and 90% was obviously
very loud y'all aren't that a 75 would
it be obnoxious to someone maybe like
sitting in like a library setting you
know library setting yeah because you
have to be quiet there but walking
outside or the mess on the bus or
something like that no one would mind at
all I don't think alright so now we're
going to jump into the girlfriend test
okay so the girlfriend test is um what
we call the sound isolation test and
it's usually when I do something that
he's gonna see if he can block out with
his headphones so anything it can be by
possibly annoying or just bothersome to
him I try to do in this test to see you
can black it out um and I'm gonna take
his earphones
he's an ear plugs out jeanny them yeah
I'm a trooper guys I come out death
Donna didn't work
okay um you ready yeah Ritsuko okay so
this time what I'm going to be doing is
I'm going to be speaking very loudly on
the phone and laughing and I have really
loud laugh that he sometimes find a
little bit annoying I guess um so yeah
that's what we're doing a man assessed
all right
so stick to the same song here okay
bring it down we're gonna start of
course we're going to start this at 50%
75% and then 100% just like the sound
weak text hello yeah so tell me your
story again why completely finish it he
said what what I haven't you guys when
I've been like two days what goddess
that's crazy
so unfortunately some of that did get in
here 130 percent Jess wasn't quite
enough to beat out that racket hey so
we're gonna have to crank it up 75
percent see how it does bear alright her
imaginary friend okay
so go up 75 percent ready yes he said he
loves you that is so weird
okay to knock out with him yeah you're
right I figured that much about it okay
so 75 percent was definitely what it
took to block her out so it's hard for
some was just fine didn't hear anything
very happy about that
cool I hope you guys will find my laugh
too annoying it's alright see why are
black it up okay so now we're going to
jump to 100% and I'm pretty sure this
will work over just to see just how much
it does right
oh my god what a complete lunatic no
wonder he's single he's like 39 I know
that's really crazy
so yeah I don't know but I'm happy to
hear that you are definitely definitely
this guy all right so definitely nothing
at 100% so that definitely passed
overall I would say it's not so bad I
wish that 50% we blacked out a little
bit more I did hear a bit of her
conversation what did I wanted to I'm
guessing a little bit higher would
probably muffle her out but it wasn't it
wasn't so bad at the higher percentages
of course any percent completely knocked
her out so I'm definitely good about
that
overall for the Soundlink test it was
alright um from 50% there was no sound
leakage whatsoever
75% up there was a lot more and
girlfriend test wasn't bad as well
so um that's pretty much it for this
video guys Josh did you make a meal of
it there you go
also shout-out to you guys for helping
us reach 2,000 subscribers forgot about
that was really fast yeah definitely
moving along now so thanks to you guys

appreciate it and um that's about it so
