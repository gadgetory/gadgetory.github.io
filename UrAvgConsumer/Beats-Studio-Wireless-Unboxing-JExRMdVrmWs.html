consumer and I want to wish you all a
Happy New Year it is kind of hard to
believe that just about two years ago or
exactly two years ago I created the your
average consumer Channel and since then
I've gotten so many followers so many
subscriber supporters so many of you who
are interested in the content that I
create so thank you all for being there
throughout the first two years I'm going
to make sure that 2014 is just as
awesome as the first two years so like I
said thanks again guys for all your
support really crazy that I have this
many followers and subs but I figured I
start off the new year strong with
something you guys have been requesting
for quite some time now
and that's an unboxing of the new Beats
Studio wireless now you guys know I love
wireless headphones the price tag on
this thing is kind of crazy though 370
9.99 but I've had other Bluetooth
headphones in the four hundred dollar
range so we'll see how this goes but hey
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it all right guys here we have the
Beats Studio wireless and as I did
mention before these do retail for 370
$9.99 and you can find this in the Apple
Store Best Buy ton of retailers right
now um I wasn't even sure if I was going
to pick this up but I did get a ton of
requests from you guys so I decided I go
ahead with it and I love wireless
headphones anyway so why not now these
do come in right under the beats Pro so
these are the second most expensive
model of B sets you can purchase and
right here I have the matte black
version and the box is pretty typical is
what you would expect
and these look exactly like the new
Beats Studio so I'm interested in
knowing how you can use the Bluetooth
controls to control your music so we'll
see how that is and all right enough
blabbering let's get to the unboxing so
we've got some plastic wrap of course
and I'm going to use my little unboxing
knife just because I can and let's pop
it open so OOP there we go broke that
you can pretty much peel off the rest we
have it and it is undressed so all the
plastic you can kind of throw it over
here and I'll put this little guy away
so let's open this up of course we have
to slide this at the top as usual so we
got that here let's put that over here
so typical beats packaging as you would
expect let's slide this part up and this
is pretty much this very similar
packaging to the originals to the new
studios such as the original remastered
so let's pop this out so these are it
let's see what else we get inside of
here and of course the bottom here is
where you have your cables so let's see
we've of course got the power adapter so
you can plug this into your wall and
charge it of course these have two
rechargeable batteries inside you have a
USB cable so it's a pretty standard USB
cable here and let's see what else we've
got and we've got two cables interesting
so this now all this matte black version
has an all black beats cable so this is
pretty cool very nice so if the red is
going to clash with it for you they have
the black black cable here so this is
really nice interesting enough though
this doesn't have a inline remote so you
can't use this for that but this version
does and it see a classic red so what
you'd expect here very nice that they
included this so that's great and
usually with these uh you know bluetooth
headphones that boots have they you can
actually plug this in and use the cable
if you want to listen without blue to
of course you get a clip here as well
for the case and that's about it
for that and here you get a rusty
microfiber cloth
so you can wipe them down and you've got
some booklets and stuff this is pretty
much the boring stuff the booklets that
show all the other beats products
warranty information yada yada typical
stuff and they've got a new beats music
coming soon thing so there you go so
that's all the junk that you get inside
Wow
destroying my place all right so that's
all the stuff that you get inside it's a
bit messy so let me clean here up okay
so here we have the case and it's a
hardshell case is exactly what the new
studios came in so I'll see what it
looks like now this is the all matte
black version and very nice I do like
the matte black instead of the glossy
black this is not going to be a
fingerprint magnet like the black
version was so this is really cool very
nice
so looking at it here the instructions
say you know volume up volume down and
of course you've got your Bluetooth
button over here and it looks like
you're going to probably just have to
use these buttons here so hmm very
interesting and of course here's where
you have your power indicator at the
bottom so you can see how much battery
you've got left and you can also charge
it here and let me give you guys a quick
close-up of what the actual headphones
look like so here you have it guys these
are the black studios as well get the
stickers off now you can see that's an
all-black B so let's get rid of this one
as well so you can use this B on the
left ear cup to pause to pair it with
your device stuff like that volume up
volume down I'm pretty sure I would
assume that these can be used to control
the tracks
I'm really hoping so um and I'm hoping
this can work as some kind of play
pause really would suck for this to not
have those typical bluetooth headphone
features those are the things I love
most about Bluetooth headphones but I
must say guys this feels very nice and I
don't think that you're going to have
any issues with fingerprints you might
have an issue with like if you have
greasy fingers or something that might
be a problem but this matte black looks
amazing it looks really really nice
great great beautiful headphones as you
would expect of course very soft ear
cushions on that the studio is typically
have and this is it guys new beats
studio and matte black really good stuff
and I guess that's pretty much wraps it
up for this unboxing guys that's
everything that's included these
headphones look really nice I really do
like the feel of them it feels a lot
better than the plastic version so if
you plan on picking these up I
definitely do suggest trying out the
matte black it's a great feel and that's
about it for this unboxing guys proof
how cool you are and hit that like
button as usual and subscribe to the
channel if you want more content from me
and I'll catch you guys in the next
video of course I'm going to have
girlfriend tests and a review coming
soon so stay out the lookout for that
it's been a while since I've done a
girlfriend test so that's going to be
really fun so till then guys your
average consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
