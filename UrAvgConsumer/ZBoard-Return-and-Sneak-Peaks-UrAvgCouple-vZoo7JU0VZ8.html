once and I just took a hog knee and
holding on to it until he decides yeah
picking this up while I'm here well yeah
it looks like this place has grown a lot
since last time we've seen it some
snacks over here there's like a ton of
different
it's like never-ending oh yes so we were
probably spent like an hour in here but
you know what's the one thing that he
comes and does and I just have to suffer
through it it's okay oh that's your son
I always thought the shoe shopping that
you do alright guys check this out
they've got some really dope Dragonball
Z for the reins some Super Saiyan stuff
this Vegeta in the back here looks super
crazy that looks really nice
I feel like I should get that throw him
in a video but it kind of breaks the
whole Gundam theme they even got some
Megaman stuff over here for those of you
who aren't anime nerds sorry but I love
this stuff I well babies haven't got
Dragon Balls only ten dollars I didn't
come with figures in it write it down
well he can collect them all collect
lost Ivan

re one more try collect all seven
dragonballs and she is what we call the
hater guys but we pay hey there's no
mind over here alright guys so right now

couple of books some productivity books
some books a shape you're thinking good
stuff yeah I think I do enjoy other we
might read sometime sometime I picked up
this new book called the girl the dream
some mystery novel so look what I found
the manga section I'm huge on manga if
you guys don't know I like manga anime
we kind of went over this in the Gundam
planet but look I probably wouldn't buy
any of these though because they have it
all online pretty much translated so
this is a good series though siren I
read this very good stuff if you guys
have any awesome mangas or enemies that
you could recommend always always on the
lookout so leave your recommendations
down below I'd love to hear them

like three different cakes these are
from a company called grates and they're
made in Brooklyn so shout out to
Brooklyn you guys know I'm from there

different looks here so let's see what
they look like
first and this is a graphite one and oh

really really nice yeah yeah doing
really good house really pretty so
that's the first one here the second I'm
making such a mess oh those this is nice
dress nicely already
no this is nice dog you got another pair
right yeah yeah this is the last one now
these are like a standard black chair
over here some black kicks these these
are surprising these are all a favorite
he's my favorite for sure I think I'm
gonna go with this one I like these a
lot
I could see myself wearing those a lot
those really cute awesome and actually
pretty inexpensive I think you get one
as low as 50 bucks so that's a really
really nice price yeah it's like sweet
oh yeah this is like sweet that's
awesome this is legit real deal got some
options here as well that's pretty dope
and I'm a fan of these guys these look
really good so I have a link down below
the description for anybody I'll have a
link to my selection down below in the
description you guys can check them out
if you're interested you probably won't
find them in like a Foot Locker or
Macy's or anything like that
since they sell like directly on their
website kind of nice really Tesla like I
said guys cuz they're pretty expensive
are you eating anyway
these I have something check them in
these Blue Diamond almonds it's wasabi
and soy sauce as you see I got these on
Monday they're all - laughs yeah you
should clear them out we're on it
there's good I heard I thought wouldn't
like the bidet with a nice little spice
to them you can find that right yeah all
right so I'm just not focusing
good job Sonja oh they're spicy mm-hmm
one thing you guys I don't know I don't
know if you guys know this about me but
I hate spicy food spicy food fire food
why bring your mouth and it's smart
snacking so I wasn't in focus in all
right guys so I'm now at the part and
since it is still so nice out I can't
help but bus out the Seaboard
I am in love with this thing you guys
know that so I figured as soon as it
gets good
when I jump on this guy and let's go
shall we
there are always good times to be had on
the seaboard
Freeza nice scenery here to run over
this kid
get a killed exit yeah it's an electric
skateboard it's called a Z board
yeah forward back is that the control in
your hand but no actually the controls
are just on the pad it will pass here to
go forward this is like your brake but
you can kind of use it to immersive into
open ass what's going on when they see
it right man
so I've been playing Mario and now she's
fighting Bowser is it's kind of freaking
out it keeps like here we go before I
just went back okay here we go I'm up
I'm up
I don't understand I don't understand I
don't understand just survive maybe you
gotta keep going up this is our high
place again she freaks out it's so
scared I might used to playing game
she's supposed to be doing the unboxing
by the way she has her little setup here
but she's playing Mario picks out guys
oh my god no I can't believe it
my poor baby oh this is the point where
I asked him to play for me because you
can do it it's not gonna feel good if I
beat the game for you you won't feel
good we have you beat Bowser oh it's
perfect I could hear the neighbors
talking yeah I kill them so right now I
am working on the next video I guess
I'll give you a little sneak peek at
what's gonna happen so I've got my
camera here and this is actually the
main subject of the video I'm not doing
a review or anything like that because
god that would be crazy but what I'm
gonna be doing is giving you guys a tour
of all the equipment that I use to make
youtube videos
so from microphones to my camera set of
software I use all that stuff it's gonna
be going in this video so that's gonna
be pretty cool I get a lot of requests
on a what camera is that I will I get a
lot of questions rather about what
camera I'm using
what kind of mic that I have all that
kind of stuff so I figured might as well
as you guys know all the equipment I use
I usually have links down below in the
description but uh I guess you guys want
to hear from me personally what kind of
stuff that I'm using and maybe talk
about it a bit so that's the plan so
it's gonna cover video audio and I guess
accessories and software that's what I'm
gonna be uh that's how I'm gonna be
tackling it and over here you guys can
see I've got the new MacBook this thing
is friggin tiny it is a small but
beautiful computer very very tiny I
really like it re actually did be
unboxing for it
over here I do have this is the box for
it but I do have the spoils from our
last outing the tube Gundams that I plan
to build I'm super excited about this
one because it just looks friggin cool
it's got the whole angel wing thing
going while still being pretty badass
and this is another one this one looked
like it's gonna be a more daunting task
because there just seems to be so much
going on the box is so huge but I can't
wait to sit down and build them areas
taking a selfie or talking to someone on
the phone does scare her
that was hilarious jump
so right now re is hunting down these
little icy vendors that's okay
so I'll rephrase that just a second ago
are you was looking for a little icy but
always out here they're always here does
about where they are right now and they
just drive down this street so now we're
going to read us have yet you can finish
on the meters before ever have you guys
ever had this really really good great
eye sees especially the swedish fish
flavor yes
my favorite is mingle though okay mango
and Sudha's fish well more importantly
today is the day everyone gets their
Apple watch except for this guy
I ordered mine at like 1204 4 minutes
too late baby
I don't can't believe that though
because I was trying to load the site
the site wasn't working and then now I
know for pre-orders just used the app
the Apple Store app that is on the
iPhone that's what you got to do if you
want to get your pre-order in I used it
and for some reason I'm getting mine in
the middle of May
Austin ordered his two hours later and
his is the same ship date is mine I
can't believe it if it's crazy I'm sorry
babe
it's your fault amount here is Rita's if
you guys can never see this awning with
the white and red stripes
the right place so we've got our Rita's
this is the cherry flavor area of course
that Domingo they didn't have swedish
fish unfortunately but I actually got a
mix so I've got cherry up top and mango
should be somewhere down the bottom so
really good job very don't know what it
is but this cherry is whack right now
there's not the good flavor kind of
Hagen but I got it - so I just carry to
get to it alright guys so I think I'm
gonna end the vlog here I'm super tired
but I've got this video to edit you guys
got some sneak peeks I'll let you in on
what I'm gonna be working on and this is
it right now so I'm gonna be trying to
edit this bad boy get this done tonight
hopefully that's the plan anyway but all
right guys
