consumer and today I'm going to be doing
an unboxing of the Logitech UE 6000 so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it
alright guys so here we have two
Logitech UE 6000 and UE stands for
Ultimate Ears if you don't know so I've
never really known the Logitech to make
headphones or anything like that of this
level before so it's gonna be pretty
cool to try out you guys have been
asking me quite a bit to you know give
these a look and so here we have it now
I believe the six thousands are noise
cancelling as well these retail for
about 200 bucks I got mine from the
Apple Store and I got to say this has
some pretty cool packaging the earphones
look pretty cool so I can't wait for you
to try it out but you know let's cut
this thing open see what's inside the
box let's get my boxing knife here slice
those size thing and let's see look like
there might be something else
I'm a betting cut it all the way oh no
it's just flat all right boom so put
this away alright so I'm going to slide
this out
and there we go
and here it says Yui and I don't know if
you guys can see it but it's like
reflecting like little different colors
it's pretty cool kind of reminds me of
the background here but let's pop this
open alright so the first thing we're
gonna look at is this little box right
here it's got a flap and there's just
some light packaging I must admit and
let's see here we've got some setup
guides and things like that so all that
fun stuff we'd like to read let's put
this away let me show you guys a bit of
what's inside here this is what the box
looks like on the inside we've got the
headphone case right here and this is
interesting I've never seen a case
that's in a square shape so this is
pretty cool
let's put that to the side let's see
what we have over here I believe let's
see this is a splitter okay so it comes
with a splitter and give you guys a
quick close-up so it seems like it comes
with a splitter I'm not sure what the
reasoning behind this is maybe there's
something with the headphones I don't
know but here's a splitter so you can
plug in two headphone jacks at once
connected to one device so that's pretty
cool that they have this probably as we
go in a little deeper into the unboxing
we can see if there's a reason behind it
alright so we'll put this to the side
and the last but not least we've got the
actual cable and let's just pull over
here and it's a big blue cable tangle
free cable so that's nice love the
window tangle free and there we go so
this is very this is kind of similar to
on the street by 50 with their blue
cable but this has an inline remote and
Mike let me give you guys a close-up
alright guys so here we have this you
e6000 cable it's got the inline remote
here playing pause now I'm pretty sure
this will work with all Apple device
devices it says it on the box and for
Android I would assume that it works to
play and pause button
works for the inline remote but the
volume control is probably not and
pretty much this is it here is the other
end that goes into your device it's an L
shape so it's pretty interesting but it
is raised so if you have a case this
will not be an issue this should still
plug in just fine so it's pretty cool
cable alright this over here and now to
the star of the show the UE 6000 open up
the case this is a soft case so it's
pretty soft I don't know if it's gonna
offer the most protection it's not hard
shell but it is soft shell case and it's
actually got some pretty good padding on
the inside and these look sick Wow
alright but yeah it's got some pretty
good padding it has a pouch on the
inside it's here and yeah pretty much
this is it
pretty nice case and here we have the u
e6000 and I must say these look great
I'm really surprised here this looks
really really cool it's got a matte
finish at the top and it's got a really
soft cushion here ear-cups feel great
this is really nice stuff I'm just feel
solid I'm impressed so it's got a little
sticker here let's pull this out not
sure what it's for
probably the battery or something okay
so that's out not sure what that just
did but oh ok so it leads to the
batteries I just hit a switch here at
the bottom you know what good time for a
close-up alright guys so here we have
the you e6000 and like I said I'm very
impressed I love this blue on the side
here this is really nice it's got blue
ear cups these ear cups look like it's
gonna be very comfortable as they're
oval so your whole year is probably
gonna get inside with no problem here so
that's really really cool um and here
this is what I found at the bottom a
little switch so when you press that it
actually pops up in the sides and it
leads to the batteries so it's going to
require two triple A batteries
and one thing I must say I don't know if
it works with the with or without
batteries I'm gonna test that out and
let you guys know but um I gotta say
that this is a fingerprint magnet as you
can see already but this looks so good
I'm okay with that
so um let's see what else we got here
this is the power switch on the right
ear cup that is right here Cup right
yeah okay so this is the power switch on
the right ear cut push it up and it goes
green I like that the batteries are
already installed there's no work for
you and boomed here we have it just feel
this swivels a bit as you can see
suggestible and they can fold up so
that's pretty cool so I'm really
impressed by these I I'm loving it and
pretty much that wraps up this close up
guys
and pretty much guys that wraps up this
unboxing this looks like a really cool
pair of headphones these were 200 bucks
honestly I I don't know I think I like
this more than that like let's say the
solo HD is at this price range as far as
looks go and I think these were better
than the SOL Republic tracks they just
ultra so a lot of headphones at this
price range I would say that this is the
best-looking that I've come across so
far I'm really loving this
alright guys enough of my rambling I'll
let you guys know how it sounds how well
the noise cancelling is gonna work when
the girlfriend test all those videos are
soon to come stay tuned if you like this
video please feel free to rate comment
and subscribe and I'll catch you guys in
the next one so that is your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
