Moto 360 mblaq I kind of like it

is it looks like the bands are gonna get
really ugly over time so I'm not crazy
about that it looks like it's beat up
already I haven't even worn yet this one
looks like it's going to withstand the
test of time a bit more so I'm not sure
what do you guys think help me choose
vote down in the comments below
black or gray
all right guys looks like we're gonna be
here a while
I'm sorry I was right all right guys
here we have an example of a bad
consumer she's doing her research in
store okay
you should have been on YouTube watching
some beauty gurus or system over viewing
these products God now we're seeing her
staying at these things forever guys all
right guys so the moment you've all been
waiting for
it is this is the humble abode
this is just our apartment it's the
first apartment we aren't actually
sharing together which is cool and we
got this apartment about a year ago yeah
they know ain't no one we move it yeah I
love one year ago so um yeah see so as
you guys can see we have like uh if
carpet is our couch with it we have this
elliptical I'm on it every day yeah guys
I think she's used it once on my second
time this is her second time she refuses
to get on it is it nice elliptical yeah
he bought it for me for Christmas I
don't know but it was pointless anywho I
got I got some weights over here too
I don't know why I haven't used them at
all I'm over here yeah see the section
here is what you guys see in my room
it's not a weed plant okay it's just a
fake plant IKEA oh oh yeah I was proud
of the design that this place that goes
everything is me in here so if you don't
like it blame me if you like it
congratulate me or give me your
accolades whatever um our pillows and we
got this so let's make great little buns
here this is a special brunch open it up
then I got tons and tons oh this is this
is our addiction and full effect guys
and this is not even
stuff under that it's just what your
ears there are cards and card like guys
you have no idea how many cards are in
here you really just do not definitely
owe their thousand thousands we have
thousands like tens of thousands I'm
sure there's a medial part there too
from our older Oh very few you your
cards but I'm sure they're like we've
we've had to have hit 10,000 oh my god
she from everybody else no one knows
what happened
we're just know we're gonna soon I'm
assuming people okay you never know that
there's a bunch of Pokemon cards in
there anyway area a lot yeah this is
where Africa's from boxing's the dining
table but it's a nice little area I love
the spot oh headaches against this
dining table like oh we win we'll save
it guys we went through it for this
table because my beautiful girlfriend
here wanted it like you think I was
crazy then oh my god I can't imagine
foot like when I become a bridezilla or
something I was crazy bad people
so this is the kitchen nothing special
about a kitchen just a quick overview so
you guys can see it not that I like it
here's one thing about me I am a crazy
for cereal i as you can see this is more
one of the more tame looks of our
refrigerator right now because I usually
have double stacks of zero everywhere I
want to show them my degree oh but this
is my degree from the University of
Pennsylvania I got my masters from the
Ivy League baby smarty pants a little
hamper and this is what one of the
bathrooms
it's undelete oh this is one of two
bathroom so uh yeah this is one I guess
to use right now I'm not matching towels
but yeah no matching towels this is
usually a brown one over here but we got
a switch monarchy now and Dan you know
keep it clean so this is the bathroom
Congrats to addy from making that setup
and also hang the pictures by myself he
was never and I like
that's why it's time to let me show this
picture it killed us every time
it's slanted if you look it from the
side you can tell it it's slanted that's
because it's a woman's handiwork I mean
it's my handiwork
I'm sure other women can help hang it
pictures but anyway yeah that's when I
was in Philly she I wasn't here to help
out that much so I was a struggling
mother single mom
get out of here well you guys know this
spot this is the office I'm not gonna
give you guys a crazy tour or anything
because I gotta save that for the actual
office tour where I show you all the
little bits and pieces but this is it
you guys know it it's familiar Gundams
headphones yes yeah my degree right here
drexel university boom boom boom my
schedule don't look at that and this is
addressed to people who said oh my god
you have your own room Hijaz yes so this
is my room in that like I got just like
decorate the house the way I wanted to I
have all my stuff on my crap is housed
in here all his crap is housed on there
but of course like we share an apartment
we share every room together
well yeah think about it guys if I have
my own office
it'd be crazy for me to want to have
half of this room as well come on mom
I'm not a compromise I thought yeah
that's what makes us a great couple okay
and this is just my room it's a little
overview of my room first I'll come in

on top of carpet kind of weird but I
thought it like we fit the style of the
room I don't know yeah a little seating
area and then my bed um over here we
have like this okay so this part was
kind of inspired by madmen a little bit
kind of my own take on Mad Men it yeah I

little oh my gosh someone thought this

jewelry holder just
a little what American Pam I like a lot
