want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
guys this J average consumer I've got
another little unboxing for you guys
this time we have two wireless studio a
headset from for the PlayStation 3 by
Sony alright let's get right into it
alright so let's open this thing off now
I wanted to get this because I've
hearing I've been hearing that it's um a
pretty nice experience while you're
playing your game and with this nice
only three display Africa why not go
all-in and all the right stuff to make
sure it's a really nice experience while
playing my games and watching movies so
I figured I'll pick this thing up I
heard some pretty good things about it
I'd give it a try myself alright so
inside the box so this is the box and
I'll take what you get inside you've got
something formation
I'm sure manuals and speakers itself
under the headphones themselves
I like how crushing it feels already and
there's also a dongle to go with the
backbone themselves so they're not
pollutant or anything they use this
dongle to connect to the ps3 I believe
these these work for computers as well
I've seen people talk about connecting
it to their pcs and their Mac's so you
know I'm definitely gonna give that a
try
I'm not expressing any hi I'm not
expecting anything the quality of life
let's say you know my beats or anything
like that but I've heard that you know
the experience the sound experience on
this is really nice so figured I'm gonna
try let you guys know how it compares of
course I don't know if there's any point
been comparing it with the Beatles or
anything like that since you can't use
those for gaming or you know connecting
it to your ps3 to listen to but um I'll
use it as like a I guess I'll use the
beats as a reference if you're familiar
with them to have these some I'm hoping
these decent sound quality on them
but I really like the look of these it
feel pretty nice this definitely screams
Sony Playstation these seem pretty soft
here you have the mic now I don't play
so many online games
well I'm mainly an RPG kind of person
but we'll see how these work out um I
guess how I have some online games
though so I can let you guys know how it
sounds when I guess communicating with
others I definitely think we got some
insight on that once I can you know once
I start using these and get a review up
as you can see here you have your volume
control you can just slide it up and
down so that's pretty nice it's in a
pretty good spot you can go behind the
air here you have the mic as I said
before and it sounds pretty far-out
which is I guess good for people who are
gonna be using it and here you have
where you plug in your USB and pretty
much that's all there is to it oh let's
see this is for the volume and oh okay
so I'm here has a sound and voice option
I'm guessing you can slide this to see
how much of the person the sound between
the video game you're playing and the
voice of let's say someone here on the
tiara on the same team within a online
game or someone you're an online match
with so he can drown out the sound of
the game and listen will focus more so
on the voice or you know draw out the
voice and just listen to Don the game
itself so that's pretty nice I didn't
even know that you had an option like
that this feels real I would really like
the material here it's really soft
um feels like a leather I'm not sure if
it
leather and every film leathery
everything this is a good material I
really like this it feels 30 overall
this is so far I'm impressed with this I
can't wait to give it a try um I'm gonna
plug this in see how it works I heard
that it as soon as you plug it in you're
really pretty much good to go I'm gonna
have a review up for it shortly it
shouldn't take me long as I play you
know a couple of games tonight and for
the next couple of days and I'll let you
guys know how it sounds all right so
this has been a quick unboxing of the
wireless stereo headset for the
PlayStation 3 alright and I hope you
guys enjoyed the video please feel free

questions you guys want and I'll be sure
