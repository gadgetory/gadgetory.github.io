unboxing today this right here is the
PlayStation 4 Pro 500-million edition
so basically sony has sold 500 million
PlayStation units so they came out with
a very very special version of the ps4
Pro which they only made 50,000 units of
and I'm not gonna lie to you guys
I am extremely extremely excited to open
this up but let me stop rambling let's
get to it and here we have it guys this
is the box and it's got a pretty
interesting design spoiler alert this is
a transparent console so the box itself
is transparent so that's a pretty cool
effect so this is a box that I
definitely don't want to mess up since
it's such a special console so let's see
now this this is nice
I feel like I just want to go for the
police station but let's take this out
put it to the side and you know what
let's shake things up a bit here let's
go straight for the console and see what
that looks like we never do that we
always go for all the other things let's
go straight for this guy oh okay this
this is nice and what's the opens these
are all labeled with what unit it is out
of 50,000 and ours right here is 49,000
and 84 that's really close to the end of
the line Wow
so 49,000 I'm not mad somebody's been
doing transparent controllers forever
I'm not sure if they've done transparent
systems before but
and this is really really nice take a
look at back here guys and they're still
plastic all over and I'm gonna take that
off in a second now this is a bundle so
we're going to see a few other things
right here we have the controller oh wow
this is a sweet-looking controller nice
now it is super shiny and it's got a
nice gloss to it but wow this looks way
better than I thought it would now
what's great about this is that they
still sell these even if you don't get
the entire bundle so you can still go to
like Best Buy Amazon they still sell
these guys so if you want to pick this
up
I recommend it this looks really nice
but you might go crazy if you care about
finger prints and you also get in this
bundle the PlayStation camera now I
don't know how many people even really
use the PlayStation camera but it is
included and it also comes with the
whole theme so it's got that blue look
to it this one's not transparent but it
fits the theme just as well and let's
see this is the paperwork and probably
the cables and stuff oh okay so we got a
couple of cool things in here actually
so this is the stand that you can use if
you want to put your PlayStation in a
vertical position so this is also
transparent and you've got your basic
cables you've got your power cable HDMI
cable as well as a micro USB for your
controller and all you see this is kind
of cool there's some attention to detail
here that I wouldn't expect even the
little mic that you get when you buy a
Playstation 2 crummy from mic and
headset it also has the theme so it fits
the theme as well it's got that
see-through blue this is a nice little
bonus here sony didn't skimp out on any
of the pieces in here so that's nice and
even the paperwork has been redone this
sucks though guys with only 50000 being
made
chances are if you try to purchase one
now they're gonna be paying a pretty
penny these this retails for 500 bucks
but if you go online right now and try
to buy when you're definitely paying a
thousand bucks or more so if you want to
pay those scalper prices for a nice
console that's what you're looking at
all right yeah so that's everything
that's in the box but what's missing
here is the PlayStation Gold headset
which also has a 500 million edition so
that's what we have over here the gold
wireless headset now I'm not a fan of
the gold wireless headset to be honest
with you guys I would have liked that
they did this with the platinum but
maybe they wanted to be inexpensive so
you can pick this up for a hundred bucks
but let's take a look at what you get
inside of here as well okay so they get
right to it and you can see the headset
you can pull it right out and here it is
and this looks good too this matches of
course it matches the theme you hear me
say that over and over but this looks
really nice as well you see I've been a
while since I tried the gold headset on
nice let's see you get a couple of other
things you of course get your Quick
Start Guide which also shows the special
edition on it and you get a little pack
e here so inside of here you get your
USB cable you get your audio jack and
your USB dongle so that you can connect
it to your ps4 and start listening yo
I'm not gonna lie the gold wireless
headset looks really really good in this
if you prefer to use the gold wireless
headset this is a version worth picking
up it looks dope I don't know why Sony
didn't do platinum though they should've
all right guys
here we have it this is the entire five
hundred million Edition PlayStation 4
pro bundle everything that you get and
I'm not gonna lie to you guys sony
outdid themselves I really love the look
of everything inside of here this is a
good look Sony paid a lot of attention
to the details here and I think they did
a good job they nailed it and this is
gonna feel really special for anyone who
was able to get their hands on it but
there's one more thing that we need to
do here let's plug this guy in and power
it on to see
please with that transparent body piece
I love it that is nice this is one of my
favorite PlayStation 4s ever this is
awesome but honestly that's about it
guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you
were one of the lucky few to get your
hands on one of these systems let me
know what to comment down below if you
guys like these kind of special edition
unboxings also feel free to hit that
thumbs up you know be that cool guy or
girl but I'll catch you guys in the next
video till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
