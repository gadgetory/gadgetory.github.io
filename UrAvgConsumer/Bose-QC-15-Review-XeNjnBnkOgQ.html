consumer and today I'm gonna be doing a
review of the Bose QC 15s you guys have
requested this for I don't know how long
now so I'm finally gonna get into the
review so it's not all wasting your time
let's get right into it alright guys
here we have the bose QC 15 known for
their amazing noise cancelling and their
hefty $300 price tag so let's see if
it's worth your money and check out some
of the stuff that it comes with as we
take a look at the case of the QC 15s
you can see that it has a nice soft
coating but it's actually a hardshell
case this is a pretty flat case and the
back features a little pouch in case you
want to carry something in it and also a
loop at the top if you'd like to attach
a clip when you open the case you'll of
course see that the QC 15 stake
comfortably inside you can expect little
to no movement from these headphones
when inside the case due to the raised
bumps that fit inside of the ear cups
you'll also notice that this has a
little zipper pouch that attaches to the
inside of the case with velcro this is
another little place that you can hold
accessories like batteries cables etc
and it's nice that it can be put right
inside of the case and taken out in case
you don't want it there and due to the
flat design of this case it's gonna be
very easy to travel with it and that's
probably one of the best things about
these headphones and case the
portability of these is just great and
now to the star of the show taking an
actual look at the QC teams you'll
notice that those went with the more
minimalist design here there are no
large pieces on this headphone at all
and this is what helps with portability
they're very small and compact although
they don't bend in the headband area but
I actually find that that's okay since
it does have a very flat design and it
doesn't take up much space when it is
flat but what's also really great about
these headphones is the comfort honestly
I view these as a traveller's headphones
and they really do well as far as
comfort listening for long periods of
time they can fit anyone's head size
it's really just really comfortable I
would have to say that they're more
comfortable to me than the 8 th and 50s
which
I felt to be the most comfortable pair
of headphones that I've used in a long
time and what's great about these is
that there's a deep crevice in the ear
cups and as you can see here I can fit
my entire thumb inside and that's how
your ear fits inside it won't have any
issues touching up against anything
these are definitely the prime example
of over ear headphones and now to go
into what I think is the number one
feature of these headphones and that's
the active noise-cancelling when you
turn it on on the right ear cup you'll
notice a little green light show up to
indicate that the noise canceling is on
and what's great about these is that the
active noise-cancelling you won't be
able to hear anything at all that's
around you so like I said this is
perfect for the traveler so if you're
watching something on a plane or maybe
on a bus anything like that you won't
hear a thing it's going to be just
enough to focus on what you're watching
it's honestly just mind-blowing how good
these are if you see in my girlfriend's
house video my girlfriend was quite
surprised when she heard a noise
canceling for the very first time really
good stuff here the unfortunate part
about these headphones is that they do
need batteries in order to operate and
I'm really not a fan of headphones that
forced you to use a battery with noise
canceling because once the battery dies
you no longer have usable headphones and
I'm really not a fan of that taking a
look at the cable that comes with the
headphones you'll notice that it has an
output level switch that has high and
low and one of the cables actually has
an inline remote for Apple devices and
play and pause for Android and there's
another one without the remote and you
can put that output level switch right
inside the ear cup and it pretty much
goes away it kind of disappears into the
headphones unfortunately this doesn't
come with a tangle free cable so yours
may end up like this if you aren't
careful but I'm very happy that this
comes with a raised input for headphone
jacks because this means that mobile
devices with a bulky case can have no
trouble here when using it and now of
course to talk about sound quality the
sound quality on these is actually
pretty nice I did enjoy listening to
these I did notice however that the
volume wasn't that loud even if I put
the
output switch on the cable to high so
that was one thing that was really a
little concerning to me so if you really
like loud music these probably won't be
the best bet for you but overall with
sound quality I did find that it was
very very clear you can hear instruments
pretty nicely the bass wasn't that heavy
although if you like a flatter sound
meaning if you don't like any emphasis
on any particular part of sound you will
find the bass probably a little more
than you want but it wasn't enough for a
bass head or anything like myself but
the sound quality is very clear I did
like the sound on these these are
definitely one of the clearest sounding
headphones that I've tried to date so
very good there I wouldn't have any
issues recommending these to the average
consumer looking for some nice crisp
sound and who travels a lot as I do
think these guys are made chests for
travel although travelers I do suggest
always carrying around an extra battery
just in case and alright guys time for
me to show you how it looks around the
neck and when I have it on so first here
we have it around the neck and you can
see it's pretty simple style um I must
say though that it is a little
constricting I feel I'll probably
because of these some ear cups they kind
of go into your throat a bit unless you
widen up the UM the the headband part so
make sure you want to do that if you
want to have it around the neck but when
you want to have it on here's how it
looks and of course fix this and here we
have it this is the front side view and
of course on the sides and there you
have it
and overall guys I gotta say I did like
the QC 15 if they had a really clear and
crisp sound they didn't have that much
bass and it really wasn't too loud for
me um when outside I did find myself
trying to pump the volume of even louder
than 100% I just couldn't so I'm not too
happy about that but overall it did have
a clear sound though and the noise
cancelling is what you would expect of
it I didn't pass the girlfriend test
that well but I can say that in other
situations just being outside it did
very well in black
you know just regular sounds like in the
street on the train things like that so
overall very impressed by the noise
cancellation here and that about wraps
up my review guys hopefully you enjoyed
it please feel free to rate comment and

I'll catch you guys in the next one
till then is your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
