consumer and today I have an unboxing
for you guys of the Neal Apple earpods
so let's not wasting your time let's get
right into it
alright guys so here we have the Apple
earpods um this should be pretty
standard headphone to do they're
supposed to be like in here
Apple spent like 3 years designing these
so it's gonna be really interesting to
see how these work I'm also very
interested to see if these can actually
stay in my ear I have a really hard time
having my headphones staying right here
so that'll be a good thing to know if
this really can fit everyone's ear as
Apple states that it can so I love about
that let's get to the unboxing of this
or opening up the case anyway so there's
a little plastic here take this off and
it's pretty simple to be honest but here
we are and then I just got to unravel
this it seems like a pretty long cord
and here we have the inline remote and
here are the ear pods alright so you
know it does feel a bit better there's a
little more high quality I'm gonna give
you guys a close-up of what I see here
alright guys and here you have the ear
pods like I said these are supposed to
be able to fit in anyone's ear it's a
very interesting design I can't wait to
try it out
umm I'll definitely have a review and
girlfriend tests and soundly tests all
that good stuff of these ear pods I'm
really happy with the fact that um they
kind of moved away from having those
little rubbish tips at the bottom that
always end up after some time getting
really soft and really worn out it does
seem to be a little visible right here
between the actual ear pod and the cord
this little part in the middle but you
know that one's not as significant as
the older versions so I'm really happy
about that
these look like they'll be able to last
a little longer due to the design
it being harder instead of this little
soft part at the stem of the earpods
so I'm really happy about that and of
course you know you have an inline
remote this will work with your iPhone
iPod all kinds of stuff your Mac's
anything Apple related really so you've
got the volume up and down and um yeah
just really happy to see that these are
a little better quality than the
previous ones and they're only thirty
bucks so that's definitely a good thing
alright guys that pretty much wraps up
to some boxing all you really get is the
ear pods and their case and I must say
this is a pretty good case because it's
similar to the Apple in ear headphone
case that I have and it offers good
protection for these kinds of headphones
because this is a skinny cable and it
can get tangled or damaged depending on
you know where you throw them or
something like that so this is a nice
place to store them and you can kind of
keep them in there and it'll keep it
safe and you know clean and all that
good stuff so definitely happy that it
has this case and also what I want to do
now is I want to try these ear pods on
because I like I said I have really
weird shaped ears and most um ear buds
don't really sit in with my ears so if
you're similar to me and you know you
have really hard time finding ear buds
that staying in your ears we're gonna
try it out right now to see if Apple's
three-year design really works for
everyone and let's try it out right now
let's see um overall it seems like it
fits pretty well I do feel it moving
quite a bit I am shaking my head quite a
bit but I could tell like if I walked
around like these are slipping out this
is pretty pretty much what I would
expect from regular ear buds so I mean
just can't fault them for it it's just I
know I have really weird shape ears but
oh well I just wanted to show you guys
if it really works for everyone or not
but I guess I didn't work for me but
either way stay tuned for my review guys
on these um ear pods and also the
soundly can sound exhalation test that
you guys know is the girlfriend test
and I have those videos up soon so
thanks for watching if you enjoyed this
video please hit that like button and
you know comment subscribe all that good
stuff I'll catch you guys in the next
video if your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
