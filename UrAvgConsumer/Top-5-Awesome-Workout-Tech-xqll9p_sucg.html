know where to start well there's an app
for that and it's called Fitness buddy
this app offers a ton of functionality
it shows you an absurd number of
workouts seriously it's absurd and it
allows you to pick the area you're
looking to work out and you can even
dive in a bit deeper and target specific
muscles one of my favorite things about
this app is that it shows you
demonstrations for each workout you get
some images and text to give you an idea
of what to do and if you still aren't
sure how to do it or you just want to
get the form right you can watch a super
short video demonstration only have a
few pieces of equipment at home not a
problem
you can even break it down to sections
based on the gear you have on hand you
can of course track your daily workouts
and your progress over time gains and if
you're at a loss for where to start they
even provide some pre-made workouts for
you to follow now made it sound like an
app for newbies but even seasoned gym
goers can use it to discover new
workouts or just as a workout tracker
and I've got one more app for you guys
to check out and that's my Fitness Pal
personally when I try to take going to
the gym seriously I love to count my
calories
it's a great way to keep your goal in
mind and helps you to be a bit stricter
about your eating you've just got to
tell it the goals you want to achieve
and how active you are or plan to be and
it'll give you a set amount of calories
you need for the day you can track
breakfast lunch dinner and even snacks
with a huge library of food items that
you can search through and I love that
it has a feature that lets you scan the
barcode of whatever you're eating and
all the info you need for tracking pops
right up and it'll even give you some
nice tips or warnings throughout the day
if you do something like taking too much
sugar
both of these apps go way deeper than
what I've mentioned so they're
definitely worth checking out if you
want to take working out to the next
level next up we have Pro mix the
original vortex mixer back in college I
had something similar to this and it was
a game changer most of us are used to
that blender bottle with the little ball
inside but who really enjoys shaking
that thing after a long workout with the
vortex mixer you can get your shakes
mixed with the press of a button
literally you can give the button a
slight press to mix until you let go or
push it all the way in for it to mix on
its own until you press it again and
it's actually pretty powerful so you
don't have to worry about clumps or it's
not mixing your shake well enough it's a
pretty simple device but man do I find
it useful and making a protein shake
isn't the only reason I love the pro mix
I also use it with a meal replacement
called Soylent if you guys follow my
vlogs you know I'm super lazy when it
comes to cooking
so when Soylent reached out to me I was
all over it it's a super healthy meal
option and what's crazy is that each
serving of this powder contains 25% of
your daily nutritional needs and it's
healthy enough to have this in place of
a meal like lunch or dinner and three
meals worth cost less than eight dollars
a day it's super convenient since all I
have to do is throw it in my pro mix and
add water it's an easy and affordable
option for you health nuts out there or
the folks like me who are just too lazy
to cook a meal if you don't feel like
mixing or even using the pro mix to get
the job done
you can grab Solent 2.0 which comes
pre-made and ready to go and with 20
grams of protein and each serving it's
great for you guys will probably be
inspired to go to the gym after this
video so if you want to get your hands
on Soylent and save some cash on your
subscription check the description for
the link and coupon while on the topic
of food and drinks you want to make sure
you're getting good results right
so here we've got the Fitbit Aria the
Aria is a smart scale that'll track your
weight BMI lean mass and body fat
percentage this info goes straight to
your Fitbit app on your smartphone
through the use of Wi-Fi you can see
charts that detail your lean weight
versus your fat which gives you the
perfect visuals of how well you're
building muscle and shredding away that
fat it's a really simple way to track
your progress by just jumping on the
scale it even supports multiple users so
it's great if you aren't the only one
with weight goals at home it even offers
meal and activity tracking which of
course will benefit you even more if you
own one of their fitness bands and
speaking of fitness bands my tracker of
choice is my app
watch sport it has everything you need
from a heart rate monitor dedicated
workout tracking tracking the calories
you burn during the day and a bunch more
it even gives you subtle reminders to
stand when it notices you've been
sitting for too long and as annoying as
it is it's actually perfect for me it
also gives you periodic reminders of how
active you've been throughout the day
and lets you know how close you are to
the goals you set and with the companion
app on the phone you can get a good look
at how you've been performing overall
over the past few weeks one of the
things I really like about the Apple
watch that sets it apart from other
fitness band is its ability to use apps
so you can interact with something like
the MyFitnessPal app I mentioned earlier
and this versatility is why I like the
Apple watch as my main fitness tracker
and last but not least we've got the
j-bird x2 music and gym go hand-in-hand
so if you're looking for some good audio
this is all you need the x2 is have a
very small footprint so you won't have
to worry about them getting in the way
of your workout with some long dangling
cable they're also sweat proof so if you
happen to sweat buckets these will be
just fine they also include ear fins
which will make them stay in place even
if you're doing some outlandish workout
but not only are they made to handle
people with very active lifestyles they
also sound great vocals coming very
clearly and they've got some awesome
bass too if you want to listen to music
that'll get you pumped up these are
perfect they're one of my favorite
listening devices and with this quality
you can't go wrong but that about wraps
it up for my list if you found it useful
be the cool guy that gives this video a
thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in the
next video till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
