an unlikely character this is a deadpool
themed gaming laptop setup and everybody
in there mama seems to love the black
and red color scheme so let's jump right
into it now the idea behind the setup
was to have a dependable and very
capable laptop that can be used on its
own but also can kind of go into desktop
mode when you want to hook it up into
the setup now the Acer nitro 5 was my
inspiration for the set up and shoe toss
at Acer for not only sponsoring today's
video but also sitting over there 15.6
inch version for us to use and what I
like about this gaming laptop the most
honestly is the price is actually pretty
good bang for your buck now this is a
gaming laptop so it has a dedicated
graphics card and is packin the nvidia
gtx 1050 Ti and with that card you'll
definitely only be able to do some
pretty solid gaming there's something
called the GeForce experience so you can
have the optimal settings for playing
certain games and you'll even be able to
stream online with your friends even
though this isn't meant to be a gaming
powerhouse you're still getting a
quality laptop although I will say the
trackpad does take some getting used to
I just wish you were a little bit more
sensitive so you have no problems gaming
here in 1080p event that means playing
on medium and not high settings now of
course the specs that you go for will
determine your experience with the
performance but these are rocking
Intel's latest
8th gen processors and you also have the
nitro sense software so that you can
keep an eye on your CPU and GPU and if
you have so you can even turn on their
cool boost features where it kicks up
the fans kind of keeps the whole system
cool that way you're able to do whatever
it is you're doing without a slowing
down now this isn't meant to be a more
mainstream laptop not for the gaming
enthusiasts out there but for the
mainstream who won a game properly
overall I've got to say this is a pretty
solid device for its price so if you're
a gamer or want to get started with
streaming this could be a great option
in terms of overall value now we talked
about the machine behind the whole setup
but now let's talk about everything
we've got going on here so of course we
have it attached to a monitor and this
is the Acer predator z1 MPU black and
red lovers you know this is clean now I
picked up this predator z1 because the
thing looks clean especially with that
Deadpool wallpaper that of course have
link down below in the description I
know you guys are gonna have
we're and this monitor has a nice big 27
inch curved display which is pleasant to
look at it's got a 2560 by 1440
resolution so you got that 2k and this
thing can be overclocked to 165 Hertz so
if you need that extra refresh rate this
thing you've got it it also has this
cool ambient light feature that you guys
see glowing at the bottom which also
adds a nice touch but let's talk about
the good peripherals that we've got
going on here this is a hyper X alloy
elite mechanical keyboard I know I can't
be the only one who wants to sit in on
these meetings where they named these
peripherals now this is a pretty nice
keyboard and it's comfortable to type on
and it feels well-made although I'm not
sure why there is any software that
allows you to change the RGB colors on
it but there are presets which luckily
has an all red backlight but honestly
I'd love to have some control here but
it still earns a spot here because of
its quality functionality and comfort
and the mouse that we've got alongside
it is the SteelSeries rival 600 and this
is actually a very comfortable Mouse to
use and with the RGB lights and nice
look overall it was a no-brainer the RGB
lights look great here and you can tell
there was some attention to detail with
the overall design and what's especially
nice too that you can change the weight
of the mouse on both sides so if you're
looking for something really lightweight
or something that's a bit more hefty you
can customize this and change it up so
that it feels just the way you want when
you're using it and it seems to be
getting a little bit hard to find this
mouse online bottle of course include
links down below in the description to
wherever I find it and the mousepad you
might have seen before
this is course Harris mm 800 polaris
mouse pad and a mousepad like this is
pretty much a shoo-in for these themed
setups since it has the RGB lining
around the perimeter makes it really
easy to throw in but what's nice with
this one is that it has USB pass-through
so there's a USB port right at the top
so if you want to plug in another device
you can plug it in right there you don't
have to plug it into the laptop itself
would be really convenient not to
mention the bottom of this mousepad has
a really solid grip so it's not gonna be
moving around unlike some other mouse
pads that I've been using in the past
those other companies needs
No and next up for our sound we've got
the Logitech G 560 speakers now not only
are these a good looking pair of
speakers but they're also very powerful
and of course they do the whole RGB
thing as well now not only do these
sound great but they have this cool
feature called light sing where it
pretty much mimics whatever's on the
screen and using those RGB lights it
kind of displays it right on your wall
so it's a cool feature but in a setup
like this you kind of want to just keep
the red glow so you're not doing a bunch
of random colors in there you want to
keep it consistent but I really do like
these speakers there you don't have a
ton of cords they have a small footprint
so they're not taking up a lot of space
for a sound and they just get plain loud
so if you want your neighbors to hate
you these will definitely do the trick
and while we're talking about sound we
also have the HyperX cloud wireless
gaming headset so in case you do have to
deal with those neighbors or in my case
my wife you can have the music or sound
go straight through these instead
they're comfortable enough to wear for
hours on end with plush ear cups and
they offer some great sound and a great
quality mic as well as the overall good
build quality and I think it's safe to
say I'm a fan of hyper X's gear they've
got good quality stuff and they're
pretty affordable and you guys know I
always got a xbox controller on deck how
could I not it's honestly a comfort
thing at this point growing up as a
console gamer this one is called volcano
shadow and you would think that this
thing was made specifically for this
setup so if I get tired of gaming on a
keyboard I can always whip this out sit
back and kind of relax and still play
and last but not least I've got a
figurine of the man himself
Deadpool now I'm gonna put a link in the
description to this guy but once you do
that prize you're gonna think I'm crazy
now I do not recommend getting this one
by any means unless you're a hardcore
Deadpool fan but I gotta admit he looks
amazing here and this thing has a ton of
detail he's super poseable and actually
has quite a bit of accessories so you
can get to do all kinds of serious or
funny poses just like Deadpool so if
you're into that kind of thing of course
you can check it out down below in the
description they've also got some other
cool Marvel characters that have really
detailed figurines like this for all my
geeks out that I'll list them all down
below but that about wraps it up for
another themed setup video you guys let
me know what you think with comment
below was Deadpool a good choice who do
you want to see in the next one but till
then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
