average consumers girlfriend re and we
have a special treat for you it's my
first time doing a boxing so I'm going
to be unboxing at the new pokemon
edition 3dsxl it has zarina's and
yveltal on the front we're not too sure
just how to say that just yet but it's
the pokemon ition at Pokemon XY the new
one is coming out this weekend so we're
super excited and we picked up a 3d 3ds
XL for me so I can play the game so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it
ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
okay so here we have the box this is the
typical box you get with a regular 3ds
XL except it just has the pokemon the
front so this is your box I'm back just
shows you how the front in the back
looks and that's enough of the box let's
see what's inside
alright so let's start to open this
thing and of course I have to use the
infamous unboxing knife here um and
let's open this bad boy up I'm holding
like it's a pencil but there we go yeah
and I'm really excited for this because
the new Pokemon game is coming out and
we just started getting into Pokemon
about a month ago so I'm so excited
within the game okay so here's what we
have when we took off the top box so you
have a package here with um some AR
cards and warranty information a Quick
Start Guide which I'm sure I will need
and another manual so just the boring
stuff so here is anything okay I think
interesting the box alright and we have
the charger here is your standard
charger a standard one you'd get with
any 3ds XL and here is the main
attraction um it's in this nice little
bag and you just take it out let's see
oh yeah that's nice that's a really nice
it's a little boyish but I like it it's
really really nice so here's the front
of it and it has the the new legendary
Pokemon for X&amp;amp;Y on the front and then
the back has the three starter Pokemon
just like their their silhouettes and I
have the blue version it also comes in
red but I thought the blue is the
best-looking one it's really really cool
and I got this from Target then if you
open up it looks just like a regular 3ds
XL does so nothing too different over
here it's the front that's the main
attraction so that's exciting
alright so there you have it this is the
pokemon blue edition 3ds XL for the new
XY game coming out on October 12 okay so
