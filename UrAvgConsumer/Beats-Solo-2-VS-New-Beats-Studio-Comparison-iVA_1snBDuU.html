consumer and today I've got a comparison
video for you guys of the new Beats
Studio versus the new beats solo2
so let's not waste any time let's get
right into it alright guys here we have
the beats solo 2 and the new Beats
Studio by simply looking at them you can
tell they look almost exactly the same -
the size difference the solo to retail
for $200 while the new studios retail
for 300 so let's see which of Beats
revamped headphones is worth your money
when it comes to design and build
quality there's very little to the side
between they support almost the exact
same look so your choices here are more
about the size you'd like the solo tools
are basically a mini version of the new
Studios but it reaches an on-air design
instead of the over air design the
studios have and the different ear cups
causes these to have a very different
feel when on the new beats studios are
one of the most comfortable headphones I
own while the solo tools aren't good in
the comfort department over time the ear
cuts on the solo tools have great
padding and are actually quite
comfortable but they are pretty tight on
the ears when wearing them for a while
this means you'll have to take breaks
when wearing them whereas with the
studio's you shouldn't have any issues
at all since these feature an over ear
design and applies no pressure to the
ears however I do like how the ear cups
cover most of your ears with the solo 2
and the isolation it provides without
having to support a bigger over the ear
design although there's a big difference
in size between the two they should both
fit any head sizes as they feature
adjustable head bands as far as
durability goes there aren't any
differences as these share the same
overall build many worry about the
durability of Beats but the new design
of the studios and now the solo tools
cause the headphones to be much more
durable you can definitely bend these
without any issue
as the curved headband won't allow for
easy snapping now let's talk a bit about
the features the studios have a built-in
rechargeable battery that will allow for
20 hours of use and this also powers the
adaptive noise canceling feature
unfortunately you don't have the option
to turn this off and if you run out of
power you can't use the headphones until
you recharge them this is a huge
drawback to the studio
in my opinion as I hate needing power to
use my headphones this is where the solo
tools get some bonus points as all you
have to do is plug them in and start
listening adaptive noise cancelling on
the studio's works very well if you want
to tune everything out and focus on the
music but I definitely think the option
to turn it off would have been nice I've
seen some people complain about the very
low hiss when there isn't music playing
but that's to be expected with any
headphones with adaptive or active noise
canceling the studios have an on and off
button as well as a power indicator on
the right ear cup so you can see how
much battery you have left
also when you plug in the cable to the
studios it will automatically turn on
and off when you remove it and lastly
the studios have a mute button on the
left ear cup if you temporarily want to
mute the sound coming from your
headphones the list of features is
pretty one-sided because the solo tools
work just as a normal pair of headphones
there aren't any special qualities that
it possesses against the studios
aside from being able to work without
power now let's talk about the
accessories that come with the beast
solo tools come with a soft travel pouch
that'll be good to protect it from
scratches in the store but it won't help
much with impact damage the studio's on
the other hand have a hard shell
carrying case that'll definitely protect
the headphones much better than the solo
twos travel case but it also moves much
bulkier and takes up more space if you
want to put it in a bag they both also
come with a tangle free cable with a
remote talk control that has full
controls when used with Apple devices
and just playing pause with Android the
studio's also come with a second regular
cable that surprisingly was missing with
the beats solo2
now let's finally talk about the sound
quality if you assume the studio sounded
better than the solo tools you'd be
correct while they both sound good alone
in comparison to each other the Studios
do perform better but that's to be
expected considering you're paying $100
more than you would for the solo tools
if you're looking for bass they both
have plenty however the studio's offer
more clarity than the solo tools which
helps it perform with more genres
especially those that aren't bass heavy
and vocals are clearer and have more
presence in the music with the studio's
both are great improvements compared to
their predecessors and honestly I don't
think you can go wrong with either
choice if you're on a budget the
soldiers make a great option over the
studios due to the more compact design
no need to be charged
and being a third lesson price if you're
willing to pay the extra hundred bucks
you'll get better sound quality adaptive
noise cancelling and an over ear design
however they are bigger and require
being charged to use them at the end of
the day when it comes to making a choice
between the two it all depends on which
of the qualities each headphone offers
is valuable to you if I had to choose
between the two I'd probably go for the
studios due to the better sound quality
but the size and no need for batteries
makes the solo choose a very tempting
option either way that wraps up this
comparison guys let me know in the
comments below which you'd go for and if
you found this video useful at all be
