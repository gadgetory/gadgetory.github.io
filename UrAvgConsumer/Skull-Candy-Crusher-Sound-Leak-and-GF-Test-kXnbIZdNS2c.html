consumer and this is my girlfriend hello
and today we have another sound leak and
sound isolation test aka the girlfriend
test and today we're doing this with the
Skullcandy crushers
alright so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it are you stole
that so we're gonna start off with the
sound leak test and what we're gonna do
is we're gonna play music at volumes of
50% 75% and then 100% and we're gonna
see how much the music leaks from the
headphones at those different volumes so
we're gonna start it off with 50% and
she has the headphones on her ears make
sure no hair is blocking so she's all
good to go and we have the base rumble
feature thing on so if that impacts it
in any way we'll see so you ready oh yes
so we're gonna start our first song off
at 50%
yeah I don't hear anything
this is definitely not gonna bother
anyone whatsoever all right so 75
percent yes let's go
great yes sorry 5% I hear that a bit
more probably wouldn't bother me though
right definitely you hear it and it's
very quiet in here definitely don't
think that's gonna bother anyone
outdoors anywhere you are so 100% are
you ready I'm ready
all right guys and we don't recommend
listening to music at 100% because it
can damage your hearing and yeah alright
prepared you're still not going to be
ready for it see let me tell you yeah
the only reason I did this cuz as a
little talk like a comic outside
did it on purpose so 100% definitely did
hear that um it's still not extremely
loud people probably clearly hear that
but if you're outdoors I still don't
think 100% is going to really bother
anyone to a really bad extent so good
stuff patch on the girlfriend tag I mean
the sound leak test so now it's time for
the girlfriend test so Kate explain yes
um so you always I like the shovelled
when you do it always that's okay I love
you guys anyway so the girlfriend test
is basically test to see if it has
phones can black out girlfriend like
things annoying nagging and sounds and
singing and bunch of other stuff so he's
missing to see if he can walk me out if
he can use these to ignore me and we're
going to do this at 50% 75% and 100%
just like we did with the sound leak
test so what are you gonna be doing
first today today I'm going to be below
drying my hair in the same vicinity as
him often times I like to just like be
with him and different
parts of the house oh hey that means
bull dyeing my hair while he's recording
or my recording you kill me Oh while I'm
watching TV or something I will do it in
the same space so let's see if you can
block me out with a phone I'm going to
power this on just low because we're
really close to each other I like
chances are in real life
it fits I'm really high I'm not gonna be
sitting this close to him 7 loud hope
not I'm gonna put it on hot and low so
I'm going to start soft with 50% and see
what it does there and go
Pacific on the Beyonce
Cooper
so 50% I heard it a little bit but
actually I heard it a little bit but it
wasn't that bad at all actually I'm
actually pretty surprised at how well
this block that out and this isn't
active noise-cancelling or anything so
really good stuff so now let's try it
out at 75% am i ready yes
now in Tyra
okay so 75% I Superman I heard a tiny
bit not bad at all though definitely
block it out of more than it was that
50% so definitely a good stuff all now
let's see if I can completely get it out
at a hundred percent all right this is
me really trying to not hear you that
Shepard on high just keep it on low
no keep running low send a consistent
alright so here it is at 100%
all right
which men crazy now yeah so at one
percent it definitely did block out all
of that so really good stuff surprise
I'm very surprised this pass the
Soundlink test and the girlfriend test
in my opinion so that's surprisingly
well did surprisingly well thumbs up and
