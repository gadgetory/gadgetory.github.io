now today we're going to be taking a
look at some very special products if
you can't tell by the title today we're
doing things a little bit differently
I'd go through a ton of tech when I'm
looking for some really good
recommendations to tell you guys about
and sometimes there are certain things
that just don't make the cut
and I'm going to tell you why but let me
introduce you just average consumer now
I'm going to be straight up with you
guys
I'm going to tell you why these products
straight up stuff and I would never have
them in the video normally if it weren't
for something like this now I picked
those guys from Amazon I wanted to do an
awesome tech under I think it was like
50 bucks and I wanted to try this guy I
thought it would be a cool option for
those selfie takers Ares one of those I
figure case you might like this a lot
but this thing sucks
you got this crazy light which is
supposed to be cool gives you a lot of
nice light so that your photos could
come out really great without having to
use that weird flash the Apple has but
the thing about this case is it's got
the cool flash going you got a precious
little button in the back but when you
press it again to turn it off right you
think one single press would do it nope
you're like cycling through these other
flashes you have to press another one
again and again and again to finally
turn it off the heck wants to do that
after taking a single selfie you have to
press the button and it's not even a
soft light and it's like a hard button
that you've got a press maybe a good for
time to turn it off cool thought of it
this is bad it's one of the worst cases
I ever ever purchased now it's looking
cool because it has this built-in
battery which sounds awesome but you've
got to get a plug in a cable to the
bottom of the cave and see your phone
whoo why why is it really this big I
know I should have no this is going to
end badly okay
texting bakka killing you right there it
was a terrible throw
so guys this is the box that it came in
it is the ip68 waterproof heavy-duty
dust case does that match I don't think
so did you send it in the right box
didn't even bother to check that's how
you know the trash next up we've got
these sunglasses now I don't plan on
buying these for any particular video I
actually tweeted some of you guys and
asked you what it's all is the worst
pieces of tech that you've come across
and one of you guys tweeted me this so I
bought it as soon as I figured out what
it was and it is bad it's like me not an
apple I think regardless you don't care
about the name because you're not going
to buy it
it sounds cool because if a pair of
sunglasses that has these a little
earbud pieces so you can kind of put
them into your ears and you've got a
Bluetooth headphones in your sunglasses
maybe if I was a psycho or something
this would be cool so I feel like some
kind of wannabe cop right now with these
glasses on what kind of think how cool
do I look like walking out with this
first of all this I'm not a big
sunglasses person number one number two
is good to imagine but try to talk to
you they can't tell you have headphones
on and it was like Bobbi feeling oh
excuse me hold on pickups muscles last
soiree
so this is a bad idea I actually tried
it create it with my phone and
everything
the sound quality sucks so in theory
this sounds cool you think you're on the
cutting edge
Google glass type of deal but you're not
you look silly they should have never
made this and I can't pretend it next up
we've got this flash drive now I pick
this up for a MacBook Pros top five
accessories video I thought it would be
a cool USBC flash regular USB kind of
accessory you know in theory that sounds
awesome I've talked about some
accessories like that in the past but
this one is garbage do you want to stay
clear of this guy
you've got this cool little tool at top
to make you pull out the side that you
want to plug in so if the USBC size or
it's a USB the regular USB USB a side
you want to play which everything you
got slow fire on top right but within
the first day the frickin thing fell off
what the quality is this is bad I can't
recommend a product that breaks on me
within the first day of trying it and
when I plugged into my computer and
types of data speeds all the thing is
bad so bad sanded I expect better from
you not only did it fall apart but it's
super super slow makes no sense I'm
ashamed
and last up we've got these headphones
you guys not like headphones but I don't
like these be in the back that's going
to be like the word of the day cut dual
counter oh how many times I said bad in
this video but these are bad these are
from bright tech bright check doesn't
have a bright future they keep making
stuff like this but when the iPhone 7
first came out I bought a few headphones
that had the Lightroom input instead of
the regular 3.5 millimeter to see if I
could recommend any good lightning
headphones out there and these will have
to be scoff I don't think maybe 28
something $20,000 too much but I try
these on
first of all the ear cut they don't know
if they want to be on here or over your
headphones because they've got this
circular design on the ear cups that fit
on part of your here and the rest kind
of just hangs around with all your sizes
are different so your experience may
vary but everyone's experience will be
bad these also sound like garbage they
actually sound what they sound like
if I want the phone with Ari and she put
her phone next to a desktop playing some
music that's what I feel like I'm
getting out of these like it's going
through a desktop through a phone over
to me that's how bad you sound if feels
cheap to that plastic
I honestly value to save up a couple of
bucks and buy some
a bit more high-quality even in fact I'd
rather use the adapter but that's a lot
it for this video guys glad to have my
desk clear that's a trash hopefully you
enjoyed your savage consumer hopefully
the first of many if you guys have
encountered any bad products that you
think I should feature in this possible
series of videos let me know with a
comment down below I'll catch you guys
in the next one so then it's your
average savage consumer whatever
whichever one you want please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
