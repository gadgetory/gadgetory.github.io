it's been a while since I let you guys
know which headphones I've been enjoying
lately especially Bluetooth headphones
so these are my top five favorite
Bluetooth headphones but Before we jump
into the list I got to give you a huge
shout out to today's sponsor clash
Royale and for those of you who don't
know clash Royale is an awesome game
where you can duel players in real time
and unlock different arenas collect
cards to soup up your deck of heroes or
even collect some treasure and you're
not only can play against people all
over the world but you can even play
with your friends and if you guys are in
a clan you can now participate in the
brand-new clan wars clan wars lets you
and your clan compete against others in
a series of battles see who's the best
and if you're familiar with the clash
universe you know they make some awesome
games that require some real strategy if
you know me you know I love games like
that but if you guys want to check it
out of course I have it linked down
below in the description you can
download it today for free and start
playing now to kickstart this list we
have the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins px and I'll
just come out and say it
I think these aren't the best-looking
pair of headphones on this list these
look awesome thousand wolf kids make
some really classy looking at phones and
I think that these look great and these
headphones have an over ear design which
I'm really confident will fit over
anybody's ears because of how spacious
these ear cups are they aren't the most
comfortable because they are a bit of a
snug fit but they do fit well and they
offer a lot of room and these are built
really well guys these are a solid pair
of headphones and when you have them in
your hands they feel premium they look
premium which I can absolutely
appreciate especially since this is a
bit on the expensive side I do wish this
had a foldable design so you can have
some options when storing these are
traveling with them but as of right now
with the case that it comes with you can
kind of lay it down flat put it away
with no problem in your backpack or even
if you want to store it away in a drawer
or something now in terms of the sound
that you're gonna get out of these
you're gonna get a really balanced sound
here very clear vocals not too bass
heavy but I definitely recommend burning
these in a bit so that means listening
to these for a while before you can get
the true sound out of them and the PX
also have a really cool feature with
these sensors inside of the ear cuff so
if you have to take your ear cups off
for a second maybe to have a
conversation with someone you can do
that and it'll automatically pause your
music and whenever you put it right back
on your ears your music will continue
playing like it was before
and I love that feature guys I wish it
were on all of my headphones because it
is really convenient another really nice
feature with the PX is that it uses USB
type-c to charge so if your phone uses
USB type-c or maybe you've got a MacBook
or a laptop that does this will be able
to charge on the same charger which is
really convenient because you don't have
to use micro USB it's like almost all
the Bluetooth headphones out there and
like most bluetooth headphones these
days these have active noise-cancelling
so if you want to drown out your
surroundings and just focus on your
audio you can definitely do that and if
you even want to hear some of the stuff
that's going on around you it actually
has a feature where you're able to do
that kind of like that ambient sound
feature that we first saw in the stony
1000x you've got that ability here as
well and you can access it within the
app if you're looking for more control
but these are a great option if you're
looking for a pair of headphones that
have great build quality great sound of
course a ton of features as well as a
balanced sound signature and next up
we've got my personal favorites the Sony
xb9 50 enones now these you guys know
ever since the 950 BTS I have completely
fallen in love with these headphones I
personally love to hear a lot of bass
with my music and these are all about
that life design-wise these aren't the
best looking I can completely admit that
they're a little bit on the big side
thankfully those really big cushions
mean tons and tons of comfort I can wear
this for hours and hours without any
issue these are absolutely great in that
regard so if you don't care about looks
too much you're gonna definitely be
happy with how these feel at least and
these are also foldable so if you need
to tuck them away you can do that the
travel case that it comes with isn't the
best it'll definitely protect it from
scratches or anything like that but it's
not like a hardshell case or anything so
something to keep in mind but honestly
I'm just glad something's offering a
posture of some sort because they did it
in the past if you jump into the
companion app you get a bit more
features if you really want to get down
and mess with the sound a bit more you
have a lot of options with this guy and
sound quality wise listen if you love
bass you'll like to hear bass stop
watching the video these are the
headphones to get if your mission is to
simply have your head
rattling these are the ones to get guys
these sound amazing and that's just on
its normal mode if you want to take this
thing to really stupid levels you've got
access to that base effect button right
there on the left ear cut and with this
you can turn the bass up to levels that
don't even make sense is it can be a lot
even for me trust me but you can
actually control it now with the
companion app so if you want to add a
bit more or maybe if you want to take
away bass from the overall sound you can
do that here which is really really nice
there's a huge range that you can work
with which makes these headphones really
versatile because even the audio outside
of bass like the clarity that you get
from vocals and things like that it
still sounds good but if you're looking
for that bass that's where these really
excel even if you're using the bass
effect and the noise canceling you still
get 22 hours of battery life which is
pretty standard but if you start asking
out those features you get even more
battery life which is great listen guys
this one right here is an easy
recommendation for me I can absolutely
stand by this being an awesome pair of
headphones and they usually get discount
in two really nice prices so I'll have
it linked down below in a description
it's lost everything else even at full
price these are completely worth it but
you're definitely gonna save if you even
look around just a little bit next up on
the list we've got the v-moda crossfade
wireless - now you guys know how I feel
about v-moda if you don't I love the
brand they offer some really really
great headphones and the crossfade
Wireless - are right up there with some
of my favorites of all time and
something I love about these headphones
is the design has a distinguished look
but there are a lot of choices here that
just make it really convenient for the
user first thing being the shield's that
you see on the side of the ear cups
these are actually interchangeable so
you can add different colors different
materials you can definitely switch this
up to fit your style these are also
designed to be a very durable pair of
headphones you can bend them twist them
I don't recommend doing that to any
headphones but you can definitely do
that and not feel like you're going to
destroy these this thing has really
great build quality but one of the perks
of this design is how compact it can get
this thing can get really really tiny
which I love because when you want to
throw this thing in your case it doesn't
take up a lot of room whether you want
to put it in a case or not it gets so
compact
it's super easier to travel with this
and with the extra-large cushions on
these guys it'll feel very comfortable
when wearing the air cushions are very
nice and plush so if you want to use
this for long listening sessions you can
definitely do that and these also got a
really cool feature called multi pairing
so if you want to pair multiple devices
like your phone and your laptop you can
do that with this and it allows you to
use your laptop and listen but if you
get a call you can answer it right from
the headphones and not have to repair
anything I love being able to do that
and when it comes to sound they sound
great you get very clear vocals very
nice punchy bass and if you're looking
for a lot of presents with your audio
you're definitely gonna get that these
definitely feel like you're a part of
whatever you're listening to which I can
really appreciate because everything is
just nice and clear these headphones
right here are an easy pair to recommend
they only have 14 hours of battery life
though which is on the lower side when
it comes to bluetooth headphones these
days but it does come with an audio
cable so if the battery dies on you you
can still plug this into your device
next up we've got the bose QC 35 Mark
twos now if you've seen some of my
previous comparisons and reviews of this
guy you know that I think the sony MDR
1000x mark ii is a better headphone
overall but where these really really
excel is in comfort thus the name quiet
comfort and these have got the standard
Bose headphones looked nothing too
special here but what's really nice
about the design here is those giant
supersoft ear cups when you have these
on guys I'm telling you these even more
than the 950 n ones are probably the
most comfortable headphones I've ever
used ever that's that's saying a lot so
I can definitely understand why somebody
would want these over everything else if
you're going on a plane if you're
traveling you want to be able to wear
these for a long period of time and it
not wear down on you and these
absolutely do a great job of that and
the QC 35 Tunes do have a couple tricks
up their sleeve they of course have that
active noise-cancelling which is amazing
you guys know Bose is great at that but
they also have a new button here on the
left ear Cup which is the Google
assistant button so if you have a Google
assistant on your phone you can access
it with just a press of a button but if
you don't if you don't use Google
assistant it can also be used to control
your active
canceling levels so you've had a couple
of options there with that little button
and you also have a cool feature this
thing has 20 hours of battery life but
if it happens to die on you with 15
minutes of charging you get
two-and-a-half hours of playback which
can actually be pretty useful if you're
sitting at an airport and you need to
charge these up real quick before your
flight this will definitely get you a
few hours and I like that now sound
quality wise I think these sound pretty
good at lower volumes I'm not too
thrilled with the sound but when you
start bringing the volume up a bit more
that's when you really start to
experience what Bose can do I personally
feel like under 70% you don't really
hear how much base this thing can offer
but once you do bring it up past that oh
man this thing is really surprising now
I think it's safe to say the sound
quality to actually get out of these
it's pretty solid but at those higher
volumes is where you really start to
hear the different details and nuances
of what this thing can really do if
you're looking for just quiet headphones
bring it down to the lower levels these
will definitely be pretty minimum but at
those higher levels it does really well
and this thing's extreme comfort and
active noise-cancelling is what really
solidified spot on this list there are
definitely a lot of people out there who
I think will appreciate that combo and
even though I think the Sony 1000 X Mark
twos are a better pair of headphones
with way more features better sound
quality a nicer look I'm not gonna go
into here I actually have a full video
where I compared these two down below I
just didn't want to have to Sony
headphones here on the list so if I had
to pick between the two you know I want
with my n ones last but not least I had
to include a pair of Bluetooth earbuds
and these are the beats X and I don't
know if people are still hating on beats
like they used to but I love these for a
few reasons first being their awesome
price you can find these for about a
hundred bucks on Amazon and I think the
official site has them for like 120 that
is a really good deal for a solid pair
of bluetooth earbuds and with this
design that they've got it makes it
really comfortable to wear and use for a
long period of time because it's laying
on your neck taking some of the pressure
off your ears so that's really great so
if you're doing something active you
don't have to worry about these
following out from the jumping up and
down or doing whatever you may be doing
these stay in their place really well
they're really foldable you can put
these things away very easily so if
you're looking for something that you
can just throw in your pocket these can
do that as well
the beat sex also packs a w1 chip and
with that it also allows multiple Apple
devices to get access to these earbuds
without having to pair each and every
one of them individually so if you
happen to be in the Apple ecosystem and
you have a bunch of their products this
will be very convenient to switch
between them and like most Bluetooth
earbuds you get a solid eight hours of
battery life oh it's really nice about
these is that with five minutes of
charging you get two hours of playback
that's a lot of time for just five
minutes not to mention these also charge
with the lightning cables so you don't
have to carry around a bunch of
different cables if you have Apple
devices and sound quality wise these
sound great it's a very balanced sound
you got some pretty decent bass from it
definitely not overpowering bass like
the beats reputation and used to have so
if you're looking for some overall clean
audio these definitely provide it and if
you want to go a step up you can always
go for the Beats Studio wireless threes
those also has a w1 chip so you'll be
able to switch between those Apple
devices with no problem with those as
well and that's my lizbo I gotta give
some honorable mentions the Sennheiser
HD 4.4 TS are really solid if you're
looking for an inexpensive pair of
headphones I've talked about this a
couple of times on the channel now and I
can't not recommend it not 100 bucks
you're not finding some really great
Bluetooth headphones from a reputable
brand like Sennheiser with an over ear
design so I definitely recommend
checking these out if you're looking for
something more on a budget and also the
j-bert X threes if you absolutely hate
betta X threes are definitely a good
option I've been loving chambered for
years now and the expertise are solid
they got a solid app overall good stuff
but that about wraps it up for this list
guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you've
been rocking any different Bluetooth
headphones that you really enjoy let me
know what they are with the comment down
below maybe I'll find some good ones to
try out but till the next one guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that gives this
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you
guys to the next one so then it's your
average consumer pace
