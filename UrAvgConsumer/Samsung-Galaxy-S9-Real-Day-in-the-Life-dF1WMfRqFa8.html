consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day in the life with the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus now if you've
never seen one of my real day into life
videos you're pretty much gonna be
spending the day with me and the new
phone and we're going to see how it
works in the real world testing out
things like the display the camera
battery life performance everything you
want to know but it's time to see how
this phone did when we put it through
its paces so we are officially starting
our day pardon that rude dog in the back
there but yeah this is the start of our
day it's about 12 o'clock so we are
running a bit late but just to give you
guys an idea of when we're starting and
also this is on the front-facing camera
of the galaxy s 9 plus I am holding this
thing with my hand so it's a little bit
shaky but this should give you an idea
of the quality and the audio quality
that you're gonna get out of this but
yeah this is what you can expect now
guys let's talk for a second this is a
beautiful phone it's great feels nice in
the hand but what's not great is how
slippery it is I unfortunately already
have a few dents on the phone I actually
dropped this guy it breaks my heart to
admit it but it happens so immediately
we're gonna start off this day by
throwing a case on it I got like a
see-through case to not hide the
beautiful design as much as we can but
this is what we're gonna be using today
I don't want any more accidents let's
keep this thing safe alright guys so one
thing that's been introduced with the s
9 + s 9 plus is this new intelligent
scan which uses the face recognition and
the iris scanner to unlock the phone but
let's see how it performs so I'll just
turn it on the phone I get into it
pretty quickly that's not bad at all
I like that coming from an iPhone okay I
don't have to do a swipe up or any other
gesture all I do is hit that power
button and I'm in but it's not as good
as the 1 + 5 t where I could just pop it
open and boom I'm in there this is the
best probably the least secure of the
three so far from what I've seen on the
s9 plus it's been a really really smooth
experience you guys know I've been
playing the sonic forces game like crazy
and this is like my own little real
world benchmark to see if you know it
can handle a game like this where
there's just a lot going on on the
screen at once and this thing has an 845
Snapdragon processor on it so there's
not gonna be any issues to think and
handle pretty much anything you throw at
it a regular everyday person playing
games or just surfing instagram or
twitter you're gonna be completely fine
the real test here is to see how it does
over time like in a few months that's
what you gotta see okay guys so right
now we've got the GPS going we've got
about eighty percent battery left and
we've got a 17 minute ride we're gonna
actually be going around a few different
places so we're gonna see how much the
GPS drains the battery but just so you
guys know 80% 17 minutes to go so we
made it here I resent the eyebrow
threading spot and as far as battery
life girls we are at 75% so 17 minutes
took 5% out of here and in terms of
screen on time let's take a look
we've actually got an hour and 54
minutes of usage so that's actually
pretty good
one hour 54 minutes of active use 25%
left that's not bad 35 hundred million
power battery so I expect some good
results so we have to make a little pit
stop to pick up some batteries because
our mics just keep sucking up the juice
out of the batteries that we had for
them so we're gonna go pick up Ari right
now so
go see what she looks like now that she
got her
caterpillars tamed take a look at her
now so how does it look how's it look
how's it look it's okay it looks too
thick
alright well perfect time we're gonna
take a picture
this looks good good this is a sharp
cameraman so first off I want to let you
guys see some of the detail here in her
scarf in the jacket I'm like really
zoomed in but this is really sharp on a
bunch of other cameras that would have
been a really blurry look as soon as we
zoomed in that far but it looks great
good job kid jack guys arrow you just
gave me a great idea she actually left
and went and sat in the car because she
didn't want to be out here while we were
filming because it's cold but it's all
good right here we have a sign and one
of the features of the s 9s 9 Plus that
they're talking about a lot is the
ability to use big speed to translate in
real time so we've got a reserved
parking sign right here and since it's
in English you can actually change the
language to whichever language you want
to translate to so we can have a go from
English to Spanish which is what we're
gonna do now so let's see how this works
reserved parking reserved righto
now you see I have no idea this is right
or wrong so I'm just going to screenshot
it and boom I'll check with my
translator area to see if she has any
clue but it seems to work
translator let us know is this correct
Spanish
is it this is in reserve does that mean
parking all right you can put your
window back up for my spanish-speaking
folks who watch this channel please let
me know if this is the correct
translation seems right but I don't know
so we just did another 20-minute Drive
and we've got about 60% battery left so
you know using it up with the GPS and
all of that but more importantly we are
at my favorite ramen spot bot and ramen
we're gonna have some good food I'm
gonna take some food pictures and enjoy
so real quick taking a look at the
cameras the s9 + has two of them so
we've got a wide-angle 12 megapixel lens
at the top and a telephoto 12 megapixel
lens at the bottom so the only other
phone that Samsung has made that can do
this or it has the dual camera lenses is
the note 8 so it's nice to see it on the
s9 so now we're gonna try super slow
motion for the record I hate these
bottles it's really hard to drink out of
but it's gonna make for a good
slow-motion shot so some of our foods
just came but the show must go on
we're rolling all right
Wow I am so sorry man for the record it
is bottled now you guys have to see this
amazing shot so I am actually going in
I'm pressing it but it knows exactly the
right moment to start slowing everything
down and look at that amazing shot
yeah definitely didn't mean for this
thing to explode the way it did but it
looks great on camera so basically what
you guys just saw was a 940 frames per
second shot and what makes this so
special is that you can grab those
moments to happen in an instant like
this and see it unfold in a much longer
duration then it happens in real life
so good job CIN all right guys so we had
a great meal Sun is going down going for
some low light shots and I've got the
perfect place Gundam planning you know
what it was
come on oh this is a really cool scene
you see how they recreated this like a
battle I think this one was really good
on camera this looks really really good
of course you can see like some of those
plastic bags over there but this looks
awesome
I'm actually gonna do a little coloring
to this and kind of show you guys what
it looks like when you really make it
come to life but so far right out the
camera this looks really good now I
don't know how it's coming off on camera
but this door is actually pretty dim
when it comes to lighting and I want to
get a shot of this pose because I want
to recreate it at home I'm actually
gonna take a picture here actually I'm
going to put this in pro mode and then
we'll see how the variable aperture
effects the different shots we can guys
so we're gonna see it at 2.4 at 1.5
aperture and see what the difference is
so this is at 2 for 5 see that but that
has a major difference from just an
aperture change Wow
so after some Gundam we have to go pick
up some bubble tea because you guys know
our routine we get ramen we go to see
some Gundams we get some bubble tea and
oh thank you my dear I got some Naruto
plain
I feel like I got it not an hour to a
burrito I'm catching up and I got to say
in terms of the display and the
combination of the nude stereo speakers
it's pretty good viewing experience this
has Dolby Atmos surround sound for you
know mobile devices and it's nice it's
nice to have stereo speakers I don't
think they're super duper loud it's like
right now I'll be able to hear this no
problem but this is the max volume this
will probably definitely disturb the
people around me so I won't keep that
going but it sounds pretty decent I'm
liking it
especially for outside environment and
when it comes to the display you guys
already know how Samsung does it the
Super AMOLED this is a quad HD Plus
display so slightly higher than 2k
because of the 18 by 9 aspect ratio but
yeah so we've got a crisp screen great
colors and Samsung always kills the
display so there's no complaints here
and now with the addition of stereo
speakers
it just makes an overall better viewing
experience okay guys so we're back at
the studio and we've been here for a few
hours now it is 10:30 6 p.m. so in terms
of screen on time
let's check the battery usage 5 hours
and 40 minutes I was actually really
good we've got 10% left this is a 3,500
milliamp hour battery so this is the
kind of performance that I would come to
expect at this size but honestly I'm a
bit surprised
coming from a galaxy device usually
these phones don't have the best battery
in the world but this one has held up
pretty well alright guys I got to go
ahead and pull out the Samsung Galaxy s8
plus to let you know what the difference
is if there's a big enough difference to
jump ship and go to the s9 plus if you
already got it or the 9 if you have
eight already but my boy a sure on my
discourse server wanted to know if it
was worth it and to be honest I don't
really think so
what you get with the s9 plus is of
course a better camera
you know better performance upgraded
performance but this is no slouch so are
you going to see a huge difference in
terms of performing
between the two honestly probably not if
you've got the last iterations of these
unless you really need a better camera
with better low-light performance or
even those AR emojis then you're
probably gonna be fine with this
there's also super slo-mo but I mean I
don't know
this is bad porn to you that's the
differentiating factor alright guys so
we just got that last call about the
battery about to die so we got about
let's see here six hours and ten minutes
of screen on time which is really good
stuff this and the real day in the
life portion very impressed with the
battery so far after what we put it
through and boom there you guys have it
that was a full day with the phone of
course I spent much longer than you guys
saw in this video I got it as soon as it
was announced but there are some things
that I liked about this phone and some
things that I wasn't too crazy about so
let's go over those of course the first
thing we got to talk about is the design
it shares the same design as last year
which isn't exciting but luckily for
Samsung it is a good-looking design
although I do find it to be a bit too
slippery so I did have to throw a case
on it but I'm already used to that so
that's not an issue and it still has
that beautiful infinity to display
Samsung has some of the best displays on
the market so of course this one's no
different it looks great colors look
great and it's a qHD display so of
course it's very sharp but even if you
want to bring that down to maybe Full HD
you're gonna be fine with that save
yourself some battery I actually enjoyed
watching content on this and thankfully
Samsung has now introduced Dolby Atmos
speakers on these so they sound much
much louder that if something Samsung
phones has suffered from for a long time
having that one measly speaker on the
bottom that you can easily cover up with
your thumb now you got Dolby Atmos
speakers which sounds very very good
especially indoors it sounds very loud
when you put it at max volume and when
you're outdoors like you guys saw it
gets pretty loud and you'll be able to
hear it with no problem although you're
not getting that same effect as you
would when you're indoors now while a
lot of the hardware choices seem pretty
much the same as last year there are a
few different changes now the
fingerprint scanner is at the bottom of
the camera which is something we're all
very happy about and there's also two
camera lenses on the back of the s9 plus
and that's a big thing for Samsung the
cameras the performance on the cameras
have been great Samsung's really making
a big deal about how great the low-light
photos are on this phone and they
deserve to make a big deal because the
low-light photos look great you guys got
to see for yourself when I went to gun
the planet I took some pictures that
came out really dark but when I changed
that aperture whoo it made a big
difference now that was in Pro Mode but
luckily for all the regular users out
there the phone can detect when the
light is too low
change the aperture and you get a much
brighter photo without a lot of noise or
so kudos to Samsung for making a great
low-light camera and even outside of
low-light shooting regular everyday
shots look great as well and even video
has been very impressive now another big
feature Samsung is talking about is of
course that 960 frames per second super
slow-motion and what's nice here is that
you can press record and whenever
something happens within the little box
that shows up on the screen it'll
automatically start rolling in slow
motion so you're not gonna miss that
instance where something special happens
it actually worked out really well you
guys saw it in person I never expected
that soda bottle to just explode like
that I didn't time it but the camera did
by itself and it caught everything
gloriously now that super slo-mo isn't
very high quality at 720p but when you
go to 240 frames per second which is a
little bit faster but still very slow
you get at 1080p I also really like the
quality from the front-facing camera the
video that I shot in the beginning of
the day seemed pretty impressive and
even some selfies that I took were great
something I was pretty surprised to see
was the live focus option for taking a
selfie I definitely didn't expect that
because you usually need two lenses to
pull that effect off except if you're
the Google pixel - but Samsung was able
to offer that with the front-facing
camera which was a really nice surprise
now camera performance is one thing but
another thing that Samsung's really
toting with this is the addition of
these new Bigsby features that work
alongside the camera one thing that I
found really cool was being able to use
the live translations I actually used it
while I was out in Barcelona and it did
a pretty good job I was able to
interpret the sign without needing
someone to come and tell me
the sign said so that's a pretty nice
feature I like that it can do that some
of the other features are like the make
up feature that they were toting where
it'll scan your face and allow you to
try on different makeup now another big
feature Samsung's pushing out there with
the use of cameras is a are emoji I'll
be honest guys not too crazy about this
feature I do think it's cool that
Samsung's scanning your face and putting
it into a live emoji that's kind of like
it's pretty much like bitmoji x' and an
emojis mixed together and boom you've
got a are emojis I get that it's like a
caricature of your face but I wish there
were more options I couldn't find a
hairstyle that matched me whatsoever and
neither could Harry and even some other
friends of mine who've tried it just
couldn't get the hair down but I am kind
of curious what you guys think let me
know if a our motives are something you
guys think are cool or if it's just
another gimmick I personally don't
really care for it but when it comes to
straight-up just using it and the feel
in the hand all that stuff
I like the phone TouchWiz is the skin
that comes with this phone and I said it
last year when I reviewed the essay and
s8 plus I actually liked the direction
Samsung in terms of software everything
you need is at your fingertips it's very
easy to manage things are easy to find
it looks clean so I'm a fan of TouchWiz
I like it I don't think there's any real
drawbacks although people do complain
that it tends to bog down after a while
but honestly I like the way it looks I
think it's functional and just makes the
overall user experience pretty nice now
the big question is do I recommend this
phone and that is an easy absolute yes
this is a great phone great hardware
listen Samsung has made no compromises
when it comes to this phone there are
some silly features but overall it is
everything that you can ask for it has
all of the top-of-the-line features
you've got waterproofing you've got your
micro SD card slot so you got expandable
storage you also have a headphone jack a
headphone jack they trying to kill that
thing but Samsung is keeping it alive
thankfully on a top-of-the-line phone
like this so it is very very nice to see
that here there really are just no
sacrifices the only thing that's really
missing is Samsung really pushing the
envelope when
the battery life the s9 plus has great
battery life easily but I do wish that
they just took it to the next level
Samsung is capable of that so I would
have liked to see four thousand milliamp
hours in this we got 3500 it works well
you're not gonna complain with it but I
do recommend the phone I think it's
great
easy easy recommendation guys but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that gives us VL
thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in the
next one till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
