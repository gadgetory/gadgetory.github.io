consumer and today I'm going to be
reviewing the B's by dre power beats so
let's not wasting you time let's get
right into it and alright guys here we
have the power beats now these beats by
dre in years have been out for quite a
while now but let's see if the LeBron
James indoors buds are worth your 150
bucks but before we do that let's take a
quick look at the case they come in as
we take a look at the case of the
powered beads
you might notice that it's the same one
that the beat stores come in
however unlike how awkwardly the Taurus
foot inside the K seems to be made for
the power beats as the case includes two
raised pieces that the hooks can latch
on to of course with a case like this
there isn't much you can do with the
cable but Crump it all up inside which
is pretty unfortunate because these
don't come with tangle free cables and
on the other side of the case you'll
find a pouch that can hold your extended
cable clip or earbuds depending on what
you want to put inside there the power
breeze does have a bit of a short cable
so an extender is included but it's so
long probably around three feet that I
can only imagine it being useful when
you're using the power beats with
something stationary and you need to
step away from it but now let's move on
to the power beats themselves these are
the most interesting pair of earbuds in
the beats line and they've got a very
interesting design but honestly I'm not
too thrilled about the shape of it due
to having some issues with getting a
proper seal for the buds when it comes
to in ears having the ear canal sealed
by the buds is very important for your
music quality even with different sized
buds I just really couldn't manage to
perfect the seal without really pushing
them into my ears although I must admit
I do have oddly shaped ears so your
experience may differ these ear buds do
excel in the comfort department and they
are easily the most comfortable in the
line the hooks are a great fit and it
won't fall off and this is great
especially for athletes as we take a
look at the inline remote of the power
beech we'll see that it's very similar
to the eye beads but I'm very happy that
it doesn't have the clicky issues that
the I beat
it is an old-school design and it's on
the newer version of the powerbeats but
overall it works fine the powerbeats
doesn't have an l-shaped jack like most
other bees have but I don't think this
is the bad thing I kind of like the fact
that it's a straight Jack because it
works with all cases with mp3s and
phones so you'll have no issues there
you can just plug it in and you'll be
good to go of course I have to show you
guys what it looks like on and as you
can see the hooks fit perfectly and
really does help with comfort and as I
said before it has an interesting design
and is sure to grab some attention but
that's what we've come to expect from
beads right and of course since these
are supposed to be athlete earphones
you'll see me here doing a couple of
little things little jumping jacks and
some jogging but as you can assume these
aren't going to be moving out of your
ears at all it's not going to budge
these are very secure and it's a really
tight fit for the ears so athletes if
you're looking for some comfortable
earbuds that'll fit and stay in place
while you're working out and playing
your sport these are definitely the way
to go
now have you ever had this happen to you
when trying to pick something up off the
floor yeah that happened with the beat
stores but with the power beats because
of the shorter cable you're not going to
run into that issue whatsoever and now
to hit on sound these sound pretty in
line with what you'd expect from the
beats line it has pretty good bass and
some decent clarity although I could
only get a real feel for what the sound
quality was like when holding it in to
my ears as I've mentioned before this
didn't provide a good enough seal for my
ears to get the best sound quality out
of them but when holding them in I was
able to judge what it was like I don't
think the sound you hear will stand
apart from the other buds that Beats has
to offer but I say it sounds pretty
similar to the urbeats but with the form
factor this is definitely a win for
those who are prioritizing comfort and
security
overall I must say the power beads won't
be for everyone but it should be good
for those who are interested in what it
specializes in the only real issue I
have with them is getting the seal right
for the ear canal but I want to stress
that my ears tend to get
a little trouble in that department so
my experience may vary from yours I'd
have no issues recommending this to an
average consumer considering that they
can get the buds to fit inside properly
if you're looking for the Basie beat
sound with the security of knowing these
will stay on your ears you know
definitely the beats for you and that
pretty much wraps up my review guys if

like this til then it's your average
consumer until the next video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
