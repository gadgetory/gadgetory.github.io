and today we're going to be comparing an
inexpensive gaming headset to one that's
a lot more premium but before we start
today's video I know a lot of you ask me
where I get the music playing in my
videos from and I got to give a huge
shout out to audio blocks for providing
the music and a sponsoring today's video
and right now they've got this cool
creator to create our initiative so like
any of you guys or creators out there
this is where you can go to get some
built tracks to put into any of your own
projects
so all the music I used to make this
video came from these guys
and they've got a library of over a
hundred thousand tracks so there's a lot
to choose from so if you guys are
interested be sure to check the link
down below in the description you can
sign up for a free 7-day trial and get
to using some of those tracks right now
but now let's get back to these headset
what's going on guys your average
consumer and today we're going to be
checking out the Logitech G 430 gaming
headset now this is a pretty inexpensive
game you had that you get it for around
35 bucks
so today we're gonna see how it holds up
against a more expensive gaming headset
something that's about two hundred
dollars more but first let's check out
what's actually in the box
let's take a look so we've got the
gaming set and honestly that's all you
really get you get the gaming headset
and add just a little adapter or dongle
so this pretty much is not much to the
packaging and like I said you do have a
dongle so you can connect the headphone
and mic inputs right into this and into
your computer but first impressions on
like how this thing feels it's pretty
lightweight the construction seems
decent these are made completely out of
plastic so if you happen to give this a
good fit by accident they could crack
them they've got the cloth ear cushions
they don't feel that comfortable in the
hand they don't feel very soft but let's
do the other side
okay I mean it's not bad it's an over
ear design it doesn't really press on
the ears whatsoever it covers the entire
here but this isn't soft so the long
listening sessions might not be the
greatest but um it'll get the job done
this is 35 bucks so you can't really
knock it too much it still had cool
features like virtual 7.1 surround sound
it has the adjustable mic over here on
the side you can move this around fold
it so you know you've got everything
that you kind of want in a gaming
headset but at a $35 price range
now what we're going to do is compare it
to something that 200 bucks more and
their opponent for today are the
SteelSeries Siberia 800 wireless gaming
headset at a higher price room to get
more features like wireless capabilities
along with some other stuff so this is
what we've got over here now I know you
guys are probably going to say Oh gang
had said suck you should use some
open-back headphones that's the best
experience you'll get for gaming but
we're going to be going with consumer
grade gaming headsets since you know
what people are more likely going to
pick up but I'm kind of curious to see
what the comfort differences because we
just tried these out these have these
soft leatherette ear cushions so let's
kind of see how this feels in comparison
okay so immediately the ear cushions are
much softer on these but there is a
difference because these ear cups
actually I can feel them on my ears a
little bit so that will definitely have
an impact over long listening sessions
also this gaming headset is just like
straight up heavier because it's
wireless and it has a bunch of other
people's built into the headset itself
that of course is going to wait a bit
more than these I think in terms of
comfort I'll give it to Logitech's
that's pretty surprising now I'm going
to be hooking these up to my gaming PC
so I could give this a full test run see
which one sounds better
also we got a test on that my quality
this has a mic and if it also has a mic
that comes out right here but for some
games
I got to want some titanfall - don't
laugh and my keyboard and mouse skills
with this game because I am still a
complete noob when it comes to gaming on
a keyboard and mouse I'm more
comfortable using a console controller
like the Xbox one controller but I'm
aside the point I've got the Logitech G
430's here and we're going to be testing
out first and then we're going to test
out the skill series side we're at 800
oh my god dude oh alright so a grenade
just killed me and that kind of helped
me to realize that this doesn't really
have a lot of base so a first-person
shooter like this high-impact games is
something like you will experience the
crazy explosions and stuff like the way
you'd want to but I can still hear
everything just fine and you know this
will have 7.1 surround sound
oh whoa come on
okay so Logitech's get the job done
surround sound I mean I can hear
everything going on around me I have no
problem with my spacial awareness so
that's really good
one thing though it feels like what I'm
listening to these is just like I'm very
far away from the action let's try the
tiberius and see how these spare now the
fat beers we got no cable to deal with
part of the bonuses of it being more
expensive I've got those features like
wireless capabilities over here we've
got a transmitter where I can control
things like the volume of the source if
I'm having it plugged into multiple
things as well as like the equalizer
settings the Dolby settings so I can go
ahead and change a couple things to kind
of tweak the experience whereas with
these but I get what he here's what you
get and that's about it
but let's try this on see if I can hear
an actual difference between the two of
them oh I can immediately tell the
difference now it's not a ton of days
but there's something about this that
feels like
I'm not as far away from the action as I
did with the Logitech's yeah this
definitely feels like a way more full
sound like I'm hearing more I feel more
in it now is it worth $200 in terms of
the difference honestly I'm not too sure
about that just yet if someone's on a
budget where I tell them to save for
this from the sound experience alone I'm
not completely sold while for 35 bucks I
don't think this is a bad but when
you're just comparing it to something
that's like this really do hear the
difference well if I do anyway I might
have to get Arian on this to let me know
she can hear anything different herself
can beautiful blonde jumping on this I'm
right got it okay and then also once you
did not show me which one to say in my
head or tell me so that was nice okay
what's the first one she's insisting on
playing by itself everything do you
really go with a console controller just
want to use an awesome cheaper than just
down yeah it sounds good to me
so you like this how about you play huh
how about you go play I'm sorry this
unless my heart is going fast I'm
getting up in there
I have trouble official if you go you're
going good dog all right somewhere just
a headset no okay no response
by hypothesis all right so what do you
want to be here anymore this one this
one definitely sounds more dynamic like
I could hear all the same things like I
hear like a little bullet sounds
everything but just have like a richer
deeper side yeah yeah and this will bit
more comfort with me when we work on
yeah just a visible more systematically
this is we can you can tell identify oh
and yes immediately but what I was
playing just fine like this before me I
have any complaints about like health so
comfort fell until I felt that it was
comparatively like oh this is better do
you think this is what it was about
okay $200 yeah you need a difference is
worth $1 no definitely not
I mean okay my initial answer is know
that you're a heavy hardcore gamer and I
care about all those other things and I
close with a rich salad yeah you're not
look at the blue except I'm 35 miss is
235 yeah the thirteen-year-old 35 mr.
paneros half now we all know a big part
of the gaming headsets is of course the
mic since you can party chat talk to
people that you're playing in games with
so you got a built-in mic over here this
one actually has noise cancelling so
this wasn't cancel all the noise from
the outside so if you're a party chat
this is the kind of audio quality you
can expect from it
I'm going to switch over to the Siberia
800 and see if this has a drastically
different mic okay so right now we're
using the mic from the SteelSeries so
just as with the logitech this is the
kind of quality you can expect here I'm
gonna have to go ahead and see what the
difference is I'm going to listen to it
and give you guys some feedback on how
different I think they are and if this
is worth if you're looking for a good
mic if it's worth to pay a higher price
tag compared to something that you find
on the lower end gaming headset and
those are the differences that I found
between the two headsets
now I played back the mic audio from
both headset and it was kind of weird
the logitech seems are cut out here and
there but I think that it did sound
clearer when it wasn't cutting out I
like the way my voice came through on
the mic but I'm just not sure why I was
cutting out not sure of - defective but
I looked around and I didn't really see
anybody complaining about it
so maybe my unit but you guys heard to
free ourselves in terms of straight-up
comparing them I feel like the
difference between them is definitely
noticeable
I noticed it re noticed it but I think
what matters is who actually cares about
hearing that difference anyone going
from a Logitech to the SteelSeries or
you know a cheaper headset to something
more expensive you're going to hear that
difference and you're going to enjoy it
more by the end of the day you got to
ask yourself if it's worth $200 I think
someone looking for just a straight-up
gaming headset will be fine with either
one I think it all depends on how
hardcore of a gamer you are and I was
pretty surprised by how well the
Logitech stood up against the CEO series
considering that there were two hundred
dollars less and Wadena sound is good in
comparison they still sound pretty good
on their own but they could use a bit
more bass but that's about it for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy girl that could
just be a thumbs up I'll catch you guys
in the next one so that is your average
consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
