consumer and today I'm going to be going
over my ranking of the beats by dre
headphones product line and I'm going to
be ranking these all the way to what I
think are the best now I'm going to be
going over the whole shebang here as for
our sound quality durability looks price
all that good stuff
is all going to be taken into
consideration in this ranking this video
is made for someone who's on the market
trying to buy a pair of Beats and wants
know if one is better than the other or
which beats they should go after now I
know a lot of you guys have favorites
among the beats line but this video
isn't to say any of them are bad it's
simply to say which ones I believe have
the best value overall and provide you
the best beats experience and with that
being said let's not waste any time
let's get right into it pop in that
number 6 I'm putting the beats by dre
executives the executives have a very
nice design
they're definitely catering to the older
more mature audience that wants a pair
of Beats but don't want the flashy Reds
that come along with it or the little
bright vibrant colors so the executives
are definitely more low-key and I think
that definitely works for them with all
black and black and gray so it's got a
really really nice design and it's made
out of some nice materials it's very
durable so I'm definitely liking to
build quality and the actual overall
design of the executives now my only
qualms with the executives is that it
doesn't work without batteries so you
need some external batteries to power up
the headphones and I think as a $300
price point there should be at least an
option to plug them in and you know just
listen to your music without the
batteries and with that you also can't
turn off the active noise-cancelling
which is my next gripe with it with the
active noise canceling the executives
have a really loud hiss that comes in on
your music at lower volumes and when
your music is paused so it definitely
can be about it too a lot of people I've
seen a lot of complaints about it so
that's definitely one of my other gripes
with it now my only last gripe which is
not really a gripe but it's all based on
personal preference the executives don't
have that really bassy sound that you
expect from beats so if you're looking
for that Basie beats Experian
and say that 10 times fast you really
won't be able to listen to it with the
executives the executives sound a lot
more subdued and it might be because
they're going after the more mature
older audience who probably doesn't want
that big bass but if you are younger and
you're looking for Bumi Basie beats the
executives really aren't the one for you
but if you aren't then that might work
so it's all personal preference as I
mentioned and that's number six with the
beats executives and for number five we
have the beats Pro now a lot of you are
probably going oh my god please Pro a
long list but hear me out the beats pro
have a great design they look really
nice they have a very durable design as
well it's built like a tank and it also
is a very great sounding pair of
headphones now these are definitely all
really great things but it's at a $400
price tag and I just think that's way
too much for just a regular pair of
headphones they sound great but they
don't want $400 in my opinion I just
think that's a bit over the top and at
the $400 price point you'd expect the
sound quality to be leagues better than
all of the other beads but actually I
don't think it's that much different I
don't think the average consumer will be
able to pick up just how different it is
in comparison to some of the other ones
so that 400 all price tag I'm not really
seeing why in comparison to the other
ones the build quality is nice but I
definitely don't think it warrants that
price range and I do know that they're
supposed to be pros and like DJ's are
supposed to use them and stuff like that
but because of that design built for
DJ's with the swiveling ear cups and
stuff it has a really strong clamping
force so after a while of listening it
can hurt your ears I know for me
personally and I've seen other people
complain about it as well it does hurt
your ears after a while so you don't
want to spend 400 bucks on pair of
headphones that you can keep on your
head for a very extended period of time
so the beats Pro for me had to come in
at number 5 and from number 4 on this
list I'm putting the beats by dre mixers
now the mixtures are overall some really
really great headphones they've got nice
build quality it made out of really
durable materials they're actually very
nice sounding they sound amongst the
best of the beats by dre line they're
very clear they have some great clarity
not that much bass
you get an overall nice experience with
them for sure and I think the overall
design of them just looks really nice I
am a huge fan of the way the mixers look
and they've got a ton of color options
out there they've got this whole new
neon line so you've got all kinds of
colors available to you and what's also
really great about the mixers is that
there are two hundred and fifty dollars
which is makes them the second least
expensive beads which is interesting at
twenty or fifty dollars but 250 is the
second least expensive of the line so if
you're on the market for beads you only
thing lower than that is the solo HP now
where I have issues with the mixers is
their comfort they also have a DJ design
so you can swivel the earcup and stuff
like that but that clamping force on the
mixers is completely unbearable to me
and a lot of people that I've had tried
them on and a lot of people that I've
seen in comments so I'm 100% not alone
on the comfort issue but if it wasn't
for that I would rank these probably at
second place or something but the mixer
is just they're just too uncomfortable
to spend $250 on and not be able to wear
them for a long period of time but if
you are one of those people who can wear
these with no issues I completely
recommend it these sounds absolutely
amazing they look great I definitely do
recommend them if you're on the market
for beads and you tried them on first
you definitely have to try these on
first but unless you've tried them and
you know they're good I'm gonna have to
rank them at number four and for number
three on this list I'm putting the beats
solo HDS now the solo HDS are the
cheapest of the line at $200 and with
$200 you get a very compact design
you've got the real iconic beats look
for going for it
I think the solo HDS look really nice
but so ladies were actually my first
pair of beats and when I was comparing
them sort of beat Studios a lot of
singers were just way too big and I
didn't really like that so that compact
design is really great and it also comes
in a ton of colors so many colors now so
you've got a ton of options out there
now the only real qualms I can say about
the solo HDS is probably the sound
quality but as an average consumer who
is probably used to just regular
headphones I definitely think that these
won't be an issue I definitely didn't
have
any issues when I first tried these on I
really loved the sound quality that I
got from it but for anyone who's tried
really good headphones and wants to jump
into the beats line try on ice beats
product the SOL eh DS probably aren't
for you
but if you're just an average consumer
going from regular everyday headphones
or our earphones and you wanna jump into
the beats line the solo HDS will
definitely not be a problem I know
Item have one and a couple of my friends
didn't have any issues as well so
definitely good stuff with the solo HDS
at that price point now the only other
issues I can say with the solo HDS would
probably be durability I know what the
solo HDS that they have that cushion
that can kind of come off at the top
I've dealt with that quite a few times
when I had them so that's definitely a
problem but I've always been able to
just you know up sticking back with it
without any real issues but the fact
that it happened in the first place is
kind of daunting now some people have
complained that it cracks things like
that but I've never dealt with a
headband cracking I think that's an old
issue that used to happen with the solo
HDS I don't think that's an issue
anymore they reinforced a headband so
it's definitely a lot stronger there but
I do think that the solo HDS are
definitely a nice introductory headphone
into the beats line and that's why I
have them at number three and from
number two on the list I have the beats
Wireless the beats Wireless are like an
upgraded version of the solo HDS they
both have a very compact design although
the beats wireless are slightly larger
and the overall sound quality of the
beats bartlett's are also better than
the solo HDS where your solo HDS might
sound a bit muddy the wireless sound
like they've cleaned it up quite a bit
in the sound quality department and
there's also a lot more comfortable due
to the large ear cushions and with those
ear cushions being on here you can
definitely feel the bass a lot more so
for those bass heads out there the
wireless sounds great for that and of
course the biggest thing about the
wireless is the fact that they are
bluetooth headphones you can actually
connect this to any Bluetooth device and
start listening right away so computers
cell phones all that you don't need a
wire to listen to your music and even if
the battery dies and you're not able to
use those bluetooth features anymore you
can always plug into headphones and
listen to your music no problem you
won't need any battery powers in order
to listen to music if you're using the
cable but the only issue with using
bluetooth beats is since they're very
targeted
item that gets stolen a lot it makes it
a bit easier to snatch off someone's
head or neck or whatever if you're in an
area where robbery is possible you
definitely want to be mindful of that
since they have no cable to kind of keep
them secure I guess so as that is
something a lot of people need to think
about sometimes when they're heading
outside with these now my issue with the
Obi's Wireless is that very cost 279 so
they're pretty close to the $300 range I
would have liked them better at 250
where they were just like an upgrade to
solo HDS but at 279 it's a bit more
expensive but I do think that is because
of the overall better sound quality and
Bluetooth feature so those definitely
cost more and as far as the durability
goes I'll put it in the same regards as
the solo HDS simply because they're
pretty much built exactly the same
except these are slightly larger around
the ear cups and for me I think that the
overall package with the wireless are a
lot better than most of the other
options you get out there you've got
Bluetooth features you got good sound
quality you've got a compact design and
it's bit lower at the price range I have
279 then let's say the executives or
pros things like that so for me number
two are the beats Wireless and number
one on this list is the new beat studios
now if we're talking about the old B
Studios this would probably be much
lower on the list probably number five
or six in my opinion now the new B's
videos have gone under a drastic change
they've changed the overall design the
whole system of needing batteries now
it's a rechargeable battery that you can
just charge up on the go and it lasts 20
hours which is really really great now
my qualms with that is if the battery
dies you can't listen to your music so
that's definitely a huge drawback but
the fact that it's rechargeable means
that you can get these charged up all
the time with a micro USB cable so
that's very easy to find nowadays
especially with all the smartphones out
so you definitely got the battery life
going there and the sound quality just
sounds really really great
now they've done huge huge improvements
in comparison to the old Studios there's
also your sounded quite muddy when
compared to these so definitely a good
job by beads there and with the new
design it doesn't feel like it's as
chunky or hue
which as the old Studios a lot of people
did like the old Studios look but me I
was never a fan of it so if you're
someone who wants a more compact low-key
headphone these actually are a lot
better for that than the old studios now
of course these still come in at the
$300 price point which is very steep for
a lot of people so that's definitely one
of the big drawbacks there as well but I
think with all this that they've done
with it it's definitely worth the number
one spot for all the beats headphones
the sound quality is probably the best
out of all of them and you've got the
very nice design
you've got great battery life I think
that overall the beats studios have
definitely done a good turn in
comparison to the old one and I think
that they earn the number one spot if
you're looking into beats those are the
ones that you should get and that pretty
much wraps up my list of beats by dre
headphones now I know a lot of you have
favorites like I said before you
probably think the mixers are the best
or you probably think the executives are
the best but I try to look at everything
that goes into the headphones and prices
and things like that and make my ranking
based fairly either way I try to look at
all the whole picture in comparison to
everything in the entire line and make
this ranking based on that
