I've never done and asked me before so I
asked a guy kidding with some questions
over on Twitter here's what we've got
what was your favorite smartphone of
2016 okay well if the note seven didn't
go boom-boom I would have definitely
said that but since that one doesn't
count at this point I'm going to go with
the Google pixel XL comes that's what my
main driver is as an Android phone so
I'm going to say Google pick excel you
only get three gadgets to use for the
rest of your life what would they be
hmm I'm going to go with my phone
obviously I don't know pop specific we
have to be but I'll say my iPhone 7 plus
and stuff like my main daily driver um
my macbook because that's where I edit
my videos I can use my camera from the
iPhone to record macros for editing and
the last thing my Nintendo 3ds because
damn I'd die without it
because so those are my three oh god
please don't call me an eye shape I
message has a stranglehold on me I
promise what do you think about the
switch I'm excited about the Nintendo
swiftly metal switch actually have my
attention because of that portable side
I'm like I said my one of my top three
gadgets that I take with me at the 3ds
so portability is my thing right
I played portable games more than
console games PC games any other kind of
games so that has me super super excited
battery life and I got portable charges
so I'm pretty excited how would you
celebrate if you reach one middle
alright so celebrating the 1 million
subscriber mark is going to be a big big
deal but I want to ask you guys how do
you think I should celebrate oh don't
say giveaways God we know that might be
coming but what do you guys think aside
from giveaways should I do
how should we celebrate because it's not
just a party for me party for you guys
do we got to celebrate in a cool way
which 2017 flagship are you most excited
about you know what it's actually really
hard to be excited for any smartphone in
2017 things I feel like the headphone
jack is on the line
with them all but I'm going to say that
picks the new version of the pixel since
it's my favorite current Android phone
I'm going to go that or maybe even Note
8 or the SI I don't know there's a
couple of good phones coming out in this
here favorite headphones of all time
don't do this to me I can't pick one
it's just too many I'm not going to do
it
no I'm not going to do it though but if
you guys want to see a list of my
current favorites I'll have a link to
that video down here I just recently did
it you guys can go check that out but I
can't pick one I'm not going to do it
why did you start doing YouTube I say I
started just like most people just did
it as a hobby something for fun I was
little I love YouTube videos back in the
day watching a lot of cell phone videos
I just jumped on board just because I
saw and a kind of an opportunity to do
it for regular average folks who don't
want to create detect jargon because
back in the day I had to do research to
forget some of these tech reviews so I
wanted to give my spin on it that was
super easy to understand and a higher
average consumer was born so be clear
guys the average consumer videos are all
about easy understanding videos not just
to products what did you do before
reviewing the tech so before I started
reviewing text I had this really boring
job I guess you would say as a Quality
Assurance analyst
which pretty much means I had to make
sure that the web the place I was
working the processes and procedures
were all in line so that we can make
sure everything was running smoothly and
I like text a lot more so I ended up
falling into this and it kind of just
blew up and I'm glad to be doing this
right now why'd you stop the vlogs all
right the vlogs so to be completely
transparent I feel a lot of attention to
what you guys say your feedback and how
you respond certain videos and it seemed
like investing more time detect videos
just seemed to make a lot more sense in
terms of putting the content out there
so the vlog has to take a backseat but
if you're interested in knowing the
things that we're doing outside of
Justin
our average tech videos be sure to
follow us on social media meet and re
both the average consumer you'll find
that everywhere snapchat is UHD reviews
your average girlfriend Ferrari follow
us you'll see the kind of stuff that we
would normally do on the blog through
those channels so be sure to follow us
but if you guys really want to see some
vlogs or something you're amped about
let us know what the comment down below
maybe we can start maybe we could revive
that your average couple channel and
post there there's interest let me know
what a comment down below what hobbies
do you have
I noticed you have Gundam and gun
playing all of your videos the fact that
you even said Gunpla means you know what
it's all about but I do like to build
these model kits you guys see them in
the videos all the time I'm a huge
Gundam fan I spend countless hours
building these little model kits things
that I could spruce up my videos with
things that I'm interested genuinely so
that's really my thing and I'm a I'm a
big gamer RPGs all day that's kind of
what I'm into an anime what's the fun
fact about you okay a fun fact about me
is actually it's funny so you can pause
this video at any point and I'm going to
look like I have the weirdest face you
can scroll back rewind back forward
pause it my face looks weird
I don't know why that happens but it
does I promise I'm not ugly but it just
happens that my face looks completely
completely weird whenever you pause the
video give it a try
leave some time marks down below and if
there's any really hilarious faces be
sure to screenshot it send it over to me
over on Twitter and let's have a good
laugh do you like anime or manga what's
your favorite series yes I love anime
and manga if you couldn't tell by me
featuring them in almost every video
with a screen in it um but I love them I
just like my main thing to watch my feet
in terms of my favorites
obviously Gundam Gundam double O if you
guys are slightly interested in Gundam
good nun double o is a very very good
place to start
other series attack on Titan
code gear hunter x hunter there's just
so many of course it's like the
knowledge show and Dragonball Z but
those are classic the other ones I
mentioned was a Loki amazing show Yugi
or Kaiba it's all about the heart of the
card where do you get your Nike hoodies
ah the Nike store you can also get them
from Macy's I got a couple on Macy's
website so you can check those places
out can you ask companies not to drop
the headphone jack you know I wish I had
that kind of power but uh unfortunately
not I'm just praying to God they all
don't jump on that really bizarre
bandwagon
alright last one do you use a screen
protector this though or not why well I
love to use screen protectors because I
like to protect my phone dies in these
cases all the time I unfortunately did
not do that with the iPhone 7 plus and I
completely regret it this thing is
covered in fine scratches at this point
I put it in my pocket
take it out spine scratches are all over
the place
luckily I have Apple care but I really
hate those fine scratches and that's why
I use it my Google pixel XL that I also
carry with me has a screen protector I
always put my favorite screen protector
company I guess down below in the
description if you guys need screen
protectors but a screen protectors are
definitely the way to go if fine
scratches annoy you but that about wraps
it up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you like to see more of
these videos let me know with a comment
down below I'll try to do some more if
you guys are interested and be sure to
follow me on social media so that you
guys can hit me up with some questions
things like that and you get featured in
