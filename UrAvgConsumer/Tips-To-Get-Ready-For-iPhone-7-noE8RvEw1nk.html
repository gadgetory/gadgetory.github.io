and it's that time of year again is
iPhone season and you guys know in the
tech world that's a pretty big deal but
if you plan on getting the new iPhone 7
like me here are some things you're
going to want to do to get ready step 1
start thinking about how you want to get
rid of your old phone I know I have a
very very bad habit of holding on to
phones after I've moved on to the next
one
where I really could be getting some
cash for them there are tons of ways of
getting rid of your phone but you're
gonna want to sell it on eBay
now you might be wondering why eBay
instead of something like Amazon or even
selling it back to your carriers but it
comes down to two simple things one eBay
has a really really easy process and two
you get more money I think more money
says it all but if you guys don't
believe me I'll have links down below in
the description for you to check it out
and it will literally take you a few
minutes to get your phone up on eBay and
ready to be sold and once you're there
it's super simple like I said all you
have to do is choose the manufacturer
the device type your phone carrier its
capacity its color and what condition
it's in as well as the accessories that
will come with it and after that you're
done and you get to see the total amount
that you can get for it and with the new
iPhone right around the corner these few
days right before its release are always
the best time to sell your phone with
that good insult it's time for step two
we all know about the loss of the
headphone jack
r.i.p a phone jack but the silver lining
here is that there's an excuse to buy my
favorite kind of headphones bluetooth
headphones now I've made videos about
some of my favorites so if you guys are
interested in that I'll have links down
below as well but me I think I have my
eye on the new Sony here in wireless
earbuds they look pretty lightweight and
compact so I think they make a good
companion for the iPhone 7 and if you
guys are interested in seeing me do a
review or something let me know with a
comment down below and step number three
which may be a no-brainer to sum is to
buy yourself a case while the design
change slightly it pretty much has the
same body as an iPhone 6 and 6s and if
you've used those phones without a case
you should know how slippery they are
and you're gonna want to protect your
investment
especially if you're bold enough to buy
it in jet-black because that thing will
be a fingerprint magnet and it scratches
like crazy Apple even recommends you use
a case with it and I know that puts you
between a rock and a hard place because
you want to show off that smooth
jet-black design but you're gonna want
to protect it from those scratches but
if you don't care about them go nuts but
for my headphone users who have nice
pairs of headphones that they want to
keep using with their new iPhone I
definitely suggest getting a second
adapter they only retail for about nine
bucks so luckily they won't break the
bank but there's a high chance that
you're gonna lose it when carrying
around your phone so get another one
better safe than sorry
but that about wraps it up guys
hopefully you enjoyed this video
oh and one of the most important ways to
prepare for the new iPhone is to watch
my videos when I get my hands on it so
you can learn all there is to it
and that's about it for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you plan on
getting a new iPhone what color did you
pre-order what color will you order what
are you gonna get big shout out to eBay
for sponsoring this video and I'll catch
you guys in the next one till then it's
your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
