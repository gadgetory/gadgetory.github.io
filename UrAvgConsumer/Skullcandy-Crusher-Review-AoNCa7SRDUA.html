Squarespace what's going on everyone at
ravish consumer and today I finally got
a review for you guys of the Skullcandy
crusher so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it
bah-bah-bah-bah-bah
alright guys here we have the Skullcandy
crushers and skull candy is put out a
warning that these headphones have bass
you can feel so watch out now I know
some of you guys are quite excited about
the crushers do that they're crazy bass
and probably that $99 price point but
let's see if it's all it's cracked up to
be here I have the black version and
they come with a few other color options
such as red white black and even some
custom designs the crushers are a bit on
the large side especially when you take
a look at the ear cups but they do have
a foldable design so this doesn't hinder
their portability or storage options
taking a look around the headphones you
can see that it has a fairly thin and
plastic headband which has a pretty
interesting design for the cushion
underneath it may not look comfortable
due to the ridges but I had no problems
while listening to it moving on to the
ear cups you'll notice that they're a
little large but probably because they
contain through drivers as well as a
built-in amplifier and for those of you
who don't know what a driver is it's
basically where the music or sound comes
from within the ear cups their questions
are made of synthetic leather and are
actually quite comfortable above the
right ear cushion is a latch that you
can pull down to reveal where your
double-a battery is housed and at the
bottom you'll find chrome grills as well
as your 3.5 millimeter audio input and
last but not least you have the bass
slider on the back of the left ear cut
overall the crushers have a plastic
build which I typically have no issues
with but I can't shake the hollow
feeling that he's given the hand when
you unfold these or bring any real
movement to them it feels and sounds as
if there are springs inside you can
especially feel this when adjusting the
sides while it's on your head now I know
that this is in place to give the head
rattling feeling when you pump up the
bass slider but when you aren't using
the headphones or you don't have the
slider turned up while listening it can
come off as cheap and feeling really
hollow I'm sure these aren't as hollow
as they feel but that
not only wouldn't want to bend these or
leave them anywhere accidents can happen
although I wouldn't trust these to take
a beating if you're careful with your
stuff I'm sure these can handle regular
everyday wear and tear it also comes
with a carrying case to make traveling a
bit easier but the pouch is actually
quite large and thin so you won't get
much protection from it it'll just help
moving the headphones and accesories
around it also comes with a straight
detachable cable that includes an inline
remote with a play and pause button and
a built-in mic now let's talk about the
base feature that Skullcandy has so
graciously warned us about it definitely
is an experience that you won't get from
your standard pair of headphones no
matter how bassy they are it's similar
to the pulse wireless headset you guys
hear me rave about although not executed
quite the same when listening to music
you can expect to feel tons of
vibrations from the headphones but
thankfully there's a slider so you can
control just how much bass you feel as a
bass lover I found myself turning down
the slider most of the times because it
can be a lot because you can adjust the
extra amount of bass
I don't expect many will have an issue
with the bass drowning out sounds the
bass is powered by a built-in amplifier
and is dedicated to its own pair of
drivers within the headphone the
amplifier uses a double-a battery for
power and what's nice about the Crushers
is its ability to tell when music is
being played and when it's disconnected
from an audio source this allows you to
turn on and off on its own to conserve
battery when not in use thus the reason
for no often on switch but back to the
topic of sound to be honest I wasn't too
impressed by the sound quality without
the bass feature present music came off
muffled especially when compared to
headphones within its price range and
even some that were a bit cheaper some
examples being the H th M 50 s the pulse
wireless headphones that tout the same
rumbling feature and the Logitech UE
4000s that cost only about 40 to 50
bucks now I know you're probably
thinking the m50 S and the pulse are
more expensive than the Crushers but
only by 15 to 20 bucks vocals seem
distant and require increased volume to
hear clearly and I found that subtle
instruments were harder to hear as well
however if you don't have experience
with decent quality headphones you may
not even notice where the sound quality
has its flaws but if you have any
experience with
the decent pair I'd be careful picking
these up unless you're in it for the
base feature but I'm pretty sure that
these caught your attention that's why
you want them these aren't headphones
that deliver on great sound quality but
rather an experience of extreme bass
that will blow a lot of people's minds a
lot of people will see this as a gimmick
but it depends on what you're really
looking for do I think these are a good
buy for you if you're interested in
extreme bass yes you don't get a ton of
options out there when it comes to bass
like this and if you're looking for a
versatile or high-quality headphones
this probably won't be where you want to
spend your cash I think the average
consumer probably won't have any issues
with the sound quality unless they've
used other headphones outside of Apple
earbuds these aren't exactly a budget
pair of headphones but they aren't
expensive considering what they do and
now of course I have to show you guys
what they look like on but here's a
quick word from our sponsor if you

going to try it off from the front and
here we have it this is the front you
got some side action here and of course
you've got the top so you can get a good
idea of what this would look like on
someone's head how large the ear cups
are in comparison to the face and all

ear cups are a little large but
big big deal and that's about it for
