right and we got a bit of a different
video today we shot this a little
differently than the normal videos that
you guys see on the channel so let me
know what you guys think but let's move
on to this retro set now when it's
already shot I wanted me to try out this
Dell XPS tower with Intel's octane
memory I got to say when I started it
kind of reminded me of those towers that
we had back when we were growing up but
this one is way more powerful and for
you spec heads out there this thing is
running Intel's eighth generation i7
chip with six cores and it's also got 32
gigs of RAM 16 ddr4 and 16 with octane
memory it's even packing an nvidia gtx
1080 so if you want to do some gaming
this is gonna be possible here but what
really makes a tower like this unique is
intel's obtain memory now I've seen
octane memory and laptops before but I
feel like it makes the most sense in a
tower and for those of you not familiar
with obtain memory
it basically adapts and remembers what
you do most often on your computer and
then accelerates and launches those
applications allowing you to have a
really personalized experience so if you
happen to be a creator and you use a lot
of Photoshop and After Effects like we
do over time octane memory will allow
your applications to launch faster
compared to the ones you don't really
use which really does make a difference
if you're working on a project and
you're on a deadline you got a time
crunch like I usually am trust me it
helps and if you're a gamer Intel's
optimum memory can assist in decreasing
the time spent waiting for the game to
load since it adapts and accelerates to
your most played games and that's cool
and all but the reason why I think
optimum memory works really well in a
tower is because with the tower you want
to add some hard drives to the system
you want to get as much space as
possible but when you're adding those
hard drives you know they're not as fast
as SSDs without any memory it pairs well
with the processor to make sure that you
launch those applications just as
quickly as working with an SSD so you
can get those really high storage
capacities in those towers and still use
a regular hard drive while still getting
really really fast speeds in terms of
launching your applications but like I
mentioned before ops memory is also in
laptops so you don't have to get a
full-blown tower to take advantage of it
what specs like that you can kind of see
that's the theme of this whole set up
classic clean and a low key powerful now
let's talk a bit about the audio I went
with these retro looking desktop
speakers and like the whole theme here
on the outside we've got that classic
more timeless look but on the inside
we've got some really cool 2018 features
this is the Edifier our 1700 bt
bluetooth speakers and these are some
cool bookshelf speakers it's they of
course pair with your pc but one thing
that's really nice about these is that
it's not limited to just working with
your pc here it's got bluetooth so you
can connect it to any device like your
phone tablet whatever it may be as long
as it's got bluetooth it actually has
two aux input so you can connect two
devices at once here so if you want to
have your tower connected and maybe
something else you don't have to worry
about unplugging anything just plug them
in both at once and you got access to
both and of course it sounds great it's
got a decent amount of bass and you can
actually control that with the knobs
here on the right side and you can also
control the treble as well as the volume
alright from the speaker itself and this
thing even comes with a remote so you
can do that from your bed or even your
couch but I really like these because it
fits with the whole thing here it's got
that nice classic look but it's got a
lot of versatility and features as well
and for our display we got the Dell
ultra-thin 27-inch monitor now this I
would have loved to have back in the day
instead of those big clunky monitors
with the massive bezels you know what
I'm talking about but this thing is nice
and thin with it being five point five
millimeters at a thinnest point which is
just insane and it's got super small
bezels with a nice quad HD IPS display
that gets really bright and this thing
has 600 nits and brightness which is
pretty surprising for something so thin
it also has dual HDMI so if you want to
look up more than one device you've got
the ability to do that and it's also got
the ports right here on the back to
allow for some quick easy access but now
let's talk about those accessories and
peripherals now have a little fun
picking out the accessories here that
really help the theme come to life first
we've got this really interesting
Bluetooth speaker that pretty much turns
your Smartphone into a desk phone I was
pretty shocked when I even saw this
thing existed you pretty much dock your
phone inand it connects automatically
through bluetooth allowing you to make
calls and answer calls right from the
desk phone that is insane and it's crazy
because you really use this thing just
like a desk phone you pick up the phone
and you dial the numbers you want
you hit the little button and boom
you're making a call and when you want
to hang up you just put the phone down
and it hangs up automatically
honestly it almost feels like it was
made for this setup you can even store
some speed dial numbers if you're into
that but honestly this thing is just
straight-up cool being able to use your
phone as a regular phone I don't know
could be nice especially if you work
from home and you want to have that
official feel this definitely does that
now as for the mouse that we've got here
we've got the classic microsoft
intellimouse and it looks like just a
regular straight-up mouse but it's a
little bit more special than what we
used to use back in the day I've got
three customizable buttons here four
preset shortcuts for desktop navigation
it's actually really lightweight and
ergonomic and while it feels and looks
like what we used to use back in the day
it of course has a much better sensor
and it's got this nice cool white LED
strip in the back so it kind of helps it
to have this more up-to-date vibe and
the keyboard that we're using here
actually came with the tower I didn't
change it out because it's got that
simple and classic look which works
really well for your theme and it
actually types pretty nicely
we've also added this classic looking
lamp it's simple but a nice modern
design that fits the theme without being
over-the-top but there you have it guys
this is my take on a retro setup in 2018
it has its classic look but it's
powerful and packed with a bunch of cool
features but that about wraps it up for
this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
if you liked the whole vile of this
video definitely hit that thumbs up
button you know be that cool guy or girl
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then it's your average consumer peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
