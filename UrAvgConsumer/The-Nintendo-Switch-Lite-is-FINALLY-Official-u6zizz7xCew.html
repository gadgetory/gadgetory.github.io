today Nintendo dropped a bomb and
announced a Nintendo switch light now
we've been hearing rumors about a
Nintendo switch meaning forever now as
well as a more powerful version of the
switch so only half of those rumors are
confirmed right now so let's talk about
this new Nintendo switch light and this
isn't too surprising since we've seen
them ten they'll come out with light
versions of their handheld systems for
decades now now this is the Nintendo
switch light which means it also has a
lighter price tag this thing is going
for 200 bucks which is 100 bucks less
than the standard switch and I was
actually very very happy to see that
lower price tag I think 200 dollars is a
lot more accessible for those people who
thought the switch was just a little bit
too much money and it also makes the
switch and easier buy for kids but now
let's actually talk about the system
this is a smaller Nintendo switch so it
has a 5.5 inch display compared to the
6.2 inch display that we saw with the
normal one so you get a smaller display
here and something else that's changed
that's pretty huge is they took away the
joy cons so now the droid cons or
controls are attached to the device so
it's now one single piece and it feels
like Nintendo is kind of using the idea
that they used with the 2d s and where
they made one slab that had no hinges
just one easy piece to use and I think
that's a good move when you're factoring
in young kids playing with the system
gives them less pieces to potentially
break but it does kind of kill the whole
idea of being able to switch up your
gameplay style since you're only playing
it in handheld mode one cool change that
did make with this though is now it has
a normal deep pad instead of the four
button that we had before so now you get
that pretty standard d-pad so for those
of you who've been dying for that you
got that here and that smaller display
still has that 720p resolution just like
the normal switch but you will not be
able to dock this thing in and get it
fully scaled at 1080p on a television
they kind of remove that feature which
is a bit mind-blowing to me I it
wouldn't make sense to not include the
dock period just so you can keep that
price tag lower but they sell the dock
on its own so it would have been cool to
be able to still do that if you just
bought the dock separately but that
functionality is just
there at all and basically Nintendo's
reasoning for this is they notice the
trends of how people play their switches
and they say most people just play with
it
handheld would it impact me if I owned
the switch light probably not but it
just kind of sucks to see certain
features get taken away there's also no
kickstand which makes complete sense
since you can't remove the joy cons and
have the switch far away from you while
you play the kickstand kind of sucks
anyway now there's also no HD Rumble on
the light I'm not sure if that means no
rumble period but as of right now no HD
Rumble which is the more precise rumbles
that go with the sounds and the games
but hopefully they keep normal Rumble
I'd be fine with that but no Rumble at
all I wouldn't be crazy about that and
this time is dropping with a few colors
we're gonna see grey yellow and the
stylish color which you guys know I am
all over and there's gonna be a special
edition one for a pokemon sword and
shield that one looks really really good
and it kind of reminds me of the
Nintendo 3ds that had all those special
themes that you could buy so you might
see a lot of people collecting these
Nintendo switch lights and something
that's pretty cool with this new design
is that the bezels now will match the
color of the system so it's not gonna
just be a black bezel it's gonna match
the system kind of help it blend in a
bit more and I'm all about that now with
a smaller display means you get an
overall smaller footprint when it comes
to the body of the switch light and the
verge described it as taking off one
joique on on a regular switch and you
pretty much have that footprint which is
probably gonna be great for kids since
they have smaller hands won't be as
unwieldy as the regular switch since
that is a pretty big portable now the
standard collar is gonna be dropping
September 20th the same day as Link's
Awakening and the special Pokemon
Edition will be dropping November 8th
and thankfully there's no performance
difference between the switch and the
switch light so that means you can play
games like breath of the wild have that
huge environment and not worry about
getting like lowered graphics or
anything like that you get the full
experience just on a smaller system
you'll also still be able to use
external joy cons pro controllers
pokeball plus so if you have those
accessories or maybe you plan on getting
them you'll still be able to use them
but it might be a bit weird since you
won't have that kickstand or anything to
prop it up
probably have to buy an extra stand to
make full use out of it and there's a
couple things you've got to think about
if you're planning on picking up to
switch light since it doesn't have
detachable controllers no IR sensors
certain games kind of require you to
have those even playing arms is gonna be
a bit different since you're not gonna
be able to do that punching motion so
you got to really think about what games
you want to play if you're gonna get the
switch light since you're not gonna have
the ability to do certain motions
alright so we got our details we got
that $200 price tag now who is the
switch for personally I think if you've
been wanting a switch but that $300
price tag has just been keeping you away
this seems like a good option since it's
only 200 bucks you do have a lot of
trade-offs but if you just don't want to
spend $300 you might be willing to make
the compromise I also think that this is
going to be great for kids that smaller
size fewer pieces I personally would
jump at a switch life for a gift for a
young one over the switch any day now
who isn't this for obviously it is not
meant for hardcore gamers this is the
light version of the switch there's no
reason to go down but it's not targeting
any hardcore gamers that's for sure I
personally just don't like the fact that
they're kind of getting away from the
switch aspect which is being able to
switch up your gameplay style you're
getting one gameplay style with this but
it just has the switch name it's kind of
weird now all we really have to do is
wait for that pro version the upgraded
one that maybe has a 1080p display has
bluetooth so that you can listen with
headphones all the things that we really
really want on the normal switch
hopefully we get it in the next version
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it let
me know what you think of the new switch
light down below in the comments and
we'll catch you guys in the next one
until then it's your average consumer
