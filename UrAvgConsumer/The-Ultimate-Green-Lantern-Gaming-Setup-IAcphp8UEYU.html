my power Green laughter life
what you're looking at is the ultimate
Green Lantern gaming setup I told you
guys after my fire set of videos that
I'd be doing a few more themed set of
videos just for fun and we ended up with
this one and I got to say I really like
how he came out now I decided to go with
Green Lantern because he happens to be
my favorite DC character and if you like
Green Lantern or the Justice League in
general be sure to give this video a
thumbs up and maybe we can make more
themes based on one of those characters
but now let's jump into the setup first
off was not to talk about the rig
colouring everything and this beast is
the r1 razor Edition by main gear and
main gear with clothes let me borrow
this beast of a machine just for this
setup and since they can customize their
pcs down to whatever you can think of
I'll probably be looking for them to
bring any theme ideas I or one of you
guys have to life now this is a razor
addition which makes complete sense and
it's just like the Green Lantern they're
all about that black and green life now
for you spec heads out there
this guy's powered by an Intel i7 7700 K
processor 32 give the ddr4 Ram to g4 GTX
pain eighties all on the msi 270x
powered gaming titanium motherboard and
of course all water-cooled with some
additional RGB lights for that nice
glowing green effect now what this means
for my average consumers out there is
that this thing can handle just about
anything you throw at it I've been able
to play any game I wanted at max
settings without any hiccups and the
things also VR capable but if you want
to learn more about this machine and the
nitty gritty of all the specs I'll of
course have a link down below for you to
check out as for our displays we've got
dual ASA Predator X 271 H caves and
these are 27 inch 4k IPS monitors with
Nvidia g-sync perfect for gaming without
duals GTX 1080s
and I gotta say these are awesome
displays I like having the ability to
multitask so having two monitors is
great and they perform well for gaming
or even watching some nice 4k content
they come with these stands with red
legs and that wouldn't work for this
setup so I have them on this dual
monitor now that I'll have linked down
below as well as everything else listed
in this video taking a look at our
peripheral these outrageous latest
version of their BlackWidow chroma
keyboard this one uses their Razer green
switch which reminds me of the Cherry MX
brown and feel very clicky and it's
often to use not to mention this is an
RGB keyboard so getting it to fit into
the theme was super easy and to the
right of that we've also got regulars
Ouroboros elite Mouse this is a wired or
wireless gaming mouse that looks great
and it works whether you're right or
left-handed and while you can't change
LEDs there's still fits in perfectly
with our theme this thing looks amazing
offer some really nice customization and
even comes with a charging dock so that
you can charge this guy even when you're
not nearly to set up and of course it's
sitting on top of a Razer Firefly
mousepad this is actually my favorite
mousepad since you can completely
customize the awesome glowing lights
lining the perimeter and to be honest
you'll probably see that in future set
of videos because it can't be deaf
flexibility now let's talk about our
sound our speakers are the Mackie CR 4
bt for interview speaker now these are
hardwired into our set up but you do
have the option to connect with a bike
why are so using bluetooth giving us
some pretty good flexibility but I told
these for the obvious reasons but they
actually sound really good I was
impressed by their sound quality even
though these are relatively small
speakers but if you're not looking to
blast your music we've also got the
SteelSeries Octus 5 please give us the
perfect green ring no pun intended as
well as awesome sound quality and an
adjustable mic for party chat
unfortunately these aren't Wireless so
you're going to have to deal with the
cable but they're worth it and obviously
it fits right into the setup if you're
looking for our nice reasonably priced
gaming headset that allows for some
customization through RGB lights this is
a great option especially since it comes
in black and white and last but not
least we've got the life-size green
lantern lantern that actually activates
when you put the included ring right up
to it and if you're a green lantern fan
you know that how they do sub
ring this thing looks awesome and feels
legit and we can't forget - Hal Jordan
figuring that we got on the side some
people are going to say where's Jon
Stewart but honestly there's no good
food or anything so I went with Hal
Jordan I grew up watching Hal Jordan
anyway on justice friends so he was a
solid choice but that figure and the
lantern are nice additional pieces to
the setup to kind of just tie it all
together and that's about everything
that makes up this ultimate Green
Lantern gaming setup slash razor setup
but this is everything guys hopefully
you enjoyed this video leave some theme
ideas down below in the description I
want to hear what you guys think we're
going to talk to main gear make some
stuff happen and see what we can come up
with hopefully you guys enjoyed it till
the next one is your average consumer
