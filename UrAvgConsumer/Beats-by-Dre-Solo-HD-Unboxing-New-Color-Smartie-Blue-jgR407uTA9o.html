want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone in Traverse consumer today I'm
going to be doing an unboxing of the
solo HDS now I know you're looking at
the color like what well they have a
couple of new colors this five in total
this one is called smarty blue and they
all have like little fun names for them
all this one smarty blue there's like
sour apple bubblegum grape and I believe
there's another one that's blue but I
can't really find the name anywhere on
what that one is
so enough about that let's not wasting
time let's get right into it alright
guys so here we have the smarty blue
solo HDS and these will now include the
new cable with control talk that has the
new design little oval shape and on the
box it shows you that it works it has
all the features with the iPod and
iPhone and iPad and on HTC phones and
blackberries it only uses the little
play button and pretty much that's all
you get as far as on the box that's
important and let's open this bad boy up
pop off the plastic here voice rings
that would pop I'm very interested in
seeing what these look like the world
was so used to the bottom use sort of
white or black versions of all the beats
it was very interesting to see a colored
version come out get the box off I'll
put this over here for now and pop open
the top now this looks you know pretty
much like the regular oh no this isn't
the same box now it seems to have a flap
here as well here's where they read okay
so if you guys can see here this is now
where they store the cord and all the
packaging comes sealed in like this so
it definitely changed up how you get
your you know your beads now now has a
similar box holding all the accessories
in here similar to the box of the whole
thing itself so that's pretty cool and
the solar is these are in here
dogs pop this open very cool so now I
also notice that you only get one cable
with these headphones before they gave
you to one with the hottest customers
open one with the control talk and one
without
so now seems that they're only including
one cable inside so see maybe they did
that save cost or something well but
here we are
these are dnews solo HDS this no it's
nice but these definitely look like
these look so tiny to me this doesn't
this isn't like a the solo HDS I said
before maybe I'm just so used to dealing
with bigger phones now they on that
phones nowadays but these seem extremely
tiny I'm going to grab my beats wireless
to compare them alright so here are the
beats wireless let me see here I guess
it's I don't know maybe I'm just really
because I these Wireless are bigger than
the solo HD is maybe I'm just getting
I'm just used to them but these seem
extraordinarily tiny like I'm really
shocked right now how small these seen
but um I don't know it's probably the
same maybe I'm just building my mind
here but here you are let me give you
guys a little close-up of what it looks
like so here you have them it's got a
nice little blue on blue I like the
color I must admit though these look
like they're more for girls than they
were
before guys I'm sure nobody would knock
a guy for having these but on you know
just first glance looking at it it does
seem warm for girls there's a darker
blue version for the up these headphones
the ones I didn't know the name of but
those are like similar to the studios
that have the dark blue version so I
think guys would rather go for that or
something or the green purple even but
this one definitely kind of seems like
it's girly especially with Hawaii but
these are it you got your headphone jack
right here you know got your nice
padding it feels a bit different to be
honest it feels on like it has a little
bit more grip to it but yeah that's
about it the Christians feel nice though
it still feels like a really nice pair
of headphones and um that's it all right
so here you have the control talk cable
your you know standard warranty
information as well as like you know
beef catalog showing you all the other
stuff that they sell and you got your
case and that's about it guys so this is
how they're doing the beats packaging
for the solos they seem to have changed
it up a bit um they took away some
things like the first like two chords
now you only have one they introduced a
new little box to hold the stuff here
and that's it everything else is pretty
much the same and that's all so if you
guys like this video please feel free to
rate comment and subscribe of course you
know I'm going to review these things
and I'm going to have the sound leak and
sound isolation test for you guys as
well and I'll see you guys in the next
video till then peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
