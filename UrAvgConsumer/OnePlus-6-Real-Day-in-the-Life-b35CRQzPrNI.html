consumer and yes I know this video took
way too long to come out but this is a
real day in the life with the one plus
six and for those of you who've never
seen one of my real day in the live
videos you're pretty much gonna be
spending a day with me and the phone
where I pretty much take you through how
it performs the battery life of how the
camera works all that stuff we're gonna
see how it is to actually use this phone
in the real world so let's see how it
does
alright guys so we've got our one plus
six in hand and of course it's got 100%
battery life to start today we are
running a bit late it's 11:45 so we'll
see how long it lasts throughout the
entire day but starting a little bit
late I'm expecting this thing to have
exceptional battery the 1 + 5 t did
really really well in terms of battery
so I'm expecting the 6 to do the same
and guys we are rockin the mirror black
version of the one plus 6 and I gotta
say this thing is super reflective which
is why it's got its name but it looks so
so clean
I'm really hoping I'm not gonna have to
throw a case on this guy in the middle
of the day I've been using it for longer
than a single day of course but I've
been using it with a case so today's the
real test to see how it feels in the
hand without a case hopefully it's not
too slippery but we'll find out I've
even got my cool watch right here to
match with it
so it looks perfect together so this is
a classy look I love it so something
that's pretty unfortunate about the 1
plus 6 is that it's only got one single
down firing speaker so when you're
watching content it's really not that
loud I've gotten used to hearing stereo
speakers but a lot of phones that we're
seeing nowadays you know I'm listening
to this and I'm just really I'm really
not that impressed and what sucks is
depending on how you hold it you can
easily quiet this thing all the way down
so one thing I do wish that the one
plastics had is stereo speakers just
noticing the sound wasn't super great
just you know trying to watch some
content here so right now I'm dealing
with a bit of a crisis my custom-painted
gundam by my boy yukkuri Oh Ventura this
flower actually leaned up on its foot
and took off a bit of paint here and I
need to show him the damage which is the
perfect time
to try out the cameras on the one plus
six the rear camera has a 16 megapixel
shooter as well as a 20 megapixel lens
so let's see what we can get here boom
let's see that looks like it's gonna be
pretty clear yeah you can see that
damage easily not too sharp but you can
see all the detail necessary so you can
see the kind of damage here alright guys
so I took the little feet off of the
Gundam we're headed to UPS so I can ship
this out to my boy Jared and then we're
also going to be returning a few things
that we had sitting around the office so
we're shipping those back you showed
them that so we're gonna be sending
those things back to Amazon right now so
we've got the GPS going so we can hit up
the UPS spot and we'll see how that
impacts the battery and just so you guys
know the battery is currently at 88% and
it's 228 p.m. so we've got a lot more
day to go so we just parked and I was
about a 12 minute drive and we've got
85% battery left now and the screen
usage has been about an hour and nine
minutes so 15 percent and we got an hour
nine minutes that's not bad at all but
I'm to go return this thing now I'm not
sure how well you guys can see it but in
terms of brightness this phone is doing
a really good job outdoors now there is
no direct sunlight as you can see it's a
pretty cloudy day the Sun is being
blocked by those clouds right there but
it's definitely doing a good job and
that's not really a concern for a lot of
phones nowadays they tend to do a good
job outdoors especially in direct
sunlight and this is amongst those
phones that you really don't have to
worry about taking this outside it gets
plenty bright and something that I'm
very happy to report is that the mirror
black version of this phone isn't as
slippery as I would have expected I
definitely would have thought that this
phone would have given me a lot of
issues in terms of walking around with
him being scared that I drop it but it
feels pretty safe in the hands to be
honest so I'm liking that a lot
definitely thought I would have needed
to throw a case on this guy like I did
with the galaxy s 9 but I feel actually
pretty confident with it ok guys so
right now you're seeing footage from the
front-facing camera of the 1 plus 6 so
this is the image quality as well as
audio quality that you could come to
expect my only issue right here with
this camera right now is the exposure is
a little bit off for me
this would be the ideal exposure right
here a cloud stay intact my face is
still pretty intact but as you can see
it shifts and those clouds just kind of
go away and I can kind of appreciate
that it's doing that because it's trying
to keep my face nice and lit but it
turns overexposed in order to do that it
doesn't need to do it but I can
appreciate it trying since I do have a
darker face then it's probably used to
seeing but I wish you wouldn't do it I'm
all were out here guys we're gonna try
out this rear camera see what kind of
quality we can get from taking shots
outdoors I've got my little jar of M&amp;amp;Ms
here with the UAC colors so we'll see
how that does DoubleTap the power button
to jump into the camera which is so fast
I love that but let's take a shot here a
nice clean photo and one thing that I
really like is that there's portrait
mode now so I can tap that and get a
shot here as well and we'll try this out
as well and see how that does okay now
this looks like a pretty clean image not
super sharp but there's still more than
enough detail here now this isn't an
easy subject because it's clear so this
is pretty blurred out so you're not
gonna see a really good effect here this
doesn't look that hot but I might have
given it too hard of a job with this
clear bottle one side is completely in
focus while the other side is completely
blurred out but we'll give it another
subject and see if it does any better
all right so it's not the shot at this
little flower not bad looks like the
petals themselves are what's in focus
everything else is pretty blurred out
this is solid I would have I wouldn't be
upset with this photo at all so this is
pretty good alright guys so it's 557
right now and we've got about 51%
battery left and just to give you an
idea of the screen on time let's see
what we've got
alright two hours and three minutes so
of course you know we were using it a
bunch for doing camera tests and stuff
like that but 61% left after two hours
I'm not complaining so I'm sure this has
a lot more to go especially since we're
not going to be recording a bunch of
stuff later on alright guys so right now
we're waiting to get into top so I
figured out to play some games in the
meantime so right now I'm playing
injustice 2 and this thing is smooth man
of course that makes sense because it's
running a snapdragon 845 processor look
at this no dropped frames things
handling like a champ Superman
kicking my butt oh snap now there is a
feature called gaming mode with the 1
plus 6 that offers a few features that
can pretty much enhance your gaming
experience or at least allow you to game
without being interrupted so one of them
being answer calls via speaker so if
you've got an incoming call you don't
have to hurry up and put it to your ear
while you're playing your game it'll
answer it and speaker mode so that you
can just speak to the person without
jumping out of your game and it can
block notifications so that if you want
to keep gaming without interruptions it
can do that and there's like some
battery saving options as well and
there's also something called network
boost which limits other apps from using
data so that you can make sure all your
resources are going towards that game
that you're playing which is pretty good
if you're putting something that's
online you don't want to have your
resources eaten up and going to other
apps when you're playing against other
people ok guys so we're in tops we're in
a pretty dim area so it's the perfect
time to take a low-light picture we got
some nachos right here so we're
definitely got to get a shot of that so
let's see here pull this out yeah
and that's that's a clean image right
there even in these really dark areas
you're not seeing a lot of noise so I
gotta say I'm pretty impressed with the
1 plus 6 and taking some really good
shots so far low-light there's some
exposure issues we saw with the
front-facing camera but it's all good it
takes some really great photos
especially with the rear camera alright
guys so it's much later in the day like
10 55 watts in the game game 7 Houston
vs. Golden State but I'm using the
YouTube TV app and I've been watching
this for a while now let's see what the
batteries at 26% at the end of the day
let's see how much screen on time we had
so 4 hours and 8 minutes of screen on
time very impressive I can probably get
5 hours with what's left so just like I
saw with the 1 + 5 t this is definitely
gonna give us really good battery life
so battery life here definitely a good
thing alright guys so it is 12:30 5:00
in the morning I've been literally on
this phone for the past hour or so and
I've got 7% left and I'm pretty much
calling it quits I'm tired I got some
meetings in the morning but just to let
you know where we are with battery let's
see 5 hours and 20 minutes so I've been
playing sonic forces a buttload of
Instagram today I put this phone through
its paces lots of photos lots of gaming
watching videos social media all the
stuff that you could typically expect
even using it for GPS and this thing has
done a phenomenal job in terms of
battery like I expected so I'm very
happy with what I saw in the real day in
their life today but any features that I
didn't touch on throughout this day I'll
talk about in the wrap-up and that was
our day now I gotta say guys I walked
away from my time with one plus 6 very
impressed especially considering that
this phone lives in the five hundred
dollar price range with its overall
design being very similar to what we saw
in previous generations upgrading to a
one plus six is going to feel very
familiar if you're already coming from
something down the line it does have a
new shape to the fingerprint scanner but
it's still fast and reliable and works
the same way so it doesn't really matter
one thing that I do like is that they
brought back that face unlock feature
that works very very quickly but it's
all up to personal preference on which
one you want to use to actually protect
your phone but both options are very
quick so I like that now one of the more
immediate changes that we've seen with
the overall body of this phone is of
course the knotch now I'm gonna say it
here
I hate notches I hate that they exist
but at least one pluses doesn't really
get in the way of the overall user
experience and if you don't like it you
can even turn it off but what this
generation oneplus does have some new
colors and I got to say I really like
what they're doing with their color
options here because they really do feel
unique compared to other color options
that we see from other manufacturers
very unique stuff which I can appreciate
like that silk white I think is nice how
you guys saw my first impressions of my
massive tech unboxing definitely like
that a new red is dope and mirror black
they're all pretty solid now I'm not
gonna lie this is a pretty big phone but
if you have any experience using bigger
phones like an iPhone 8 plus or maybe
even a Galaxy S 9 plus you're not gonna
have any issues here you guys saw during
my real day in the life that wasn't a
complaint of mine I was able to do
everything I needed to some texting and
you know just watching media all that
stuff was just fine now when it comes to
the performance of this phone you can
expect it to keep up with most of the
flagships out there right now since it
shares pretty much a lot of the same
specs it's running Android 8.1 with
oxygen OS which feels really close to
stock Android offers quite a bit more
options in terms of customization they
also throw in some gestures with the
newest version of this OS and I'm not
gonna lie to you guys I'm not really a
huge fan of the gestures here it felt
like it would take more effort to
actually learn them and use them then it
wants to just keep the navigation bar
the navigation bar hasn't been a problem
for me at all so I prefer to keep it
there than to devote the time to the
gestures honestly they just didn't seem
worth it to me that said though I'm glad
that they did include some gesture
options instead of just taking away the
navigation bar and forcing it on
everyone so you have that option if you
do really like gestures just not for me
now using it for media consumption is
kind of interesting I think this screen
is great colors are vibrant and even
though it's 1080p it still feels very
sharp but when watching videos one of
the biggest issues that I have with it
is the speaker placement and that single
speaker it just can be very
underwhelming honestly
probably the weakest part of the entire
phone that speaker is just not that
great
I do wish I know oneplus tries to keep
it down but I do wish they would include
some stereo speakers maybe we could get
that in the next version but chances are
that's not gonna happen but it would be
a really really nice addition now let's
talk about the camera I got to say I was
honestly very impressed with it
it's not going to dethrone something
like the pixel 2 but it is a very solid
camera especially considering its price
low light performance was actually very
solid I took it out to the last Apple
event which was pretty dark and between
that and my iPhone 10 I was honestly
liking the results that I got from the
oneplus 6 quite a bit more and that's
what I started using to tweet out my
photos during the live event and it does
have dual camera lenses so you can use
special effects like portrait mode and
the portrait mode was pretty decent I
would definitely be able to use it with
no problem if you're really hunting for
imperfections you will find them I was
able to find some with some of the shots
that I took now when it comes to that
selfie cam it did a pretty decent job I
found that it overexposed two
backgrounds quite a bit probably because
of my darker complexion it was trying to
compensate and you know bring up the
exposure but overall it just kind of
made the image seem a bit more dull and
just felt like there was some kind of
haze in my photo so not a fan of that
but some of the shots were pretty decent
not at this price you're gonna be
missing out on a couple of features you
shouldn't expect to get all the bells
and whistles that you would get from a
more expensive premium flagship device
some things that are missing are
wireless charging even though this has a
glass back it's sadly not seen here
you're also not gonna get official
waterproofing no expandable storage
which is kind of bizarre since it has
like the dual SIM card slot but no
expandable storage and you're also
missing out on a quad HD display but
that one I can forgive a little bit
because the display still does look good
and you still get amazing battery life
the phone has to put more pixels we
would probably see less battery life and
the battery life on this guy is amazing
absolutely worth the trade-off but keep
that in mind you're getting a lower
resolution phone it's still rocking the
same milliamp hours as the previous
device but I'm okay with that because it
just straight-up performs so I'm happy
with it does a really good job now can I
recommend this
phone absolutely being in the $500 price
range you're getting everything that you
could expect from a phone except for the
bells and whistles I mentioned but it
does everything that you needed to and
it does it pretty well it also has the
headphone jack so come on I like that
that's there but this is a solid body
guys I would absolutely recommend it
without batting an eyelash it's a great
phone but let me know what you guys
think of the oneplus six or do the
colors entice you is that probably
something that makes it seem really
worthwhile let me know what to comment
down below but hopefully you enjoyed
this video if you did be the cool guy or
girl that gives it a thumbs up I'll
catch you guys in the next one till then
it's your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
