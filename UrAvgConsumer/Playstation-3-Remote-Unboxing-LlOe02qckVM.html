want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
guys - drivers consumer I'm gonna do a
little unboxing for you guys of the sony
ps3 media and blu-ray discs remote
control
alright let's not waste any time let's
get right into it alright so I picked
this up so that I can use it with my ps3
and my Sony Playstation 3d display
unfortunately the 3d display did not
come with the remote control on its own
so I guess that Sony's way of getting us
to go buy this but it was only 20 bucks
at on amazon.com so didn't kill the
pockets or anything so alright let's
open this thing up a little tape here
now I'm service much to this this demon
jester ammo anyway so it's just a box
can I believe this TV works with them I
mean this room I believe this remote
works with other televisions as well and
I believe this manual here will give you
a list of codes so that you can sync it
to all of them yeah so it works with
either Playstation 3 your television a
Sony AV amplifier so it should work with
a bunch of Sony products and I know it
has some compatibility with some other
brands as well let's get this back
inside here alright and let's open this
thing up here we are and it comes with
two batteries okay and let me see it
okay Oh as soon as I pop the batteries
in it automatically begins to work
can't beat that um I guess there's not
much to it let me see if I can turn on
my ps3 from this so I just selected ps3
let's see about the power button nope
that turned off the display the ps3
well I'm not sure if I can turn on the
ps3 just yet with this I'll figure it
out um really that's all there is to it
so only a remote but I figured you guys
can see what's inside but you guys know
that the UM it does come with
compatibility for other televisions as
well as I've seen online I have you have
to try it myself but so this is a pretty
nice remote pretty decent side lots of
buttons I'm sure I'll have fun figuring
it all out and there you are alright
guys this has been a quick unboxing of
the ps3 media and blu-ray disc remote
control alright thanks for watching this
yabas consumer please feel free to rate
