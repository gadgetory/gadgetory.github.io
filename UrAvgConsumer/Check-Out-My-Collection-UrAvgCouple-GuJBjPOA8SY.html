the room is looking pretty spiffy I
think so but it sure looks pretty boss I
got a uh I got to finish setting it up
so that I can make a 2014 office tour
yeah that's gonna be awesome I know you
guys would like that alright guys and we
just picked up our favorite food at
Ecuadorian food yeah
so it's Saturday night we are just gonna
have a really nice peaceful night
probably watch a movie or something and
eat this food but we just realized we do
not have anything to drink at home or
even like Chinese water and stuff but
and not by Warner bottles to try and
like fill up our bottles with like the
filter but we Fred the float up so now
he has to go buy water from CVS if you
so silly buying bottled water you know I
mean yeah it does seem silly but it's
just at convenience you get to use of
the convenience yeah buying stuff like
that and then it becomes habitual what
you guys did you guys buy bottled water
or do jig tap water
some people feel really strongly about
like magic in tap I'm not one of those
people but some people feel like you
were strongly about drinking tap like
why waste your money yeah I I avoid tap
if I could what if I have some I'm like
dying I'll drink it yeah I feel like
thirsty yeah I'll drink the tap water
tap water like I feel like tap water
with ice feels different from tap water
without ice it feels cleaner it's weird
but what you guys did you guys drink do
you guys drink tap water or do you like
are you silly about the bottled water
let us know so right now we're in CVS
looking for something to drink I guess
wasn't reading mostly guess that's like
the one that we have near us at least is
24 hours so let me just love CBS like we
are always here at nighttime pick up
some last-minute things we used to love
it when we're in Philadelphia CVS was
the place to go I always liked some
funky music yeah so CVS was our spot
always got something from there I
actually do have a good one for two
dollars off of eight dollars worth of
candy now I don't think we want to do
that we want to step into that realm
that's good I am tasting some sour gummy
worms oh man don't don't tempt me

Morgan City of which I saw this I saw

whatever we're friends yeah so if you

let us know alright guys so now I'm back
home
Irish sleeping we finished eating we
were watching an old school movie um
what is it Ferris Bueller's Day Off or
something like that really old school
movie but I wanted to watch it so she's
passed out now I'm in my room doing some
video editing I got some boxing coming
out soon and it's of these guys these
Sony headphones so you guys have a sneak
peak here if you watch the vlog so you
get to see what's coming up on the
channel umm one interesting thing you
guys always ask me to make a video about
my Gundams but I really can't make a
video about the Gundams on the channel I
think a dedicated video about the
Gundams would just have everyone freaked
out bad enough some people don't like
the vlogs but I figure this is a good
spot for you guys to see all the my
collections so far I guess so I'm just
going to show you guys around some of
the Gundams that I do have this is the
double-o riser these are all master
grade versions so that's the size these
are all master grades and this guy back
here is a perfect grade that's why he's
like the biggest of them all so with the
different grades shows how you know
involved is how many pieces there are
the bigger the grade the more parts the
more detailed it is so this guy's
extremely detailed had a ton of parts so
I took a long time but anyway this is
double oh riser master grade this is the
star build Strike Gundam right here I
don't have his little accessories on him
to make him all shiny and whatnot
but that's him right there he's pretty
cool of course this is the Gundam a
stray perfect grade over here we've got
the death scythe some of you guys might
know him might be familiar with him if
you are an old-school Gundam fan from
back in the day Gundam Wing on Cartoon
Network that's where he's from he used
to be my favorite
this guy's also from Gundam Wing he's
doing zero this is death scythe wing
zero and he was actually the leader so
he's probably like the most popular and
this guy is a stray red frame just like
the perfect grade but this is the master
grade version he's a little smaller but
he has more um more weapons and stuff
like that so he's really cool and this
guy over here he is the double-o quanta
nice I'm gonna have some really nice
features like this one right here it has
a light an LED light built into the
chest so you can kind of see that it
lights up at night so you know it's got
a little something going on so I've got
them all around but I also have another
one sitting right here this is the Ale
Strike Gundam from Gundam destiny yeah
so I got to build him just haven't had
the time to yet but I'll get around to
it so that's my little collection as you
guys can see this is about all I'm
willing to sacrifice as far as space is
concerned so they're all right here I
can't fit another Gundam up here and I
have one on the desk I think that's okay
but I really don't know if I want to
build this guy anytime soon because I
don't know where I put him I would think
about putting him where these headphones
are but I don't want to give up my
headphone spot and put them all in one
little cluster over there I think this
is really cool so I'm not gonna do that
but yeah so hopefully that gave you guys
some insight into those guns I'll have
links down below in the description for
all of these if you're interested in
building them then they don't take that
long they take a little while to build
to get used to the instructions and
putting them together but it's not that
bad I enjoy it thus
having so many but I think it's really
cool if you want to you know do
something like get a hobby
pretty cool stuff to do but now I'm
going to get back to editing this video
I'm gonna have some videos ready for you
guys for the week let me know what you
guys think of the new schedule like it's
only been one week so far but let me
know what you think if you guys are
liking the videos that are coming out I
actually have a special video coming out
for you guys in the middle of next week
so stay tuned for that um definitely
good stuff you definitely enjoy that so
stay tuned for that and yeah
I also kind of get to a room tour video
it's been a while
you guys can pretty much see that not
too much has changed here um I got a new
tripod but this isn't this is it's
actually out for repair if I'm using an
old one but pretty much a quick scan of
the room shows you not too much has
changed but I can go over some of the
upgrades that I've gone through and yeah
so let me know if you guys are excited
to see that when it finally comes out I
almost forgot that I said I'd show you
guys this chair so this is it check it
out really really nice chair it's very
very comfortable it was only a hundred
bucks of staples so I forgot what it's
called I think it's called Osgood so
it's a Osgood black 99 bucks really
really good definitely worth it uh it's
very comfortable very soft my chair I
got from Ikea for like 40 bucks it was
terrible I mean it worked as a chair but
it was it got really squeaky really
quickly it made making videos a pain so
this is a nice nice chair hopefully it
doesn't turn squeaky or anything on me I
have to get some wd-40 on this but well
I'm not yet but if it happens I'll do
that because I really like the way the
chair feels overall so the squeak
happens I'll get some oil ready for good
stuff good stuff you guys should get
them alright guys so it's Sunday right
now but I've been doing work all day
and I have some stuff to get done myself
so probably look at the vlog here we'll
catch you guys in the next one hopefully
you enjoyed this one we didn't do
anything much this vlog but we'll see if
we do something exciting next week but
till then till the next video I'll catch
you guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
