consumer and today I'm going to be
giving you guys my review of the street
buy 50 wired on ear headphones so let's
not wasting any time
get right into it
this video was brought to you by H H
Greg so stay tuned to hear how to enter
their huge 48k giveaway with some
awesome prizes like a Samsung 65 inch 4k
UHD 3d smart TV all right guys here we
have the on-air version of the street
buy 50 the original street buy 50 has an
over ear design and is much larger than
the headphones you see here let's take a
look at SMS audios newest version of the
streets and see if they're right for you
taking a look at the street buy 50 you
can see that it closely resembles its
older brother but in a smaller more
compact body it also now features a very
welcome foldable design and the original
had no such thing which was one of the
biggest flaws it had considering its
size although I'm happy that the
headband is now foldable I was a little
disappointed by the joints they snapped
in place with no issue and didn't have
any issues staying in place but when I
extended them I did notice that they
jittered quite a bit with very little
movement which made them feel a bit less
solid but joint movement aside these are
overall a very solid pair of headphones
you come to expect the headphones by 50
to have great durability and these
thankfully don't disappoint these can
definitely handle any accidental bends
and twists and even intentional if
you're into that sort of thing the
headband while durable is also quite
comfortable it has a nice piece of
stitch padding in the middle and
although it doesn't cover the entire
inside of the headband I still found it
to be quite comfortable and speaking of
comfort I found the ear cups to be
equally pleasant to have on the cushions
are very comfortable and offer pretty
large padding for on ear headphones now
these are on ear headphones so you have
to remember that these will be pressing
against your ears rather than going
around it what I found different about
these ear cups though is that they
covered my ears completely while still
being directly on them this is due to
their oval fit design and this
contributes greatly to the passive noise
cancelling that these offer these
headphones come with a detachable tangle
free cable that features an inline
remote and the inline remote has a
single button for playing pause and the
ability to answer an end phone calls
there are no volume controls for Apple
devices but this doesn't really impact
Android devices as most of the volume
controls aren't supported anyway you
also get a hardshell travel case when
you purchase these headphones and they
are pretty small in size and come in
oval shape they definitely offer good
protection for your headphones from
Falls or any other impact and are pretty
helpful when you want to just throw
these in your bag I must say though I
would have liked to see a pouch to hold
any cables or accessories you might
bring along with you and now to talk a
bit about the sound quality these
headphones offer enhanced bass which I'm
always a fan of but it isn't
overwhelming so for those of you who
aren't into that kind of thing
you don't have to worry about your
vocals or instruments being drowned out
I don't think these particularly shine
in the clarity department but my music
did come in through them pretty clearly
I would say that these excel and genres
like hip hop electronic rap dubstep even
pop but they aren't limited to just
those so the average consumer these will
definitely perform well and I'm pretty
happy with the overall performance of
these headphones overall guys I was
pretty happy with these they're low
profile durable design and good sound
quality added up to be a very solid pair
of headphones I do wish the hinges felt
a little bit more secure when extended
but that's about the only real flaw I
can think of and of course now I have to
show you guys what they look like on but
before we do that I want to let you guys
know about the huge 48k giveaway that
ath greg is throwing right now till
january 28th check the links down below
for your chance to win a huge Samsung 65
inch 4k UHD 3d smart TV that's a

love giveaway so I hope you guys all
take advantage of this and of course
it's time to show you guys what it looks
like on so here we have it
and here you go so as you guys can see
it's a pretty regular fit I find these
very comfortable as I said in the review
they cover the ears completely so it's a
nice on-ear feeling so here you have it
now I do think that in person it looks a
little off because of my head shape my
head shape is kind of round oh and it
has a longer shape to it it's not really
round it's a longer shape so it does
look a little funny on me in my opinion
but overall it isn't a bad pair of
headphones I think most regular head
shapes would be just fine with it and
that's about it for this review guys and
