consumer and today we've got a special
unboxing of the brand new iPhone 8 plus
Projekt RED edition now everyone who's
seen this on the internet has been going
nuts because you'll see it in a second
and for those of you not familiar with
product red edition products a portion
of your purchase goes towards the global
fund which actually does research and
testing for AIDS and HIV so that is a
great cause Apple has been carrying
product recognition products for quite
some time now in the form of cases Beats
accessories and even the iPhone 7 last
year but you guys came for an unboxing
so let's see what's inside of this thing
and with the product rendition you got
the little red tab right here so once
you pull this out oh there goes this
baby but you get this paperwork with a
red little pamphlet of course detailing
the information about product red in the
back you got your Quick Start Guide as
well more information and of course some
stickers but of course you got your
standard stuff like your wall adapter
your ear pods and of course your
lightning cable now nothing really new
there but this guy right here the red
iPhone 8 plus with some dirt on it but
yeah this is it and I I gotta say guys
this thing looks clean
so of course you got that like matte
brushed finish on the side so you've got
that aluminum finish on the sides you
also got the glass back so it's got
actually pretty interesting contrast
between the side frames and the glass
back now everyone's going crazy about
what this new model is the fact that it
has a black front when they came out
with the red iPhone 7 I had the white
front which everyone wasn't too crazy
about you knows black and red that's the
thing that's the combination that
everyone likes and I gotta say this is
like really red look at it in comparison
to my sweater this thing's really red
now of course this is an iPhone 8 plus
so you get all the standard stuff that
you'd come to expect
you got your dual cameras in the back
you got the bigger design
you got that touch ID in the front so
you got that home button with touch ID
which is so nice I kind of miss it and
it's also got the iPhone product red
logo
right there at the bottom which is the
nice touch I do like that it's a silver
Apple logo at the back so that looks
pretty good I think it's a really nice
color combination here but overall guys
it's an iPhone 8 plus that's red but I
do have something else they also came
out with a product red folio case made
out of leather and that's this guy right
here but this was made for the iPhone 10
looks actually looks pretty good so if
you feel like you want to contribute to
the cause but you don't want to buy a
whole new phone you can definitely do
that with the cases Apple offers quite a
few outside of this little red folio
case they also have the silicone and
regular leather so they've got a few
options and it's also nice if you just
want a straight-up red case and just so
you guys can see how it stacks up
against all the other color options here
we have it all laid out we've got the
Space Gray product red silver and of
course the rose gold so if you're on the
market for a new phone and the iPhone 8
+ catch your eye because it has that
touch ID or the similar body to what
they used to have here you go you got a
good option right here but hopefully you
guys enjoyed this video huge shout out
to Apple and all the other companies who
make product red Edition items so that
they can contribute to the global fund I
think it's a great cause but what do you
guys think of the new product red
iPhones let me know what's coming down
below hopefully you enjoyed it and if
you did be the cool guy girl that gives
video a thumbs up I'll catch you guys in
the next one
till then is your average consumer taste</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
