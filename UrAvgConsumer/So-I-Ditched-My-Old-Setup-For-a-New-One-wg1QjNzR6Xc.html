going on guys the average consumer right
and if you know me you know I tend to
bring around a lot of stuff in my
backpack and Intel actually challenged
me to leave behind my laptop tablet
combo and give this HP Pavilion x360 a
try which is a two on one with the
latest eighth generation Core i7
processor and with that new chip that
promises to deliver better performance
which means jumping into my programs
really quickly even game a little bit
and video and photo edit without a
problem so of course that means leaving
my current laptop and tablet behind and
seeing how this thing performs and with
this whole idea the thing that I'm gonna
be looking for the most is how fast
everything goes because we're talking
about the processor alright guys so it's
happening I'm gonna get rid of my laptop
oh and my tablet both of these guys are
getting traded out but this guy right
here this is the HP Pavilion x360 and
this is a two and one it's a laptop and
of course I can bring the screen all the
way back and turn it into a tablet so
this is why I'm going to be swapping
them out and this is gonna be a pretty
interesting move I haven't extensively
used to in ones before so replacing both
my laptop and my tablet is going to be a
big deal for me but I'm pretty confident
this thing has some pretty decent specs
and the interesting thing with this guy
is that it has an Intel eighth
generation Core i7 processor with
obtained memory and for my folks out
there who don't know what obtain memory
is it's pretty much Intel smart memory
that allows the computer to learn your
favorite apps files all that kind of
stuff and gives it the ability to launch
them a lot more quickly
so pretty much things like big game
files editing software that kind of
stuff you'll be able to jump into a lot
more quickly rather than sitting around
and waiting and waiting for it to load
up the octane memory should help it to
be a lot faster but now I got to spend a
lot more time with this thing I'm gonna
be working from it all day and we're
gonna see how it does alright guys so
I've been working on this thing for a
little bit now and even playing a little
bit on the side but one thing I will say
it is super snappy so I have
a lot of tabs open and that's something
that is pretty important to me being
able to have a bunch of tabs while I'm
working that's how I am on my desktop
and being able to have that same
experience on this two-on-one it
actually makes me feel a lot more
comfortable going into this whole
challenge having this thing for a while
so being able to do that is awesome I've
even been able to jump into my games
quite a bit so I got my games open over
here and honestly it is just super
snappy jumping between the two I've got
a lot of stuff open here and I'm glad to
see that it's not bogging down
especially with chrome Chrome with a
bunch of tabs you know what it can do to
a computer so I'm definitely seeing the
benefits of that a gen processor being
able to jump into different programs and
tabs really quickly I love it even if
there's a lot of them going on so it's
good stuff but one thing though guys I
do have this stylus that goes with this
Troon one I really like when a stylus
can just sit somewhere on a you know
laptop or something because then I don't
have to worry about placing it anywhere
but this one doesn't really have that so
that kind of sucks but when it comes to
actually using it it's kind of cool I
don't think when I'm in laptop mode it's
something I always reach for most likely
when I have it in its tablet mode that's
when it's gonna be a bit more beneficial
me personally I don't like putting my
finger prints on the screen even if it
is a touchscreen putting my fingerprint
on it just kind of I don't know that
isn't sit well with me so I like using a
stylus for those situations so I was
using it for a little bit and
performance was actually really good I
was able to do all my scripting and
emailing and all that kind of stuff with
no problem of course but what really
surprised me was how well everything
worked even though I had a bunch of
programs open
I even had a game running in the back
and I couldn't notice any slowdowns
which is really surprising and the more
I got used to using it the more I kind
of saw the benefits of having that
laptop power and even a tablet form and
honestly guys one of my main reasons for
even having a tablet it's a wasum videos
before I go to bed right now I'm
watching my buddy awesome evidence video
some of the ones that I missed on his
channel and it's actually really nice
it's got a really good display it's
1080p and you can see right here there's
a lot of nice colors it's vibrant it's
got a lot of pop to it I can definitely
get used to having this thing
better with me and Stan load especially
since I can prop it up and have it at
the angle that I want and if I don't
want it to take up too much space I
could even do it like this
and I could just prop it up against my
headboard so like this this is a good
look it's a good quality display so I
can't complain and the speakers are
actually pretty good too
they're from banging all of since so
they sound pretty decent definitely
great for media consumption now guys I
know this is a revolutionary or anything
but for me this is pretty cool where I'm
able to actually go ahead and edit some
photos for Instagram while eating a bowl
of cereal I know I'm not the first guy
to eat some cereal and edit a picture
for Instagram at the same time but for
me this is just really cool now I'm glad
I can do this because I'm in tablet mode
right now so I don't have to worry about
taking a bite that was a good bite and
this situation is pretty cool because I
can do my work and eat and not worry
about milk splashing onto the keyboard
or anything like that or even have to
worry about touching left on the screen
with my hands because I got my stylus
and like I said this is the best way I
think you can use the stylus when it's
in tablet mode so I can go ahead and
make all of my changes here and it
actually responds so quickly you can see
all the changes happen instantly so this
thing doesn't get bogged down and this
is a pretty large file this is a raw
file that I'm working with right now so
I really feel like it's these kind of
situations that you don't really think
of that make having a two in one kind of
special compared to just a regular
tablet or a laptop tablet wouldn't have
the specs of this guy and a laptop would
just be a little bit scarier to work
with this is pretty cool
and using this thing to photo edit was
cool even with RAW files which can
definitely be a drag on certain
computers if they're not good enough
those FRA files are massive sometimes so
being able to do that fluidly here was
really nice and this is where I felt
like the challenge kicked in a little
bit because I didn't have access to my
hardcore video editing apps but I did
mess around with Adobe Premiere and some
4k footage and it didn't seem to slow
down the machine at all so that's
definitely a good sign but in terms of
other day-to-day activities like just
traveling this thing was actually really
nice so right now I'm actually an uber
I'm on my way to my house I have a
couple of meetings but a few contractors
but I'm only going to be bringing my two
on one with me
it's gonna be the only device I'm gonna
do work from so I'm pretty confident
that this is gonna do well because I've
been using it for a little while and
it's been holding up pretty well so I'm
actually feel like I'm in a safe place
where I can take this get everything I
need to get done on it and pretty much
be okay with it being the only device I
have in my backpack all right so I'm in
the house now I pretty much got my work
done in the uber so now I'm just waiting
for the contractor to get here for our
meeting and honestly it's like the
perfect time for me to just play some
games and this is why I like having
intel's octane memory i can just kind of
throw up a game really quickly and start
it before somebody gets here kind of get
a quick gaming session in and kind of
like I said before the octane memory is
really good when it comes to opening up
a large library dealing with like really
large video files and even playing some
games opening up some really large games
and the whole idea behind that for some
of you who might not get it it pretty
much is supposed to make a standard hard
drive kind of act like it's an SSD
supposed to give you those quicker
speeds so even though you've got a
standard hard drive with a larger
capacity you're not gonna miss out on
those SSD speeds that's the whole idea
behind Intel octane memory kind of make
those regular hard drives give you a bit
better speed so that you can kind of do
what you need to do really quickly so if
this guy pops in I'll already have
gotten a gaming session in and then I
can go on with my meeting and having
this thing is my only device kind of
opened my eyes to how much grounds a
solid swim one could actually cover even
though I didn't have access to some of
my favorite apps from other operating
systems if you're gonna be putting all
of your faith into one device you're
gonna want it to be good for work media
consumption and even gaming if you're
into it but overall I was pretty
impressed with the HP pavilion and
Intel's eighth generation processor
looking at it on paper I wasn't really
sure what to expect I feel like this is
the kind of device that gives you enough
power to do a bit more than you would
expect with a normal laptop which gives
you some room to grow and keeps to get
more demanding needs as time goes on
like I said very snappy very fluid was
able to multitask with no problem and I
think a lot of that is possible thanks
to the eighth generation processor and
that obtained memory now he's got an old
computer and you do for an upgrade this
is definitely a solid option but if it's
one one isn't really your style of
course the eighth generation processor
going to be throughout a ton of
different devices so you want to keep
your eyes out for that and I really
think that's what you want to look for
when you're buying a new laptop or
something so you can at least
future-proof yourself so you'll be able
to do all the kind of tasks that you saw
me do and then some in the future but
that about wraps up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy girl that give this video a
thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in the
next one so then it's your average
consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
