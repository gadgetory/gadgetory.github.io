and today we're gonna be checking out an
awesome laptop this guy right here is
the msi gs70 5 stealth and I've had this
laptop for a while now and I feel pretty
confident about being able to tell you
guys what's good and bad about it and
doesn't start off with the overall looks
of this guy this is a 17 inch display
but what that means is that this is a
bigger laptop than normal but because of
its slim form factor it doesn't make it
any harder to travel around with it I'm
actually able to throw it into my
backpack with no problem so if I just
open this guy up BAM
fits in no big deal and that's one thing
that I really like about this thing even
though it's a gaming laptop is 17 inches
it still has a really nice form factor
especially when you see how thin it is
now I'm not gonna stay here and bore you
guys with the specs I won't throw up my
configuration over here so you guys can
know what I'm working with
but the biggest takeaway is that this
thing is packing in videos latest r-tx
graphics cards mine happens to have the
2080 max-q version so lots of power here
lots of graphical power but let me show
you guys how that translates into real
world gaming alright guys so I'm firing
up Apex Legends trying to get into a
match right now
now I played this game a lot on the Xbox
one and I will say guys having a faster
display with a higher refresh rate and
of course with a graphics card like this
one you can actually see quite a bit of
a difference when you're actually
playing the game like right off the bat
this immediately looks a lot smoother
just from a visual standpoint and what's
awesome about this display guys even
though it's only a 1080p display
everything still looks really good it's
an IPS panel like I said it has the 144
Hertz refresh rates or everything looks
buttery smooth and it's got a three
millisecond response time and basically
for all the folks would have no idea
what that means if you're a pro this
thing is going to respond well or if you
plan on becoming a pro you don't have to
worry this thing is going to be able to
keep up with your inputs as you play the
game
alright Malcolm you play on the ps4
right do you see a difference in the way
in the movements on the screen be honest
yeah there's a difference right yeah see
it for yourself and honestly that's how
I felt after coming from the Xbox for so
long I played a lot of matches on xbox
but once I got this going I was like oh
yeah that's why all these PC guys go
nuts
oh are you kidding me how did I oh wow
my poor teammates all died oh the rack
so you guys have an idea of the frame
rates that we're working with I'm
playing on high settings for apex
legends and we're sitting out like 136
normally it hovers around the hundred
range even to 90s I've seen it dip down
to right now we're at like 120 so you
get a really clean smooth experience hmm
got them yeah what's up buddy
boom okay okay that's enough we can't go
too crazy here but you guys saw me in
action this thing is a beast when it
comes to playing of course I was playing
on an Xbox one controller that's what
I'm used to I haven't quite mastered the
keyboard and mouse feel yet but let's
actually talk about the keyboard and
this is actually a pretty nice keyboard
if a full keyboard it has a number pad
over here on the right since this is of
course a 17 inch laptop one thing to
keep in mind is that the Windows key is
over here on the right instead of on the
left so that's something that takes some
getting used to the only other thing
that I'm not super crazy about it are
the arrow keys how they're like jams in
the middle between the actual keyboard
and the number pad so that also takes
some getting used to but when it comes
to actually typing on the keyboard it's
pretty nice it gives you a lot of travel
this isn't a mechanical keyboard or
anything like that so this is pretty
much something that I think most people
will be familiar with if they aren't
coming from a regular mechanical
keyboard on a PC okay 100% accuracy 61
words so typing on this thing like I
said cakewalk but the layout is the only
thing that you kind of have to get used
to one thing that's also a really nice
is that it now has a much larger
trackpad and this is like a glass
trackpad it feels really nice and
comfortable it's precise so definitely
nope
complaint but if you're used to using a
smaller trackpad well get over it this
is a nice one right here and it's a much
larger now of course this is a gaming
laptop but not only can it game really
well but if you're into creative work
you can use things like the Adobe suite
for video editing and trust me we really
push this thing we were able to at an 8k
footage on it so if you're into regular
4k or maybe 1080p this thing should
handle it like a champ and if you're
into visual effects maybe you want to do
some After Effects work this thing also
handled that pretty well of course
thanks to all that power under the hood
now something I'm not too crazy about
with this laptop are the speakers the
speakers to me have just been pretty
mediocre but if you do plan to plug in
some headphones or maybe a gaming
headset this thing is certified for high
res audio now when it comes to like the
i/o and all the ports this thing is
packing quite a bit we've got like three
USB 3.0 ports you've got a micro SD card
slot and that would have been it would
have been better if it was just a
regular SD card slot but I'm okay with
micro sd and you've also got a
Thunderbolt port Thunderbolt 3 which is
great because that opens up the door to
a lot of new accessories you've also got
a regular USB type-c port HDMI and the
power port is over here on the left side
now which is an improvement because the
previous generation that I used to use
all the time had it on the right side
which kind of got in the way with the
mouse so having it over on the left is
better although in the back would have
been ideal now we talked about how great
this thing looks but one thing that I
have to mention is that the aluminum
chassis that this thing is made out of
is quite the fingerprint magnet and take
a look guys fingerprints galore same
goes for the inside you're gonna get all
of those same fingerprints as well so
that's something you want to keep in
mind although that's definitely not a
deal-breaker but a slight annoyance and
when it comes to battery life I'd say
that this is pretty decent
you probably get around like four hours
I think it's rated for maybe like eight
or so but four hours was the more
realistic number that I've gotten out of
it but overall I think that this thing
is an awesome package and it's one of my
favourite laptops I've ever used you get
things like the RT X 2080 graphics card
the biggest thing with RT x graphics
cards is not only do they perform well
but they allow for ray tracing basically
what that means
you're gonna get a little bit more
detail when it comes to like reflections
when it comes to water and stuff when
you're playing games you just get a
little bit more detailed that makes a
huge difference and I honestly think it
is worth the investment now when it
comes to the price of this guy this is a
premium laptop but if you're looking for
something that is high-end solid
performer that will last you a long time
I definitely think that this is
something worth looking into I've been
extremely happy with it and it's
probably gonna be the laptop that I
carry around in my backpack for a long
time
but I think that about wraps it for this
video guys I of course have it linked
down below in the description if you
guys want to check it out but the msi
gs70 5 stealth I think is completely
worth the investment if you're looking
for a good gaming laptop this is one you
want to check out until next video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy girl that gives this video
a thumbs up I'll catch you guys in the
next one
so then is your average consumer piece
time to get back on this apex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
