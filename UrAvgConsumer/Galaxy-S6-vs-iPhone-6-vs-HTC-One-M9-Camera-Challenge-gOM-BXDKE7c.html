average consumer and today we're going
to be testing the cameras of the iPhone
6 galaxy s6 and the HTC One m9 so I've
got my buddies Austin and John and we're
going to take the phones outside and put
them to the test
so let's not waste any time let's get
right into it ok so I'm first up and I
have the iPhone 6 so I've been using an
iPhone for about six months or so by
using the six plus so let's get the six
to try first of all this looks really
cool so one of the things I like about
the iPhone is it's super easy to get
into the camera app like seriously I can
lock the phone unlock it
swipe off and the camera app so it's
actually it's really nice to to make
sure you don't miss that moment oh yeah
looks nice alright so I'm going to be
using the galaxy s6 now can't Samsung
has always been pretty good with their
cameras
a little bit sharp but I've always been
a fan of it so I'm going to go see how
it works out in the field so the s6 has
a 16 megapixel camera like I said
samsung has usually has tons of features
on their cameras I found a couple that I
like myself
to test it out yeah
pretty wide what'd you just do take a
selfie yeah so this is actually the
lowest megapixel phone in the entire
comparison as this is 8 megapixels
versus 16 and 20 with even though it
might on paper only have like 8
megapixels the images are really nice
and to be totally honest how often do
you you know print a 20 megapixel
picture right like you're probably not
you're gonna be looking at it on your
phone on your desktop something like
that so feel like the lack of like crazy
megapixels really actually doesn't
matter in the real world I think this
looks like a pretty good spot for photos
there's a cool little feature where you
can actually rack focus now that means
you can actually control the focus using
a slider so you want to jump into the
pro section of the camera and then with
that you get a ton of manual controls
for someone who's familiar with using a
camera this is actually pretty awesome
use this little slider and I can control
where the focus goes with this so for
this shot if I really want to just get
this edge right here put it right there
and snap this looks like a good photo
focus is nice and you focus is pretty
quick mmm
the shot solid autofocus pretty quick in
that environment now while I do like
Samsung's cameras they usually provide
really vibrant shots the only thing is
sometimes it can be really saturated so
the colors might look a little fake if
you're looking for something more
natural but there are controls here so
you can kind of mess with that if you
want to go for that more natural look
one of the things I found with a lot of
phones is that it's really difficult to
actually get like any kind of reasonable
dynamic range without having to go to
HDR so let's see what we can do with and
without HDR right now so it's not a
crazy contrast situation but let's see
here so this is the non HDR this is with
HDR you know what that's actually not
bad I don't see a huge difference at all
good job
so let's see if we can get anything cool
here I'll drop down a bit and down nice
I'll camera play baseball nope
so this will be interesting to see how
much detail we can get looks like it's a
little underexposed
sweet
Wow that is a tree right there all right
we gotta get to like some pro level
shots right now so auto-exposure is
pretty good but it's not quite right but
luckily I can just grab this little
slider and do the adjustments I need and
snap boom pretty good okay Matt count us
down 3 2 1 walk we all go up to the tree
guys everyone has to go get like a macro
shot of the tree entry alright guys so
now we've got all the photos on the
laptop let's check them out
alright so here's the first shot of the
gs6
one detail yeah definitely a little
blown out insta sharp everywhere yeah
the depth of field is nice so it falls
off pretty naturally yeah it doesn't
look like it's just a straight yeah yeah
you can see like it's a little sketchy
up in here like that yeah it looks a
little like Anna but I mean clearing it
the phone you don't want sketchy follow
I don't know push not come to the iPhone
ah first of all white bounces way off
yeah
the way that's really good um I mean
we've got very bit of detail but I mean
this is what 8 megapixels it's not gonna
be yeah okay that's not even gonna come
close yeah I mean it's fine but you're
definitely not getting anywhere near the
same resolution and if you try to zoom
in like I think from normal use apply
I'm gonna notice it you try to like zoom
in and it falls apart pretty quickly
yeah you've got a lot more detail just a
little scrub some of the m9 stuff this
is kind of where it falls apart and
bright situations oh that's yeah dude
what is that colour the dynamic range is
really bad here you're losing the
highlights even the walls are pretty it
just it looks like the colour is look I
only know I gotta put my finger on that
like the color which is like washed out
and
just hey look at that the fence is there
like look there's no detail there what
look look at this at all this is a 2006
full sensor there's no detail here
whatsoever almost like a Photoshop like
painting filter yeah it looks like an
oil painting yeah dude this is terrible
what is this yeah this is really bad
alright so this is us walking towards
the tree with the s6 it's like jello
yeah look like the whole thing it looks
like it's like a 3d thing that someone
just like shit yeah work that chips out
here yeah obviously look everything's
just like pulling back the corners are
terrible I don't ever want to see the m9
I would actually forget actually does
the autofocus is nice though it was
there was a nice smooth transition up
the tree oh that oh this is with the
iPhone 6 which only has 1080p right so
the others have 4k options because those
like things like stabilization or
different options like you know visual
stabilization definitely got a little
bit of the same thing not as extreme
it's nowhere near extreme but you can
see like a little bits of like jitter
yeah yeah all the slides that'll doing
okay I was good pretty well too that was
it was a little I saw like hit a couple
steps though wasn't quite smooth I don't
think yeah I didn't notice that the s6
focusing a nine-time okay first let's
weigh hundreds but Wow yeah everything
Woolery there's not the detail
there's no no this is this is 1080p we
just watched two other two I just think
you have a hard time focusing no I'm not
focusing on the other thing right now oh
wow look at that
that's trouble oh wow look look over its
long man that is that is disappointing
all right so what do you guys think I
can down my losses I 9 is definitely out
a simple the iPhone 6 and galaxy s6 kill
there 9 yeah but what do you guys like
between the iPhone and the galaxy s6
like let's talk about pictures first I
think if you need that extra detail and
crop yeah the s6 is nice protective
extra megapixels hmm and if you want
like that instant satisfaction of that's
gonna look really good
well now as soon as you finish taking
the picture right it might be better to
work with after right you bring it in
yeah right use it editor I feel like the
galaxy s6 like right out of the camera
it's pushed to the extreme right like
saturation stuff it's already cranked up
quite a bit
where's the iPhone it might be a little
bit more conservative but that means
that you had a little bit more freedom
to make those changes that you actually
want to kind of to fine-tune the photo
so I think if you don't want to do a lot
of work you can go with the s6 yeah if
you have more fun and you like photo
editing yeah if you want actually like
get in there and tweak it uh what do you
think about the video though I think
that I don't think I don't know that
fish in there I think that warp kind of
took me off so yeah my vote goes to
iPhone - yeah plus saying you have super
slow to 40 fps right yeah and we
actually Joe as a video app and the
galaxy s6 does 120 and they'll just play
it at half speed which looks 15 yes
right it's just it's it's half as fast
if you guys want to check that out I
have a link to Austin's video down below
in the description alright guys so that
pretty much wraps it up um definitely be
sure to follow Austin and John I have
their channel links down below in the
description check out the videos that we
worked on everything will be down below
in the description so thanks a lot guys
