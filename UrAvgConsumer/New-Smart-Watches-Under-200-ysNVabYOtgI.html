smartwatches with where OS under 200
bucks with mom voice tick watch E 2 and
s 2 and of course big shout-out to my
boy for sending these for us to check
out and partnering with us on today's
video
now the boxes include the same things
you get your user manual their USB
charging docks and of course the watches
now these have technology built into
them geared towards fitness and that's
called tick motion so if you haven't
haven't made a certain resolution at the
start of the year these might be helpful
now what makes these watches different
is pretty much their design and of
course the price the s2 is $20 more than
the e2 and it's made with military-grade
casing so if you're someone who loves
outdoor activities like skiing mountain
climbing that kind of thing this is the
one you're gonna want to pay attention
to and since it's a lot more durable but
let's take a closer look at these guys
and check out some of their features
alright guys so right here we've got the
tip watch e 2 and this one is the s2 and
they're pretty similar they have a very
similar design but like I said the s2
has a bit of a different face and it has
that military grade casing but let's
talk about the actual displays now these
are both OLED displays which has a lot
of great benefits one it looks really
good and two that's gonna help out with
the battery life and the battery life on
these guys it's actually pretty crazy
you get about 48 hours of usage so you
get about two full days of using it on a
single charge which is very different
from the typical one day that we usually
get with smartwatches what do you have
to charge it every night these guys you
get to now of course with this being a
wear OS watch you can of course just tap
it and customize the face of the display
so you got a bunch of options here oh
it's nicest you can also use the wear OS
app jump in and you can get even more
faces you get a lot of options whatever
matches your style let's say this one's
machinery and electronics and as soon as
you tap it
it pretty much comes over to the watch
itself so it's pretty instant this one's
also kind of nice because of the color
obviously you guys know I'm crazy about
that now for those of you curious about
how we're OS interact with your phone
you can actually see how you navigate it
at the top of course give you access to
settings but when it comes to your phone
you can swipe left and you have access
to notifications you have Google now so
you can see all kinds of information
about your day places nearby how to get
home or things like that so you got
access to a lot of cool things where iOS
one thing that I really do like is that
you can call out to Google so you think
and ask it questions you gotta remember
this is called where OS not Android wear
anymore so that means it can work with
both iOS and Android and of course you
can get some of the apps that are on
your phone right on the watch all you do
is hit that little side button and in
here you have access to those compatible
apps so you can download those apps have
access to them here just like we would
see with any other SmartWatch now
something I like about these watches is
that they automatically detect when
you're being active that's that tick
motion technology I mentioned earlier
and I was able to see this thing in
action firsthand I just ran over to
another building to grab a couple of
things to bring back over here and when
I was running it automatically detected
that I was running and being active it
gave me a little vibrate and then I
started pop-up and it says auto run so
it automatically started detecting how
long I was running for the calories that
I was burning the distance is able to
track all of that without me having to
press any apps or tap into anything
which i think is really cool if you
happen to go on a spontaneous run or
something maybe you are a frequent
jogger this thing will track all of that
activity and if it's something that was
as miniscule as what I just did you
could go in and delete that activity if
you don't want it to count towards your
overall activity for the day
or you can keep it and I like having
that functionality not to mention these
watches are waterproof up to 50 meters
and besides running auto detection tick
motion also detects your swim style from
freestyle to butterfly and breaststroke
these watches can record some pretty
detailed swimming data and that pretty
much wraps up for this video guys
just wanted to do a quick unboxing to
show you guys what was inside talk about
some of the cool features on the sky and
if you guys are interested in a full
blown review maybe a really put it
through its paces let me know what's a
comment down below if you want to see a
full review but for now I think it's
cool to see where OS watch is coming
back it's nice because they're
compatible with both Android and iOS so
no matter what phone you're using you're
still able to use one of these but
that's about it for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that gives the
video a thumbs up I'll of course have
these linked down below in the
description if you guys want to learn
more but total x1 is your average
consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
