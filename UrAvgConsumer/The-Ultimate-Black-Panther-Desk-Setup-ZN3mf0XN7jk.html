consumer and as you can tell by the
title we've got another theme set up
this one inspired by Black Panther and
Disney reached out to sponsor a Black
Panther themed video on the channel so
that got my mind thinking let's do a
clean set up based on Charisse lab and
her inventions and the Black Panther
movie is officially out on digital
blu-ray and 4k uhd so if you haven't
seen the movie yet now's the time but
let's start off with the overall look
here I decided to go with a minimalistic
approach since Black Panther is all
about stealth and staying low-key so
with that in mind we had to keep the
setup nice and clear and keep it as
minimal as possible and of course the
overall theme is black and purple like
the kinetic suit that Cherie made and we
used a few RGB lit peripherals to get
the look but we'll touch on those in a
second the setup is built around what I
think would give us the closest
experience to using one of sharees
computers and that's the surface studio
now I feel like this works because it
has a large touch screen that allows us
to use our hands for maneuvering and
using gestures to control the computer
since we don't exactly have the cool
Holograms and the floating screens that
we typically see in the Marvel Universe
but imagine if we did that would be
awesome if we got any real-life sharie's
out there please hook it up and even
using something like the surface dial
helps us to feel more futuristic than
your typical controls and I feel like
the studio just works out perfectly
because it's geared towards creators
which is exactly what sure he is and
speaking of creations she made this
awesome levitating train system which
used magnets to stay up and they carried
vibranium which was the inspiration for
our speaker system here these are a pair
of levitating speakers called the Mars
by crazy baby now these are typically
meant to be used as solo speakers but
they are capable of being used in stereo
mode and I'm not even gonna lie to you
guys
I had a really hard time pairing these
together and I still haven't really
figured it out so I don't recommend
using this system if you're looking for
a cool pair of stereo speakers but I
couldn't help but put them in the setup
since they work so perfectly and the
potentials there on their own though
they're kind of cool since they're
levitated using magnets and they've got
these cool LEDs to give it a nice effect
and speaking of LEDs we added a few D
here to really tie in the theme color
for black panther so let's talk about
those peripherals here we've got the
apex m7 50 tkl keyboard by steels
serious and what I love about this
keyboard besides the fact that it's RGB
is that it's got a smaller form factor
and is it as kooky as keyboards that I
typically go with so it feels more
stealthy when using it and I really
wanted to tie in some kind of reference
to sharees new sneakers with this
keyboard but I couldn't figure it out
they're both quiet my only issue with
this keyboard which is a personal
problem is that it's taking some getting
used to typing on this thing since I'm
pretty used to having a number pad with
my desktop but overall the black and
purple work really well for this set up
next to that we've chosen the logitech
g930 sign and performs really well with
great accuracy kind of like our Manta
Tala
and of course you know the mousepad has
to have RGB too because why not and
surround that our RGB s we of course
have a Philips to strip in the back to
give us that nice purple glow and a lamp
with this basic RGB bulb from Amazon you
know the ones that used a little
color-changing remote and our last piece
is the Corsair ST 100 RGB headphone
stand now this is currently my favorite
headphone stand since it looks great
offers two extra USB 3.0 ports so you
can start plugging things in without
even reaching for your computer and you
can customize the RGB s around the
perimeter and even the logo on the stand
put on top of that headphone stand we
have the all black bose qc25 series 2
these headphones follow the same formula
of being lightweight stealthy with solid
performance and last but absolutely not
least we've got this figure of black
panther just to make sure there's no
confusion on who this setup is based on
but all jokes aside this is a sturdy
figure with tons of details so if you're
a collector who likes Black Panther you
should definitely check it out but not
only do you have to check that but you
gotta check out Black Panther now that
you can watch it at home if you're one
of the few people who actually missed
that movie you definitely want to check
it out and I'm obviously gonna be
picking up a copy because what ganda
forever but that's about it for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy or girl that
gives this video a thumbs up and I'll
catch you guys in the next one links
will be down below to everything but
till next one guys just your average
consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
