consumer and today we're going to be
checking out some tech that I used in
high school wasn't much but I loved it
so first thing we're looking at is the
PSP now you guys know I am in love with
portable gaming if you're new to the
channel I'm in love with portable gaming
and this guy was with me all throughout
high school when I ended up taking it to
college I played Monster Hunter like
crazy Harry hated how much time I spent
on this if we were around any of her
friends I was on her campus my head was
like this always so I actually have two
of these guys and that's where which one
works the one that works for me okay so
in high school me and Ares both had it I
played mine all the time she did it so
when mine comes out on me I ended up
taking hers so that's a story of both
and now I think I'm going to try and
turn it on I charged it for a little bit
it hasn't been turned on since I don't
even know how long how long has it been
a yeah I probably haven't even attempted
to turn this on since the PlayStation
Vita came out and kind of dethroned it
got a green light
who would that's the time oh my goodness
listen when Sony dropped this thing it
was like PlayStation 2 on the go
I was super hyped with this so let's see
I remember that there's a game in here -
oh no this is this your game god it's
freaking Sudokus I wish I had something
decent in here I think this is the only
game that I have left of the PSP it
makes me feel kind of sad to be honest
Sony didn't use any cartridges back in
the day they used these weird little CD
things called um DS they were terrible
but it got the job done and it's funny
because I probably shouldn't even admit
this but I had these both modded I had
what is it custom roms or is it roms it
anywhere I had custom firmware on both
of these Sud online download all the
games put it on the
ricard I come from humble beginnings
folks so I was getting everything online
it was terrible but I enjoyed the PSP to
the fullest definitely one of the best
handheld I ever played huh if only the
Vita could really follow in its
footsteps man it had such a good legacy
going all right so that was a nice blast
in the past but check this out this is
the t-mobile Sidekick but this is the
second one that had a colored screen now
shout out to my man does from t-mobile
who was able to hook me up with this
actually asked on Twitter if anybody had
this so I can show you guys in a video
and he came to the rescue so shout out
to him but this guy's I was done listen
let me tell you I was the man with this
phone nobody could tell me anything
people had their fluency flip phones
using the number pad sending text
messages while I'm over here like yo I
send you a DM right now haha but not
really even used the M SEC 10 this was
like the first phone to have aim so
that's a oh alt instant messaging
service that's what everybody used to
talk back in the day people were running
home to get on their computers to chat
with their friends on AIM meanwhile I'm
out on the black was that I was on the
block you got this big screen which was
unheard of back in the day we had a full
keyboard so you could type messages with
no problem
this one also could go on the internet
something no phone was doing back in the
day listen I was the man back in the day
man
I was demand nobody could tell me
anything I was glued to it my love to
tech is real people now you guys know I
love listening to music and please wear
the earbuds that got me through it he's
going for like 10 bucks you would run
into like your Radio Shack or any
electronic shop they had these in stock
these are the sony MDR j 10 I just
learned that before this video before I
just need a with the Sony's let me get
those cheap stones over there that was
there for me and I used to use my PSP
because I we have memory cards on here
that can actually hold music so I would
have all my music on here plug in my
headphones and this was me folks
so these hooks were a must I couldn't
use regular earbuds that just kind of
senior year to say wouldn't happen so I
had the hooks but it was so awesome and
I have no idea what the sound quality is
like that is a good test
let's hear heavy sound keys are so bad
no way it owes me bass right now that's
how much bass a house show this is so
bad shut down on yourself is consumer oh
no I can't do that to D I love these no
no no I can't do that that's that's
that's blasphemous right there
but these were the goats for me back in
the day I needed earbuds these were what
you saw me with always all right guys
one of my favorite things to use in high
school this guy the Sega Dreamcast now a
little confession this one isn't mine
well technically it's mine but this one
was actually Ares I had to sell my
Dreamcast to fund whatever tech
obsession I was going through back in
the day let me tell you I don't know how
many hours I spent playing Power Stone
Power Stone - sonic adventure sonic
adventure 2 Crazy Taxi I was one of the
best games on the system I absolutely
loved it
actually had to go ahead and purchase
one of these memory cards that went
inside of the controller I actually had
to buy a couple of new pieces some value
stuff was pretty beat-up
so I bought a new memory card and a new
controller now these lemon cars was
really cool because they had like this
built-in screen there were like little
video games in themselves in Sonic
Adventure 2 they had this Chows I
believe they're called the little
creatures that you were raising inside
of the Chow world you can bring them
along with you so when you went to
school you can have them here kind of
take care of them and do stuff
Tamagotchi was a thing back in the day
and I'm sorry Sega was just capitalizing
on that but this was so cool this is
probably one of the best memory cards
ever created but yeah you would take it
throw it into your controller your
controller got a screen off of it it was
just awesome this was an amazing system
way way before its time I think it was
one of the first systems where you could
connect to the internet and do all that
kind of stuff I'm actually going to go
ahead hug this sucker up and try to play
some Crazy Taxi you ready for this area
alright and
you hear that thing whirling oh wait a
minute
looks like some of the colors gone oh no
I don't know
I bought this cake I bought like a
generic table because I didn't have her
cables for the television anymore I
don't know maybe I need a new one but
nonetheless we've got Crazy Taxi inside
of here guys I'm gonna give it a try Oh
No why is this happening it has to be
this - absolutely so bear with me guys
this is in black and white but we're
gonna see if I still got my skills a new
game was so crazy because we like almost
run people over and not get in trouble
oh come on is right the first passenger
I am flopping so hard I'm a little rusty
I've been playing on my phone
way too much there we go and can you
stop bro oh snap I'm racking up the
money
Oh she'll give me a big tip oh so I get
like an ass yeah I need practice guys
all right guys so it looks like this
thing reset on me and went back to the
homescreen
but you guys saw enough but as much as
you could anyway but this has been all
detect that I used in high school you
guys got a pig tell me what you think
what are the cool things that you guys
love to use every day while you're in
high school or when you were in high
school let me know what's a comment down
