consumer and today I finally have a
review for you guys of the powerbeats2
Wireless so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it
alright guys here we have the
powerbeats2 Wireless
this is beats upgraded version of the
original power beats these however now
come is Bluetooth earbuds and cost 50
dollars more than the original landing
it at $200 as you'd expect from beats
these are pretty expensive but let's see
if it's worth your hard earned cash
first let's talk about the design this
resembles the first power beats but now
has a simpler and in my opinion much
better look here you can see I have the
black and red version but a white and
grey option is also available the body
of the powerbeats2 has a matte finish
while the ear hooks are made of a rubber
material you also have a tangle free
cable that keeps the earbuds together
and also houses the remote talk control
the control itself has a soft coating
which pretty much fits with the feel of
the entire headset the power beats are
pretty smooth to the touch with their
rubber parts and matte finish but they
have a good solid feel in the hand one
of my favorite things about the power
beats 2 is the fact that it doesn't feel
cheap I'm definitely a fan of the design
and build quality you can also find the
power button on the left ear piece but
I've had trouble knowing when I actually
press the button because it's so flesh
within the body under the body you'll
find the flap that gives you access to
the micro USB port for charging if I
could change anything about the design
it'd be raising the power button a bit
and having the ability to move the ear
hooks while they do offer some give the
base of the hooks do not move at all I
would have liked for it to be adjustable
so it'd be easier to get a fit when worn
this isn't a deal-breaker though there
are also 2 pieces attached to the wire
so you can adjust the fit if you're
looking for something a bit more secure
and speaking of getting a good fit this
is where the power beats to have failed
me or maybe my ears fail them I don't
know even with the hooks I had a pretty
hard time keeping the buds locked in
place
they indeed help the bud from falling
out of my ear but they didn't help to
keep them in this is where I can shift
the blame to my ears I've always had a
little trouble keeping normal ear buds
something like the Apple earpods in my
ears due to having a slightly odd shape
that can't hold them up now you might be
wondering why even tell us this if your
ears are to blame but I wanted to tell
you guys that even with the ear hooks
involved you're not guaranteed to have a
perfectly secure fit if you plan on
picking these up and you do definitely
make sure the ear buds will stay in
place when moving around before it's too
late to return them there's nothing
worse than buying a pair of ear buds
that won't stay in your ear but now
let's talk about some of the features
these are of course Bluetooth earbuds so
you can use them wirelessly to listen to
audio with any Bluetooth enabled device
these also have some surprisingly good
range so you don't need to hug your
device to listen to your music it
features a remote torque control that
you can use to control volume play and
pause music as well as go to your next
and previous track by double clicking
and triple clicking the play button
respectively you can also take calls
with this as most bluetooth headsets
allow but one of my favorite features is
the fact that it's water and sweat
resistant these are geared towards
athletes and those who live an active
lifestyle so sweat is a common issue
with earbuds like these you don't have
to worry here as you can see I've worked
out vigorously with these and sweat was
not an issue at all since its water
resistant you can also use this in the
rain which is always nice the power
beats run on about 6 hours of battery
life for audio playback which is two
hours less than I'm used to with the
Jaybirds bluebloods X but I tend to
charge my device pretty often so that
hasn't really been a concern for me
the powerbeats2 offers a quick charge
feature that allows you to charge the
device for 15 minutes and you'll get an
hour of battery life perfect for a quick
trip to the gym the power Peaks come
with a short USB cable three extra ear
tips and a travel case as accessories
it's pretty unfortunate but the case
doesn't have a pouch included so all the
accessories can easily fall out if you
try to take them with you but it does
offer solid protection due to having a
hard shell but let's finally get to what
you guys are here for the sound
quality this is one of the most
confusing parts to me about the pyro
beats line I find that I really like the
sound quality when I have a good seal
with the ear tips the bass is present
vocal sound clear and nothing comes off
to me as muffled I can't stress enough
how important a good seal is when
looking to get the best sound quality in
ear buds can offer this was a complaint
I had with the original power beats but
I was quickly told that this was due to
athletes needing to hear their
surroundings while that makes sense for
athletes it doesn't make sense when
you're looking for the best sound
quality from in ear buds you lose out on
quite a bit of bass with this kind of
design and honestly it seems like the
design contradicts what it's meant for
my solution for this was to use bigger
ear tips I don't have bigger ears but
ear tips can dramatically change the
quality of the sound as they directly
impact the seal in your ears all in all
the sound quality is definitely there
and when I forced the seal I definitely
enjoyed it but having to force the seal
all the time definitely wasn't a good
experience for me at $200 this could be
a good or bad investment depending on
whether or not these fits securely in
your ears and provide you the right seal
I think the design durability Bluetooth
ability and the sound are definitely on
point but the comfort and fit from all
of that because it can cause your
experience to be very lackluster if it's
not good I really like these earbuds and
I'm sure if you pick them up you'd like
them as well but I highly suggest that
if you have any comfort issues like I
had to send them back trust me in your
buds are not a product you can
compromise comfort with especially at
$200 and that pretty much wraps up my
review but I know you guys are wondering
