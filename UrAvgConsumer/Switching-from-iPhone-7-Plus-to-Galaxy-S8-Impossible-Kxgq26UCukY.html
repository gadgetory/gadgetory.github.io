said right what's going on guys your
average consumer and I've been using the
iPhone as my main daily driver for about
three years now and I recently decided
I'm going to be switching over to the
new Samsung Galaxy S a of course has to
document the experience to let you guys
know how that transition was NZ was
actually feasible for me to go ahead and
make the switch so let's take a look at
day one and a little context alright
I've got my iphone 7 plus never thought
I wasn't taking one of these to it I'm
gonna use the sim ejector tool to uh
take out the SIM card and oh this is a
bad sign already folks the SIM card
style alright I like to SP get enough to
weren't making it my daily driver I
haven't made an Android for my daily
driver since I don't know I guess since
maybe re when you got an iPhone right
yeah then that kind of made me jump on
board because of iMessage and all that
boom it's in there
I gotta admit guys I'm nervous so for
the next week I tested things that I use
on a day-to-day basis like group chats
video calls my favorite apps to see if I
could actually make the switch it's a
prize surprise within my first few
minutes I ran into my first hiccup so
now we doing good I'm actually posting
something on to Instagram from the
latest video but I don't have access to
iCloud drive anymore since obviously so
I'm actually posting it to Dropbox so I
can grab it on my phone and then post it
suddenly got to change up now now even
though the screen on 8 is absolutely
beautiful
it still has those edges on the side so
it does take some getting used to it I
said this in other videos but even after
using it for even longer
I still haven't completely got used to
it I don't think you ever really do you
kind of just have to not care it isn't
exactly the best for content consumption
because things on the screen end up
looking a bit warped especially if
you're watching something with subtitles
you're going to have the
your angle on the subtitles which isn't
really a good look but for just about
everything else this should be fine this
is absolutely one of those areas where
it's like beauty over function because
there's really nothing gained from
having those edges but it does look good
the next hit you take coming from an
iPhone is the loss of face time all
right so what are you doing at a quality
man Oh a little green yeah yeah I see a
tool on yours but you're in a dark room
though but either way I think FaceTime
would probably be better oh you got an
iPhone right next to you right you have
an iPhone right next to you yeah oh wait
I mean all right B so if give our
assessment real quick what are your
thoughts Oh
as you said if this lesson is based on
what people know about it but if we're
talking about visual quality apps kpop
yeah now I'm not a huge user of FaceTime
but it was pretty nice to be able to
jump into a video call with someone the
press of a couple of buttons you really
don't have that kind of access with the
s8 there is this cool video calling
feature that you can use but you can't
really find that on many Android phones
made with other s8 users but it's not as
widespread as something like FaceTime
and the quality wasn't really as good
now while we're on the topic of
communication one of the biggest losses
you'll face from leaving the iPhones
there's a loss of iMessage if you happen
to have a ton of group chats going on
you're going to have some problems I
struggle to find a good way to fix it
and see for yourself
okay so right now I'm about to jump into
one of our group chats so we're going to
see if this thing is going to play well
with that I really don't think so but
I'm keeping my fingers crossed folks and
here we have what I was afraid of the
most I sent a group message to me and
Anna and it's not showing up on here but
boom there we go all of our messages
still go inside
this guy right there so that group chat
is where everything is going to happen
so now we're gonna have to make a new
group something with my actual phone
number and not my Apple account see if
that will work better for our group
messages so I'm still trying to figure
out this whole group chat thing but it
looks like they're not sending I don't
know I got to figure something out but I
retry to create a group chat mine's
ended up in a separate chat and they did
not go through so we're gonna have to
figure this out so gates you how are we
feeling
I like the phone I love it I think it's
great screen is great I love holding in
the hands looking at is awesome group
messaging man I can't even talk to my
people
it sucks now don't get me wrong it's
absolutely possible to group chat
between Android and iOS but if you're
coming from an iPhone and you already
have group chats that exists the only
real way to get that group chat going
again while you have your Android phone
is by everyone else in the group chat
deleting the old thread that is a high
cost to pay if you like to archive your
messages and look back at them maybe
look like it some photos some laughs
that you had you gotta get rid of
everything if you want to start over on
an Android phone that is a pretty big
deal now I'm a pretty big gamer
especially when it comes to gaming on my
phone some of my favorite apps of all
time are games that happen to only be on
iOS which really sucks so exclusivity to
iOS is definitely an issue that you're
going to come across if you're playing
any iOS only games are even using any
iOS only apps that's something you're
going to be facing if you switch over to
Android and there were a couple of
smaller things that impacted my
day-to-day use with the phones I was a
big fan of reach ability on the iPhone 7
plus when dealing with a big screen the
breach ability is an awesome feature
because it gets that content from the
top right to the middle of the screen so
I can tap it without having to use a
device with two hands I really really
appreciated that and honestly that's why
I went with the s8 instead of the si
plus si plus had too big of a screen for
me to use with one hand so I went with
the smaller version another little quick
write that I had with the si plus which
is so bizarre to me
is that emails would come into my iPhone
much faster than my Android which
doesn't make sense because Android is
Google I use a Google email I just
didn't get it but despite all that there
are still a ton of things I mean say
worth being a daily driver the Galaxy sa
is one of the best looking phones that
I've seen in a while thanks to that
infinity display the glossy black finish
it all helps it to feel very premium and
just taking the sucker out of your
pocket you can't help but feel good it's
an awesome looking phone and that's kind
of one of the things that you really
enjoy about a unique phone the way it
looks and how it feels in the hand
another bonus of switching over to the
galaxy s 8 has definitely been USB
type-c now one thing I love about the
essay is the fact that it does have USB
type-c so I can unplug my macbook when
the battery's low and just go ahead and
charge it boom so now I'm getting juice
even though I'm not using the charger
that this came with and who said Samsung
and Apple can't get along now that's
cool because I get to bring around one
charger for both my phone and my macbook
can't even do that with the iPhone so
that's pretty good I cannot say enough
how much I miss being able to tweak and
customize my phone with the iPhone
pretty much what you see is what you get
and while that may work for a lot of
people I really didn't miss that part of
Android so I'm super happy to have that
back I like what I've got going on with
my s8 right now I think it fits my vibe
pretty well let's be honest that's the
best part about tech being able to
tinker with it now something that I was
a bit apprehensive about when making the
switch was giving up my Apple watch I
happen to use mine on a daily basis so I
was pretty happy to find out that the
gear s3 was out and I could use that
with the SI so today we went to Best Buy
picked up this guy I actually did a
video with an unboxing of it but I have
the Galaxy gear s3 because I needed a
replacement for my Apple watch the
biggest features that I actually use on
my Apple watch is to find my phone
feature because I always misplace my
phone or maybe I have it in a room I
don't know where it is use that feature
a lot now I recently found out that I
can do that with this so this has just
about everything I need that one feature
actually have to use the Find My Phone
feature right now so
test that out there we go boom boom oh
the future ever oh there it goes
time to go get it now I do know that
using a SmartWatch is not something
that's super common so if you're under
1% that actually does still use one of
these that's something to keep in mind
the s3 is definitely a great option for
hand roid there's something about those
Galaxy cameras that I personally am a
fan of now they're not massively better
than the iPhone but there's something
about the sharpness and the colors that
I really like and the fact that the
camera allows you to have more control
over your photos that's all I want
so what's the verdict I'm sticking with
the SI that beautiful look the amazing
camera all that customization these are
all pros that I think outweigh the cons
and to be honest it's not like there
aren't third-party applications that
pretty much fix all the issues with the
cons it does stuff but hey it's still
possible to get around it now if anybody
really really wants to get in touch with
you they'll download the third-party
apps and make it work with you so you
always have those options but what do
you guys think would you stick with the
iPhone or stay with the s8 let me know
with a comment down below if you enjoyed
this or found it useful be the cool guy
well that give this video a thumbs up
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then it's your average consumer face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
