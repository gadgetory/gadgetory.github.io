consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of the Sennheiser momentum
on-ear headphones now these are pretty
new and there's a little brother to the
over ear version so hey let's not waste
any time
get into it all right guys here we have
the Sennheiser momentum on-ear
headphones now this is the ivory color
and if you just take a quick look around
the box you can see that it has a little
picture here showing you what the
headphones should look like on gives you
some description of the headphones in
different languages here and it gives
you an idea of what's inside the
packaging as well as you seen here a
picture of the inline remote so enough
of the box let's see if we could get
this thing open looking around there you
can see a piece of tape up here and some
at the bottom so we're gonna need a
little unboxing knife to pop it open and
let's see here let's get this cut and it
goes the top and there goes the bottom
so we could put this guy away and let's
see if we can open up this thing I said
we have to shake it out
all this art well this is kind of hard
to get out right here you go
there we go we got it so you can take
the top off this is the case that it
comes in and over here you can see that
it has some packaging here shows you a
bit of the blue ones and inside of here
is most likely the warranty information
and you know Start Guide stuff like that
so we can put that stuff away alright so
here we have the case let's open this up
this is a pretty isn't that hard shell
case it's pretty soft but um it'll
definitely protect the headphones for
sure it's like sort of soft sort of hard
squared and the case has another little
pouch inside of it so this is where the
headphones are have the little cable
here and of course it comes with a
second cable this one doesn't have an
inline remote we're gonna put that here
and let's get this thing out of the
pouch this is tied up so we're gonna
untie it and let's see here we have
these Sennheiser momentum on ears and
these are really tiny guys very very
small indeed let me give you guys a
quick close-up of what they look like
and of course this is the ivory color as
I mentioned inside you can see that the
ear cups have like a brown tint inside
and it looks just like the brown that's
up top so it matches pretty well and
over here you can see that it says
momentum at the top so that's pretty
nice um and like I said guys a really
small headphones as you guys can see
here this is the on here version so
these will be directly on the ear the
ear cups feel pretty soft as well so
this is gonna be a very interesting
thing to try out so here we have the
inline remote and it has the Sennheiser
logo in the middle for play pause and of
course the volume controls on the sides
now this will of course work for
devices for Android it'll most likely
just be the play and pause and of course
the cable is detachable so we can pop it
out here but it has a locking mechanism
as you guys can probably see over there
so it'll won't just come out unless you
turn it first
and then pull it out so this is pretty
cool
make sure your cables don't just fly out
by mistake or anything and pretty much
that's about it guys there's a really
quick unboxing of the Sennheiser
momentum on ears I'll have a review for
you guys as well as a girlfriend test
and all that good stuff and that's about
it so I'll catch you guys in the next
video hopefully you enjoyed and until
then mr. average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
