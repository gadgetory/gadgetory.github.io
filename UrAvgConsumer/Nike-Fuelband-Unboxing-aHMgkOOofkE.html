average consumer and today I have an
unboxing for you guys of the Nike
FuelBand
so let's not waste any time let's get
right into it and alright guys here we
have the Nike FuelBand and I gotta say
I'm really in love with the design of
this thing it's got some pretty cool
features it tracks it monitors like how
many steps you do like a lot of your
activity and it gives you these things
called fuel points or fuel Nike Fuel I'm
not sure what the exact title is but
it's got all this stuff and you know you
can work with the online site and it
kind of syncs wirelessly so that's all
pretty cool arm
alright let's not waste any time let's
unbox it let's skip this little boxing
knife open to cut open the sides I do
have the medium version medium to large
whatever they want to call it um let's
see if I can pull this out alright cords
has an IQ check on it you guys
definitely can't see that but it's in
that little Nike check put a plus there
and let's see open it up pretty simple
packaging here it is but before we get
to that let's see what's on the side
we've got the USB cable as well as a
very interesting USB cable I've never
seen this ok it makes sense so what
we're going to be doing is plugging this
into I guess your computer and then the
fuel band into here so it's got its own
little interesting design and give you
guys a quick close-up so here you are
you see it it's got the Nike check on
there and like I said you can plug in
the band 2 right here while this is
connected to elect your computer or
something and this is I guess made to
lay flat so I guess you just plug it in
while it's laying on your desk or
something and alright we'll put that to
the side see what else we get here this
is I think this might be to get rid of
some of the extra pieces on the band so
you can kind of plug this in or
focusing like a sim ejector for a phone
or something
and I'm pretty sure that's what it is as
you can see they come with an extra
little piece to extend it depending on
your wrist size so let me give you guys
a quick close-up of this so here you
have an extension piece to kind of plug
it in if you have to you know get a
bigger size and I guess this part right
here that they also include is so that
you can get it in there and unlock it so
you can do that so this is like a sim
ejector but for the fuel band and these
are an extra piece so pretty cool that
they give this even though they've made
you choose a size in the beginning good
stuff and that's about it for the
accessories and you've got some booklets
probably some warranty information of
course here and a set-up guide so lets
you know exactly what to do with it all
that good stuff so let's put this aside
and let's take out the fuel band and
here it is like I said guys I am a fan
of this design really good stuff let's
see here let's see if we can power it on
if you have any juice whatsoever and it
looks like it might not so I might have
to charge this first but before I go and
do all that let me give you guys at
least a little quick closeup of the
actual fuel band alright guys so here we
have the fuel Bend pretty sturdy stuff
in the back you have the lock mechanism
so you can kind of press this button up
top here kind of open it up and this is
probably where you want to charge it so
this can go into the little adapter
piece here and there you go
I guess is how you charge it or do
whatever so let's take this back out
it's a little rough it's a little tough
at first I must say and here you can see
the little connectors at the bottom so I
really want to show you guys what it
looks like with a little power so I'm
going to go charge it for a little bit
and get back on camera and alright guys
I'm back now I didn't have to charge
this up but I did have to connect it to
the computer to get it started now one
thing I did know when I'm going to the
computer is that this thing doesn't
actually have
to stay on it it's a dock so you can
kind of take this off so that's pretty
cool a little tidbit I learned and um
yeah so what I wanted to do is show you
guys what it looks like on so when you
press it to show you the time all that
good stuff lets you know about the whole
Nike Fuel thing that they've got going
on how many steps you've taken calories
steps right there so it's a pretty cool
very interesting stuff it's a little
sturdier than I would expect for
something on your wrist but it's not bad
overall and that pretty much wraps up
this unboxing guys this is supposed to
be a good tool to help you get active I
want to get back to working out so we'll
see how this works as a motivator and
things like that so stay tuned for my
review I'll definitely have one on this
and I'll catch you guys in the next
video till then it's your average
consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
