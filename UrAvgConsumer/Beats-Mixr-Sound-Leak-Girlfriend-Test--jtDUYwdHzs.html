want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on guys
it's your average consumer and here's my
girlfriend again hello we're going to be
doing another sound leak and sound
isolation test aka the girlfriend test
for you guys today with the beats by dre
mixers now a lot of you guys have been
asking about these headphones and the
how much it leaks so here's this video
all right let's not waste any time let's
get right into it and I'm gonna be
wearing the headphones because one you
know that he doesn't find these too
comfortable and two um he's really the
better judge of how much it leaks so
just make it better for you guys alright
so what we're first going to do is we're
going to try it out at 50% then 75% then
100% so you guys can have an idea of how
much it leaves at those different points
alright so let's get it started so here
it is at 50%
now there's some little decent leakage
not too bad nobody next year would be
really bother at this point um but
someone next you will hear that you're
listening to music I can hear what song
is um it's not too bad but it does leak
a bit at 50% so now let's try it out a
75% is that 75 now I hit this pretty
clearly I'm not sure if you guys can
pick it up but there's a decent amount
leakage that 75% yeah
so I say 5% there's some good leakage
there all right it's kind of a hundred
percent ready yep once you've done the
studios you can do anything okay all
right so here goes it's pretty clear
it's not as bad as the studios but it's
very clear this is not even a lot of
point in the song let's see out of
chorus yeah
these are pretty well as if you expect
that at a hundred percent is going to
leak really badly but we've heard worse
so I understand doubly good enough all
right so now we're gonna start the
girlfriend to my favorite part okay so
we're going to be trying now to see how
much I can isolate sounds from the
outside using these headphones just so
we can have how much we can focus on the
music itself and not what's around us so
the girlfriend test we'll see what she
has to say or do and see if I can block
it out and of course we're going to
start it at 50% 75% and 100% so for now
let's see that 50% are you ready yes are
you ready I hopefully I am
all right Oh God
what so it works let's see if I remember
some tunes from like six years ago you
to brace yourself all right so we
started off at 50% and here we go yeah
so I can clearly hear that clearly maybe
it's because we're really close to me
but um I really heard that really well
so I mean and it sounded a little
muffled but at 50% it was not quite
enough to block out this thing so we'll
try that 75% and see if we can get the
job done
all right you ready yes
ah it's not bad at 75% I was
surprisingly able to block out a pretty
good amount of that I heard a little
slightly but I think these will do a
good job blocking out most sounds from
the outside this is really loving and
close to me so I'm assuming that I tell
you part percent you won't hear much on
the outside it will do a really good job
isolating at 75% and maybe even a little
lower than that so let's try it out a
hundred percent okay again I'm sorry
YouTube little this can't be easy in
case you can't tell playing playing
jingle bells all right and here we are a
hundred percent let's not play through
too much I don't know what you got to
dig up on me these did a perfect job at
completely isolating all the noise from
100 percent so it's a really good job I
think that these will do a great job
isolating sounds like I said this is
particularly loud and very close to me
and I still struggle to hear it
so I think these do a really good job at
keeping noise on the outside out and
you'll will be able to focus on your
music so good job on the sound isolation
and the girlfriend test it has passed
but for the sound leakage it did leak a
little bit wasn't the worst we've heard
but it did leak uh slightly so high
volumes the person next to you or around
you probably will hear it but most more
times than that they probably won't so
alright I think that rat who is it and
finally we can put this alright there
you have it guys if you liked this video
please feel free to rate comment and
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video if you have any other
requests for other headphones or
anything that you like to see the
girlfriend test fun let us know and
we'll get right to it
alright so the next video guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
