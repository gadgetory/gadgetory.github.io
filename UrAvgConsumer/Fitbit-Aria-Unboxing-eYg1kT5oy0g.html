Squarespace what's going on everyone is
average consumer and today I've gotten
an unboxing for you guys of the Fitbit
Aria Wi-Fi smart scale now me and my
girlfriend have been on a bit of a
fitness trip lately so we decided wanted
to get technology involved in so we
picked one of these up so let's not
waste any time let's get right into it
all right guys here we have the Fitbit
Aria like I said this is the Wi-Fi smart
scale and just there's a little simple
box but upfront it does tell you some of
the features that it has so of course it
has Wi-Fi you can use it online or with
your mobile device and it comes with
little achievements like little badges
to keep you motivated it can track your
weight and your body fat percentage and
body mass index so the BMI and it also
has like graphs and calorie management
for those of you who are taking it
really really seriously so it's got a
lot of stuff here and in the back it
shows you a couple more things that it
can do it has multiple users it's easy
to set up so they say but we'll try it
all out and see but enough of the box
let's get to the actual scale itself and
open this thing up so no unboxing knife
needed here so once you open it up
of course it says hello so this is the
scale itself and more of those things
that it can do up front so we can take
this out and we're actually start with
this box and here it is so I'm just
going to pull this tab open here and
boom so this is the scale so let's get
this thing out of its wrapping so it's a
little heavy let's see what else we've
got so this is like a set-up guide
probably need this since I've never set
up a scale before so I'm gonna keep this
on the side and let's see let's get this
thing out of the little wrapping house
here and this is actually really nice
looking looks fancy and alright now that
it's undressed
you can see a hair tells you how to get
started so you of course you want to go
and download the software at fitbit.com
slash start it does have a caution
slippery one wet but that's because if
they do want you to use this with your
bare feet so that it can track
everything they won't be able to track
as well with like socks and shoes on so
they definitely tell you to do that and
at the bottom here unless you ask you to
pull this little tab but let's see
what's inside of here first so it
functions on for double-a batteries so
I'm not gonna take much to power this
thing I'm not sure how long these last
but for double-a batteries it's not too
bad very common thing looking up and
pulled that out okay cool
so that should be all good to go it's
got a very interesting bottom here a
bunch of little ridges so there goes
that Oh Logan it already says activate
so um yeah so I guess I gotta set this
thing up and what I plan on doing is
actually trying out the whole ecosystem
we also got the Fitbit flex which is
gonna be in another video but we got the
Fitbit flex we're gonna see what the
whole Fitbit ecosystem is like and how
it helps you to either lose weight or
just keep track of your way and see how
well it really helps or if it's just
like we've given it kind of thing so
this is about it for this unboxing guys
I'm gonna have a review and a review of
the whole ecosystem let you guys know if
it's worth investing in but before we
