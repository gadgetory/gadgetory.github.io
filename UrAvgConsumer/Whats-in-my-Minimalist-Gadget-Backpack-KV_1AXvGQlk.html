consumer and this is the cocoon slim
backpack now some of you may have seen
me unbox this in my latest massive tech
unboxing as I continue my search for my
next full-fledged gadget backpack taking
a look at this thing and it's super slim
profile I immediately knew that it
wouldn't work as my next gadget backpack
since I tend to carry a lot and I mean a
lot but since it has a built-in gritted
system and doesn't overdo it with too
many compartments I figured it'd be a
great contender for a minimalist
backpack setup that's what we're looking
at today if you guys liked the idea of
these themed backpack setups be sure to
hit that like button let's try to get
this video to about 10,000 likes and
also let me know to comment down below
what things you want to see in the
future so this backpack setup I made
sure to only include the essentials
while still covering all our bases of
functional tech now in that very first
compartment up front I've got a spuds
microfiber cloth because you guys know
me can't live without it well that's all
that we've got over there but beyond the
next zipper is what makes the backpack
special if you aren't familiar with the
greatest system it's a board that's
completely covered in straps which
allows it to hold a variety of items of
all shapes and sizes just pull up one of
the straps and place what you need
inside they also sell these gridded
board separately so if you want to throw
it into another backpack you can do that
as well I'll be sure to include a link
to those and everything else you see in
this video down below in the description
now let's make some sense of this
organized chaos on the top left I've got
my staple riding utensils a pilot g2 pen
and a Curatola mechanical pencil which
has some self sharpening tech inside
next to it is this Aki wall adapter and
it's a wall adapter with two USB ports
and a USB type-c port with quick charge
2.0 now I really like this because it's
versatile and allows you to charge
multiple devices at once which means you
can minimize the amount of wall adapters
that you bring with you below that we've
got the jaybird X threes now I chose
these not only because they're awesome
ear buds but because the travel case
really helps to save space in this
backpack and the jammers themselves have
such a small footprint that it fits in
well with the whole minimalist theme
without having to sacrifice audio
quality these are definitely one of my
favorite Bluetooth earbuds so I'm glad
they worked out here and this wouldn't
be a video by me if I didn't mention
affordable charger just want to buy a
cool
now there are tons of super slim
portable chargers and even some that fit
in wallets but I didn't want to
sacrifice the milliamp out capacity and
I still wanted it to be functional so
this one has 10,000 milliamp hours and
quick charge 3.0 this should be able to
hold down those phones a few times over
and with quick charge 3.0 if your phone
supports it
that'll minimize the amount of time you
actually spend holding this thing to get
your phone juiced up up next is my
Samsung t3 now I love this because it's
a super small SSD that can carry up to
one terabyte of storage
it's got fast data transfer speeds and
honestly with this much storage in this
compact design it is a shoo-in for this
backpack now next to that is the tool
two USB hub now I've got to carry around
something like this since I primarily
use a macbook pro for work but with
something like this i have all bases
covered and that allows me to worry
about dongles a lot less when using my
macbook it has three USB 3.0 ports and
an SD card slot another USB C port and
even an HDMI slot in case you want to
hook up your device to a TV or maybe a
computer monitor if you ask me I think
this is one of the best USB see hubs you
can get next up we've got this Universal
cable by Nomad now the idea behind this
backpack is a minimalist design so we've
got one cable here that covers micro USB
USB type-c and even lightning ports so
this will be able to charge us about any
devices you carry with you and if
someone asked to borrow your cable you
can rest assured that you'll be able to
charge their device - and I love the
nomads cables have a rugged design since
we're relying on just one here we want
to make sure that it lasts I've also got
my macbook charger in here that charge
my macbook but you can see that even
though it has a stick wall adapter if
it's in these straps with no problem
and last but not least on our grid is
the new Microsoft arc mouse now this
sits perfectly in this backpack because
it can be laid completely flat for
storage but when you want to turn it on
and use it all you do is fold it and
you're good to go the works over
bluetooth so it's compatible with both
Macs and PCs and it also has this new
touch surface that allows you to swipe
up and down to scroll and even left and
right which is the nice addition when it
comes to straight-up portability there's
no beating this mouse now in the big
compartment
I kept it pretty simple I've got this
moleskin notebook for jotting down notes
and ideas in this small tablet
compartment as well as my macbook pro
behind it now I love the interior of the
laptop compartment since it has a nice
plush design so it should help to
protect your laptop a bit but in this
big main compartment you can see that
there are four total areas that you can
store stuff in food which is a nice
touch
now the backpack is adequate padding not
enough to make it super comfortable but
since it is such a lightweight backpack
you won't feel uncomfortable unless you
over stop it but overall this is a
really great backpack for those of you
who want to keep it simple but still
pretty stylish but that's about it for
this video guys hopefully you enjoyed
the concept behind this whole minimalist
backpack setup here and if you did be
the cool guy a girl that give this video
a thumbs up I'll catch you guys in the
next one
till then it's your average consumer
