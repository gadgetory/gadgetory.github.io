consumer and today I've got a quick
unboxing for you guys of the charging
station for the PlayStation 4 Dual Shock
4 controllers so let's not waste any
time let's get right into it
so alright guys here we have the
charging station for the Dual Shock
controller for and this will allow you
to charge two Dual Shock 4 controllers
when you place them on here now first
things first this is a $30.00 product
you can find this at Gamestop that's
where I found it and it's not officially
by Sony but it is licensed by them so
Sony didn't make this it's I think it's
made by power a up here this is
definitely third-party so enough
blabbering let's get to opening I think
this is really cool this will work
perfectly with my setup for my consoles
so I'm gonna grab my unboxing knife here
and pop it open so we can just get it
slit at the bottom and there we go so
that's that I'll put the unboxing knife
away so here we have it all we'll have
to do is slip it up and it seems to have
a pretty interesting design I'm not
really sure how it functions because in
this picture is the USB ports are
actually not being used but I don't know
let's see so here we have the AC adapter
that's included and I'm hoping that this
has a long cable because I'm the way my
setup is my consoles are very far from
the ground so let's see so the cable has
some decent length to it but it won't
probably won't be enough for me I
project to put an extension cord on this
but it is pretty good length so if you
could keep this near your ps4 you
shouldn't have any issues so let's see
what else we've got
so we've got some instructions here some
instructions and I'm sure to some
warranty information so user manual
warranty stuff and the actual cradle
itself and that's all you get in the box
so we can push this aside and let's see
here so here we have it it's a pretty
simple design it's cool that it has the
PlayStation logo right there let's see
this can actually be pushed down you can
kind of lock it in place and you know
what let me grab a controller and I'll
show you guys how this functions and to
give you guys an idea of how it charges
it uses a little extension port as well
as the headphone jack port so you can
actually get it inside of here and then
it'll start charging right away so as
you guys can see we get this one inside
alright so as you guys may see now it's
charging one of the controllers I guess
the other ones already charged so it's
charging them and it's pretty secure
inside of here
now when you want to pull off your
controller all you'll have to do is like
this grab it and you're good to go
since the pieces will no longer be stuck
inside of it so you push this in when
you want it to secure be secured and
locked in place and start charging and
when you depict when you're ready to
grab it and go you flick it down grab
your controller and start playing so I
think that's pretty cool I definitely
would have thought that they when I
first saw it I could have sworn that it
was going to go like this so we can use
the micro USB port but it's pretty cool
that you can actually charge it from the
bottom here at the extension port so
that's really cool Sony I guess made it
possible to charge it like that for
accessories like this so really cool
stuff you guys know if you guys have
seen my ultimate set up tour you know
that I have one of these for the ps3
well I have an official one by Sony but
this is going to be a nice one to add
next to my ps4 this should charge pretty
quickly charges two at a time definitely
a great option for those who have
multiple controllers and them yeah
that's about it for this unboxing guys
just something really quick wanted to
demonstrate one of the accessories
that's currently out for the ps4 but
