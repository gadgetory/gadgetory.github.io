consumer and as many of you already know
the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 was recently
introduced and as expected
Samsung dropped another large and
beautiful phone I for one am super
excited about this phone since the
galaxy note 7 was one of 2016's best
phones and I was definitely disappointed
by the recall but luckily it looks like
we're getting a lot of the same but with
a couple of cool upgrades but what I
wanted to do with this video is give you
guys my first impressions of the Galaxy
Note 8 while also doing a slight
comparison to the s8 plus since it is
one of this year's hottest phones and
people will be drunk a comparison
between those two the most so first up
let's talk design side by side you can
see that they're similar but the no
dates rectangular edges make it
distinctly different and this makes
sense since the note series has always
had a more rectangular design compared
to the other samsung phones
this difference in edges both
distinguishes it nicely from the s8 plus
and also makes the phone slightly more
grippy and comfortable to hold it's not
a huge difference but it is something to
know in terms of other physical
differences then though eight is
slightly larger with a 6.3 inch display
compared to the s8 plusses 6.2 inch
display but what remains the same
between the two is the quality of the
beautiful display I had a chance to play
around with the phone for several hours
and I don't think there's anyone that
can get bored of that beautiful quad HD
plus infinity display that we get on
both the s8 line and now the note aid
now when it comes to the UI you pretty
much get the same thing but what I did
notice on the note 8 is that the app
drawer now has five apps across instead
of the four that you get onto s8 plus
and I still include the edge panel that
you can access on the side but a nice
little software tweak here is that you
can now access split-screen with a
preset of two apps so now you can pair
any two compatible apps with the press
of a single button and since the no date
is meant to be a productivity increasing
phone it definitely makes sense to see
his future come alive here and speaking
about being productive I gotta let you
guys know about LastPass I've personally
been using LastPass for years to keep my
passwords organized and accessible and
it is cool to finally be collaborating
with them
video basically LastPass will remember
and store your passwords and will
automatically fill them in when you
visit your most often use sites which is
nice because this allows me to use a
different password for different sites
which we should all be doing for the
sake of security but at least with
LastPass you don't have to remember them
all I can't stress how awesome it is to
not have to type in a password anytime I
want to sign in on a site I've even
installed this from my dad who's been
known to forget his password quite a bit
and get locked out of his account so the
same the trouble is having to go through
those security questions or somehow end
up calling me but guys definitely check
out LastPass it is a game changer and
it's been a staple for me for many years
now and I'll have links down below in
the description for you to check it out
but now back to what makes them no 8 the
note 8 and that's the S Pen the S Pen
it's always been a staple to the note
line but with the note 8 it does have a
few tweaks and upgrades now the new S
Pen is more pressure sensitive and it
also comes with this new carousel
feature where you can choose the action
you're looking for by scrolling through
the wheel and a cool feature that I
personally like is being able to pull
out the s pen and jot something on the
screen without turning the phone on or
choosing a specific app this is great
for taking down numbers writing lists or
any sort of reminder and I gotta say
it's really easy and comfortable to
write down on the screen even though my
handwriting sucks
and of course one of the most exciting
changes here is the new dual camera it
features a wide F 1.7 lens and the F 2.4
telephoto lens
now that wide lens is identical to that
of the s8 and sa plus but the addition
of that telephoto lens a lot of some
cool things to happen now you've got the
ability to use this feature called live
focus which allows you to take
professional looking photos with that
blurred out background and this is
pretty similar to the iPhone 7 plus is
portrait mode but the note 8 does allow
a bit more functionality by allowing you
to be able to adjust the amount of
Boquete or blurriness in the background
and not to mention both of those lenses
have optical image stabilization which
should really help with some low-light
photos or getting nice smooth video both
the note 8 and si plus share the same
front-facing cameras so if you need
those nice crisp selfies they're
definitely gonna be able to get them
with either phone
it's no surprise here because Samsung
makes some of the best cameras in the
business which has me really excited to
try out the note 8 and really push it
through its paces and see what kind of
shots I can get with it myself and of
course there are some spec differences
which you can see here but it really has
my attention here is the decrease in
battery life on the note 8 which is
rocking at 3300 milliamp hour battery
compared to the s8 plusses 3500 milliamp
hour battery and it makes sense
considering what happened last year but
can't help but feel disappointed but
that's about it guys now keep in mind
this has just been my first initial
impressions and comparisons between the
phones I can't wait to get them no 8 in
hand and put it through a real day in
the life and if you guys are excited
about that be sure to hit that like
button and I'll catch you guys in the
next one
till then it's your average consumer
