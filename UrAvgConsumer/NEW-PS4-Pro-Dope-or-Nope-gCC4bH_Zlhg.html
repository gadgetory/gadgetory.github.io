consumer and right now I'm playing the
PlayStation 4 pro and I decided you know
what I'll give you guys a doper note
letting you guys know whether or not the
PlayStation 4 pro is worth picking up
but I did an unboxing so let's check
that out and looky looky we've got a
PlayStation 4 pro now this is the only
one I picked up got a couple more coming
today you could assume what I'm gonna do
with that but let's take a look at
what's inside pop the sucker open mmm
let's see oh no I'm good always make
sure you put your unboxing knives away
folks and what do we get another box so
very top we've got a booklet don't need
that and this is any boxes on boxes on
boxes so obviously this is the ps4 pro
but we're gonna check out what else
we've got power cable now this is a much
thicker power cable than the original
PlayStation 4 so rather than the
standard cable you got this big thick
one you've got this micro USB cable
charge up your controller got a weak
PlayStation headset if you want to go on
PlayStation live and talk to your
friends HDMI cable and a PlayStation 4
controller so it looks like everything
you get in the box is pretty standard -
this power cable but you guys aren't
really here for cables or booklets we
want this guy the PlayStation 4 Pro ok I
like already you know I don't mind the
triple stack I don't mind this burger
look it actually looks pretty clean now
it obviously has another layer than the
PlayStation regular PlayStation but it
doesn't look so bad and I'm glad that
it's all matte so I've got the
PlayStation 4 right next to it and this
is only a teeny bit taller than it but
it does look like if we put the backs
together so we got them back-to-back
here and it looks like the front of the
ps4 protrudes just a little bit but it's
not much but one thing I do have to say
guys
I am glad that this glossy finish is out
of here and for my Xbox lovers out there
I've got this beautiful beautiful Xbox
1s but it is a bit taller than the ps4
Pro but I got to say the ps4 pro the
front protrudes quite a bit looks like
they're about the same height almost
exactly the same height so boom there
you have it so I got to say the pictures
of the ps4 Pro make it look a lot bigger
than it is but there's really nothing to
worry about now in terms of what you get
with ports you've got two USB ports in
the front and you've also got one in the
back so you got a total of three and
you've also got your power button which
is weird
weirdly right in the front and it's
super tiny I don't know why Sony keeps
going with these weird to touch buttons
but it's right here and eject is over
here pretty crappy buttons if you ask me
and taking a quick look in the back
you've got your slot for your power
adapter your HDMI cable even your slot
for your pay station camera even an
optical port which they took out of the
PlayStation slim and you've also got
like I said the USB cable and an
Ethernet port but a cool thing to note
that the rubber stops at the bottom of
the PlayStation 4 Pro have cool things
like the X square triangle and even the
circle button so there's got these
cooler rubber stops PlayStation 4 logo
on the bottom and I gotta say it's clean
so we've seen what's inside the box but
let's talk about what's new with the
PlayStation 4 now you're gonna get bored
Kay gaming if you own a 4k display
because this is a much more powerful
system now even if you don't have a 4k
display you still get the benefits of
having a much more powerful system
because depending on the developer they
can put different things towards the
graphics so you can get a higher
framerate you can get better textures
all that good stuff they can cram in a
lot more information here so you're
still gonna get better quality even if
you're not running a 4k TV now I hear a
lot of people aren't picking up the
PlayStation 4 pro because it does not
support 4k blu-rays but I have one
question who's buying 4k blu-rays I
don't I don't know when that became such
a big deal but honestly for me as long
as Netflix and all the other streaming
apps support 4k and this can output that
I'm alright but before I hook this up
and start testing out all the games I
mentioned that I picked up more than one
of these and of course you know I'm
giving one away to one of you guys and
all you got to do the inter is make sure
you subscribe to this channel and leave
a comment down below
but that's all you got to do to enter
guys I'm gonna pick the winner in two
weeks so take a look out for that and of
course I'm going to be announcing the
winner over on Twitter so be sure to
follow me there I'll have links down
below in the description and even if you
don't have a Twitter account you can
always check my page and see if your
name was picked so let's get into some
testing guys all right guys so right now
I am testing this out on my 4k samsung
television this is the KSR 8500 and so
far I gotta say it looks pretty good
I've never played - Wow well you know
I've never played tomato so I don't know
how crazy the graphics are on its own
but this right now is amazing so I do
have it up in 4k oh this looks good this
looks read like this looks really good
guys there's just so much detail in this
it's insane
from the rocks to the ice this is crazy
so I'm gonna keep playing see how this
goes I do want to try out titanfall
alright it's not to play some titanfall
this is titanfall - and I am height now
this is the game I play the most on my
xbox one I don't play a game more than
this one right now and well I don't play
a game more than titanfall one so I'm
pretty interested in seeing how this
plays oh and this looks good so far - oh
that's a grunt
now I really don't know how to play this
I played the demo a little bit you know
this looks good too now something else
to mention is that the ps4 Pro also has
all cannot talk so then something also
to mention is that the ps4 Pro is of
course faster so you're going to get
faster load times things of that nature
but that about wraps it up guys I
definitely think the PlayStation 4 Pro
is dope I'm playing on a 4k TV so
everything looks good but like I said
people who don't have 4k TVs if you have
1080p they're still going to be a lot of
benefits as well so I definitely think
it's worth it and it's only 400 bucks
it's not like Sony's charging a super
premium for it but till the next video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it be sure to
enter into the giveaway I'll catch you
in the next one till then it's your
average consumer who's getting back to
my titanfall</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
