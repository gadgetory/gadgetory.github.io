2018 but I want to stop and take a look
at the most unique pieces from the year
starting with the Xbox one adaptive
controller now this to me is a game
changer no pun intended but obviously
guys this is a really big deal and for
some of us who love gaming is kind of
hard to imagine a life where you can't
so it's really awesome that Xbox created
a controller that is made for folks with
limited mobility to actually go ahead
and be able to play games and for
everyone with limited mobility their
needs may be different and that's what
makes this thing special this thing
basically acts as a hub to a bunch of
different inputs so that you can go
ahead and customize this and have it
adapt to the person who's using it and
over here we've got a few different
inputs a little switch over here we have
a joystick with a couple of buttons and
we even have a clip pad now all of these
can actually be put right in the back
there's a little headphone jack or 3.5
millimeter input where you can just plug
in all of the different spots and then
you're controlling a different part of
the controller and this is really cool
because if someone has to use their chin
or their shoulder to play a game they're
gonna be able to do that here you can
even have a foot pedal so that you can
use your feet as well there are tons of
different options for that you can use
different body parts to get involved in
the game and I just think Microsoft is
doing an amazing job by doing things to
make gaming more inclusive and
accessible and if you know someone who
really loves gaming and could use
something like this be sure to follow me
on social media I'll have my Twitter and
Instagram down below and we might be
able to give out one of these
so the Xbox one of that the controller
is easily one of the most unique things
that we've seen this year especially
since you can completely customize it
based on someone's needs but let's move
on to the next device and this right
here is one of the most unique laptops
that I've gotten my hands on this year
and this is the HP Spectre folio
convertible 13 &amp;amp; hu√© shots in self
response err in today's video and
actually putting this thing on my radar
because I had no idea this existed
so this laptop is unique for a few
different reasons first being its body
it's got a leather case like body which
is just really really nice if you want
to take this in
the professional world you want to go to
work and you want to look nice and clean
you got something that's nice and slim
and with this leather profile looks like
you're just walking around with your
portfolio or something now this thing is
called a convertible because one it can
work in laptop mode and there's also a
straight up tablet mode where you can
just bring it down like this
which is kind of cool and if you just
want to present or maybe watch something
you can also throw it in like this lots
of different options to choose from in a
sleep design like this you really can't
beat that but what makes this thing very
unique in my opinion it's a feature that
I've only been introduced to pretty
recently and that's the inclusion of
Intel 7560 modem and what this guy being
able to have an eighth generation core
i7 processor and what if Intel's latest
modems giving you the ability to connect
anywhere you get some crazy
functionality out of this that you just
don't get out of other laptops for me
the most mind-blowing aspect of this is
being able to travel and not rely on
public Wi-Fi networks I've been able to
take this thing into a coffee shop or
maybe just be on the road and go ahead
and upload a video to YouTube work on a
video and not have to worry about using
my phone's data or anything like that
and I'm gonna commute home from work you
can throw this thing into tablet mode
and you can just start watching
something like Netflix YouTube and not
have to worry about having downloaded it
prior or jump onto a public Wi-Fi in
order to stream this is just an awesome
feature to have and I just wish it was
in every laptop and if you guys want to
get your hands on a laptop that's always
connected like this one all you gotta do
is head over to your local tech store
and ask them for an intel-based 4G LTE
connected PC but for me this easily
takes a spot for the most unique laptop
of 2018 but I've seen and next up guys
we've got the Oppo find X now this guy
is here for two reasons one that bezel
list display it does have a slight chin
but it's pretty much bezel as' and this
camera now I don't know if you guys
caught that but this camera has a motor
that pops up and allows it to have
this full screen display now for me I
think this was the most innovative
design in hiding a camera and even
unlocking the phone you feel like James
Bond you want to pull it out swipe it to
unlock checks your face and goes away
that thing is really really cool it
having a motor may cause some issues in
terms of the longevity of the device but
you can't deny the fact that this is
actually a very innovative design not to
mention it gives you room for all the
screen and no knotch
which we saw way too much of in 2018 now
when it comes to unique tech for 2018
there's no way we can't mention the
Apple watch series for now not
necessarily the Apple watch itself but
the ECG technology that Apple put inside
and for those of you who aren't familiar
the ECG records an electrocardiogram
which basically represents the
electrical pulses that make your heart
beat so now the Apple watch series 4 can
read your electrical pulses using the
crystal that's under the watch itself as
well as your finger on the actual crown
and with this it is going to be able to
detect your heart rate and then let you
know if you are possibly in afib and if
it basically means having an irregular
heartbeat it doesn't tell you if you're
having a stroke or a heart attack but
being in afib is a symptom of having a
stroke or heart attack but the Apple
watch itself does not detect those
things let's be very clear about that
now for me this is really unique and
cool because now consumers have access
to this information and they can share
it with their doctors and get the kind
of help they need if they find that
their an afib but where this really hits
home for me is I feel like this is
something I want to get my parents who
are a little bit on the older side as a
precaution just in case anything comes
up it doesn't hurt to have something
like this to help monitor your heartbeat
and make sure that everything's ok so I
personally think that this is a game
changer and the more people that end up
having this the more lives that could
potentially be saved and last on our
list four unique pieces of tech this
here is actually from another game maker
that's Nintendo so Nintendo created the
Nintendo lab Oh which is a really cool
and interesting way for kids to do a
little bit more outside of just playing
with their console so this whole thing
becomes a project for kids some can take
as long as 10 minutes to make
or two hours so if you've been looking
for your kid to go ahead and do
something that's more than stay behind a
screen you can at least get them in the
process of making one of these things to
at least interact with their switch so
this is a nice creative way for them to
do a bit more than sit behind the screen
and mash some buttons there are tons of
different inputs are you pass me that
label with the giant robot look at this
guy's so something like this the kids
can create this suit where they can like
walk around and act like a robot I think
this is really cool and innovative
especially since it allows them to still
play a game while being physical and
that's something that Tyndall's always
been about now the most basic version
we've got right here is actually an RC
car so we just threw the toy cons into
this cardboard piece and check this out
guys we can actually control it like
it's an RC car we going guys
I think that's cool Oh now can I turn it
around though
yeah it's loud though it's really loud
it's pretty much like Legos but for the
Nintendo switch I think that's a really
awesome concept but that about wraps it
up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it lots of awesome unique tech
that we saw in 2018 let me know what
your favorite was or if you have
anything different that you'd put on a
list but let me know it's a comment down
below tol next video guys it's your
average consumer face face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
