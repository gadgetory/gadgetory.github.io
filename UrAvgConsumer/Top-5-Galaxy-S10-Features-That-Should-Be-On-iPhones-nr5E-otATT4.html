consumer and today we're gonna go over
five features on the new Samsung Galaxy
S 10 that I wish came to iPhones now the
first feature I wish were on the iPhone
is Samsung's new supersonic fingerprint
sensor now this is a fingerprint sensor
built right into the display guys this
would be awesome on the iPhone because
ever since Apple took away touch ID I've
been missing it not gonna lie face ID is
cool but having that fingerprint sensor
would it be so much better and I
understand Apple's trying to keep that
screen to body ratio but for those of us
who really love touch ID it would be
nice to get it back in this form and
based on my time using the S 10 I think
it is a viable option it's very fast
accurate so I see no reason why Apple
should implement it into their display
not gonna lie I just really want some
form of touch ID back on the iPhone now
the second feature is wireless power
share that is an absolutely awesome
feature and for those of you who aren't
familiar with it basically the S 10 can
be used as a wireless charging pad to
charge wireless chargeable devices and I
know if Apple adds this feature we're
gonna see it blow up everywhere from
other phone manufacturers to even
accessory makers everyone's going to be
jumping on board to make their phones
compete with the iPhone or accessories
that can work with them and Apple's
already mentioned creating a wireless
charging case for the air pods hopefully
we'll see that with the air pods too and
just imagine those two working together
guys it would be amazing I just think
it'd be great to have an iPhone that can
charge things wirelessly whether it's
another iPhone or another phone in
general some air pods whatever it may be
it is a really cool and handy feature to
have especially when you want to save
somebody low on battery now the only
issue I foresee what that feature being
added on the iPhone is that Apple never
makes large-capacity batteries in the
iPhones so hopefully if they had it they
also add a larger capacity battery now
the third feature which I've been asking
for for years is a wide-angle camera
lens Samsung has finally added it to the
s10 and it is absolutely necessary on
the iPhone as well now there's a regular
wide-angle camera lens and they call it
wide but it is not
enough luckily though last year they did
make it a little bit wider than the
previous year but I want ultra-wide guys
I want to take landscape shots group
shots I want to be able to get a lot in
my frame and I've really been enjoying
the wide-angle lens on the s10 as you
guys can see here it takes a beautiful
photos and there's just so much you can
add to a photo now there have been
rumors and leaks of the new iPhone
having three cameras in the back some
very interesting stuff that's out there
but hopefully this is something that we
do see with the iPhone 11 and while
we're on the camera I say the fourth
thing I'd like to see is super steady
video you can shoot in 4k at high frame
rates the iPhone has a really nice
camera but it would be amazing to have
that super steady video so you can take
it a step further turn your iPhone into
an action cam that would be great your
iPhone would be able to handle a lot
more situations honestly with more and
more people using their iPhones to
capture content whether it's for
Instagram or somewhere else it would
just be something that adds to their
tool belt and I remember that person who
commented that the super study video is
going to change the game for world
soccer and last but not least but what
would be really really awesome is a
remappable shortcut button now the s10
has the Bigsby button but Samsung is
finally letting the reins go a bit and
allowing us to remap the button to do
other actions and the previous Galaxy
devices are also going to be able to do
this so it would be nice to see the
iPhone come out with a dedicated button
that you can just use to make the camera
pop out if you want to take pictures
really quickly you just press that
button you get into it maybe you just
want to pop open Instagram real quickly
if you've got a favorite app it would
just be mapped right to that it would be
awesome but that's my list guys if
there's a feature on the s10 that you
would want to see on the new iPhone
leave a comment down below let's get the
conversation going
hopefully Tim Cook is listening but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy a girl that gives this
video a thumbs up I'm gonna catch you
guys in the next one till then it's your
average consumer peace peace please
please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
