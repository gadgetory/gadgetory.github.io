consumer and today we've got a massive
Apple unboxing
right yes a massive Apple tech unboxing
as you can see we've got the new iPhone
8 and 8 plus the new Apple watch cases
watch bands all kinds of stuff and you
know we got to make a giveaway happen
for one of you guys and all you've got
to do to enter that giveaway is make
sure you're subscribed to the channel
and leave a comment down below on
whether you want an 8 or 8 plus and if
you're gonna leave that comment down
below also add your Twitter or Instagram
handle it'll make it much easier to find
you when I pick the winner in two weeks
and if you want to see me give away an
iPhone 10 God has that thumbs up button
let me know baby but let's open these
things up we're gonna start off with the
iPhones because that's probably why
you're here
now we've got three iPhones here but
I'll probably unbox the gold one since
it's the color that we're not very
familiar with this is the newest one and
then I'll show you guys what these look
like as well all right you ready I mean
this is actually arias iPhone so I get
to open up her stuff so Apple makes it
easy they've got a little tab here
things boxes are sliding open super easy
all right
so lose the paperwork aside and this is
it so here we have the phone and it
looks good this is a nice goal now it
has a pinkish tint to it so for those of
you who've asked if it looks a little
pink it does look slightly pink but it
gives off a real gold feel but let's
check out what's in the box you get
standard stuff like your wall adapter
your ear pods and you even get an
adapter for your headphones so you got a
3.5 millimeter to lightning adapter and
a lightning cable it's that simple and
something I'm noticing is that this
thing feels a bit heftier than the
iPhone 7 might be due to that all glass
back now that allows for wireless
charging but uh I like it it feels very
solid so I went ahead and opened up our
silver eight plus and our Space Gray
eight plus and I can confirm these are
heftier for sure but I gotta say guys
the glass back looks so so nice
this looks amazing I really really dig
the look of it it's you know it's crazy
to not put a case on this though I I
just feel like we'd be a madman I know
John and Austin and Marquez all those
guys are gonna do it y'all crazy and
something that's actually kind of cool
to note here is that you're just getting
two things on the back an Apple logo and
the word iPhone so none of that FCC
stuff no other text just those two and
it helps us look really clean now a lot
of people feel like this isn't much of
an upgrade compared to last year's model
but with this year's model you get cool
things like a true tone display which
allows the screen to adjust its white
balance based on your lighting and
everything around you and we also get a
new sensor for the camera which will
allow for better picture quality and you
also get some impressive video recording
settings like 4k and 16 frames per
second which is nuts to see on a
smartphone and if you get the eight plus
you also get that a new portrait
lighting feature which should be
interesting I'll have to test it out and
let you guys know how it works not to
mention there's also improved speakers
which are 25% louder and also have
deeper bass so that's pretty exciting
especially since there's stereo so I
can't wait to see what that experience
is like we all know that it has wireless
charging that's like the biggest feature
everyone's talking about but a feature
that not a lot of people are talking
about is the fact that it now has fast
charging and we actually have some
accessories here that'll allow us to do
that and I'll go over that in a second
but I have way more information on my
full video on the iPhone so make sure
you have your notifications on for that
video I also did a video on iOS 11 and
all the new changes that are coming to
some of the older phones as well so if
you haven't seen that I'll have the link
down below now let's see them watches
mmm boom so we've got two watches this
one's Aries this one's mine
so I'm starting with mine yo that crown
with the red on it I don't know why with
that I like the way that stands out so
we got the watch in here we also have
the cable to charge it as well as a wall
adapter and some paperwork but nobody
cares about that where's the easy open
tab
Oh Apple you film now I'm interested in
seeing this one because I don't think
there there's ever been a gold one so
this is supposed to go with the new gold
iPhones oh snap this like I said it has
a slight tint of pink to it the red the
little red on the digital crown right I
like it for the most part these look
exactly the same as last year's models
but there are a few changes that red
that we like so much indicates that it
has LTE connectivity so you have
cellular service and what that means is
that you can use your Apple watch to
make calls access things like Apple
music all kinds of stuff without having
your phone nearby so when you're making
calls we'll be using the same phone
number as your a regular phone but you
will have to get an additional service
with your carrier and I think it goes
for about $10 a month that seems to be
the price that everyone's going for so
that's what you can come to expect if
you want to use that LTE connectivity
now I mention that you'll be able to use
Apple music without having your phone
nearby but what's cool is that you can
even pair your ear pods to this and use
it standalone so if you're at the gym
you don't have to go and look for your
phone you can just control everything
right from your watch have your ear pod
connected to it it's actually really
really cool that there's that ecosystem
there that's starting to build up of the
Apple watch and of course there are the
nerdy changes these are supposed to be
70% faster things to apples neww to chip
and you also have 50% better power
consumption as well as improved
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity and we
actually got quite a few bands for these
so let's have to take a look at some of
the accessories so we've got all of our
accessories out here and like I said
these are the Apple watch bands that we
picked up quite a few this is all ferry
I got two but we actually even got
matching iPhone cases so we can switch
it up whenever we want but we do have
some new colors here so we're just gonna
pop these all open and just take a look
at them alright so we've got our Apple
watch bands over here as well as some
Apple cases and they've got some new
colors it looks like this is this pink
and this purple what they need to do is
bring back that marine blue that was the
closest thing to teal we have but I
actually really like the Apple cases
I've had them on my phone for quite some
time and
whenever my phone fell oh the one I've
never really had to worry they offered
pretty good protection which is
surprising because these aren't like
super thick or anything but I do wonder
how that's gonna hold up when it comes
to that glass back I actually really
like the silicone cases because they
offer some really good grip it feels
really good in the hand when you're
using it so if you've ever been on the
fence about picking up one of these
Apple cases I can definitely recommend
them I'm not gonna lie these bands even
though these are the sports bands they
look really good this blue has my
attention man this is the cobalt blue
I'm loving this and of course some of
you may know that they offer a leather
version as well this is the saddle Brown
this is when you want to go for that
classy clean look and I've seen some
people worrying about cases affecting
the wireless charging capabilities but
that shouldn't be an issue whatsoever
actually we have a wireless charging pad
over here by Mophie this is their
wireless charging base and you can see
it's actually pretty nice everyone's
picking up the Belkin version but I like
this because it's a lot slimmer and it
has a nice rubberized texture to it so
it's not gonna go sliding around on your
desk or your night table you're gonna be
able to just place it down with no
problem alright so we've got our iPhone
with silicone case throw it on here real
quick oh that was fast Wow as soon as
you put it down it starts charging
that's really quick and let's see the
leather case boom no surprises there
with cases they work and last but not
least we've got these guys here we have
some USB type-c two lightning cables so
that these can work with the new 29 watt
USB type-c wall adapters at least I
think these are new who knows now the
reason why you'd want this little
charging setup is so that you can have
access to fast charging and this is the
two meter cable baby you gotta get the
long one yeah you're not gonna have
access to the fast charging with what's
provided in the box with the iPhone
you're gonna need something with a bit
more juice now if you've already got one
of the new MacBook Pros all you're gonna
really need is the cable and you can use
the charging block that it comes with it
right with your iPhone kind of sucks
that you don't get fast charging with
what's already in the box
this setup together goes for what Eric
how much did you spend on this fifty
bucks for the adapter and I think 30
bucks for this
so that is 80 bucks guys it's a long
cable though right and that's a lot of
money guys it's a lot but that has
pretty much been our haul guys we've got
the new iPhones Oh in all the colors
they all look really nice the glass back
looks great and the new Apple watches
we're gonna be testing everything you
see here in future videos so definitely
stay tuned for that
now if you want to enter into the
giveaway remember subscribe leave a
comment down below on which one you want
and a Twitter or Instagram thing so
we'll get in touch pretty easily but
that about wraps it up guys hopefully
enjoy it and if you did be the cool guy
girl that gives us video a thumbs up
I'll catch you guys in the next one
until then it's your average consumer
