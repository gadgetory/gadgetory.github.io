consumer and today we're going to be
taking a look at a new 2d s XL and
seeing if it's dope or no now obviously
the first thing we're going to want to
do is jump right into the box see what
we get inside of it so let's see first
of all I want to note that this color
looks dope
it's blow leaning on the field side so
Booya whatever oh oh okay so we've got a
charge at this time and the 3dsxl x'
that we've been unboxing our you know
this you don't get these anymore and you
got to buy them separate but it's
included in the packaging here aside
from that we've got the console itself
and some paperwork that would you know
this is pretty much it in terms of an
unboxing yeah blue but it looks good
though
I like it oh I like what they did with
the fine it so over here in the very
front of the top screen it kind of
reminds me of an iphone to be honest
with the bezels on both sides it's all
pretty much the display where as before
with the 3dsxl you kind of had the
speaker's on the side so kind of curious
where they put them now but this is the
2d SXL it's very different from the 2d s
that was released a while back I'm not
sure but I never even picked limited
CBS's up because the styles are just
wasn't for me it's all one body but the
2d s XL now being in this flippable form
factor similar to all of the other ds's
this one falls in line with what I feel
would be portable enough for me and kind
of my form factor the only thing that I
notice is really different here is the
placement of the canvas so now you've
got a camera right down in the middle of
the hinge and you've also got it you
also got the other two right here in the
back of the actual bottom so if you're
laying this down you're kind of covering
the cameras not that I've ever used
those cameras to be honest but just some
of the changes that you kind of see here
now what I like here is the fact that
you're not really sacrificed too much if
you go for the to be XXL you get a
different form factor of course
from the 3dsxl all thing I'm really
missing is 3d now you still get all the
other features like a sea stick you got
your NFC so you have an Evo support and
it still has that new processor so it's
running just as fast
everybody fxl but I want to see how this
thing actually feels to play in the hand
it looks it seems comfortable when you
just hold it but let's give it a run and
see how it actually feels to use it all
right so I'm not to boot this thing up
but one thing I'm noticing already just
from handling it for a few minutes this
thing is getting a ton of fingerprints
already so prepare to have fingerprints
all over this look like it's gonna be a
fingerprint magnet all right so I'm
setting this thing up I'm actually using
the touchscreen a bunch so like plot the
stylist oh gosh this thing is tiny this
is the smallest olive I've ever seen
Wow why there's like an Ikea pencil
really short oh I can't even get a good
grip on it all right so I was trying to
actually pop in the game sense this
works just like the 3dsxl it has access
to all their games so I can use the
entire library even stuff from the
Nintendo DSi want to do that I have that
option but let's throw some good old
Pokemon why not I don't know I'm not too
crazy about this design this slot is
super thin so it just makes grabbing it
a pain maybe this thing had a bigger
slot where you house the Noda games and
the memory cards I'd have an okay time
with it but this is a little weak it's
actually a little disappointing it's not
too bad where I can't hear what's going
on though
but for max volume like even at the like
halfway I don't hear anything yeah
halfway is a whisper pink and lower than
that and you're not hearing a thing so
I'm not crazy about these pieces at all
okay so you know the game looks good the
only real difference that I'm feeling
here is that the edges are a bit sharper
so on this mute 3dsxl
they've got really round edges on the
side so you don't even really notice
that you're holding it but on this one
you take note that you're holding it
because of these sharp edges and
noticing alright guys so the sound thing
was bothering me a bit I just want to
kind of confirm just how different the
sound quality is between the two of
these especially with that placement so
just to make sure I'm not just talking
crap I'm going to figure this out right
now I bet you hear just one song that's
the 3dsxl if I mute this thing you can
faintly hear this guy the two DSX out
yeah that is a big difference I think
moving the speaker's was a bit of a
mistake so sounds a big deal to you
that's something that you might want to
note take note of naive about commented
on the sides being a bit sharp this
still feels pretty normal to using the
hand button layout is the same so
everything feels pretty normal the
c-stick feels good so in terms of being
able to actually just play your games
that you're used to that's not going to
be an issue whatsoever this has a very
familiar feel in the hand it's just a
matter of and kind of getting used to
those sides alright guys so it's time to
decide whether this thing is dope or no
now there are a few things about it is I
kind of just make me scratch my head
just kind of like this stylus over here
the fact that it's so short I'm not
really sure why they did that even the
3ds has a longer stylus so that's
something that's a little bit weird the
speaker placement is also a bit off to
me the fact that it's so much lower than
the 3ds XL kind of to fix me feel like
you're losing out a bit on this one but
that's all in comparison to previous
models and something else I'm honestly
not so crazy about is the fact that you
have this flap now in order to get to
your games and your memory cards and
honestly it doesn't have a big enough
slot so that it's just easy to pull down
and pull open I think that this is
unnecessary to be honest especially if
you're trying to change games really
quickly you can't do that here you got
to pull this thing out
take it out put it back in it's just
cumbersome but it does keep your game
and your memory card nice and protected
but if you're going into the DS line for
the first time I definitely think that
this is dope you get all the power of
the 3dsxl the new 3ds XL but without the
beauty features so you don't ever have
to worry about using the feature if you
don't want to and you say 50 bucks so
it's a better price point to enter the
DS line and you still get a nice big
screen which I would still recommend
over the regular 3d screen I like having
a big screen because you can just see
your content a bit better now if the
sound of something that's going to
bother you you can always use headphones
but let's make this clear if you have a
3d XXL already I don't think that it's
worth picking up one of these unless
you're just really in it for the design
I think this looks really good but in
terms of like the overall what you get
from it I don't think you need to go and
pick this up if you already have one of
those but that's about it for this video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you did
be the cool guard girl that give this
video a thumbs up I'll catch you guys in
the next one so that is your average
consumer face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
