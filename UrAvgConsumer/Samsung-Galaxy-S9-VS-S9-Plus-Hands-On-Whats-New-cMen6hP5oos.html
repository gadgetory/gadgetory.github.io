consumer and yes you read the title
right I got some hands-on time with the
Galaxy S 9 and s 9 class and here my
dots before we talk about all the new
changes you know you guys subscribe to
the channel because I'm gonna be giving
away an S 9 and and s 9 plus so you got
to be subscribed and look out for future
videos
where I'm gonna be giving one away now
first things first this is what the
phones will look like like previous
models the S line is gonna be coming in
with a 5.8 inch display and the s9 plus
is coming in at six point two inches
long and of course we've got that
beautiful infinity display with vibrant
colors
thanks to that Super AMOLED display now
the phone is gonna be coming in in three
colors midnight black lilac purple and
coral blue there's also gonna be this
great option available but that's
outside of the US now while they look
pretty similar to last year's model
there are a few physical changes like
the fingerprint scanner that's now under
the camera instead of to the right of it
as well as some more discreet sensors in
front of the phone and probably most
exciting in terms of physical changes we
finally have stereo speakers on the
galaxy line and I had a little time to
play with it and they sounded pretty
good they're tuned by AKG and have Doby
Atmos so if you're watching some content
tuned for Dolby Atmos you're gonna be
getting a nice surround sound feeling
right from the phone and from what I
couldn't tell they sounded pretty good
but I can't wait to get this in house
and really put it through its paces to
see if it's anywhere close to the razor
phone that one has really good speakers
but outside of that that's pretty much
where the physical changes stop I know a
lot of people are gonna be disappointed
by that but I'm sure Samsung is thinking
if it ain't broke don't fix it so you
still got your phone with an infinity
display power button on the right side
volume buttons on the left side as well
as that big speed button you've also got
USB type-c to charge it and guys it
still has the headphone jack so kudos to
Samsung for coming out with a brand new
flagship device in 2018 with a headphone
jack a dying breed but I'm glad Samson
sticking to its guns and I know some of
you are probably a bit disappointed that
there were no huge physical upgrades
there were some nice upgrades in terms
of the camera and ass off
we're now for me personally a good
camera is a big deal the s9 has a 12
megapixel camera with an 8 megapixel
front facing camera and the s9 plus has
dual cameras with a wide-angle and
telephoto lens
both the 12 megapixels and also with the
front-facing camera at 8 megapixels
pretty much the same as last year's
models and it looks like Samsung's
taking the camera really seriously on
the s9 and s9 plus by having a pretty
strong focus in low-light photography as
well as video the main wide-angle
shooter on both the s9 n s9 plus will
have an aperture of f28 4 but during the
low-light it'll automatically detect how
much light it needs and it can open up
to 1.5 which is actually really nice but
if you take your photography really
seriously you can jump into the pro mode
and change the aperture yourself with
the press of a button and what's
actually pretty cool is that you can
physically see the aperture open up on
the lens whenever you access this
feature they also put a real focus on
slow motion giving us 240 frames per
second at 1080p and a mind-blowing 960
frames at 720p and for my everyday folks
who are hearing these numbers I'm
wondering what they even mean basically
something that happens in a split second
if you're shooting at 960 frames per
second you're going to be able to
capture that so something that typically
happens in a flash you'll be able to
draw that out and actually see it happen
try not to my my ugly face here but
that's exactly what I'm talking about
and sometimes these things happen before
you even realize and hit the record
button but there's some pretty
intelligent software here that'll detect
the motion capture it before you're even
ready so you've got it captured before
you missed a moment but of course I'm
gonna have to test this out in a real
day-in-the-life
let you guys know how practical and how
useful it is so it's stay tuned for that
and Samsung's really taken advantage of
AI and a are here to add some really
cool features to the phones
the first being this new feature called
AR emoji you can pretty much create an
animated emoji with your face the camera
takes a picture of you and you can
customize it like add glasses change its
hair color hair style and even its skin
complexion which is really awesome and
one of the limitations that we saw was
the offerings in hairstyles re was a
little bit disappointed that she
couldn't find something
represented her big natural hair but we
spoke to some of the Samsung reps and
this is of course software so more
things will be added in the future and I
was actually able to take advantage of
one of these cooling features where she
was able to try on different makeup
right from the camera app and any of the
makeup styles that she liked she was
actually able to go in using Bigsby and
pull up where it's from like Sephora and
I think some other makeup spot but she
was actually able to go ahead see
something that she liked and find it
directly online with the press of a
button another pretty cool thing that
they demonstrated was actually big speed
translations big speed has the ability
to right from the camera app see
something that's in a completely
different language and translate it in
real time using augmented reality so
this is pretty cool for signs if you're
in another country or maybe you're
looking at a document or you just need
something in front of you translated it
can do that in real time and you can
even select the language that it
translates it to which i think is
actually really cool and while Samson's
always had the iris scanner they also
introduced facial recognition and they
even have a feature where they combine
the two and they call it intelligent
scan and I found out the facial
recognition and thankfully it's pretty
fast but honestly these are all things
that I really want to test out in the
real day-in-the-life
so you've got to stay tuned for that
video but if you're interested in
pinging when a pre others are gonna be
opening on March 2nd so definitely mark
your calendars and on March 16th are
going to be available in stores but that
about wraps it up for this video guys so
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video
but till the next one is your average
consumer pace so much more s-line
coverage to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
