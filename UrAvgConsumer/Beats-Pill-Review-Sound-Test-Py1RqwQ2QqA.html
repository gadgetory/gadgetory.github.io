consumer and today I'm finally going to
be reviewing the beats pill so let's not
waste any time let's get right into it
and alright guys here we have the beats
pill this is beats by dre snus addition
to their speaker line and as you can
already see it looks like a pill hence
the name but before we get into that
let's take a look at the case it comes
in as you can see the case is shaped to
fit the pill perfectly and this is
really nice it's a hardshell case but my
only gripe with this case is that it
fits the pill perfectly but that leaves
no room for anything else so adding
cables or the charger that it comes with
or even an auxilary cable is not
possible so all you can do is really put
the pill inside a word of caution to
those of you who are interested in the
white version of the pill the case will
get dirty very easily depending on where
you leave it it will attract a ton of
dirt and scuff marks or you want to be
mindful of that the beats pill does have
some great battery life it charges very
quickly you can play music for about 2 7
hours with continuous playback so I'm
very impressed by the battery life and
I'm happy that it doesn't take longer to
charge at all now here we can take a
closer look at the pill itself and as I
said before it does indeed look like a
pill the back has a really nice texture
it's a really soft coating and as you
can see it includes the line out in
power button Bluetooth indicator and a
micro USB port and it also indicates
that it has NFC and it also in the front
has volume buttons the volume up and
down controls as well as the button for
Bluetooth and below that you can find
them built-in mic for using with your
phone or anything that can utilize it as
we take another look at the back as I
said before it does have a nice coating
and it's really soft to touch but if you
do have the white version you want to be
mindful that it can get dirty very
easily one of the really cool features
of the beats pill is that it's NFC
capable so other NFC capable devices
like the Galaxy s3 or the Nexus 7 will
be able to wirelessly transmit music or
Audio to the pill by simply tapping it
against the pill and simply beamed the
music to it and it's a really cool
feature it's pretty similar to Bluetooth
as it's very easy to pair devices and I
really think it's just a nice bonus that
this little speaker does have that extra
capability now when it comes to actually
using the pill when you power it on
you're greeted by a little sound that is
pretty interesting but it sounds
something like this and of course when
you do power it on the be in the front
does light up red which is pretty cool
feature and when you turn it off you get
this sound saying goodbye and the
biggest or smallest thing about the
beats pill is its actual size and as you
can see when I compare it to my phone
that has a 4.3 inch screen but it's
really tiny and it's pretty much the
same size and as you can see when I put
it in my pocket it's very easy to get in
there and it really adds no bulk or
anything
due to its peer tidiness so that's one
of the really cool things about this
speaker and another cool thing and
probably the most important part of the
speaker is of course its sound quality
the speaker can get extremely loud
despite its size and even though this
video won't really be able to show you
listen in on a quick track
steaming up this and he's leaving
nothing laymen
I think I know why he cuz I said because
I'm bad now we all know you can't judge
sound quality from the video but I
couldn't help but give you guys a quick
example of how to sounded and I must say
I was really impressed by these speakers
they don't have a ton of bass due to
their is simple size but it does offer a
good amount of bass and it is very loud
it can be heard in multiple rooms
depending on where you have it so it's
really impressive considering how small
it is and the four speakers really do a
good job at projecting and putting it
this in a corner or something like that
is really going to be helpful to get
that sound to project across a room and
just to give you guys a quick example of
how it sounds outdoors we did a little
test and here it is alright guys so now
we're going to do the outdoor test for
the beats pill if you watch the beatbox
portable video we're going to do a
similar test to that where we're going
to play this from 50% 75% and then 100%
so we can kind of hear how loud it is
outside and I'm also going to be moving
backwards so we can know how loud it is
depending on how far you are from the
actual beats pill and my girlfriend here
is going to indicate whether she can
hear it clearly or not just in case you
can't really pick it up from the camera
so we're gonna actually be playing a
song called the cupid shuffle and I'll
explain what it is so you guys don't
think I'm crazy the cupid shuffle is
basically a song that's played a lot of
different parties and it's sometimes
played outside so we want to see if you
can dance to the cupid shuffle as a
start and dance you can dance the cupid
shuffle while outside using the beats
pill okay we're gonna try this out first
at 50%
we'll be ready yes all right let's see
so yeah
I can still hear it bitch
I love the color on
if a motor
so he got really far and he's coming
back now good good job I mean it's not
as loud as it beats portable but it's
cool alright so I got pretty far back
there now how was it um it was pretty
good I mean it wasn't as loud and
booming as the beats portable but within
this little area you could hear it so
alright so that's not bad at all
definitely probably not comparable to
the we've gots portable the people ox
portable the sound was piercing when
having at a hundred percent closed
nearby so this one was definitely a bit
more tolerable I didn't turn as many
heads here in the park so it was loud
but not crazy loud I mean I did but with
my PC dancing but okay all right so
that's about it for the sound test guys
alright so I hope you guys enjoyed this
outdoor test hopefully it gave you a
good idea of how far you can be from the
beats pill before it starts getting
really low oops
so as we saw in that outdoor test it's
not quite as impressive as the beatbox
portable but it does very well
considering its size you wouldn't expect
something as Tiny as this to project
quite as loudly as it does as I said
before it can definitely fill up a room
it would be fine for a locker room or a
party or anything like that so I would
definitely recommend picking this up it
does offer some great sound quality not
crazy on the base because of its size
but it still does very well with the
price of $200 and considering all its
features like NFC Bluetooth and coming
with a rechargeable battery that lasts
up to seven hours this is really a great
device and I would strongly recommend it
to anyone who's searching for a very
portable speaker that they can take
pretty much anywhere and I would only
recommend that you be very careful if
you're going to purchase the white
version I personally wish I would have
gotten the black one but I do feel like
this is really a great purchase for
anyone who is interested and I highly
recommend it and that's about it for
this video guys hopefully this gave you
some good insight into the beats pill
and if you enjoyed it please feel free
to rate comment and subscribe and I'll
catch you guys in the next video till
then this year I've consumed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
