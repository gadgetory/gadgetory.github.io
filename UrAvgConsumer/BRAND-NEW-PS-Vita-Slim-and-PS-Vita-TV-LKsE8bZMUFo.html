average consumer and today I've got a
video for you guys of Sony's newest
announcement of the new PS Vita slim and
PS Vita TV now I'm a huge fan of the PS
Vita so you guys know I had to bring you
this content so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it so the PSP is
coming to Japan October 10th no news on
wins coming to North America or Europe
but it's coming to Japan on October 10th
and it's gonna be retailing for about
$200 as usual and what's great about
this new PS Vita is that it's lighter
it's 15% lighter and 20% thinner and it
also has an additional hour of battery
life compared to the old one and also
now it has micro USB charging which is
amazing because micro USB chargers are
everywhere smartphones use it tablets
use it it's the standard and it's great
that the Vita is going to this now
instead of their proprietary USB cable
the Vita is also getting a new screen
it's going from oh le D to LCD some
might say that's a step back but we
haven't seen any performance yet so
we'll have to see how that goes they're
also coming in a ton of new colors from
black blue yellow lime green grey
there's a ton of new colors and it's
gonna be pretty interesting to see
people walking around with different
colors and see which one looks the best
and it's also coming with one gigabyte
of on-board storage now because it is
onboard storage Sony is decreasing the
price of some of the memory cards that
you can get now I believe the 4 gigabyte
is around $15 the 32 gig is dropped down
to about 70 and there's also going to be
a new 64 gig version so that's pretty
cool now these prices are all based on
like the Japanese releases so we're
gonna have to see what the North
American and European prices are gonna
be ranged that now this means that the
old Wi-Fi model is going to be
discontinued but the Wi-Fi 3G model is
still going to be available to insert
bundles so if you want that version you
still might be able to get your hands on
it and now for my impressions on the new
PS Vita system I think it's gonna be
pretty interesting we've seen Sony do
this in the past with the PSP they've
updated product like the 2000 and 3000
version which was always thinner and
lighter but I never really liked the
feel of that I didn't feel as premium
I always like the fat version the
original but it we'll see how this one
goes I definitely have to bring to the
channel to show you guys what it looks
like so we'll see then but that wasn't
all for sony sony also announced the PS
vita TV which is a very interesting
little system it's a tiny little 6 by 10
centimeter box or a device that actually
works as a PS Vita and you can put it
connected to your television and it'll
work as a PS Vita and it'll also work as
a PSP a Playstation one and it works as
an extender for the PlayStation 4 so
you've got a lot of functionality and
this thing is priced at of only 100
bucks
so the mic I said this is based on
Japanese prices and it's going to be
released in Japan on November 14th so
it's gonna be a little time before we
see that but it seems like it's gonna be
pretty interesting you can use it as an
extender for your PlayStation 4 if your
TV is occupied and someone's using it
you can actually use that on another
television and still play your
PlayStation 4 so it's gonna be pretty
cool and also what's interesting about
this it's not just going to stream your
PS Vita content to it it's it's own PS
Vita system so if you have a PS Vita
already and then you get that you'll be
able to do multiplayer between the two
it's also gonna have to use a Dual Shock
controller now this means that not all
PS Vita games will be supported by this
because they require touch functions on
the screen and the back panels and of
course the Dual Shock controller doesn't
have all of that so we're gonna have to
see which games aren't gonna be able to
go to it not all of them obviously but
I'm pretty sure that all PSP games and
Playstation or PSP games will be able to
work with it just fine now I'm not sure
if I would need something like this of
course because I have my PS Vita system
and I'll definitely enjoy having its
portability putting it on a TV is going
to kind of take away from the
portability of a PS Vita but it's gonna
be interesting because it has all those
functionalities where you're actually
going to be able to play the PSP
PlayStation 1 all that old stuff on your
TV so it's gonna be pretty interesting
to see I'm definitely gonna bring it all
to the channel and so that pretty much
wraps up this video guys I'm a huge fan
of Playstations portable lines so you
guys will definitely see it all the
stuff on the channel and um yeah um let
me know what you guys think below
do you think it's a good move are you
gonna be interested in that definitely
hold off on buying memory cards right
now if you're getting a PS Vita
regardless of the old one or the new one
the slimmer of that because the prices
are gonna drop so if you can hold out
definitely hold out on those memory
cards because prices are gonna be coming
down but let me know what you guys think
down below one whether or not you want
to buy this and I'll catch you guys in
the next video till then it's your
average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
