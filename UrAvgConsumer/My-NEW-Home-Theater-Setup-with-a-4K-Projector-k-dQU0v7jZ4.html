consumer let me welcome you all to my
brand new home theater
so guys welcome to the home theater and
let me just start off by saying this is
not a complete home theater there are
still a lot of things that I need to do
in here I mean just to give you guys an
idea
some of our sockets don't even have the
little plates on them so this is a real
work in progress the house is still very
very fresh so there's a lot of stuff
that we still got to add and I know you
guys are gonna go crazy when you see
certain things so don't be too harsh but
first off we got to talk about the most
important part of this home theater the
piece that kind of puts it all together
and that's this LG hua TKA aka the lg
Cindy being this is an amazing 4k
projector and LG was cool enough to not
only sponsor today's video but send them
one of these out for the home theater so
you shout-out to you guys but this thing
is awesome because not only does it have
like this really interesting design
where it's just kind of standing here
but it can also be set in different
positions as well so you guys see the
standing position here you can also lay
it down
you can also ceiling mount it and
there's just lots of different ways that
you can actually take advantage of this
and what's really cool is that it's got
this like retractable cable so if you
want to take this somewhere with you
it's portable and the quality is awesome
you can wash things in 4k
it even has HD r10 support so if you
want to have that full 4k HDR experience
you can have that as well
I've been using it for a lot of watching
my shows you guys know me I love me some
anime having a 120 inch screen to watch
anime on I'm telling you guys it's a
good time now I think one of my favorite
things about this LG projector is the
fact that it has the web os built right
into it so with this I can still access
hulu netflix all those smart features
that you expect from a smart TV they're
right in the projector so I don't have
to worry about plugging anything crazy
into it right now and that's kind of
nice because when I just had the
projector alone and nothing else in this
room I would just throw up something on
the straight-up wall and be able to
watch content so that was actually kind
of nice but now that I've got the screen
I've got the projector I'm pretty much
good to go and something that you'll
notice guys is that the image is
actually being bounced off of this
mirror
so that you can position the lid
wherever you want your image to be so as
you can see right now our image is on
the screen but if I come over here and I
just completely lift it up our image is
going to now shift to right above us so
now we've got it on our ceiling and you
can kind of just do all kinds of motions
and movements you can even tuck this
thing away in the back here so if you
want to have it like this you can do
that so take a look at that complete
control and the benefit of something
like this is if you have limited space
you can have a shorter throw or you can
even go ahead and position it on
something like the armrest of your couch
and still have it go to your screen
and speaking of screens this is the 120
inch elite screens edge free screen I
guess so this is the edge free screen a
huge huge shout out to my boy majest
text I stumbled across his channel when
I was doing research for home theater
tech and equipment and the dude puts out
some really good content lots of great
information so if you're looking to get
some info on how to set up your own home
theater things you need to consider you
got to check them out I'll have him
linked down below in the description but
I like the screen because it's got like
a really really small border around it
some of the ones that I was considering
had like really huge bezels and we don't
like that on our TVs no reason to have
that on our projectors and honestly this
wasn't that expensive for what it is so
I was really happy to pick this up and
with the LG Sinha Beam it's been a dream
to watch now around it I've got these
LED light strips and I'm gonna tattle on
myself and point out that I've got this
little cable hanging out right here so
this is one of those things that I'm
going to do a little bit later I'm going
to clean this up probably get a hole
drilled somewhere and kind of have this
thing tucked away it's a bit of an
eyesore but it doesn't stop me from
watching content so I'm not super mad so
the lighting gives it a really nice cool
effect these light strips aren't very
expensive we needed something that was
really long to cover the entire thing
Philips hue strips just weren't going to
cut it I tried but yeah this is cool you
can change it to all the kind of colors
you want this kind of matches some of
the other lights that we have in here so
I've got it on this blue but now let's
talk about audio and I know some of you
home theater freaks out there are going
to shame me for using a sound bar but
this is what I've got here right now I
actually plan to use this somewhere else
but I was excited to get this set up
completed so right here we have the LG
sound bar this is the SK 10 Y now this
is a Dolby Atmos sound bar so of course
you're getting that whole Dolby Atmos
surround sound effect it has the regular
speakers up front as well as the top
firing speakers so if you have sounds
like a flying helicopter going above
your head it's going to bounce the sound
off the ceiling over to you so you kind
of get that whole 3d immersive sound
experience so that's what we've got over
here and we also have a couple of
speakers set up behind our couches so
trying to get the whole surround sound
until I get a full dedicated system but
what I like about this sound bar is that
it plays very nicely with the LG
projector over there so syncing it up
was not an issue I was able to actually
do it wirelessly I just go into the LG
settings
they're both LG so they just happen to
sync up and we've got some little
speaker stands over here as well
we've got these just to give it a better
surround sound effect so I've got one
right here and I've got one right here
on the sides of these chairs so that way
you know you get the whole experience
and it's been nice so far I'm not gonna
lie to you guys this will probably be
fine for any regular person who just
wants to get better sound quality out of
their projector I know you gotta have a
crazy seven point two point four setup
in order to really go crazy but this is
what we got for right now but like I
said not only do I have the projector
here but I've got Xbox one X as well as
a PlayStation 4 Pro just a little
shout-out to the
I'm like messing up my system here my
playstation 2 playstation 4 this is a
doe custom-painted job from color where
they made it look like the ps2 so this
is really really awesome but uh it's
kind of nice to have both systems on a
120 inch display not bad alright so we
talked a little bit about some of the
tech the projector the games the sound
that screen but we gotta talk about the
seats baby so what we've got right here
is a three piece set from sikraft these
are some really nice recliners they're
powered recliners they've got some
pretty cool features too of course you
can do the whole typical reclining thing
so you can kind of sit back relax and
watch your content with no problem
you know just chilling but you can also
plug in something right here on the side
with the built-in USB port and not only
that but check this out guys we got LED
lights right here at the bottom even the
cupholders are LED lit and some things
that kind of like what these chairs not
only are they comfortable they recline
you can actually adjust the headrest as
well which is really really nice but on
the sides they come with these little
trays so that you can pop them right in
if you're eating something you know
while you're watching your movie dinner
and a movie you can get that all set up
you could have some popcorn
speaking of popcorn we're gonna talk
about that a bit more in a second but
yeah these are awesome chairs now
something that I'm really really in love
with are these guys right here
now these are also from sikraft I
believe and these are game changers so
when you want to relax you want to get
really close to the to the big screen oh
yeah you just sit back and relax right
here this is nice it can you can seat
two people so you know if Ari wants to
chill with me while we watch something
we can definitely do that but now these
are really comfortable we've got like a
nice velvet feel to them they're solid
so we talked about the tech
we talked about the seating now you know
we got to talk about the snacks come
check this out guys so over here we've
got a little snack in situation remember
that popcorn I was talking about we got
our own popcorn machine right here so
you know we got a little set of popcorn
here you got your butter your oil you
got the machine to make it all come
together this is really cool I don't
know how much I'm gonna use this because
I don't know if I want to clean it but
if everyone soak it up and make some
popcorn for herself I'm not even a huge
popcorn guy but area is so she wants to
use it so you can go ahead and go crazy
with it but what I am really really
excited about is the snackage I love me
some sweets you guys know that I always
keep sweets on deck and here we have a
ton to choose from
I'm just charged to everybody three
dollars if they come down here and ask
to get some snacks three dollars just
like the movies and for those of you who
might be looking for a way to do
something like this well we've actually
got right here is a kitchen cabinet so
this is meant to go up on a wall but
what all we did was put some furniture
glides on the bottom of this just so
that I can sit upright and we actually
added some LED lights at the bottom of
each shelf so that each of these snacks
can be illuminated even though the doors
are closed you can still see what snacks
you can get during the movie and if you
you don't want candy
you know we can go over here we got
chips we got Doritos Cheetos Fritos
Lay's we also got some chocolate bars
Twix Kit Kats Hershey Snickers the best
got some Pocky if you want and then over
here we have our Danby fridge now you
know you got to get some drinks for all
the superstars the friends the champion
the superstars again the leader we got a
bunch of drinks here soda galore we do
have water - that's like upstairs so you
gonna have to work for that one but we
got lots to drink um but that about
wraps it up for this video guys let me
know your thoughts on this home theater
so far trust me
it is a work in progress I still need a
coup stick paneling I need a more
dedicated home theater sound system so
the sound bar probably won't stick
around in this setup so you just gonna
be a lot of changes happening here but I
would love your opinions and you guys
let me know what you think of the LG
Cinna bean I personally love the form
factor of this guy it's got a lot of
functionality you can grab it take it
places projects a different kind of
walls so I think that's pretty cool
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed seeing
a quick tour in where we are with the
current home theater setup but till the
next video guys traverse consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
