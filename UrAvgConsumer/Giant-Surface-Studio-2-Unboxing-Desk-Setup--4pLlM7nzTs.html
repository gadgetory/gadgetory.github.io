consumer and today we have a giant
unboxing not quite a massive tech
unboxing but this is a big embossing
nonetheless and this is of the surface
studio tooth this is the latest version
of Microsoft's all-in-one and this is a
good-looking computer I saw it when it
was first announced and man I'm excited
to open this thing up
alright so peel off these stickers over
here such that we actually need to use a
knife but it's all good this thing is
all this presentation is just so so good
this is this feels like it's all scream
no this actually isn't that heavy ok so
we've got the surface studio over here
and unless it we've got a few more
things inside of here as well this of
course has to be the keyboard oh you get
the keyboard you also get the pen as
well as the mouse all in one little
package here I like that they include
the number pad right off the bat we also
have the pen which has a magnet kind of
throw that guy over there and we got the
mouse and we're gonna make a bit of a
surface setup once we're done unboxing
this guy and we check it all out what
else will we have we got some paperwork
over here I love you Microsoft but I'm
not gonna read this and once I have to
there's like a secret compartment this
has to be the power cable oh it's a
power cable of course that's pretty much
it this is a very very simple unboxing
and this is the base right here at the
bottom this is kind of where everything
goes on and in the back here we have the
i/o so we have four USB 3.0 ports as
well as an Ethernet port the area for
your power plug a USB type-c port as
well as an ADD ecard reader and a
headphone jack
let's actually power it on show you guys
why this thing is so cool
so guys we've got it on and this thing
is beautiful it is a big display here so
we got a 28 inch display 4500 by 3
thousand resolutions so nice crisp
beautiful display but for those of you
who are curious about the specs we've
got an Intel Core i7 processor in here
at seventh gen though I do wish it was
like an eighth gen processor but a
seventh gen it also has 32 gigs of RAM
one terabyte of storage and what's
really nice is that it also has an
nvidia gtx 1070 graphics card inside of
here
so gaming is definitely gonna happen
we're gonna definitely have to take
advantage of that i'm gonna make a
little setup out of this guy we'll talk
a little bit more about it but let's see
how it goes all right guys here we have
our setup for the surface studio 2 now
there's not a lot going on over here
guys I just added a couple of other
surface products here we got the surface
precision Mouse right here I find this
to be a lot more comfortable than the
one that it came with this is an awesome
Mouse it feels really good it's
ergonomic has extra buttons on the side
I even threw in the surface dial because
let's face it this thing was made for
the surface studio and it's great for
creativity using creative work being
able to choose different tools like in
Photoshop and other apps and if you
don't want to use those you can just use
it to scroll your page or even just
control your volume so it's nice to have
that bear as well and this guy wanted a
latest products to come out from
Microsoft the surface headphones these
are actually really really cool
headphones the way they work with the
surface studio as well as like your
phone you can seamlessly switch between
the two so I don't really have to do any
crazy pairing in order to use them but
I'm gonna be touching on that in its own
dedicated video I'll have it linked down
below for whenever it does come out so
you guys can learn all you need to know
about the surface headphones
honestly I didn't want to go super crazy
with this setup I threw in some Logitech
speakers over here these are the g5 60s
they have RGB lights in the back but you
know I'm trying to keep the surface
aesthetic here where it's like very
minimalist and clean and I've also got
an Xbox one elite controller right here
since this guy does have a gtx 1070
inside of it we're gonna be able to play
some games now with some good quality so
definitely something i'm going to be
excited to try out it's nice beautiful
display man how can you not those
computers definitely geared towards
creators the whole design of it is based
on that because you can just slant it
down like this grab the pen kind of get
started doing some work open up some
Photoshop look somebody wrote a
beautiful message over here but you can
use this to of course do whatever you
need to do I am no artist so I can't
really take advantage of Photoshop the
way somebody else would but you know you
get that idea but the surface to do to
guys the thing is a beast of a machine
it's got a great display obviously need
to test it out and see what it's capable
of but I was able to do some gaming on
him when I first tried it out so that's
something I'm really excited about but
let me know what you guys think this is
what a all out surface I had s setup
would look like if you try to put one
together and I'll catch you guys in the
next one hopefully you enjoyed it if you
did be the cool guy or girl that gives
video thumbs up and i'll catch you next
one guys till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
