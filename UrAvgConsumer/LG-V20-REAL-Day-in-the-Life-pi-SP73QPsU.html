consumer and today I decided to switch
things up a bit
I've got my hands on the LGV 20 but I
decided to give you a more raw real feel
of the phone by spending a full day with
me and the V 20 and today we're going to
be checking out things like the display
performance battery life camera and some
of its new features so let's check out
what I did alright guys so right now
we're on the way to the mall so we're
using the phone for GPS and it's a bit
of a shame because we've been going to
this mall for how long re four years or
something yeah we're like what getting
on for years
so as you guys know the V 20 has a
second screen so I can control music by
just tapping up there get a notification
to control it again that's pretty dope
of course I know you got all the other
stuff as well
and that's pretty cool because if you're
in the middle of something you're
scrolling up on Instagram boom you can
still control the music by just tapping
up there so that's pretty hot so I'm
using this thing and surprisingly it's
pretty sunny out and the screen looks
really good you know obviously this has
a quad HD display goodness sunlight so
we've got to test the story here I think
is the P 75 I'm gonna take some pictures
of it I'm gonna test out the wide-angle
lens
and the regular this is it normally and
with the wide angle that's a huge
difference
all right so we're going to see what
that looks like when we get it on a
computer but so far on the camera it
looks pretty good so air is going into
Sephora
again so I'm not even gonna go in with
you I'm gonna chill out here and uh he
souls me down anyway guys I'll probably
try out listening to some music while
I'm out here see you so the v20 has a
high fight back so I'm gonna see if
there's actual improve sound quality
while I wait for her so I'll just chill
here for a bit and try out a bunch of
different music alright so Harry took
too long I'm gonna have to gamestop
that's more my speed and so far this a
high five DAC it's a nice improvement I
see increased bass vocal sound a little
clearer I don't think I'd listen without
the high five back since I have it as an
option it's good I'm getting access to
the high five DAC is pretty simple all
you got to do is bring it down here turn
this on or off and that's it but it only
works with a wired connection so that's
something to keep in mind but like I
said you get a nice fuller sound with
this so I don't think I'll ever turn it
off alright so I got my little cousin
here trying it out don't mind his hair
don't mind it but he's trying it out let
us know if you hear a difference okay
sounds good right let's turn it off and
let's turn it back on yeah it's legit
right so one thing that I'm really
liking is how fast the fingerprint
scanner is kind of just put your finger
on it and you kill you get it on so you
don't even have to press the button
makes it really easy to turn it on
alright guys so right now we've got
cookie over here and it's time to take
her to the groomers so let's take some
before-and-after pictures
so we got the shot alright guys so
cookies ready we're gonna get some more
after shots and see how it looks
so here doesn't happen as good as light
as outside so we're gonna take some
pictures in here so you can see how some
low light shots look cookie you won't
get a tree you want to get a treat mama
alright let's get you a treat so I
fooled her how to use the treat word
alright cookie let's go Sophie time so I
just took the selfie but if you look at
it some but over exposed lots of white
her head over here you can barely see it
not so crazy about it but at least it's
a dark room so it tried alright guys so
mark has dropped a video so I figured
good time to try out the screen see what
it looks like when watching a you know
highly produced video Oh battery's dying
let's do that brightness up though
remember you may have seen the end of my
galaxy note senator view where I
mentioned if you have a purse pretty new
from galaxy note 7 I was exploding you
should return it still sucks that is on
just one side so you got a cup it what
it sounds good so number four is the LG
v 2000 with your phone feeding directly
against the note 7 a lot of ways for
your money so it should and I gotta
agree it is a good phone talked about it
more in a second video but this is a
phone that's flying under the radar as
far as great high end big smart phones
go
so guys right now I'm walking cookie but
I figured I might as well play some
Pokemon go but I did notice that this
doesn't play as smooth as I've seen with
other phones there's a little lag here
and there a couple of dropped frames but
for the most part you know this is
completely playable this is that you
know sometimes it does lag a little bit
but so far not bad hooks you ready to go
inside and we're back you guys let me
spend a full day with the v20 so here
are some of my takeaways the 5.5 inch
display is nice because it's a large
screen so that makes watching movies and
playing games enjoyable but it's not as
vibrant as I would have liked some of
the colors did seem a bit dull but
overall it is a nice display and it gets
the job done and a nice bonus is that I
was able to use this in direct sunlight
now the camera or cameras were pretty
hit or miss for me you can get some
really awesome shots with the wide-angle
lens but I did notice that some of the
photos would come out a bit overexposed
or soft which I wasn't too crazy about
but this is a pre-production version of
the V 20 so the ones that hit consumers
will probably be updated for better
performance now the additional features
that I found myself using the most
throughout the day was the second screen
and that fingerprint scanner the second
screen is a godsend if you use a lot of
apps because you can save them all at
the top and utilize whatever you use the
most without having to jump out of apps
and you also get that fingerprint
scanner which is really quick so if you
like accessing your phone by just
picking it up you can do that here too
now when it comes to performance this
did as I'd expect it's a high-end phone
with high-end specs so anything I throw
at it did really well but when it came
to playing games like Pokemon go I did
notice it stutter a bit so that was the
only issue with performance that I found
but for the rest of it regular everyday
stuff handled is just fine now one of
the most impressive things about this
phone is the battery I was able to push
it by using GPS watching videos just
browsing social media even playing some
games and listening to music and I still
ended the day around 9 o'clock but
what's awesome with the v20 is that you
can actually swap out the battery if it
dies on you and that's a feature you're
not seeing on any phones anymore so it's
solid to see it here but hopefully you
guys enjoyed spending the day with me
and the v20 and if you like this kind of
format let me know with the comment down
below I'll catch you guys in the next
one peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
