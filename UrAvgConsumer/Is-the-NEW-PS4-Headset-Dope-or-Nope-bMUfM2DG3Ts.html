consumer and today we're gonna be taking
a look at the brand new Playstation
Platinum wireless headset and before we
get into the video I just like to say
that I call this back when I reviewed
the gold wireless headset I said a
better version was gonna be coming out
at some point called platinum
I just want my kudos anyway now I'm
really really hoping that this can fill
the shoes of the pulse wireless headset
I love that one
the gold were pretty disappointing I'm
hoping this can fill up shoes it's not
gonna have the base impact feature let's
get this out it's not gonna have that
base impact feature but this has 3d
audio so that should be something new to
the game at least for Sony anyway all
right time to see these babies for the
first time huh
okay you give me a drumroll
okay oh they look kind of like the the
pulse not bad oh these are some big old
ear cups you see I try these on okay not
bad how do I look
that's fine that's fine but these look
good though
they look way better than the gold
wireless headset those I was not a fan
of but these I like alright so when you
pick up the Platinum headset these are
what you get you got a dongle so that
you plug this into your ps4 use it
wirelessly and you're good to go and
over here we've got a 3.5 millimeter
audio cable so you plug this up to your
phone or maybe you want to use it in the
controller or maybe a computer you got
that option here as well and of course a
micro USB cable to charge it and
surprisingly this travel pouch these are
actually foldable headphones so you can
actually put this inside of here go to
your friends house with it I guess
alright guys so let's examine these gear
cups that's where they put all the
features and buttons let's see if audio
jack micro USB plugs we can charge it I
see some volume controls over here and
it looks to me like these are actually
pretty flush into the headset so we got
the mute button your on and off switch
there toggles to switch between your
chat and your game sound so you can
switch between that and of course you've
got that virtual surround sound 3d audio
switch over here on the right side now
what's special about these headphones is
that feature in itself so you got
virtual 7.1 surround sound so that means
you know somebody's creeping up on you
with the gun you can hear footsteps
supposedly and you've also got that 3d
audio which is supposed to be like a
even bigger version of that so I'm not
sure how that's gonna pan out exactly
but right now there's only one game that
really supports that and that's
uncharted for Sony says this is gonna be
more games with this feature but we have
to wait and see if developers actually
jump on that but I'm gonna be trying
them out but I think I should give this
a try with some regular music right just
so I can let you guys know what that
sounds like made plans for you and now
wall let them follow through
I know it's kind of weird they sound
pretty good but I didn't have to pump
the volume up a little bit more than I
expected I don't know if that's a good
thing but I'm wondering if it's going to
sound any different when we were playing
actual games so I guess it's only right
that if we're gonna try it with all the
new features we play some uncharted 4
you might pass me that ps4 Pro check
this out guys the gamers paradise got
upgraded this is a PlayStation 4 pro
color we're actually hook this thing up
the gamers paradise is going to be
rocking a retro PlayStation 4 Pro and if
you guys haven't seen what the gamers
paradise is all about I have a link to
that video down below in the description
now this is a special PlayStation 4 Pro
obviously but there's only 25 of these
luckily I have one of 25 I feel freaking
amazing about that but there are only 25
so if you guys want to pick one up check
the link down below in the description
color where does an amazing job at
customizing gear like this this is just
it's amazing
so let's pair these guys together I
guess I'm gonna try you're going alright
guys so we do want someone charged
before I haven't tested out the actual
3d audio yet I'm gonna go back and forth
and see what the difference is so let's
try it out right now okay so I can
definitely hear the gunfire coming off
on the sides nothing too special
yo how are these guys getting back up
though okay I'm gonna turn him back
around alright guys so what I'm hearing
right now when we turn on the actual 7.1
surround sound / 3d audio is that you're
able to get a way bigger soundstage so
what that means is oh okay well what the
hell means is you're gonna be able to
tell where certain things are a lot
better than without it so that's
actually a really a nice improvement
when you turn it on and off so that's
pretty cool it's interesting it really
does feel like the world opens up a bit
and where things just get a little bit
more clearer
a bit more clarity like I said that open
soundstage sounds really good it is
definitely an improvement I do like it
now something I like is that Sony has
this headset companion app where you can
change up the presets to your gaming
headset and kind of switch up the sound
quality give it a little customization
now something that you'll see when you
actually go into this is that it has
developer made presets for your headset
so as you can see we have uncharted 4
obviously that in extensions Uncharted 4
supports the 3d audio and all that stuff
and they'll be the show is also going to
be supporting 3d audio at some point so
that's gonna be coming out and then the
Last Guardian is also here so you can
assume that that's going to also have 3d
audio now there's also some other
presets that you can use here but that's
more generic stuff these aren't features
that are gonna give you 3-d audio and
other games but they're generic presets
to change up your sound now let's get
down to the real question are these a
dope or note and let's be real guys
there's one game that supports this
headset and that's I'm trying for that
game is kind of old at this point so
it's definitely definitely not worth
getting a platinum headset just to use
pretty audio with that game I think that
it's a pretty decent sounding headset if
you already have a gaming headset I
probably wouldn't upgrade it I'd wait
for more developers a lot more
developers to get on board with the 3d
audio thing to at least make use of its
special feature but until then I
definitely say that these are a nope
it's really cool but the 3d audio does
you can hear sounds above you below
around it so that's all I'll gravy more
games need to support it so for now guys
save your money
wait so some more stuff comes out and
hopefully you enjoyed the video if you
did be the cool girl who you know this
thing and I'll catch you guys in the
next one until then is your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
