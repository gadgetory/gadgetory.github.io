average consumer and today I've got an
unboxing for you guys of the new beats
solo2 s now you guys have been flooding
my inboxes common sections tweets
Facebook everything you guys have been
asking me if I was going to unbox and
review these and of course you guys knew
I was going to so I picked it up for you
guys on the day of its release and hey
let's not waste any time
skur it into it and all right guys here
we have the new beats solo2 x' and let
me tell you guys this box is tiny it's
really small you cannot Palm it with
your hands nuts um but it's pretty much
the same packaging that you'd come to
expect you can see the new beats solo2
design which is similar to the new beats
studios but what's interesting is that
they call this the beats solo2 instead
of like solo HD 2 or whatever probably
because there was a solos beat solo
before so we'll see if there's an HD
version that might come out in the
future but this is tuned with emotion
we'll see how that goes
pretty much this is the look pretty much
standard stuff all the things you'd
expect nothing too crazy so let's pop
this thing open also this does retail
for $200 so it is the direct replacement
of the original solo HDS and the
original solar HDS are now priced at 169
99 so if you want to pick up one of
those still you can actually get that
for a bit cheaper so we'll throw this
plastic to the side and one thing to
that's interesting is that out of all
the beats in the line right now
I believe this old HDS will probably
have the most entry-level sound quality
basically saying it's not the best the
worst of the whole line but that is
because it's an entry-level it's what
the cheapest one out of all of them so
we're gonna see if this actually can
stack up against more of the higher
priced versions so let's pop this open
and see what we get and this is pretty
much standard beats packaging like I
said now it's just change the way you
hear sound pop this lid
and it looks like we get the same solo
HD carrying case so this isn't anything
new we're going to put that to the side
get some of the accessories out of here
there's a little tab you can pull that
open they all come tumbling down so here
of course you're going to have all your
product guides and warranty information
all the paperwork bead sticker all that
stuff so you can learn about your device
and warranty and all that so we can put
that to the side here we have a little
coupon for beats music so that's that
and also in here we have a regular
control talk cable so this one you can
actually use to work with your iPhone or
iPod Apple devices pretty much and the
play and pause button will work for
Android devices so it's a standard be
it's cable so we're going to put this
aside as well and you get this carabiner
clip what's that and pretty much that's
all that's inside of the box so let's
put this back and let's get here cleaned
up a bit and alright guys now for the
main attraction the bad boy let's check
it out open it for the first time and
boom here it is I did up for the black
version now I know this is gonna be a
fingerprint magnet but wow these things
are small uh they might be slightly
bigger than the originals though I'm not
sure but these are very small
nonetheless very tiny headphones so if
you want something really low-key most
not gonna be it says low keys beats can
get with a bright-red be there but um
this is it this is pretty cool this is
almost exactly like the new beats
studios but just a smaller version of
course you're not going to get active
noise-cancelling or anything like that
no batteries involved here you just got
the standard headphones and right here
is where you can plug in your 3.5
millimeter headphone jack overall it's
got a nice feel still pretty thin very
lightweight so this is really good but
I'm definitely good for anyone who
doesn't want a large pair of headphones
definitely be good for girls as well so
this is really cool
inside of the case you get you get
nothing else one thing that really sucks
that I'm seeing here is that they took
away the pouch so that means your cable
is just going to be thrown inside there
you can't really put it in there
securely so that's a bit unfortunate but
taking a look at the headphones
themselves they feel nice I'm definitely
impressed with the quality it feels just
like the studio 2s and you guys know I'm
a fan of the new studios so this is
going to this is definitely a nice
improvement design-wise
I'm just getting a feel for the ear cups
they feel pretty soft and you've got a
nice plush material here so it does feel
really soft definitely should be
comfortable and this is good because
these are on ear headphones they're
going to be resting on your ears instead
of going around them so you definitely
want these to be as comfortable as
possible and so far these seem like they
fit the bill
so pretty much this is it guys this is
the first look of the no beats solo2 I'm
going to actually compare it to the
beats solo HDS and any other headphones
you guys might want me want to see it
compare to so let me know down below
what headphones you want to see a
comparison between this and and um I
also have a review for you guys and of
course you'll see a girlfriend test so
stay tuned for that and pretty much
that's it for this video guys if you
enjoyed it be the cool guy that hits the

average consumer peace
