might have seen the world's thinnest
laptop in my minimalist gadget backpack
video the Acer Swift 7 and if you have
it
this thing is insanely thin I mentioned
I was going to be taking this thing to
CES not only because of super thin and
light but also because it has Intel 73
60 modem inside of it which basically
means the thing is always going to be
connected to the internet with a 4G LTE
connection so here's some of the cool
things I was able to do with the a
search for 7 while in Vegas for about a
week so here it is the world's thinnest
laptop Acer swift 7 very excited because
this thing has an LTE connection so I'll
be able to go all over CES and not have
to worry about the pretty bad Wi-Fi
that's out there can you imagine so I
don't have to share Wi-Fi and my own
connection I'm actually very excited to
see how this performs on the show floor
and one thing that's cool is that with
it being so thin and light I can just
throw it in my backpack
like it's no big deal alright CES time
and the airport was the best place to
get started since our flight was delayed
things can never go smoothly but I was
pretty impressed by how quickly
everything loaded up ok guys so we are
now in the airport with this bag you
know TSA was fun a hub but I got my
swift 7 right here and I'm going to see
just how quickly I could get for our
YouTube videos after you know just
sitting down and pulling it out alright
so let's pop this thing open
okay hop into Google Chrome go to
YouTube
yo this is so fast compared to like
Airport Wi-Fi this is nuts
so there's a lot of advantages to having
a built in LTE connection when you're
tethering one it's killing your battery
on your phone and two it's a slower
connection than what you'll get with the
dedicated connection this is awesome so
this is nice so now we can kill some
time while we wait for our flight by
streaming videos just surfing the web
and not having to worry about a slow
connection I can watch all the anime I
want airy and honestly that's what I saw
throughout my trip whenever I needed to
get on the internet maybe for a lunch
break or just leaving a break from the
craziness of the show floor I would just
be able to hop onto the computer get
online and have a really smooth
experience not relying on any crummy
Wi-Fi I think we often expect that when
we're on our computer and we're not in a
work or home environment we expected
have much slower internet accessible but
because I had that 4G LTE connection I
was able to have fast data just like I
would with my phone but on my laptop now
of course I could spend hours on the
internet watching videos web browsing
but it will see us have a lot of work to
do footage to get and had to send that
footage over to our editor back home
alright guys so right now we're in our
hotel room and I am actually
transferring some footage over to the
computer so that I can upload it so
right now it's transferring and it's
about 90% and then I'm going to upload
it to Dropbox so that my editor back
home can start working on it so I'm
going to try to compare the hotel Wi-Fi
speeds to the LTE connection that I have
inside of here and see which one's
better and you guys can see here right
now we're connected to LTE Wi-Fi is
turned off let's see what those speeds
are like alright so speed test let's see
okay 43 down 45 oh and then the hotel
Wi-Fi is not gonna be able to compare to
this but we need to see what that upload
is like nice nice or in the 20s very
respectful or we hint there nice ah all
right so we end up with forty six point
seven down and 31.8 up so that is very
very solid I'm gonna switch over to the
hotel Wi-Fi and see what numbers we get
there okay so like nine down which is
decent for our hotels not the worst I've
seen but it definitely doesn't compare
to what we just got from LTE and the
upload okay we're looking at seven eight
definitely fine for a hotel but LTE is
definitely the way to go all right I'm
good here let's get to uploading all
right guys right now we're on the
hotel's public Wi-Fi and it's saying
it's gonna take about two hours there's
a big pretty big file of almost seven
and a half gigs so we're gonna see now
if having that LTE connection is going
to make that to our estimated time
decrease so now we're back on LTE and
guys already it dropped by half so
instead we're just gonna be waiting an
hour to get this seven and a half gig
file uploaded so I am very very happy
about that and what's nice here is that
not only am I getting faster speeds but
I'm not on hotel Wi-Fi which could be
pretty sketchy sometimes so now I no
longer have to worry about checking my
bank information and worrying that some
hacker is going to grab my stuff since
it's not a secure network got my own
personal LTE connection in a hotel room
that's just beautiful
so yeah the biggest benefit to me was
not having to rely on public Wi-Fi
especially at a convention with a
quarter of a million people and to be
completely honest with you guys I don't
even know see has had public Wi-Fi to
begin with I had my own connection so I
didn't even bother to check I gotta say
I was really happy to have this with
seven Omni Center was lightweight fast
portable and one thing that I really
understood after using the Swift 7 is
why people went with
tablets that had LTE connection it never
made sense to me before but after having
this I want Wi-Fi on everything and if
you guys want to check out the CES video
that I did make I'll of course have them
linked down below in the description so
you guys can see what we worked on while
we were out there so now we are finally
back in Jersey we got off our plane and
ran straight to the studio to pick up
the car that we left there now it's
super charging because the cold did a
number on it but as soon as I got off
the plane I found out that I got an
invite to a launch event coming up and
right now I am looking for hotels I'm
just hoping that they don't cost an arm
and a leg now that everyone has gotten
that invite but for me personally what I
am searching for a hotel or flight
information I usually have a bunch of
tabs open so having a desktop browser is
ideal for that I don't know how arrey
does it on her phone that would that
would drive me insane but being able to
have a full-blown desktop or browser in
front of me so clutch and the crazy
thing about this all guys is right now
we're sitting in some parking lot oh and
we're able to look up hotels and flight
information on a computer without
needing an external Wi-Fi or anything
like that it's nice it's very nice and
honestly I think right there was one of
the moments I really appreciated to have
him a swift 7 I don't have a charger for
my car just yet at home so I've been
using these super chargers where I had
to wait for more than an hour to get a
full charge so being able to just look
in the backseat pull out my laptop
really quickly and jump on get some work
done like booking my hotels and
everything watching some videos and it
just really helped to kill time for me
but I gotta say I was very happy that
the a sister of 7 was my companion
during the trip it was so lightweight
and portable that honestly it made
walking around with it on the show floor
a breeze you don't want a heavy backpack
when walking around the show floor CES
take it from me I have a lot of
experience in that regard but having
something like this just made it so much
easier but one thing I will say about
the asus 4 7 is that even though it has
that really thin body it actually has a
metal chassis so this thing is very
durable it's not going to be a flimsy
piece of tech and you
we're able to see it but I wasn't really
actually get a lot of work done even do
some light editing nothing too crazy but
it handled everything I needed to like a
champ
I just really hope this is a trend that
catches on maybe inside will be able to
push more manufacturers to get on board
with having their modems inside now of
course the laptop isn't perfect there
are some things that I didn't like the
battery life was okay especially when I
was doing some more intensive work I had
to charge in the middle of the day but
aside from that this is a very solid
laptop and it gets my recommendation if
you can deal with the trackpad that is
like the biggest qualms that I have with
it but aside from that it is an awesome
laptop and this isn't the only laptop
that's Intel's modem inside of it she's
got to make sure you're looking at 7th
and 8th generation laptops that have the
modem but if you guys want to learn more
about those laptops I'll have links down
below in the description but that about
wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that gives this
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you
guys in the next video till then it's
your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
