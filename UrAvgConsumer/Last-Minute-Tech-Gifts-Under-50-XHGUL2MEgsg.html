consumer and we've got another holiday
tech Gift Guide this time with some tech
under 50 bucks and this is great if
you've got a million cousins like me or
maybe if you're at the end of your
holiday shopping budget these are gonna
be some great options for anyone in the
family or maybe yourself but before we
start I got to give a huge shout out to
BitDefender for sponsoring today's video
but Defenders is an awesome
cybersecurity software that protects
your PCs Macs phones or even tablets
from any crazy cyber attacks and they
offer a few options like BitDefender
20-18 that provides multiple layers of
protection and it provide parental
controls which controls and monitors the
type of content children are accessing
online and if you even got save files
which protect your personal pictures
videos and other files from being used
as ransomware
and for those who don't know ransomware
is where hackers will steal your
personal documents and make you pay to
get them back and one part of the suite
that helps me to feel really comfortable
is the advanced threat defense which
continuously monitors and protects you
even from the most advanced malware and
he even does things like scans networks
let you know which Wi-Fi is the most
secure to connect to as well as it
protects your webcam from hackers
accessing it like I said this has
multiple layers of protection so this is
an awesome choice for anyone in the
family whether they're young or seasoned
and if you're interested in you want to
check out the defender definitely check
the link down below in the description
and if you want to see a more in-depth
video that I did about bid defender I'll
have that link below as well so that you
can learn more about everything it
offers the next piece of tech that we've
got here is perfect for forgetful people
and that is the tile sport now if you
know someone that constantly missed
places their wallet or keys like re then
this is gonna be the perfect piece of
tech for them you simply place it in or
on any device that you constantly use
pair it through your phone through
bluetooth and whenever you misplace that
item you can use your phone to send out
a time to help you locate it the top
sport is the new and improved waterproof
and rugged version of the Tal slim that
I currently use in addition to being
able to handle a lot more mishandling
this thing also has a louder alarm and
has a 200 foot range which is twice the
amount of my car
I've been using tile a ton this year and
it saved my butt quite a few times so if
you guys know anybody who happens to be
forgetful or loses things this is the
perfect gift for them up next we've got
the Skullcandy jib with a headphone jack
going a lot more people are looking for
bluetooth headphones or earbuds to
listen to their music on their device
these wireless earbuds provide the
basics like an inline mic and remote
that you can use to answer your calls
and for controlling your music you've
got a decent six hour battery life and
these all come in at a price that won't
break the bank
in the box you get the earbuds a cable
to charge them a smaller set of earbuds
if you need them and three three months
of youtube red and in terms of sound
quality these were pretty decent I
usually don't expect much from earbuds
in this price range especially when
they're Bluetooth but this was pretty
surprising they also come in a few
different colors like red teal and this
nice purple my only real gripe woodies
is the lack of volume controls in the
inline remote I feel like that's
typically what you'd come to expect with
Bluetooth earbuds but these were missing
it you can still access music controls
like play and pause but you just can't
control the volume unless you're doing
it from your phone so that's something
to keep note of but at 35 bucks I feel
like this is our solid Buy especially if
you know someone who's rockin ear pods
or whatever headphones came with their
phone I think this is a good option to
replace it and the perfect thing to go
with the jibs is this multi power
capsule if you saw my favorite I get a
month then you saw this guy this is a
rechargeable case that's pretty much
made to protect and recharge your
Bluetooth earbuds and like I said more
people are leaning towards Bluetooth
earbuds these days so this is a great
option to make sure that they're always
charged and ready to go the case itself
is made out of this rubber-like material
and it's semi hard but still pretty
durable when you're done using your
earbuds all you've got to do is plug it
in zip it up in the case and you're done
it includes a 1400 milliamp hour battery
which doesn't sound like a lot but when
it comes to these wireless earbuds it's
more than planning it'll definitely be
able to charge them multiple times over
the case itself comes with a micro USB
cable since you can charge most
Bluetooth earbuds with it but because it
includes a regular USB port you can
pretty much use any cable that you want
with this I've been using these for the
last few weeks and it's absolutely
helped to keep my hair but it's charged
so these aren't a staple in my backpack
and the thing only cost like thirty
dollars and considering some wireless
earbuds can range all the way
like $200 or even more these are a solid
investment to make sure they stay safe
and charged and one with this list be
without a nice Bluetooth speaker and I
actually found a really decent one for
only 38 bucks by Sony this is the SRS XP
10 wireless bluetooth speaker now I have
the speaker in red but it comes in black
white and even blue what I see being
pretty appealing to a wide variety of
people I'm actually digging it's really
light and portable design as well as the
material choices that they used to make
this this speaker is definitely easy on
the eyes it's stylish and definitely
looks more expensive than it actually is
the sound quality is also really good
for its size and price but I have to
admit it could be a little bit louder
max volume is definitely gonna be fine
for most people it doesn't get quite as
loud as the bose micro 2 but that cost
about 70 bucks more than this which kind
of makes sense as an impressive 16 hours
of battery life so it should last all
day and it's even waterproof you
definitely don't have to baby this thing
which makes it perfect for being on the
go taking it to the pool or even buying
it for some teens and like with most
Sony extra based products you can
definitely hear the dump with this which
I'm all for when it comes to Bluetooth
speakers but what's even cooler with a
speaker in this price range is that it
includes cool things like NFC and it has
the ability to have a stereo speakers if
you want to add another one to the set
now take two of these at this price
would make a really inexpensive and
impressive combo but that about wraps it
up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it hopefully you got some cool
suggestions now this is not going to be
the last gift guide there are going to
be more at different price ranges so
definitely be on the lookout for those
but till the next one guys add ravage
