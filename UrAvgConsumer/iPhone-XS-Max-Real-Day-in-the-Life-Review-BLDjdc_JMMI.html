consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day in the life with the
iPhone 10's max and for those of you who
have never seen one of my real day in
the live videos you're pretty much gonna
be spending the day with me and the 10s
max and we're gonna see all kinds of
things like its performance battery life
what that camera is like and we're gonna
put it through its paces in the real
world and see how it does so here was
our day okay guys so we are starting the
day I'm actually headed to the studio
but if you see behind me there are a ton
of people that'll know what's going on
but I just happen to pass by a huge
crowd but either way we are shooting
with the front-facing camera of the 10s
snacks right now so this is the audio
and the video quality that you guys have
come to expect but I have to leave the
distracting crowd head to the studio and
get the day started we are at a hundred
percent I use the phone for like a phone
call but yeah not a big deal and it is
12 o'clock having a late start
who would've thought right
but I think that's enough testing of the
video capabilities of these cameras now
we're back on the regular camera and I
think it's time we head out we launched
a video today we got what we needed to
do done in the studio it's actually a
budget edition version of some cool
accessories you can get for the phone
I'll have that link down below so you
guys can check it out but let's get on
out of here and have our day right Ari
alright and I'm not listen guys I'm not
walking around with this phone like this
mama ain't raised no fool let's get a
case on this bad boy ain't breaking over
$1500 phone come on now all right guys
so we are on our way to the mall and
we've been driving for about 27 minutes
now actually been driving for 25 minutes
and we've been using GPS for that long
and let's see 84% so I think we got in
here when it was around 91 so took a bit
of a hit with the GPS but we still got a
lot of battery left and a lot of day
left so we'll see how it goes alright
guys so we're in the mall and areas over
there looking at shoes so this is good a
time as ever to play some games but
there's something that I noticed that is
a little unfortunate with that 10s max I
don't know if you guys can see the
knotch
is blocking some of the content on this
game and that isn't something I've dealt
with on the iPhone 10 but it is visible
here it looks like we're gonna have to
wait for app developers to update for
the resolution of the iPhone 10s max but
I will say guys from a performance
perspective this thing still does do its
job the a12 chip oh snap talking too
much you guys are messing me up again
hey hey hey hey hey hey go buy your
shoes please so this is one of those
games that I love to play is called
hyper heroes but look up here guys
you'll see that my currency I can't see
any of what's going on there this is
actually pretty unfortunate and I can't
get out of here we already got all these
boxes here well yeah so that kind of
stuff it kind of sucks that I'm not able
to see it okay guys so we are finally
out of Macy's IRA took forever in there
it is like four o'clock right now and
we've got 72 percent battery left I was
playing a lot of games I had to keep
myself occupied because I was falling
asleep but uh yeah 72 still got a lot of
day left let's see how it does and I
just realized the Sun and I even though
it's kind of cloudy but this would be a
really good time to try out the smart
HDR feature I want to see how it does
with the portrait mode effect using the
front-facing camera so let's see if I
can get a decent shot off here try
another one like this get some color in
the background all right let's take a
look and see what we got
it's actually pretty nice now it is
super cloudy the sky does look a bit
blown out so not bad the selfies
actually look pretty good though nice
and sharp backgrounds bored out looks
good and while we're out of here taking
pictures I figure we'll take a picture
of some flowers this wouldn't be a tech
review without one so let's see if we
get a nice cool picture in here let's
see what we've got here for just a
random snap I liked what I'm seeing here
colors are nice and vibrant looks pretty
sharp this is the portrait mode one some
good detail this is this is pretty nice
for just a flower by the sidewalk this
is really good and we have to stop by
the Apple Store real quick guys because
listen I want to protect this phone at
all costs you see that Belkin screen
protector I got one of the tempered
glass ones from the Apple Store
they actually install it for you so you
don't have to deal with making it
perfect or anything like that just let
them do it
it cost a bit more but I'm telling you
guys it is worth it I scratched my
iphone ten screen pretty bad and I'm not
doing it with this one it is way too
expensive so
just stop to give some food and this is
actually the perfect time to see how the
max feels with one-handed usage and it
takes some maneuvering I'm not gonna lie
I feel like I'm shifting my hand a lot
more to reset in places but one feature
that I use on almost all the iPhones
nowadays is reach ability and that is
playing a really big role especially now
since the top of the phone is just so
far up so just swiping down on the home
button I get access to the top of the
screen and I can just do whatever I need
to do reach ability I feel like it's
very important now especially on the max
or you can use a pop socket like Ahri
says but I'm not gonna do that now we
gotta take a picture of the chicken it
is not gonna pick this up let's do this
Apple bottle instead portrait mode now
there was supposed to be an improvement
to portrait mode for those finer details
that kind of hard to capture
they never claimed that it was going to
be perfect but they said it was going to
be improved but it does still struggle a
little bit especially when it comes to
determining certain edges so it got the
sticker pretty fine but it blurred out
the bottle and the top of it as well so
not so hot but something that's actually
pretty cool about the new portrait mode
effect is now you can go ahead and
change the aperture so I can change the
aperture here and make it even more
local issues at the box oh yeah bringing
it all the way to the front nice and
clear I got some decent bouquets on its
own well you know gotta make it bow
knishes baby back and do you guys see
that sunset so I want to see what kind
of dynamic range we can get out of the
camera are supposed to have that new
smart HDR so let's see what we get here
yo the colors though dang that is nice
so let's look at some of the darkest
points this car over here looks pretty
good even some of the brightest points
like these lights they don't look
completely overexposed or not being
they're not too harsh on the picture but
let's see what the non HDR version looks
like you know honestly even the non HDR
version looks pretty good yeah maybe
once we put on the computer I'll be able
to tell a bit better but as of right now
even between the smart HDR version and
the regular version they both looks
really solid this is a really good
camera not to mention this is pretty low
light so guys arrey is on FaceTime right
now and there's actually a feature and
it's more of an iOS 12 thing -
absolutely just hate it's not really a
feature it's just the way they changed
FaceTime
like I always got her an emoji going
right now guys check this out when you
want to switch the camera you no longer
just press that button right there and
you can't even do it over here you have
to swipe up or press the screen hit this
button and then hit that button that's a
lot of work compared to what it was
before so now he's got me being her
camera man as usual I'm always the one
who gets her nice Instagram photos photo
cred - Jed always that is absolutely
true
so now I'm gonna put these through a
little bit of Lightroom see if I can
make them look really good and ready for
Instagram all right we rendered that out
really quickly and it's headed your way
stop plugging yourself so right now
we're trolling the basement I'm watching
mr. Ken bonitos video on Austin's
Channel and the screen looks really good
here guys
but that's not what we're really
checking out here what I want to hear is
the sound quality now Apple has improved
the stereo speakers of the new iPhones
and I gotta say guys it's actually
pretty impressive so check this out
so this right here sounds good but
bringing it up all the way to the max is
actually really solid now I've tried
this out with other shows and whatnot
and it sounds really impressive it's
much louder than your typical iPhone and
it is actually really impressive when
playing a game like asphalt 9 it just
sounds crazy oh and the crash is epic so
just to give you guys a battery update
it is 848 p.m. and I've got about 33%
less all right so we're looking at 3
hours and 57 minutes of screen on time
and honestly that was a lot lower than I
expected for the max yeah I do have 33%
left
hmm so that's kind of interesting that
we're getting a lower number in terms of
screen on time we'll see how it lasts
throughout the rest of the night
hopefully I don't clunk out before it
does but so far I've I had to put it on
the charger so we'll see so one more
quick update I was just looking for a
picture to post on Instagram and I was
looking at the portrait selfies that I
took and actually I see a really big
difference between the smart HDR version
and the normal one the smart HDR version
I see a lot more detail on the sidewalk
to the right of my body and you don't
see as much over on the selfie without
HDR so you're seeing a lot more detail
and that's actually very nice you'll
also notice that my hoodie it doesn't
look as faded as it does with the
regular picture so this is an overall
better shot a lot of the things that
might be a little bit overexposed you
get all that detail back with the HDR
shot that's actually really impress
and could be a game-changer I think
everyone should have that HDR feature on
when they take their photos
unfortunately it looks like we have to
go back to the studio we have some more
work to get done a couple of videos
we've got a wrap-up
it is currently 9:57 and we've got 13%
battery left so I don't think this phone
is actually going to beat me today I'm
probably gonna be up longer than it will
I really don't even know why we teased
ourselves coming here arey
now I'm tired I am super tired but duty
calls and I was pretty much our day guys
now that was a pretty interesting
experience I gotta say I did expect a
little bit more with the 10s max right
off the bat I wasn't super impressed
with the battery life I really thought
that I'd see a lot more than I got with
the iPhone 10 but it was probably the
same for me I don't know why that's the
case I saw a lot of other tech youtubers
mention it having really great battery
life some saying the same as me that it
matched their 10 so I'm not really sure
what to think of the battery life as of
right now but through my current
experience it hasn't been really an
upgrade which I will say is a big
disappointment because that's what I
really got the max for now of course
with the max you have that bigger
display what content just looks really
really good on it of course you have
those nice BIG's new stereo speakers
that are improved and they sound amazing
guys I mean really really good so this
is a huge improvement compared to the 10
and it definitely makes watching content
or playing games that much more
enjoyable at full volume now personally
for me where I did have an issue with
this new bigger display while it's
awesome and the sound is awesome all
that is great I really had a hard time
using it with one hand now everyday
regular stuff wasn't so bad you do
definitely get used to it but what was
kind of a deal-breaker for me guys it
was not really even what happened
throughout the day throughout the day
was pretty fine but it was at night
where I ran into my real issues so me
personally I do tend to use the phone a
lot in bed and where I had my biggest
issue was just kind of laying on my side
scrolling on my phone I had a really
time holding the phone in a position
that wouldn't make it fall out of my
hand
honestly it was a lot of shuffling with
the phone in my hand trying to get to
the top of the screen and do all kinds
of stuff that would I feel like I'll
have a really hard time getting used to
because just maneuvering the phone like
that with one hand it's just not for me
and it's not really the size of the body
that's an issue there for me because
I've come from the iPhone 7 plus 8 plus
so those were no problem because they
had smaller screen now with that much
larger screen you're dealing with
swiping at the very bottom or swiping at
the very top to give you notifications
there's a pretty wide gap between the
two of those so navigation as a whole is
pretty difficult with one hand unless
you're willing to do a lot of shuffling
with your hands now when it comes to
performance who are we kidding
these phones are absolute beast I'll be
able to do whatever you want them to do
there's absolutely nothing that you're
gonna be able to throw at this phone and
if not be able to handle heck I could
even say that with the iPhone 10 but of
course having that eight 12 Bionic chip
and all of its power does allow the
phone to do a bit more than it used to
before in the past and it's more about
what can developers add to their apps to
take advantage of this power and that's
why we're seeing the growth of AR and
things like that we're getting way more
power in our phones and we're able to do
a lot more even really cool things like
using the measure app to figure out the
distance between things in your home
that to me that is a mind-blowing app
guys it's kind of crazy but yes now the
iPhones can do more than ever whether
it's the iPhone 10s or 10s max now let's
talk about those cameras and I will say
I am very very happy with the cameras
they performed really really well one
thing that's really cool is that
portrait mode effect now portrait mode
is a big feature for me I did find that
now all the pictures I took came out
perfect in terms of edge detection and
things like that there is still some
room for improvement there but there
definitely has been improvement from
previous iterations you now also have
the aperture control feature so if you
want to add a little bit more bulk into
your shots make it a little bit more
blurry in the background you can do that
I think that is a very very nice touch
and as a portrait mode fan I'm happy to
see these improvements and new features
added to it I also found that photos
came out a bit brighter liking the
mid-tones and the shadow areas there's a
bit more detail in there now and with
that smart HDR feature there's
of detail everywhere whether your frame
has something really dark and something
really bright you'll be able to see and
distinguish what's actually there
because there's just a lot more detail
and smart HDR that's a really good job
at stitching together all those
different photos and making it a really
nice single photo and one thing I
noticed that's pretty interesting about
the cameras is they pick up a lot more
lens flare so if that's something you
like then you're gonna see a lot of it
here but it is something I noticed quite
a bit more in my photos so whether you
love or hate it that's something you're
gonna want to know because it's
definitely more present now when it
comes to the front facing camera it did
a solid job
I didn't notice some people complaining
on Twitter about it doing a smoothing
effect and I guess it's like those
beauty modes that other phones have for
me I don't got no rule issues with it it
didn't bother me I are even noticed on
herself once you took a couple of
selfies so it is there if you hate that
feature unfortunately the camera
settings don't really allow for you to
turn that off I don't know I posted a
selfie on Instagram for the first time
in forever and got mad likes so Who am I
to complain something else that was
pretty interesting that I noticed is
that the lens seems to be just slightly
wider than the regular tens camera so if
you have the 10s or 10s max you do get a
slightly wider lens which is nice
because you're able to get more in your
frame that is a welcomed addition I
always want the wide lens to actually be
wide and the telephoto lens go ahead and
be a telephoto lens but Apple moving in
that direction is really really good
overall guys where I stand with the
iPhone Tenace max is that I've used it
trying it out and I honestly don't think
it's for me I'm probably gonna go down
to the iPhone 10s I honestly prefer to
just have an easy one-handed experience
the screen being bigger didn't really do
much more for me than the regular iPhone
10s so I feel like I'll be more
comfortable using the 10s instead of the
10s max even though the 10s max has that
nice big beautiful display great
speakers but the iPhone 10s pretty much
has a beautiful display and great
speakers as well so I'm just gonna go
for comfort here and probably downgrade
since I wasn't able to see a really big
benefit in battery life which is
probably the biggest reason why I went
with the max in the first place but that
is my take guys I think I'm going to end
up switching to the 10s
they're both great phones oh just a
matter of comfort which one is more
comfortable to use for you what's gonna
be more comfortable for me I think is
the regular 10s so I'm going to be
jumping on that train I'll keep you guys
updated if I actually make the jump
though because I got all my stuff on my
tennis max right now but we'll see I'll
keep you guys posted make sure you
follow me on Instagram Twitter all that
stuff so you can know what's happening
and if you haven't entered into my
giveaway of a brand new iPhone 10s and
10's max I'll have that video linked
down below in the description for you
guys to try it out but that about wraps
it up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy or
girl that gives this video a thumbs up
and I will catch you guys in the next
one so that is your average consumer
piece that that's really long intro
outro that's a really long I'll try I
gotta top that down
these guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
