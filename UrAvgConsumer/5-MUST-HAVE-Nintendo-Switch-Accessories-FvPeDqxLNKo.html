consumer and today we're going to be
looking at five must-have accessories
for the Nintendo switch and first up on
this list we've got the official
Nintendo switch premium console case now
the Nintendo switch is a portable
console so there's a good chance you're
going to be taking this thing around
with you maybe throwing it in your
backpack your bag however you want to
carry it but you're going to want some
protection whenever you take it around
there's a standard Mario or Zelda
version of the case so you can pick one
based on your personal preference
but what's cool is they all come with
microfiber cloths that have to do with
the case itself so with this case you've
got a nice lots pro your switch in even
with the to Joy cons connected to it and
you've also got 14 slots to hold games
there aren't that many games out right
now but if you build up a collection
over time the case will have you covered
so you've got some pretty good
protection as well as the ability to
carry your games around and this thing
only goes for like 15 bucks so if you're
a bit more hardcore than that and you
want to bring more of the accessories
along with you there's also the game
traveler deluxe system case that is a
crazy name but this thing holds a lot
now this means a lot bigger but it holds
a lot more to you can bring your switch
with the joy cons attached you can also
bring the charging cradle as well as a
joy con grip or the pro controller and
you can of course bring the AC adapter
HDMI cable and it even has to game card
cases as well as the case of some
microSD cards so you've got everything
you need to take the system on the go
wherever you want and considering this
is a Nintendo system which usually has a
lot of party games like once we switch
Mario Kart you're going to be able to
bring this to a friend's house and be
able to play along with all the stuff
that you need and here we have the
SteelSeries artistries now this is an
awesome gaming headset with a built-in
adjustable mic that goes for about 80
bucks which is the same price as a pair
of joy con controller but what I really
like about them is that they feel like
they were made just for the switch but
looks and cost besides they're also
really comfortable which is great for
long gaming sessions and we all know
this which is portable but you can
actually take these with you without
looking like you're wearing some crazy
gaming headset while you're outside you
can use these for the switch but they're
also great enough for any other console
like the Xbox one or ps4 next up we've
got the Serge grip kit with
is perfect for those two-player games
when you're using a single joy con in
both hands you'll notice how really
small they are and if you're used to
using a regular controller you're going
to want something that will give you a
better grip and that's where these come
in all you have to do is pop a joy
cotton in and you instantly got a bigger
easier to hold joy con you still have
access to all your buttons and it even
has some included thumb grips for the
joysticks which you could use even if
you're not using the grip and for 15
bucks if you're going to be using the
switch a lot with someone else
these are definitely worth picking up
and here we have the Aki 30,000 milliamp
hour portable charger now I've talked
about this portable charger in other
videos and it is a must half of the
switch I'm not going to lie the battery
on the switch could definitely be better
so it's a nice bonus that it comes with
USB type-c
it would suck if you came with a
proprietary cable so shout out to
Nintendo for going Universal but with
that natural hot battery life you've got
to make sure you've got a decent
portable charger on deck and I highly
recommend this one you can play in
handheld mode while the switch is
plugged in which is perfect since the
switch is all about gaming on the go and
a bonus with 32,000 milliamp hours is
that you're able to charge the switch at
least five or six times or you can even
use it to charge your regular phone man
you guys know how portable chargers work
but this is a good one especially for
the switch but make sure you get the
version with USB type-c I'll have that
one linked down below but if you also
want a cheaper alternative I'll have
some other suggestions down below as
well and this is an easy one you're
going to want a micro SD card to go
along with your switch which is which
you get 32 gigs of storage with access
to about 25 what's going to get eaten up
really quickly if you plan to get any
digital games so with micro SD cards
being so cheap these days it's
no-brainer to pick one up that'll give
you more space for your system I got
this 128 gig for about 40 bucks and
that's definitely a good value for the
amount of games you'll be able to store
on it 64gb is also a pretty decent
option which is quite a bit cheaper so
I'll have links to all those as well now
I've got a couple of bonus suggestions
first being a screen protector now the
switch is a portable system I'm going to
be drilling it in your backpack it's
going to be taken along with you
everywhere you're going to want to make
sure that screen stays clean me
personally I went with the screen
protector by
it's what officially-licensed screen
protector but the thing works really
well it has a nice system for
application so if you have a hard time
putting screen protectors on this thing
is going to help out a lot but traveling
aside you also run the risk of getting
your screen scratched up by using the
charging dock as you're putting the
switch inside the dock over and over and
over the hard surfaces of the dock
itself can actually lead to scratches on
your screen what you don't want so you
gonna want to get a screen protector so
you can be protected at home as well now
last but not least is also the pro
controller now this guy is about 80
bucks so it's a little bit on the
expensive snotlout's a lot a bit on the
expensive side but if you use the
traditional gaming controllers this one
might feel way more comfortable than the
Joye cons so it's a good option to have
if you want to be comfortable while
playing your games and I actually really
enjoy it it's a very solid controller so
I definitely think it's worth picking up
but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you didn't know I have a giveaway of the
switch going on right now thumbs up if
you like giveaways but I'll have a link
to that video down below in the
description as well so be sure to check
that out enter free Nintendo switch do
it but if you guys enjoyed the video be
the cool guy or girl that give this
video a thumbs up I'll catch you in the
next one till then it's your average
consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
