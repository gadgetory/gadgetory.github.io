consumer and I know tons of you guys
always ask me in like almost every
single video that I put out what's the
display I'm using is that a PlayStation
Vita monitor or a Vita TV and I figured
I finally give you guys a review of the
PlayStation 3 display that I have back
here so let's not wasting your time
let's get right into it and all right
guys here we have the PlayStation 3d
display and this is probably one of the
best looking displays that I've seen in
quite some time it's actually my
favorite looking display it's got a very
similar look to the PlayStation Vita or
PSP with the curved edges with the
curved speakers so that's really nice
it's not your regular rectangular look
so it's kind of outside of the box no
pun intended
and it looks really nice in my opinion
it's got the really nice sleek black
design it's very thin like an LED TV is
it's very thin it's just a beauty to
look at anyone who's come across my TV
and you know take a good look at it
always says the same thing like wow that
thing is gorgeous so it's definitely a
beaut I absolutely love the design of
this display 100% there are some flaws
with the display though it is very
beautiful and nice to look at but it is
a sining display or a glassy display
rather and that can be a little
troublesome at some points when you're
playing and you're in a well-lit room or
you've got a lot of sunlight or whatever
it can be pretty reflective you can see
the reflection of things in the room
that you're in or yourself maybe which
can be a bit of a problem when you're
trying to focus on you know what you're
watching or the game you're playing
whatever you're doing on the display so
it can be a little frustrating to see
that you know reflectiveness but it is a
nice display nonetheless now let's talk
a bit about the hardware of this guy now
we've got a 24 inch display here with
full 1080p and on 24 inches that might
be a moot point to some people but it
still looks very nice regardless
and it's got a refresh rate of 240 Hertz
so it's going to be really smooth when
you're playing your games and all that
so it's definitely good stuff there and
of course the biggest thing about it it
is 3d but we'll get into that 3d in just
a second the display also comes with
inputs for your component cables to HDMI
slots as well as a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack so you can plug in
headphones or your speaker system
whatever you like so you can listen to
it so I'm a big fan of that because I
personally use speakers with my display
and it really enhances your experience
with it so I really do like the fact
that I can add external speakers on
there with pretty much simple ease by
just plugging it in to the headphone
jack and as for the two HDMI slots
three would have been like perfect but
two is not bad as well I'm able to
switch between using my computer and my
PlayStation with no problem but three
would have made it perfect for adding
another gaming system so I got like my
xbox and my ps3 as well as my computer
but two does the trick not a really a
big deal also on this TV you have two
speakers and a subwoofer now the sound
quality on this isn't extremely great I
know the subwoofer is like a really big
deal considering its a subwoofer in a
television or display rather and that's
cool and all but it doesn't sound as
great as you might think with a
subwoofer in it it just sounds pretty
right alright nothing to run home about
it's pretty regular stuff but it will
satisfy the needs for anyone who you
know wants to listen directly from the
display alright so now that we've talked
about the hardware a bit let's talk
about some of the things that you get
inside the box when you actually
purchase this of course you're going to
get the 3d display you'll also get an
HDMI cable that has the PlayStation logo
so that's pretty cool and it's about
like a 6 foot cable so you don't get
crazy lengths from it but it definitely
does the trick so it comes with that and
it also comes with a pair of 3d glasses
so with this you're going to be able to
check out all the 3d content and have
fun with all that and with the 3d
glasses is pretty cool because it has up
to 30 hours of battery life on a full
charge so definitely no worries about
having to charge these all the time and
it's also pretty cool because the 3d
glasses the way they're shaped they're
pretty large so those of you who do wear
normal glasses you'll be able to throw
these on top of that without any real
problem at least that's been my
experience with my girlfriend she has
glasses and she's able to throw that on
without any trouble so that's pretty
cool for those of you who have to wear
glasses and you'll also get a microUSB
cable to charge the 3d glasses so that's
definitely a bonus and you'll also get a
game called motor storm apocalypse and
with this game it'll demonstrate all the
3d effects that you can possibly get out
of the 3d display so you've got this
regular 3d as well as the simu view and
for those of you who don't know a single
view is you're able to have 2 players
play on the same screen and see two
completely different things based on
what player they are so we no longer
have to play with that annoying split
screen that has all your content
squished on half the screen and the
other person has their half over there
gone are the days of that with the 3d
display and there was pretty cool
because there were no signs of me seeing
my girlfriend's car racing unless it was
on the screen passing me by or something
which is really cool so it's not like a
half big job it does the trick and it
does it really well and just a heads up
you won't be able to use 3d while you're
using semi view all the 3d stuff is
being used up for that and I just want
to let you guys know give you a heads up
because I was looking forever trying to
find how to turn on the 3d when using
that feature so if you only do one at a
time definitely want to let you guys
know that so you won't look around your
settings as much as I did but overall
it's a pretty cool game to demonstrate
that it's not the best game in the world
but I mean it's okay definitely does the
trick and definitely shows off what it
can do with the display now one thing
that the 3d display did not come with
that was a huge bummer is that it didn't
come with a remote I just don't get why
it wouldn't come with the remote it it
baffles me really but thankfully you can
buy the remote for about 20 bucks on
Amazon or anything anywhere else it's
really really cheap but it just doesn't
make
since why it wasn't included in the
first place but who knows now as far as
performance goes
I love the 3d display playing games on
the display is great it makes really
nice and crisp to look at is 1080p
everything looks great a beautiful game
like Final Fantasy you'll be able to see
all the details all the good stuff very
nice display I don't think anyone can
complain it can get very bright too so
when you're playing bright games it's
really nice and as you guys already know
I use this as a monitor for my MacBook
Pro and it works wonders there I'm able
to surf YouTube edit videos on there do
all kinds of stuff watching YouTube
videos in 1080p on this is just perfect
I can't complain about it whatsoever as
a regular monitor for a PC really does
the trick there honestly guys if you
want this for a gaming display you're
not going to be disappointed as far as
the average consumer goes definitely a
thumbs up for me in the gaming
department I can't complain about
performance whatsoever it's been a great
and phenomenal display in my opinion and
I really loved it but of course it's not
all rainbows and roses for the 3d
display there are a couple of bad things
that come along with it as well there's
been tons of people who've had issues
with the screen going black and then
coming back on and you know going black
again coming back on every couple of
hours or minutes depending on how bad
Bears was now I actually ran into one of
these issues before myself and then I
had to exchange it but you have to be
careful of that because I'm not sure
what causes it if it's overworked or
what but you really want to make sure
that you get a fully functional unit one
that doesn't show any signs of you know
those kinds of issues as far as the
screen blacking out and coming back on
I would definitely return it if you run
into that because it's just going to
keep happening and happening I wouldn't
risk it but luckily I always purchase
insurance from Best Buy when I'm
purchasing a TV or headphones or
something like that just in case
anything goes wrong
I know I can come back and switch it out
now I do that for the you know
items like headphones and TVs because
those can break on you and I figured why
not just pay the insurance and I'm able
to swap it out and I already told you
guys about the reflectiveness that can
definitely be an issue as well and one
of the other cons that I have with this
display is that the buttons are actually
in the back of it so you have to kind of
feel out in the back what button you're
pressing and you have to kind of get to
know where the buttons are when you're
first pressing them because there's no
indicator in the front or anywhere that
will tell you which button you're about
to press once you do press it though
there is something that comes on the
screen so you kind of have an idea but
there's no guide in the front of the
actual panel that'll let you know so
that can be a little troublesome at
first can be a little annoying and it
takes some getting used to
now the last issue that I have with this
is that of course even though it's a
beautiful display and it's very thin
it's super thin because it's led but it
doesn't have anywhere for you to mount
it so you're not going to be able to
throw this on with a standard mount I
think maybe you can possibly make one I
don't know if there's any way you can do
that but there's no regular way to just
go ahead and mount this onto a you know
wall or and you can like that but it's
not technically a TV so I don't think
that's probably why there's no wall
mount or anything like that for it but
overall I really do love the display and
what's great about the display guys is
that you get a ton of different places
with huge deals Amazon sells this for
like half the price that's like 250 or
something like that so there are tons of
deals out there for this guys just do a
little hunting and you'll get great
deals just make sure that you can get
insurance with it though I don't know
how much warranty covers from Sony but
if you get insurance from one of these
stores like Game Stop or Best Buy you'll
have no issues if you come in to you run
into any problems I think it retails for
about five hundred normally but I
haven't seen at that price for ages but
um pretty much that wraps it up guys
I definitely recommend this unless you
have a really well-lit room that you
know it's really bright because you will
see those reflections but other than
that I fully recommend this display it's
amazing it
works well with my computer works well
with my gaming systems it just does
everything I needed to and I fully
recommend it and that's about it for
this review guys hopefully you enjoyed
it and I'll see you guys in the next
video till then is your average consumer
until next video guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
