consumer and it's about time but I
finally got an unboxing for you guys of
the audio technica a teenage m50x now
you guys know I've already done the M
50s but a lot of you have requested the
m50x to see what the differences are so
we're gonna start off with this unboxing
and hey let's not waste any time let's
get right into it
Bob Bob Bob sub by Bob and alright guys
here we have the ath m50x these are
professional monitor headphones but a
lot of people just like to use them to
casually listen to music and things of
that nature so I have multiple purposes
for my m 50s so let's take a look around
the box and see so of course we've got
the actual headphones and we've got a
couple of different cables here so you
guys will be able to see that and if
you're an audiophile this does come with
some specs on the box so you can know
exactly what you're getting and enough
of this let's open it up this is a
pretty cool packaging I must say so
let's see what we've got
I don't see any tape here so it doesn't
look like we'll need the unboxing knife
so push this open also we've got the
Audio Technica logo up front and let's
see we've got the headphones and of
course since these are the X version
they don't have cable so it's got a
detachable cable that can get put into
these so we'll put this to the side for
now over here and let's take a look at
what comes inside this thing first
so we've got some manuals and some
warranty information all that good stuff
so we can put this to the side and this
is the Cape the carrying case that comes
with which is a very nice carrying case
it's got this Audio Technica imprint
here so this looks really really good so
definitely some nice stuff feels very
very nice so we can put that to the side
push this over here as well and let's
see what else we've got in the box so
this little thing was holding a couple
of cables
and it looks like we've got three
different cables here so you've also got
a locking guide because you have to lock
the cables into the headphones when you
put them in there so that's what this is
so a little bit more paperwork but
enough of that let's uh put this away so
we can start taking a look at what we've
got inside here all right so here we
have it now we have the three cables
here overall the box had pretty nice
presentation really liked what we got
out of there and let's open this stuff
up and see what we've got this is a
piece of tape so I'm going to use mine
on boxing knife to kind of just open it
up a little make it easy there goes that
I want to rip anything so let's see the
first cable we've got here is a straight
cable now this is a very very long cable
much longer than what most people will
need if you guys can already see this is
quite some length right here and we've
got a ton left over so I'm not going to
open that up all the way I believe this
is let's see on the box the box says
that this is a three meter cable so
they're the coiled version is also three
meters so this is very very long and
these are monitor headphones so usually
you'll have this plugged into a computer
or some kind of audio equipment and you
know you'll be able to move around
freely within three meters so not bad
and like I said this is the coiled
version which a lot of people are
accustomed to would be regular em 50s I
know that's where I'm used to I don't
have the EM 50s let's see if I can get
this open so a lot of people are used to
dealing with this kind of cable and it's
a long table definitely shorter than the
straight cable because of the coil but
it's still a long cable nonetheless so
that's what we got here and what I'm
most excited about is actually this
cable and I'm excited about this cable
is because it is shorter than the other
two and you can use this for more
practical reasons like you know going
outdoors with it or anything like
that so this is really nice and it's a
fake cable so that's really nice as well
so I'm really excited that this just
helps the ATH m50x be a bit more
portable then the m50 is were in my
opinion so very nice stuff here now
let's get to the actual headphones
themselves here we have them open it up
and here you go now first thing what's
the first thing I'm noticing is the ear
cups are softer the ear cups are
definitely softer than the original the
original felt like it was made out of
like a paper ish material it's hard to
explain it was still very comfortable
but these are more plush and the let you
can feel it
this feels a lot better so definitely
really good stuff here I'm really
excited about this and the headband
seems to have a bit more cushioning as
well so that sounds that's really good
so I really expected this to be the
exact same headphone now design wise it
looks pretty much the same but I'm
liking is that they definitely took some
attention to comfort when it comes to
the ear pads and the headband so that's
really nice and of course over here
right above the audio-technica symbol
you have a singing ath m50 not sure if
you guys can see it but let me give you
a quick close-up so here you guys have
it ath m50x
so that's the another differentiator
between this and the original m 50s so
overall pretty nice stuff and at the
bottom here is where you can plug in the
cables now one thing that's different
about this headphone is that it doesn't
use your typical 3.5 millimeter jack to
plug in the headphone cable so as you
guys can see here this one is smaller so
you're not going to just be able to take
any detachable cable and plug it into
these m50x and because of this locking
mechanism it's a proprietary cable so
you're not going to be able to use
anything but well audio technica
provides so at least these are
detachable and you can probably get some
more if you need to but let me show you
guys quickly how you get it together so
there's a little hook here so you guys
can see where
you got to turn it so it's going to go
in like this and then you turn it and
then it's locked
once the two white parts line up they're
locked in place and you're good to go
and that's about it guys there's a quick
look at the m50x this looks very
promising I'm actually really really
excited to try it out I love my em 50s
because I use them for a wide variety of
things when it just comes to music
editing my videos making sure I have the
greatest sound quality possible for my
videos so I like to use this a lot when
I want to test it against other
headphones and things like that so a lot
of uses for my em 50s this makes it a
step up this retails for about 160 9.99
I know the m50 is retail for pretty much
are pretty close to that price but you
can find them for so much cheaper on
Amazon but since these are brand new you
probably won't see any significant
savings on Amazon Jess yet but uh I'm
sure you'll be able to find some deals
out there but I'll have some links down
below in the description if you're
interested in picking these up and I'm
sure you guys will be I definitely do
like some of the changes I'm seeing here
already
so that's about it guys this is the m50x
this is a headphone that really needs no
introduction we know how the m50 is
perform so I'm just going to give you
guys a review and let you guys know how
the stacks up in comparison if these
comfort changes are the only changes and
what you can expect if you want to pick
these up so that's about it for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the cool guy that hits the
like button and I'll catch you guys in
the next video till then it's your
average consumer peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
