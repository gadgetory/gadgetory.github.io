consumer and this is a real daily life
with the Galaxy Note 8 now if you've
never seen one of my real
day-in-the-life series this is when we
spent an entire day with the phone
we're gonna be testing out things like
the battery performance those new dual
cameras maybe even that S Pen but let's
see how it does alright guys so we're
starting our day in the studio I've got
a lot of work to do but this is the
front-facing camera right now the
quality that you can expect the audio
you can expect so that's that but today
I've got to work on this video then I'm
headed to a meeting and then later on
I'm gonna be taking my little cousins
back-to-school shopping so that'll be
fun but uh I think it's work
alright guys check check these out
Microsoft has sent me these two
controllers for the destiny to launch I
didn't even know it was from Microsoft
or else I would have you know saved it
for a massive tech unboxing but we got
some new controllers these are actually
really awesome and they also sent me
some codes for destiny too so I have two
codes here one I use for myself and the
second one I'm think I'm gonna do a
giveaway on Instagram so you guys has to
be on the lookout for that
and in order for me to do that I gotta
take a picture good opportunity to use
the no date so I'm gonna try to set up a
nice little shot here
alright using that I'm actually using
the telephoto lens for this shot I'm
zoomed in so let's see if I can get a
nice flick
check this out guys this shot looks so
good and when you zoom in it's still
super sharp that right there that's
quality folks that is quality now
there's absolutely no reason to be
surprised at the quality of this camera
because Sam some kind of kills that when
it comes to cameras so that looked
amazing
expect to see the giveaway up on
Instagram at some point maybe in the
next couple of days huge shout out to
Microsoft for sending that out but I'll
have the link to my Instagram down below
if you guys are interested in a free
copy of Destiny - alright guys so right
now I'm getting some b-roll for this
video
what you're hearing right now is me
listening to some music with two
Bluetooth speakers so right now look I
got this beats pill plus and I got this
Bose Soundlink mini - and they're both
playing from the X the note 8 so the
note 8 has you know bluesy 5.0 so with
this you can sync two audio devices at
once through bluetooth and have them
both play so while I'm shooting my stuff
I like to have music playing having it
come from - Bluetooth speakers it's just
awesome only thing that sucks is that
there's sometimes a slight delay let me
pull the volume up and see you might not
be able to hear but there's like a super
slight delay I try to hit playing pause
to try and let them sync up over and
over again sometimes it works sometimes
it doesn't but it's cool I like that
so it's killing my battery but that's
fine alright guys so that's a get out of
the studio and then finished the video
yet but I gotta head over to this
meeting and times a-tickin so a really
awesome benefit to having such a long
screen on the note 8 is being able to
have 2 apps open at once and the maps
and the music app it's like ideal for in
the car driving you can see where you're
going and you can see what musics
playing even though you probably want to
control it with this guy instead of
having to mess with the screen too much
but still it's really awesome so I'm
back in the studio trying to finally
wrap up this video but I gotta say guys
after being out in the real world with
this phone it's a little bit scary when
I first got my hands on it you know
shooting the first video that I did it
didn't feel so bad in the hand I was
able to do whatever I needed to but once
you're outside and there's concrete and
just things for this thing to fall on
you become a lot more conscious of how
big this is and how easily it will slip
out of your hands so I ended up actually
throwing a D brand skin on air this is
my favorite skin to use right now gives
us some nice grip and texture so that it
doesn't fall out of my hands I don't
want to throw a case on it just yeah I
want to get the full feel for it but I
needed some kind of assurance that this
thing wasn't just gonna slip out of my
hands but definitely keep that in mind
if you're planning on picking up
no.8 but I'm gonna try and finish
wrapping up this video finally and then
I'm gonna go change cuz I think it's
about to rain
then I'm gonna take my little cousins
clothes shopping for her back to school
so after a busy morning of shooting and
working hard we are now taking this guy
tigress we're taking him to go shopping
yeah back to school schools tomorrow so
yep so Ares off my little cousin finding
some kind of clothing my mission is to
find him some decent sneakers and I'll
take a couple pictures of them send it
over to Eric see what she thinks
now you know what I want to see how this
a live focus shot will do so this is
like the iPhone 7 plus is portrait mode
where it makes the background real
blurry less beome alright so let's see
what that's light and check this out
call my other little cousin is my
cameraman right now call check this out
see the background and see how it looks
all professional light yeah it's
actually it actually did a pretty good
job and then when you want to see the
normal picture you hit this that's the
normal picture with a live focus one
other way we don't know what you mean
what the Levi's Levi's is not a sponsor
so while we're waiting to pay for these
clothes showing these guys the new
Dragon Ball Z fighter trailer or dragon
ball fighter Z on the new screen call
what you think this the screen is
amazing and the game is amazing so did
you ever see this trailer Chris look at
it looks dope right I am buying this
game and in fact if anybody wants to
play me I'm ready
alright so we're done shopping with the
kids now we're just out here walking
cookie and they've got these LED lights
going crazy at this bar over here
but ya know date low-light shots this is
what you can expect yep very camera
cookie
Pokemon's stay what's up baby alright so
little cousins gone actually went and
got myself a little haircut and I figure
this is a good time for a selfie I'm not
a selfie taker but you got to do it when
you get a fresh cut all right guys so
the game was paradise isn't really that
well-lit well it's lit but doesn't have
a lot of light here I don't have my
recording lights but we're gonna do a
selfie thing anyway and see how it goes
that's like and these actually aren't
bad I consider you just to be pretty not
low light but not that much light but
these actually look pretty good I'm sure
if we were outside and there was still
sunlight and everything like that
these were turn out to be really awesome
so in terms of the selfie camera I'm
pretty impressed I was able to get about
four and a half hours of screen on time
so honestly as of right now is a solid
phone four and a half hours isn't a big
deal but we got quick charge and there
goes the day now of course I've been
using this phone way longer than what
you saw in this video but here are my
main takeaways from it absolutely nobody
can deny that Samsung is making some of
the best smartphone hardware that we've
seen to date the note a is a beautiful
phone it feels very premium and it
performs just like you would expect it
to and it has just about every feature
Under the Sun except for a removable
battery now I have very few qualms with
the no date but something I wasn't too
crazy about honestly has to do with the
design now trust me I know the note
series always features a giant display
but because in though it has a much
slimmer design I found it a bit awkward
to use with one hand it fits in my hand
with no problem at all
but because of the way I like to hold my
smartphones it makes reaching the top of
the screen very difficult now when it
comes to performance I already told you
guys the note 8 is a beast it has the
latest Snapdragon processor so whatever
you throw at it it's gonna handle with
no problem has six gigs of RAM you're
not gonna be able to make this phone
slow down and what also performs well is
the new dual camera system now I've been
able to get some amazing pictures with
the note 8 and honestly I'm not
surprised the s8 and si+ also performed
really well but something to note is
that you have the dual camera system so
you've got this feature like live focus
where you can use software to make that
blurry background and give you those
kind of professional looking photos I
found the actual use of it a bit hit or
miss some photos just came out way too
soft Sam came out really well
I loved the implementation of it though
being able to adjust just how much of
the blurry effect you want in the photo
afterwards but that is the bonus you get
with that additional telephoto lens I
would have loved to see a real
wide-angle lens but yeah I guess you
probably miss out on that feature if you
did have that now when it comes to
battery there's no eight performs just
as any flagship would nowadays the note
series usually pushes the boundary when
it comes to battery capacity and how
long you can use it but I found this one
to be pretty average obviously we all
know why samsung went with a smaller
battery this time around so were left
with pretty average daily used with
around four hours and change of screen
on time but to be completely honest all
these phones that have this 4 hour plus
screen on time range if they feature a
quick charge 3.0 or any kind of fast
charging then there's really no
complaints you can get a lot of juice
really quickly if you plug in for just a
few minutes so no real big complaints as
long as it has those two that's gonna be
fine by me still lasted throughout the
day so no real complaints and since this
is the Galaxy Note 8 we've got to talk
about the s-pen the s-pen is a cool
feature it offers some nice
functionality that you don't see on
other phones really so it's nice to have
you here but it's honestly just a bonus
I don't see it as the groundbreaking
feature to grab a note 8 I really didn't
find many times where I needed to pull
it out and use it
of course I clicked I took it out for
testing purposes but outside of that I
really honestly just haven't found a use
for it
so it's there it works well at what it
does no complaints but don't get me
wrong that's not a knock I always
appreciate having extra feature options
and that's what the s-pen is but that
about wraps up for this video guys and
let me tell you the note 8 is a beast of
a smart phone I know a lot of people
weren't too crazy about it because it
didn't seem that much different than the
s8 and the s8 plus but I honestly feel
like the note 8 is one of the best
smartphones out right now
and the fact that people think it's only
an incremental update to the essay and
si+ just goes to show how good those
phones are as well but anywho guys
hopefully you enjoyed the video if you
did be the cool guy or girl that gives
this video a thumbs up and I'll catch
you guys in the next one until then it's
your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
