and today we've got the brand-new one +7
Pro and let me just start off the video
by saying this phones ridiculous now
this one has a ton of really cool
features and we're gonna go over those
all in a second but for those of you
interested in the cool packaging that it
came with when I unbox this thing it had
a lot inside and once I got inside of
the box first thing that I got my hands
on was the reviewers guide and inside of
this one plus pretty much outlined all
of the cool new features that this thing
came with all the specs and under that
they included the oneplus Bullet
Wireless twos the next iteration of
their Bluetooth earbuds and next to that
they included their oneplus warped
charge 30 car charger and of course
after that we got to the actual 1 plus 7
pro itself but they actually seem to
have like a hidden compartment all the
way at the bottom it has two of their
standard phone cases and I gotta say
oneplus really puts together some
awesome packaging but when it comes to
unboxing the 7 pro itself you of course
get this booklet case but the real prize
is right under that the oneplus 7 pro
but of course the box does come with
some more accessories you can expect a
new warp charger as well as of course
that standard red USB type-c cable and
inside of the box with the booklets
you'll also get this clear case so if
you don't have a case already you can
actually use that right out of the box
and of course some paperwork which
nobody will read now let's talk about
this beauty that we have in the nebula
blue color the oneplus 7 pro this phone
I'm telling you guys love at first sight
this thing is gorgeous it's a six point
six 7 inch display it is a quad HD
display and it's an AMOLED display as
well up but one thing you'll notice guys
let's check out the top we've got no not
so no front-facing camera right here at
the top it is a perfectly beautiful
display with no huge Chin's or bezels it
looks gorgeous now the only thing I
don't like about this display guys is
that it has those edges like a samsung
galaxy device I am NOT a fan of like
this infinity edge display for me I just
give me everything right up front I
don't want it to spill off on the sides
if they didn't do that I would say that
this has the perfect phone design ever
like it would be a perfect looking phone
for me let me know what you guys think
what's a comment down below
do you prefer these like edges that go
off to the side like these infinity
edges or would you prefer to have
everything all on one slab looking
forward now of course you're probably
wondering where's the camera and we're
gonna talk about that in a second but
what else is cool about this display is
that it's running at 90 Hertz so this
thing is going to give you a much
smoother buttery experience when you're
going through menus and you're swiping
around and of course even playing video
games
now I'm personally really happy about
that because the game that I play the
most right now which is regalia loss is
able to take advantage of that and check
this out guys when I'm actually playing
a game you can see this thing takes up
the entire display and it looks
absolutely awesome and like I said it
being at ninety Hertz this game looks so
much smoother it's kind of like the
difference between playing on a PC and a
console so we've got this big fast
vibrant full display but we got to
answer the question of where's the
front-facing camera and you know it pops
up baby so when you jump into the camera
app and you throw that front-facing
camera on boom
comes right up there it's pretty
terrific I love it now of course there's
going to be concerns about the motor
this thing is going to maybe mess up at
some point but they actually did some
really cool stuff with this so that it
can come some of our worries
and I believe oneplus tested this thing
and opening it about 300,000 times and
to put that in perspective for you guys
they said if you opened your phone or
the front-facing camera a 150 times a
day it would last you five years so at
least when it comes to the motor
degenerating and messing up
time last something that's not really a
huge concern also another concern for a
front-facing camera that pops out is
what happens if you happen to drop it
and it falls on the camera or something
for breaks but check this out so we have
it here and if we were to drop it it
automatically shuts so you don't have to
do anything if it slips out of your hand
the camera will retract because the
phone uses accelerometers so it knows
when the phone is falling and it can
detect that and immediately retract the
camera to protect it now you might be
wondering what about face unlock right
well you could just look at the phone
boom
unlock super super quickly now I was
afraid that trying to have the camera
pop-up and then unlock the phone it
would just make a slow process but
that's quick guys that is a really fast
unlocking experience only thing I am a
little bit concerned about is like if I
were to have it in my pocket
and then I hit the power button by
accident and this thing pops up trying
to find my face that's where I have a
little bit of a concern but as of right
now I love this thing's really cool very
Apple find X ish but absolutely done
right so of course they switched up the
front-facing camera but they changed the
rear cameras as well so right here we've
got three cameras and I'm happy about
this so now they've got your regular
standard camera lens your telephoto and
now your super wide angle lens there's
also a 48 megapixel camera so we're
supposed to see some really high
resolution stuff from this and I'm
really excited to try it out but I am so
so happy that oneplus added the super
wide angle lens this is absolutely
necessary in phones these days now you
might have heard me mention warped
charge before and that is also a feature
included on this guy right down here
you'll be able to charge it up using
more charge 30 and for those of you who
aren't familiar with warped charge 30
that thing is going to charge this guy
insanely fast like crazy and that's a
feature we first saw on the oneplus 16 I
believe McLaren Edition and I am very
stoked to see it here now one of the
cool features that they included with
this warped charge
is being able to do something really
intensive like gaming and not have the
phone get extremely hot while you play
so that is something we're gonna be
testing out during the real day into
life and we're gonna see how this
actually works out but that is a really
really promising feature now some
features that are missing are one an
official IP rating oneplus has put on
some interesting messaging out there to
show that this thing is pretty
water-resistant but there's no official
IP rating for that also missing is
wireless charging so if you're a big fan
of that
oneplus isn't so you're not gonna get
that here but overall though I am really
happy with the way this phone looks this
nebula blue is absolutely amazing I love
that they have the nice new cameras the
screen is gorgeous it is going to be
awesome using this phone which I already
have been but we're gonna talk more
about that in a real day in the life now
the only thing I don't know as of
filming this video right now is the
pricing for this guy I imagine that this
is going to be a bit expensive
maybe the $600 range I don't know I can
see oneplus really throwing the price up
on this guy but hopefully they don't
I'll of course include in the
description what the price is
once this video goes out and the
announcement is out with it
but as of right now guys this is quite
the phone to look out for and this thing
is amazing but that about wraps it up
for this video guys if you enjoyed it be
the cool guy go that give this video a
thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in the
next one so then it's your average
consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
