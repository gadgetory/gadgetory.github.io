want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on guys
it's your average consumer today I'm
going to be doing an unboxing of the new
2012 model of the MacBook Air all right
so let's not wasting time let's get
right into it alright guys so here you
have the MacBook Air like I said this is
the 2012 model that was just released um
this is the base model the one that
comes with no special features on there
no need no configurations so I'm gonna
have the pub the specs listed down below
in the comments like right above the
comment section and you guys can check
it out and let's open this thing up
let's see we can pop this bad boy out
I'm pretty excited to see how this works
Mac Mac repairs are really fast and it
should definitely be a bit faster than
my family computer because of the new
solid the solid state drives that these
come with and solid state drives are
usually faster hard drives than there
are standard ones and they're a bit more
secure as well that's the name solid
state so just pop it open and here it is
so got that really new MacBook smell it
smell hard a brand new product just pop
it open this is it of course you know
it's razor thin great thing about the
air and as well as the air you get some
instruction manuals and I'm sure Apple
stickers of course and you know little
stuff like that so all that comes inside
of it
and you also have this new charger that
has a new MagSafe connector as you can
see it's a new design it's a lot um it's
a lot slimmer than the normal but you
know it all works the same pretty
standard stuff plug it in magnetic it's
magnetic so you know it doesn't bring
your laptop down if you trip over it or
something and pretty much that's all you
get here
and I can um let's see if I can just get
rid of all this stuff here unwrapped
MacBook Air itself now this isn't a
redesign in any way they did change up
some of the port's that come on the air
now you have to 3.0 USB ports which
basically means if you have a 3.0 USB
device that it should be able to be
compatible with this and usually those
are like hard drives and things like
that so basically you'll get faster
speeds when you're transferring files or
doing things like that so basically if
the 3.0 let me just makes it a lot
faster it as far as you know using the
device that gets plugged in there
alright so here you that the little
MagSafe power connector you have the USB
port and the headphone jack as well as
your microphone right here and on the
other side you now get an SD card reader
which is really nice you have your
Thunderbolt arm your Thunderbolt port
right here and another 3.0 USB port so
that's all the ports here and of course
you know this doesn't come with an
optical drive even the new MacBook Pros
are coming without an optic
drive so it's pretty much the same
design is just got some new ports now as
well as the SD card reader and let's
open this bad boy up holding it in one
hand like this is not even an issue
because because of how light this is
so that's always a great thing there
shouldn't be any issue position being
issues in travelling with this thing so
let's take off this little um screen
protector here throw that to the side
and let's power it on they also removed
a little power button that used to be
there and now it has a power button on
the keyboard
here's the first boot and pretty much
that's all there is to it guys um if you
have any questions about this I'm going
to have a review up on it soon so if you
have any questions please feel free to
let me know and I'll try to answer them
as soon as I can all right so I'm gonna
get through this set up and start using
it I'm alright guys is your average
consumer if you like this video please
