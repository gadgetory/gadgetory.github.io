want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey guys your average
consumer and today I stopped by Best Buy
favorite store and picked up this bad
boy this is the Sony 3d display for the
ps3 and um I plan on using this for my
ps3 you have a couple of other things so
I'm free I'm just doing an unboxing for
you guys so you can check it out let's
jump right into it before I cut this
whole thing open let's talk about it a
bit all right so let's see this less
some of the key features on this thing
is that it's full 1080p um it's a three
on one display with do for 3d content I
guess it has two standard one dimension
view and the - um split screens with two
3d glasses that seems to be like the
biggest selling point as you can see in
this picture you can have two people
look at the same display and see two
different images which is really cool um
it's 3d and this is at a 240 Hertz
refresh rate for higher 3d quality um it
comes with two HDMI slots and then your
let's see and component one like your
regular component for those who don't
use HDMI um it's led as a built-in
subwoofer and sleep buttons yadda yadda
I want to open this up so let's now we
sign this open set for the bottom I
should do it
oh I'm ripping the box no way no all
right
okay so we got rid of one layer see wait
is flat looks like that would be fast
okay so this also comes with motor motor
storm apocalypse with an HDMI cord some
warnings and safety tips over here we
have this little white box made in China
mind you okay so we Oh okay these are
the 3d glasses here you have the little
USB cord for it comes in a nice little
black pouch and you got some some really
cool 3d glasses right here alright here
we have what feels like the stand and I
am correct this is one part of the stand
we have a power plant special no and
finally last but definitely not least
the TV itself now I wonder if this is
going to be a fingerprint magnet like
all other screens nowadays oh this is a
beautiful thing
alright well I am going to hook this bad
boy up right now here we go
all set up this was extremely easy to
put together I think my newborn niece
can do this with no problem
it really was like two three steps three
steps really all together and here you

display um let's see if I get powered on

all right well there we go no signal I
put that too yet um I'll give you guys a
look once I get some stuff connected to
it and give you guys a review on how I
