on one display with do for 3d content I
guess it has two standard one dimension
view and the - um split screens with two
3d glasses that seems to be like the
biggest selling point as you can see in
this picture you can have two people
look at the same display and see two
different images which is really cool um
it's 3d and this is at a 240 Hertz
refresh rate for higher 3d quality um it
