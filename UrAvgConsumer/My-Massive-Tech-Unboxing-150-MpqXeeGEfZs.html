what's going on guys to trap which
consumer and as you can see we've got
another massive tech unboxing this is
like number 15 we gettin up there guys
but as always you know go grab your
snacks grab your drinks
get yourself all cozied up because we
got a lot of things to unbox and
unfortunately ares missing again so i'm
gonna need you guys to go in the
comments section let her know that she
needs to be here for these videos so she
can pick the first one but in the
meantime I got my boy Jay so Jay you're
gonna get to pick the first one my man
what are we doing you going for this
alrighty go for the nerf all right well
you guys can see it clear as day we got
a little something here from nerf this
is their laser ops pro I don't know if
you guys remember but me and arrow used
to do some nerf wars back in the day it
was crazy but we had a lot of fun so
let's see what they've got over here now
these are news and new product so I have
no idea what to expect here oh so this
is like so wait yeah you're supposed to
be like able to play like an laser tag
and whatnot you got a health bar over
here oh this is looking kind of cool oh
this is an even bigger one yeah
eh so I guess if you pick up at least
this small one you can play with two
people immediately which is kind of nice
oh snap I would want these to be like
dual blasters what's actually cool is
that you get a little armed end because
these actually use an app to get the
game going so with these you can
customize your blasters performance you
can even get power-ups you can check
player stats and track the winners of
the games and you can use the GPS to
locate people during battles so if
somebody's hiding off somewhere you can
actually see them on this I think this
is a really clever idea and what I like
about this is that they don't have the
nerve bullets which kind of sucks on the
physical aspect you're not like shooting
someone
that scared but I like this because
there's no cleanup or anything we're
involved and these are the two blasters
that come with this we can have two
people play at once or you can go for
the big guy like this
I'm guessing this has to have more power
and all that but if you don't want to
have it on your arm band like this this
thing actually comes with what looks
like a scope or something and then you
can just turn put this on and then this
thing will be able to hold your phone so
you can kind of see all of that
information as you go this is really
really cool might be really fun to see
us uh play this in the new house we got
a lot of space in there so this could be
really dope so I got to nerve for
sending this out oh I remember this are
you talking about this so this is the
line doc they said big up to area cuz
area was actually the ones talking to
these guys about getting this in here
yeah oh okay
so this right here guys is just a small
little dock for your laptop to sit on
but what it does is it offers a ton of
connectivity and i/o huh oh haha that's
hilarious
so I thought this was gonna be some more
accessories but basically these are
cutouts for dongles so they're saying
goodbye to dongles this is all you're
gonna need very clever and all you have
to do is connect it right here this is a
USB C port so you can connect this to
your device and get access to a ton of
i/o so if you're using something like
the MacBook Pro which is definitely what
this is targeting then you actually get
back a ton of ports and what's nice
about this is that it's more than just a
USB hub it actually offers a battery
inside of it so this thing also will
charge it it's a twenty thousand
milliamp hour battery inside of here and
you can also get storage configurations
so you can get one without any storage
and there's also one with 256 gigs and
let's see what does this say you've also
got one with one terabyte
so you can definitely get some crazy
storage I'll have pricing information
listed out for you guys so you can see
but it looks like what they're trying to
do here with this is basically give you
a ton of different options for your
MacBook without the need of all those
dongles we've got a sleeve for it that's
though and you've also got the USBC
cable so you can use this to plug it up
to your device now it's not limited to
the MacBook Pro obviously you can
connect it to other things with USB
ports but that is the first thing that
comes to mind when you think about
Donegal's oh yes
so prime day I actually went and got a
400 gigabyte micro SD card for my
Nintendo switz I can't really say go run
and check the link down below because
prime dates over now but if you do have
a Nintendo switch or you save a lot of
videos or music to your phone there's a
400 gig option out there
these are definitely way too expensive
to buy normally though but I'm glad I
got it for my switch Microsoft's back
with the controllers baby and one of
them holds a very glorious controller
they're both probably going to be
glorious but one that I'm going to like
a bit more so than the other because I'm
biased let's see well I get it on the
first try I didn't get it on the first
try Just My Luck hi again
Xbox a glad to have you back so this is
the Armed Forces - controller so you got
that army look oh oh yeah that's nice
that's nice Xbox you know how to make a
controller
Oh baby oh look at that sport white I
don't know why did he just call this the
UAC controller I don't know why they
didn't do it
it's okay I wouldn't be that popular Oh
Xbox I know you made it for me you had
to have look at this thing this thing
looks amazing we'll get that back there
guys and it's got the rubberized grip in
the back extra comfort oh they said
let's make it out of control there give
it official Xbox branding yeah I get it
guys got to keep I love low-key I get it
in the gadget backpack you go slit its
throat open the duct what is this the
dual air wireless fast dual qi wireless
charging pad a regular USB out USB
type-c in put micro USB input and a
lightning input so I guess depending on
what phone you have no matter the
manufacturer you're using at least one
of these three cables so you can plug
that into this and it will wirelessly
charge your device Apple these companies
they're trying to catch up
you got drop that air power accessory
and then we wait in but we got these for
now oh so this is a battery case for the
iPhone 10 that also has a headphone jack
so if you've been wanting a battery case
that you don't really see those for the
iPhone 10 Apple hasn't made one
officially for the iPhone 10 so this
could be cool and it brings back the
headphone jack I'm a fan okay and boom I
could use this Oh
it charges with a micro USB cable that
is the one thing like I feel like if
you're gonna have a case like this just
make it with a lightning cable just use
that to charge it I know it's possible
because a lot of portable chargers do it
that is what I would have liked to see
here instead of having to carry this and
a lightning cable okay so it doesn't say
how many milliamp hours this thing has
but it's supposed to give you one
hundred and thirty percent more battery
life out of it so that's not bad it's
not super bulky I like that so this is
kind of cool
let's call audio mod so if you really
care about your headphone jack and extra
juice might be worth looking into every
video every massive tech unboxing things
fall so this is the sole by GE oh now
let me start this by saying I was
actually interested in this only because
my boy John has used things like this in
his videos where it's like a ring light
so I wanted to get a ring light but not
just a standard one this one seems like
it has a bit of cool tech inside of it
so I wanted to give it a shot oh this is
cool this is cool so now it's probably
gonna ask me to set it up and do all the
Alexus stuff that you have to do but
this is awesome
alright well I can't do anything with
this until I finished setting it up but
you might see this in another video very
high chance of that I'm actually really
excited about this all right let me grab
this thing sets it just fell this is
something that I've been eyeing for a
little bit I went to the mall to pick it
up and I figured I'll just unbox it what
you guys kind of show you it and this is
the DJI Ronin S and BAM oh that looks
complicated J this is looking a heavy
duty man this is looking real heavy-duty
that's all there is to it I guess and of
course you got to balance your camera
onto this so for those of you who aren't
familiar with this kind of stuff
basically these are camera stabilizers
like I said before it helps you get some
really nice and smooth shots especially
when you're walking around when there's
movement but uh so far this thing ain't
no joke can I
can can we do this no you're not you're
not too thrilled all right let's get you
over there another bag
so we've got another bag this is from
pacsafe anti-theft carry all solutions
okay
check out the zipper though guys so this
thing has like this crazy lock on it so
to unlock assess trim right
is that it oh all right so you unlock it
like that you drag this up
check out this zipper this is not just
your average zipper this thing is stuck
together
oh yeah nobody's breaking into this it
feels like it's high quality stuff I
love me some compartments I could see
myself storing quite a few things in
here I'm gonna switch over there laptop
over here some hard drives I'd be
holding it like this this is what I want
to give my grown man on so I'll pull out
that switch didn't it like okay he's a
kid when I got this in I was like what
did I get from Home Depot I have no idea
what this is this is a system G gaming
plus backpack oh there's a gaming mat
like a mouse pad okay so we've hidden
got a mouse pad over here
interesting oh look at that
what about it makes it gaming oriented
though and stick out a lot it does huh
okay the little pouch for accessories I
guess like cables
check this out folks we got compartments
for days so they are strapped in here
this is a gaming backpack right so got
some controllers can we draw controllers
in
yeah you've got a ton of compartments
you got little things over here as well
I like that
open this up to throw some stuff in here
go some stuff in here the shell I the
shell is kind of cool I just wish you
didn't make it stick out so much this
would have been really awesome if it
were just like a normal thing in the
front but if you if you got something
like you know high quality stuff in here
it's always nice to have a hard shell
case too and yeah you just throw in your
laptop back here so I'm digging it let's
see what this thing looks like I'm
getting a Linus vibe from this huge
Linus vibe oh you know what this is
something I also picked up I want an
unboxing here now I can just hear people
running for the comment section now
complaining about beats showing up but
these are the beats X I personally am a
big fan of the beats X the w1 chip the
form factor I like it a lot the
fast-charging good stuff and they came
out with a new edition that has the
original beats colors that black and red
I'm a fan I think these are like the 10
year edition so I guess pieces been out
for that long now Wow I really like the
beats X the thing that retails typically
Grubin 150 bucks but you usually find
them for a hundred bucks like if you
look on Amazon right now you'll probably
see them for a hundred bucks and at that
price I'm telling you guys these are a
really really good value so this is it
right here the beats X the 10-year
anniversary edition so I recently picked
up the Sony here on Tues who looks nice
this grey though alright so here we have
them looking kind of good so it has a
touch panel on the side so I have touch
controls
you also have active noise-cancelling
and you can probably use the app that
goes along with it also needs headphones
nowadays can work with their headphone
app now these are kind of expensive so
I'm gonna be looking at these and seeing
if they're worth the money so far this
looks really nice though
and now what I also have in this box
is this guy right here now having been
seeing much about this product this is
the ends on fire TV cube so basically
it's like an Apple TV Roku all that
stuff got 4k HDR it also works as an
Alexa so if you don't have an Amazon
echo you can actually pick up one of
these kind of get your smart home
started and it all works in one go so I
randomly facetiming here's the Amazon
fire TV cube but what what was different
is that when you plug this thing into a
TV you can tell it to turn on something
on Netflix like turn on Jane the Virgin
or something like that kind of like
chromecast but you can just speak to it
you don't need a remote or anything like
that so you don't need your phone
nothing you just speak to it and it'll
throw it on your TV you already know the
mancave definitely needs this okay
Erin's hanging out at a bachelorette
party right now so she's having a good
time well I'm out here unboxing some
stuff having a good time too so I mean
jealous sorry but this is gonna be
really cool I can't wait to try this out
I will say these edges whoo these edges
are sharp keep this away from children
okay this is a the Satechi smart monitor
stand but what it does is it provides
USB port so it works as a USB hub you
can hook this up to your computer and
then get extra USB ports while still
propping up your monitor if you need a
little bit more height out of it and you
can also I think use this with like a
laptop kind of like the lime dock but um
this one is not as sophisticated as the
lying dock oh no this I wouldn't use
this for a laptop this thing is kind of
on the wide side oh but it's lightweight
it's made out of plastic I was hoping
that this would have like an aluminum
finish but I guess it's not a very
expensive monitors thing so I guess you
can't expect too much it does come with
four USB ports a headphone jack as well
as a microphone jack
but you know what else has great
