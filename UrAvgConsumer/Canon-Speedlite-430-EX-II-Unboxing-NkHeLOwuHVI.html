today I have for you the Canon
speedlight for 30 X 2 so I just picked
this up for Best Buy cost around 322
with tax
so yeah let's unbox this thing alright
first thing you'll get is just the pouch
with the flash inside there it goes
there goes also inside the box you got
some warranty information here and also
get a manual I guess since this flash
can act as a master and slave there's a
couple of and it also has a lot of
different features there's a couple of
things that can go into so we'll put
that back and also in the pouch it has a
stand for the flash because this flash
can be used remotely depending on your
camera and you know you can have a set
up somewhere and seamlessly take picture
um take pictures with the flash
somewhere else unfortunately I don't
have a camera that's good enough to do
that but this is it right here guys
these are some of the options as you get
it takes four double A batteries adds a
little heft to it but there's not
anything unbearable um
pretty much yeah that's about it for the
box I'll definitely have a review up for
this and I'll definitely have a review
up for this shortly let you guys know I
think of it I've actually had a bra I've
actually been able to play around with
this for a little bit so I can give you
guys some insight when I do that video
but that's right now this is what you
get take a close look this is your lock
mechanism right here so to lock into
place on top of your camera and this is
the little lights so you can know what
you're taking a picture of like you know
it shows up and um yeah pretty much this
is it I'll let you guys know how it is
wouldn't in to review this if you want
to know if your peers on how stands by
itself there it goes
all right well I'll leave the room I'll
have the review done for you guys
shortly if you have any questions I'll
definitely be way more descriptive in
the review on all the features and
anything I figured out about the flash
so far and feel free to leave comments
rate subscribe and if you have any
questions let me know and I'll I'll be
sure to hit you back
alright thanks Adam for consumer peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
