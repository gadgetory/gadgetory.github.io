consumer and today we're gonna be
checking out my favorite type of the
month for the month of January and when
I say favorite of the month I'm talking
about old or new tech just tech that
I've been using a lot or just been
loving in the past month now let's start
off with a pair of fully wireless
earbuds that I've been using quite a bit
more than I expected
these are the j-bird runs so when you
pop open the case you got them right
here
now I really like these because I
usually have a really hard time with ear
buds and these actually stay in
perfectly so they've got the wingtips to
make sure they stay in place so I can
move around and they're meant to be
active ear buds so if you're working out
and stuff like that they're supposed to
be perfect for that but not only that
but they actually sounds really good now
what's most surprising about these is
the fact that when it comes to sound
quality they've got quite a bit of bass
which you don't typically see in what I
was scared buds like this because
they're so small it's kind of hard to
produce that bass but these do a really
really good job and what's great is that
these ear buds actually work with the
j-bird app where you can control a ton
of different things you can actually
switch up the sound quality based on
different presets or you can use the
original sound that it comes with you
can customize that to work however you
want and you also can do a couple things
like change up the button controls so if
you want to access Siri or maybe you
want to you know make calls whatever you
want to do you can switch up the button
controls which I find to be really nice
you even got the ability to find your
buds since these are tiny little things
and if you happen to drop them somewhere
you can actually use the app to try and
locate them which is a really really
nice feature that I think all wireless
earbuds should have so I'm really liking
these they've got about 4 hours of
battery life and whenever you put them
away inside of their case you get an
additional eight hours so I think you
got a total of about 12 so I like
wireless earbuds these are the best ones
that have worked out for me so far and
in terms of fit and sound so I'm really
digging these and I think they're worth
it now my next favorite piece of tech is
actually an upgrade that I made over
here so this is my little editing setup
but this is the Samsung fast charge
wireless charger I actually really like
this because it's
convertible style while I was charging
pad so first thing you'll notice is that
it works as a stand so I can throw my
phone right up there let it charge but
if I want to lay it down flat I can do
that as well
so it really doesn't matter I think at a
desk it's nice to be able to choose
between the two so you can actually set
this up let's say you don't want to put
this on your phone too much and you just
want to be able to work but you want to
see your notifications you just put this
thing up and then you can see
notifications as they come in so if
you've got a phone that supports
wireless charging and you work out a
desk I think this is a really great
piece to have since it just makes it a
bit easier to just place your phone down
and have a charge without looking for
cables or anything like that
it also supports fast wireless charging
so if you've got a phone like the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 or sa whatever you
have that thing is going to boost it up
even faster than a normal charge it's
made out of this leather like material
so it's actually pretty grippy
so your phone won't be sliding around
and I think it actually helps it to look
really good can get a little dusty
looking though but overall I do like the
way this looks and that's why I changed
the one that I had here before which was
I think like a rad power to what we have
over here now the next thing I got is
actually in my wallet over here we've
got not this MetroCard but we got this
orbit I didn't find their I guess this
is actually for the wallet and it's
pretty much like tile but this one is
actually specifically made to go right
into your wallet now I like this because
it has a regular credit card shape so it
can fit in any of the slots that I want
to inside of my wallet makes it really
easy to carry around but what's great is
that it has an app that accompanies it
so if you use your phone you can
actually track down under a wallet and
happen to misplace it maybe you forgot
it in a pair of jeans and you can't find
it you pull into the app hit find orbit
and then it makes your wallet ring and
what's great about these is that it
actually also has a button on the card
so that you can actually find your phone
if your phone happens to be missing just
going like this
and all you do is press the button again
and you turn it off so I really really
like that and they've got a bunch of
different products re although I'm not
gonna take her glasses right now right
off her head so they actually got
something that goes on a pair of glasses
let me tell you re always miss places
her glasses whatever husband for ya she
has me go looking for them all the time
she's like Velma so whenever she was her
glasses she's like blind and I had to
find them for her but now she can just
pop into the app that she seen see it
clearly enough and actually make her
glasses ring and was great about these
in comparison to wait oh you can't even
see right now I'm sorry now what's great
about these in comparison to tile is
that they've got with chargeable
batteries or replaceable batteries so
even something like this or bit card or
the little piece that goes on a DS
glasses they can actually be recharged
using a USB cable which is unlike tile
tile is pretty much a one and done but
these are reusable rechargeable which I
really like and I think they last like a
month on a single charge so that's a
really good look and over here they've
got a stick on piece which you can throw
on to just about anything which is
really convenient so if there's
something else that you just happen to
lose all the time like a remote it's
actually really nice to be able to just
find it no matter what the item is so
I'm really a fan of these they're
perfect for forgetful people like me and
Harry
now our next thing is a little bit
different because I don't actually have
it in hand but it was one of my favorite
things at CES and that is LG's news 5.1
surround sound sound bar with Meridian
technology and Dolby Atmos now I don't
show you guys I didn't get a ton of
footage when I was out there checking it
out but I'll throw up some pictures so
you guys can at least see what I'm
talking about now I really like that
because I haven't seen a ton of Dolby
Atmos sound bars that Ashley support 5.1
surround sound so that means you're
gonna get sound at a bunch of different
angles behind you above you in front of
you that's supposed to be the whole
point here and I really like that LG's
making this system and LG had a bunch of
other cool looking speakers like their
peak a line like think they have the PK
7 5 and 3 which are these bluetooth
stereo speakers that have le
the lights of their multicolored than
you changed and looks really good
pretty interesting they've also got
these smart speakers I think they're
calling it the pink line
it's like bin Q so it says pink it's
pretty interesting those are they're
smart speakers with Google assistant
built-in and they even have one that has
a screen which is kind of like the
Amazon Show but they didn't have a fully
functioning one there but that looks
really interesting as well since it has
Google assistant and I don't think we've
seen a little assistant speaker with ass
built-in screen and one of my absolute
favorite pieces of tech that I've
acquired last year is this so pro smart
coffee table some of you guys might have
seen it in the ultimate gamers paradise
2.0 video that I did a lot of you were
going nuts in the comments section about
this smart coffee table and for those of
you who haven't seen it I'm telling you
this thing is amazing so the first thing
you'll notice is that this thing has a
really clean design it looks really good
but not only that it has some really
cool features one of them being right
here you've got a couple of wall outlets
so you got two of them over here and
you've got another two on the other side
and not only do they have these outlets
but over here they've got two USB ports
so if you want to charge your smartphone
or any other device with a USB cable you
can just plug them up over here and have
the charging with no problem and not
only do you have outlets and USB ports
but right above the outlets you got
speaker grills for your Bluetooth
speaker so this thing can act as a
Bluetooth speaker you can connect your
phone to it and was actually also pretty
cool is that this thing came with a
Bluetooth adapter you can connect it to
your TV and have your coffee table work
as your speakers so it's got all of
those features but this thing also has a
ton of storage options as well you got
two doors over here on the right side
and as you can see we got snacks but
days folks you'll lose your teeth in
here if you hang out with me
I promise so we've got a bunch of candy
and sweets I gotta have my snacks always
and if you're done with this next you
setting a drink right
you got a built-in refrigerator on deck
so listen you got your mancave you got
you a nice little coffee table we got
access to your drinks you don't have to
get up and go to the fridge you got the
fridge right in the room this thing is
awesome and I actually even have the
second bar at the bottom here filled out
with a bunch of my controllers so
whenever I'm playing one of my games I
can just grab the controller that goes
with the system that I want to play I
got some remotes nearby and I even have
some USB cables so I can just plug in
whatever device I need you right into
the coffee table now that list alone
makes this thing bomb but there's more
so over here we actually have a touch
panel where you can control a ton of
different things from an alarm clock to
even controlling the temperature of the
fridge you can even access your music
from here and control the volume and all
that good stuff or you can even change
the LED lights that you've got right
here at the bottom and yes I said LEDs
and with that mic drop you guys
completely understand why I'm in love
with this big this thing is an amazing
buy for any guy or a girl who has a man
cave or just a really nice entertaining
room waving a whole coffee table with a
lot of smart features but before we wrap
up today's video we've got to give a
huge shout to today's sponsor audible
now I know you guys have heard an
audible before it has the biggest audio
book library now I've actually been
using them for years and it's the start
of a new year where a lot of people are
saying new year you mean so if you're
looking to get into something new and
you want to get an audio book to help
you this is the perfect way to do it
lately I've been having much longer
commutes and being able to listen to an
audiobook while driving has been pretty
clutch I'm currently listening to
relentless by Tim s Grover to help me
feel motivated in the morning and do
what I got to do of course if you guys
