consumer and today I've gotten unboxing
for you guys of the street buy 50 on ear
wired
sport edition so let's not waste any
time let's get right into it
and all right guys here we have the SMS
Audio Street buy 50 on ear wired sport
headphones and this is a pretty long
title for it all together but this is
what they are and these are sports
headphones so these are made for working
out and you know all kinds of sports
activities and their athlete of choice
for this is carmelo anthony just like
beets has lebron james SMS Audio has
carmelo anthony so on the side we've got
a picture of course of 50 cent and a
list of a couple of features that the
headphones have so this has an IP x4
rating which means that it's gonna be
sweat resistant and water resistant now
this doesn't mean you can submerge these
headphones to not waterproof or anything
like that but they will protect against
splashes or being able to go in the rain
so little things like that we're just
little drops of water can get on these
headphones without any issues so sweat
water no problem just not in crazy
amounts of course it also has a 40 you
rubberized coating so it should be extra
durable as it says rubberized coating as
old fit ear cups and easy fold hinges so
those are the four features that they're
listing in the side and of course we've
got some more stuff in a couple of
languages and you can see some of the
accessories that come with this so let's
get to actual unboxing let's open this
thing up I've got my unboxing license
this has some plastic so we'll pop this
open definitely not necessary but it's
fun to use this is like my favorite part
of them boxing's pretty much care at it
definitely some excess use bear with the
knife but okay
like I said favorite part about boxing
but alright now we got this stuff to the
side let's pop this thing open
put this over here and I see it opens on
its side so let's see here we have 50
cent and you told us open to the side
here yes some Street by 50 on ears and
boom so what's this alright so we've got
a couple of things here put them all out
onto the side we have some booklets and
paperwork so over here we also have some
stickers so we have some stickers this
is a list of international distributors
and of course we have a booklet so this
is the owner's manual so it'll go
through all the warranty information the
things that come inside of the box all
that good stuff that you want to know
about you can find it all in this little
booklet so we can put this stuff back
and let's see we've got the case here
with the headphones a couple of
accessories here I'm not sure what those
are yet and let's see if there's
anything else behind this oh so that
seems to be it so we're gonna put this
thing back and we're gonna put that over
here so let's take a look at some of
this stuff that we'd get here now just
by looking at this I can tell that these
are need to go around the ear cups so
these are like little ear pads or
something these are gonna cover up the
ear pads so let's see this is probably a
travel pouch and they're all made of
this special material counter feel I'm
not sure what this feels like actually
but ok this is interesting I'm not sure
what this said I might actually go in
the owner's manual right now just so I
can see what these things are why
they're included alright so I just
checked the owner's manual and like I
said these are definitely ear pad covers
these small little things here these are
ear pad covers so these are washable as
well and what's really cool this is a
sports towel so they included an SMS
audio sports towel I guess you know free
of charge here it is so if you guys are
working out you're using these
headphones that
Jim you've got this little thing to go
along with it so that's really awesome
something I've never seen any headphones
do come with something that outside of
like the regular carrying case so that's
really cool hats off to them and let's
get to opening the set so this is the
hardshell case that it comes in pretty
tough and durable it has a carabiner
clip on it as well so if you're going to
clip this on to your backpack or
whatever you are since this is a sports
headphone it comes included so let's get
some unzipping this when I see so here
it is interesting so this feels very
different this is not like your normal
ear pads but we'll get to this in a
second and over here we have the cable
that it comes with so this Cable has an
inline remote so it only has a play and
pause button so that's all you're going
to be using so it works for Android or
Apple devices no problem just playing
pause though and it has an and also
includes a mic and it's a thick tangle
free cable l input and a regular input
at the top so that's that for this cable
this is the case
no pouch in the case would have liked to
sing that but that's alright now to the
actual headphones now these are very
interesting these ear pads now they
don't feel like they'd be a dad but it's
just not the kind of material I'm used
to it almost feels like a yeah if you
guys can see it too it almost looks like
a jersey material pretty interesting for
sure I definitely feel that a rubberized
coating at the top this gives it a nice
matte black finish and it looks really
nice and in person I really like the way
it looks it feels pretty good just this
is gonna take some getting used to I'm
not used to seeing these ear pads like
this but it's gonna be interesting I
recently joined a gym so this is gonna
be interesting to see how it deals with
the sweat so as you guys can see here
between the little holes of the blue you
can see it has a white material on the
inside so it overall it still feels very
nice in the hand but it's just got this
different look so it kind of gives it
like a polka
kind of thing going so very interesting
let me know what you guys think of it
but I'm sure this is here for the sweat
to be sweat proof and all that so you
guys let me know what you think of the
design and what's interesting about
these headphones is that they retail for
the exact same price as the regular on
ear Street by 50 so it's 170 $9.99 you
can get them both at the same price
that's really cool that they included a
version that is good for working out and
sports without upping the price at all
so that's really nice but this is it
guys this has just been a quick unboxing
you got some really cool stuff you've
got these ear covers that go around the
ear cups so see how easy it is to put
one of these things on yeah
not too bad got the ear cover on not too
bad at all so this will give us some
extra protection so there you go but

quick unboxing I'll let you guys know
