consumer and I've got another what's in
my gadget backpack video now this is the
fourth one so it's version 4.0 and this
time we're rocking a case logic backpack
and I went with this guy for a couple of
reasons
one it looks good I like the black and
red theme secondly it has a ton of
compartments and third it is cheap you
can find this for under 40 bucks and for
what you get out of it that's pretty
good now if you guys know me you know I
put a ton of gadgets in here I like to
fill it up with all the stuff that I
might possibly need so it might be
overkill for a lot of people but it
works perfectly for me so let me go
through all the stuff that you can find
the side up here so in the very very
first compartment we have a front I've
got a hard shell carrying case for my
Nintendo 3ds XL now inside of here I
have the new 3ds with the improved 3d
and the face tracking so it can track
your face for the 3d features and
whatnot and I love this thing I have a
ton of games on it that I'm still
playing like xenoblade and a couple of
other Pokemon games so tons of good
stuff that I like here and I've got it
in this hard shell carrying case which
isn't too easy to find but I'll do my
best to have links in the description to
all the stuff that you see in this video
but that's what we have in the first
compartment don't think I have anything
else inside of on top of that rather
I've got a few things first things first
this little guy has quite a few
compartments as you guys might be able
to see here and at the very bottom I've
got a portable charger now you guys know
you can no I got to carry one of these
and since this is the gadget backpack
I've got a little more room I've got a
bigger portable charger now this guy is
by ravpower and it's 20,000 milliamps
now this is probably one of the most
versatile portable charges that I've
come across and that's because it has
this 2.4 amp USB port so it'll charge
your phones really quickly now it also
has a quick charge USB port so if your
phone supports quick charge this guy
helps you out and that is awesome you
don't see that much in a lot of the
portable charges out right now but
what's also amazing is that this thing
also has USB type-c so this thing can
charge any of the new Nexus devices it
can charge the pixel seek and charge
your
inch MacBook whatever you want it
supports USB C which is awesome I think
this guy runs for about there's 60 bucks
but at 20,000 milliamps and all of these
put on charging options you really can't
beat that and it come from a traveling
case so that's awesome probably the most
heavy-duty portable charger that you can
come across I've also got the file
e18 now this is a deck and an amp so
what that means is that the sound
quality that you get out of your
smartphone or anything else like a
laptop you can boost that with this guy
so you get better sound quality and with
the amp you can power headphones that
need a lot of juice to really get the
full sound quality out of so with this
guy you can do that so if you got some
heavy-duty headphones and you want to
take this on the go and listen on your
mobile device thing is amazing and has a
bass boost switch so if you into bass
this thing is awesome if your headphones
aren't very loud this thing is going to
help and it also has controls on the
side so you can control your music this
thing is also a portable charger
everything has 3,500 milliamps so this
will give most phones out at least one
charge which is pretty amazing so you've
got multiple functions out of this which
is awesome so and it also comes with a
travel case and you can hook this up to
your PC whatever you want great stuff
you guys definitely need to check that
out if you're serious about your audio
and on the other side of this
compartment we've got the honor 5x now
huge shout out to honor for sponsoring
this video and sending the 5x out for me
to try out now you guys might not have
heard about it since it was just
announced at CES but check out some of
the specs there's got a 5.5 inch 1080p
display a Snapdragon 615 processor 2
gigs of ram a 3000 milliamp battery
which is a nice combo with a 1080p
display and it's also got a metal body
design as well as a fingerprint scanner
which is all the rave nowadays with all
the flagships now the kicker with this
guy is that it retails for 200 bucks for
a phone with this design and build
quality as well as some of the specs I
think that's a pretty good value now if
you guys want the full rundown of specs
and where to get it I'll have links down
below in the description for you to
check that out but moving on but in this
last compartment over here I have
a bunch of cables and this is my little
life hack if you've seen some of my room
tour videos you know that I have a huge
container with cables and plugs and
they're all in Ziploc bags so that I'm
not dealing with a bunch of messy cables
tangled I know exactly what's cable I'm
dealing with one at a time this is my
little life hack I love this trick so if
you've got a lot of cables in your
backpack and you want a nice way to sort
them ziploc bags baby they work now
let's check out the sides I have let's
see the Logitech MX master mouse now the
reason why I picked this guy over my
favorite gee 602 is because I have a
couple of devices in here that this can
work with this thing runs on bluetooth
so I can swap between my devices with
just the press of a button you can
actually store up to three different
devices with this mouse and it's a
Logitech MX so this thing is a solid
performer you can always count a
Logitech mice so this is one I carry
around whenever I'm on the go for that
quick syncing so that's what I carry
over here and let's just jump to the
other side now this is another cable
nothing too special
I carry my macbook cable so that I can
you know charge it up too big for a
ziploc bag now let's check out what I
got at the top compartment so you got
something here that you can use for
sunglasses or whatever you want but me
I've got a huge microfiber cloth I love
microfiber cloths because I'm always
cleaning my devices so this is my
favorite one right here and I've got the
Sony rx100 mark for now this of course
everyone knows by now the rx100 are the
best point of shoot cameras on the
market they aren't cheap though
especially not this guy but it can shoot
in 4k it has a stupid time limit of five
minutes because it starts to overheat so
if you're looking for long reporting
this might not be the best bet
but I use this guy for vlogging and
they're usually quick clips so 4k is not
a problem here and this thing is just an
awesome camera this guy performs super
well and you won't find a better point
and shoot on the market performance wise
especially that pop-out screen so that I
can use it when I'm vlogging I can see
myself and what's in frame gotta love it
but that is my goal
- vlogging camera and so with that we
can jump into the main compartment which
has quite a few things as well now the
first thing we're doing with first you
know let's check out this flap right
here this guy has a couple of ear buds
I've got two of them now this is the
j-bird x2 case and inside it I've got a
pair of j-bird x2 s now these are the
best in eared Bluetooth earbuds that you
can probably find I love these they fit
well the sound is amazing
I got a gotta carry these wherever I go
somewhere now in case the battery dies
on me and I can't charge it or maybe I'm
using a device that doesn't support
Bluetooth I have a wired option as well
and this is by Ultimate Ears these are
the UE 900s now these are an awesome
pair of earbuds one of my favorites now
they're not cheap they're a bit priced
on the pricey side but it's so worth it
these sound amazing and just having a
wired option is always helpful to have
in the bag so that's why I carry these
guys around now flipping this back over
back with more audio if I'm not using my
earbuds you know what these are already
my favorite headphones to walk around
with to travel with these are the Sony
xb9 50 bt i think i've talked about
these enough but in case i have it these
things sound amazing especially if
you're a bass lover honestly if you're a
bass lever there's no beating these
these sound amazing
they're bluetooth but you can also use
the cable that it comes with if you
don't want to use the bluetooth it's
super comfortable it's got NFC there's
tons of things to go on it's got a bass
boost button which you just need to
experience the bass gets on ridiculous
ridiculous levels so I carry these
around with me and I don't think I'm
going to stop so that's what I got over
there over here on the side we're
finishing up audio I've got a portable
speaker now you might think what's this
guy doing with a portable speaker in his
backpack well let me tell you it's come
in handy there have been times where me
and airy
and we want to listen to some music like
if we hit up a hotel room or something
throw this guy on and we're having a
good time now if you've never seen this
before it's the JBL pulse - now this is
the second version and this thing has a
lot more features it's really awesome it
has a ton of lights you can customise
the heck out of this guy they've got
this new multi speaker system now where
you can sync them together with other
speakers that are just like this so
that's pretty awesome it's got some
little cool features the sound quality
is on point so I'm gonna go into more
detail with this in another video but
this is what I've been carrying around
with me
for the last couple of weeks this thing
has been pretty awesome with that sit
aside let's see what else we've got oh
this guy over here this is the tech
survival kit this is a hardshell case
everything you'll need tech wise in case
of an emergency is inside of this case
if you guys want to see a video about
this definitely leave a thumbs up and a
comment down below
show me how interested you are and I'll
have it cooked up for you so I'll put
that to the side a little mystery for
you but what else do I have I've got a
couple of things here these are for the
rx100 now this is an action monopod aka
a selfie stick but it's a legit selfie
stick because it's got some awesome
quality it's got a nice grip here on the
side now this is made for action cameras
like go pro or Sony's action cam and
just want to use it like this but it's
actually turned out to be really amazing
for vlogging because I don't have to
hold the camera so close to my face and
it has a better time focusing since it
can see my face more clearly so this is
what I use for that and it's been
actually pretty awesome and it's legit
it's dirty it's not like the cheap fake
metal ones that you find in like all the
stores now so this is legit I love this
and over here I've got a mini tripod
this is like a table tripod you can
throw your
camera on it and it's actually supports
some pretty decent weight and you can
actually just press this button in and
you're able to tilt this and move it
around so you can position your camera
just the way you want it or maybe you
can use this as a super tiny selfie
stick just to give you some links and
hold your camera from afar so this thing
is actually pretty legit very good
quality and it's not expensive at all
super cheap so I carry both of those
around to me in case I want to use a
selfie stick or if I want to put it on
the table
I've got my options I love options and
lastly in this well not lastly but I've
got a couple of notebooks this is just a
regular a notepad where I take my notes
same jotting down anything I need to do
I put it in this guy and over here I've
got something called the uncanny valley
no beading this this thing is an insane
system if you need to get on track you
want to get your life straight you want
to set up your goals all the kind of
stuff that you would do with an
organizer this thing is the way to go
it's super legit shout out to airy for
putting me on to this if you need to get
your life together look no further this
thing will help you out so boom there's
that if you're not into using like your
phone or something if you want to write
it down that's legit option and over
here we're wrapping this up don't worry
I've got my surface now this is my
surface pro 3 I still carry this guy
around but it has the new type cover
keyboard now this keyboard is amazing
this kind of changed the game for me
when it comes to the surface this is how
the keyboard should have been when it
first released it has amazing feel a
great travel the keys are separated now
the trackpad is extremely different it's
larger it's way more comfortable this
makes me feel like the surface can be
more of a laptop than it used to
there's still some funky stuff in terms
of positioning since it's you know not a
strong hinge or anything like that but
this is like my tablet and I actually
like to place theme on here so I've got
a couple of themed games that I
so I've got my Windows Windows 10 right
here in the form of the surface pro 3
and let's see this is it for here and
last but not least I've got well this is
actually not last but I've got my
15-inch MacBook Pro my 15-inch MacBook
Pro I've been doing a crap ton of
editing on here I mean a lot of malting
all my most recent videos like the last
few videos I've been doing all we're
done on this since I haven't been home
and forever it's all been done on this
guy and it's a MacBook what can you say
I do all my Final Cut Pro editing on
here so boom that's that and last but
not least now this is last but not least
in this back you've got a little secret
compartment that you wouldn't even know
is a compartment because it just looks
like padding but there's a zipper here
and I've got this little hard drive this
is the Samsung t1 hard drive external
hard drive now this is an SSD and you
can plug this into a computer and this
is one terabyte guys one terabyte I can
throw this guy in my wallet this thing
is pretty awesome and it's super fast so
I can put all of my video files on here
and edit right off of this guy with no
problem and if I need to jump to another
computer take it out plug it into
another computer continue my editing no
issues super super useful John and
Austin put me on to this amazing stuff
and this is it bag is empty I think
that's it for the gadget backpack 4.0
this might be overkill to some but there
have been plenty of times where someone
says I wish we had this I'm like I got
that so this is what I do with my god
two backpacks hopefully you enjoyed it
if you did be the cool guy or girl that
gives this video a thumbs up and I'll
catch you guys in the next one till then
it's your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
