right here feeding the TV go off peace
out the last game that we'll play on
this what's going on guys your average
consumer and today is a very sad day
you've read the title right we're
destroying my baby
the ultimate gamers paradise will be no
longer and some of you guys have seen
this room turned into what it is over
the years all the subtle upgrades the
new things that we've added all the
different aspects of gaming we have over
here my gaming PC this is leaked the
gaming PC that I built on my own
it is powering the setup we've got our
editing station over here
our iMac pros this isn't really about
gaming but we get a lot of work done
here since we spent so much time or we
used to spend so much time in the gamers
paradise and of course you can't miss
all the beautiful Gundam everywhere our
shrine to Xbox with a ton of Xbox one
controllers how many do we have yeah I
think we have like at least 50
controllers thank you Xbox he's right
but over here we have our gaming setup
65 inch TV wall-mounted LED lights
everywhere so no sound system all of the
systems that you could possibly want to
play and that's what this little section
is all about Oh can't forget this side
right here this is where we have like a
portable gaming systems is a dope setup
if you haven't seen the gamers paradise
in its full form and glory
I'll have video links down below in the
description so you guys can check it out
but we are moving over to a new studio
so we gotta start taking this thing
apart
no listen nobody's touching the Gundams
but me and that is absolutely gonna be
last you guys right here we have like
just all the games that I've collected
the physical copies anyway I don't
really get any physical copies anymore
come on show some respect
I pretty much do digital now it's a lot
easier instead of having to swap out
games every time you want to play a
different game all the pokemon games
that we have I got these from you right
Ari this is like a dangerous move right
here all these 3ds games so when I first
made the gamers paradise these portable
systems were what we're in you know Vida
3d ashes but now with the switch being
the main portable system that I play you
kind of don't really need this kind of
setup you could dock it now play it on a
big TV to sit on a regular couch
who needs this when you know you can
just have a regular TV set up so I guess
we're good we'll take this part down
all right I have to connect this thing
is just like I tried I tried longer than
Xbox did they stop they stop supporting
it I still did but that's all good this
is the gaming headset that we chose for
here this was so easy the Astros
whenever I wanted to switch between ps4
and Xbox all I have to do is just drop
it in the base and boom I was hooked up
and now it's got to go it's all gotta go
this is actually pretty painful to just
start unplugging things Amazon TV is
super clutch by the way for those of you
who don't know this pretty much replaced
the Kinect for me if I wanted to control
the TV just use that thing just with the
voice it's good stuff this this is this
is gonna be tough right here feeding the
TV go off peace out the last game that
we'll play on this the retro ps4 Prout
made to look like the original
PlayStation color where did this they
did a great job that one of 25 the very
first one they made yeah this is number
wonderful yeah number one of 25 yeah
they launched it with you boy haha
alright so getting the systems is out is
one thing but the drawers for each
system is kind of crazy but we got tons
of accessories oh arey this is your
controller that you made it
you did a decent job I'm proud of you
you know there's just so many things
here that I probably will never use you
know what let's make a box where we just
put all that stuff inside up and then
we'll just kind of give it away and
maybe like on social media all right
guys if you're not following me on
Instagram Twitter or you're not part of
my discord server this cord is
definitely a big thing so if you don't
follow me on any of those you should
definitely hit the links down below in
the description will give away a lot of
the stuff that I probably will never
take a look at again oh my god the video
finish the rest of the video first guys
I'll make sure I wait a few days before
I put anything up all right guys so we
got a little something old-school over
here this is Aires from when she so we
got Pokemon golden so a gold version so
this is this is legit you know give her
some respect to that we got a gameboy oh
we got took Gameboy colors okay so what
do we have Barbie
ocean discovery Buffy the Vampire Slayer
Sabrina the Teenage Witch oh man Wow
mary-kate and Ashley wow you guys are
girly girls at least you got Super Mario
Bros deluxe I can respect that too
Rugrats
I've no Rugrats kid so I give you
respect for that it looks like it
survived a lot all right so this part is
the more like this stuff is more
delicate because it's like way more
expensive this is where we do all our
work and this we're gonna take over to
the other studio and for those of you
who just might be curious what kind of
stuff we're editing on this is the ten
core iMac pro 128 gigs of ram right here
we have a promise Pegasus with 48
terabytes or 52 terabytes
do you remember Jay yeah well it's got a
bunch of terabytes
but that thing actually gets filled up
with all the projects that we work on
yeah right Linus come make us a server I
gotta be careful with this thing and it
feels so wrong just taking anything
apart with this so those are all the
Xbox controllers that we had in that
dror you know what let's have some fun
let's put all the Xbox controllers right
here I want to see just how many we all
have yep wait do we not have like just
one more ah we have one more Xbox
controller over here to round it all out
the UAC Xbox one elite controller yeah
so 6 times 6 36 that's it only got 36
controllers here I said like 50 before I
thought we had a lot there's a lot
alright so let's take down this TV for
those of you who don't know behind this
TV we have like these LED strips so
these guys right here what kind of gate
with that glow but we got to take all
this down I guess I can show you guys
like what kind of went into the cable
management so that you guys can just see
a floating TV floating sound bar alright
Eric you got this now we've got the TV
and let's just put it on the floor right
now alright guys so this is pretty much
the cable management that went into this
so we've got our bracket over here this
held up the TV so we cut out a hole we
put this cover over here so all the
cables can neatly go inside of the wall
and then they spill out through here at
the bottom it's gonna be pretty easy to
just pull all the cables well actually
let me do it the other way around
does this plug is easier oh yeah that's
how we did them a cable management for
the TV and sound system now we got to do
this guy the gaming PC this thing listen
I am NOT looking forward to this because
to get these aligned took me so long and
having to hide the cables back here gosh
guys but I will say though the over time
the cable management for this setup has
gotten atrocious take a look guys and
don't judge alright the J Raceway that
we used to have in the back the adhesive
started to get weaker and it started
falling off but it doesn't matter now
we're going to take it all apart where
does one begin first of all let's get
these Gundams honors
I don't yo guys over here this al jar
this is from Ikea and Alex drawer is
pretty common but this is kind of stuff
that's inside of it
phones for days all the phones that we
test my personal phones from before I
even started the channel all that stuff
is inside of here but instead of
emptying all that stuff out we'll
probably just move the whole drawer all
right now this feels like I'm actually
destroying this place like this monitor
really and for those of you who have
been asking about the RM I use this is
from lock tech they're actually pretty
good arms it's been a pretty difficult
to line them all up perfectly since
they're three ultra wide monitors but
this arm allowed me the flexibility to
kind of move them and position them
exactly as I wanted I think they have
some that can hold up to two monitors so
definitely get my recommendation they've
served me really well so there's a
motorized desk and I can kind of raise
up the height to whatever I want so if I
wanted to be a standing desk boom but
this is actually really useful if you're
working on cable management it makes it
a lot simpler to kind of go under and do
what you need to do this Jay raceway was
overstuffed
for sure it's just too heavy fast you
see how crazy this is just all of these
cables so all that was hidden inside a
this guy right here so if you have a
desk setup of some sort this J Raceway
is in absolute MutS it's a must-have all
right so computer is gone the monitors
are gone everything even this little
sound panels that we used to have over
here all gone so these are the only
things left I think what we'll do is I
will grab all of the Gundams place them
over here so it's going to be a little
bit easier to kind of get these things
out of here
this is gonna be the slowest thing cuz
man so right here we've got the metal
bills these are the more high-end
version of Gundams for those of you
interested they're a bit more expensive
and they come pre-built but they've got
like metal pieces they're a lot sturdier
these will last quite a bit longer look
at this guy it's got a lot going on this
one that is something else
Malcolm I'm good bro okay you two are
the last people I need helping me I'll
be able grateful for this sorry guys
now go put a death but all right guys so
these are all the gun them over here and
also over here these guys actually
helped me put them on the desk much to
my dismay I did not want them to touch
anything but they did anyway we checked
my heart rate after we did this it's
changing now 13 minutes ago it was
resting at 63 and then it shot up to 102
when we just checked it just to show you
how much they were freaking me out so
pretty much with the Gundams over here
we can kind of look in this direction
there's not much else here I gotta take
these pieces of art down but you guys
know if you don't there's a closet here
with a lot of stuff though
so here the gamers paradise closet and
this guy has tons and tons of headphones
Gundam boxes
lots of portable chargers speakers
Bluetooth speakers if you guys for all
you guys who always ask me where does
everything go it's here baby
so we'll probably just do this part
tomorrow I am I think we need a little
break I've done enough destroying for
one day okay so day two and I think
we've pretty much cleaned here
completely out closets actually empty
like I said it was gonna be so it's
completely barren inside of there it
just got a couple of figures on the
sides
and that's pretty much all there is to
all of the artwork is down except for
that guy over there but that's the
gamers paradise this is now just a
normal room with some Gundams but the
new gamers paradise guys is going to be
dope trust me
gamers paradise 3.0 is going to be
absolutely insane we got it in a bigger
better location but it might take some
time to set it all up since this guy
took me a few months so keep your eyes
peeled for that hopefully it doesn't
take too long but also hopefully you
guys took away a little something from
this video how some products have held
up how I did cable management how cable
management has held up but hopefully you
learned a little bit of something here
but till the next video guys hopefully
you enjoyed it if you did be the cool
guy or girl I give this video a thumbs
up and definitely thumbs up for the next
game is paradise and I'll catch you guys
in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
