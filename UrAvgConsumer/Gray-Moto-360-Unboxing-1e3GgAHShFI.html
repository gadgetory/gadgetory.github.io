consumer and by now I'm sure you've
heard of Android wear and wearable tech
but today I've got an unboxing of the
most anticipated addition to Android
wear in the wearable tech market and
that is the Moto 360 now Motorola
announced there's quite some time ago
and it got hyped up and everybody wanted
one and when it finally went on sale is
sold out like but luckily I was able to
grab one so hey let's not waste any time
let's get right into it
and all right guys here we have the Moto
360 now I've been waiting for this guy
forever and here you see I picked up the
gray version and just a quick look
around the box you can see that it's a
cylinder kind of box because of course
the 360 is has a round face to the sides
it'll tell you some of the things that
you can expect from Android wear over
here it's the same thing but in another
language but um yeah I'm pretty excited
so I'm just gonna get to the opening of
this guy so I'm gonna pop this open with
my unboxing knife so here we have it and
I'll slice this tape open right here
there we go we've got some more tape
over here and I think this is the last
piece and boom so three pieces of tape
and let's open this thing up boom here
you have it man this this thing look
pretty already
alright so let's see if there's anything
else over here up top here just shows
you the Moto 260 and it has a nice
little protective piece right here to
make sure that the screen is okay inside
the packaging so we'll get some tape off
so let's pull this out so here we have
it I'm not gonna play with it yet until
I get everything else out get this to
the side so of course what we have here
is a charging cradle now the Moto 360
supports wireless charging so with this
thing when you're plugged in with a
microUSB cable which is also included
inside of here and dropped it through
sixty into the cradle and
and boom you're charging wirelessly and
I really like that I'm a fan of wireless
charging so it's gonna make it a snap
since this supposedly has one day of
battery life you have to at night just
throw it on here and you'll be good to
go so let's take a look at what else
we've got we've got some paperwork tells
you a quick gives you a QuickStart guide
so you can know exactly what to do with
the 3:16 and also some warranty
information and how to protect it so
that's here now you also have this micro
USB cable and this wall adapter so let's
see what we how long the cable is when
we take it apart you guys can see here
that this is actually a pretty decent
length cable so if you want to put this
on a desk or a nice stand or something
this is actually gonna be pretty solid
the feel of it is pretty good yeah
that's about it for this let me stop
wasting time and get to the actual 360
so we're gonna clean here up a bit and
let's check out the 360 and alright guys
here we have the Moto 360 it comes on
this little piece of cushion here that
just like a normal watch so all we have
to do is slide this thing out put this
over to the side and here you have it
now this has leather straps now this is
our Harwin leather I believe it's called
or ya hard wean or Harwin leather and
this is it
it feels pretty solid not not anything
too crazy it's not the best feeling uh
leather in the world but it's alright
and but this feels really nice this
feels very solid as far as the Moto 260
piece itself I plan on getting the metal
straps that come out later in the fall
those retail for about 80 bucks but you
can actually buy this with the metal
straps later on for 300 altogether now
you pay a premium for the metal straps
it's $80 but they're factoring the price
of the leather straps that are included
here so if you were to buy both of them
separately it all would always come out
to 330 dollars so yeah that's that so
let's see if I can actually take this
sticker off the screen
and boom there you have it now I didn't
mention it yet but the actual 360 itself
retails for two hundred and fifty
dollars which is actually a really good
price point in my opinion I like the
price I expected it to be like three
hundred but thankfully it wasn't now I'm
at the bottom here you might be I'll be
able to see it already there's a little
black bezel now it doesn't go all the
way around the screen because all the
sensors are down here and it doesn't go
all around the screen so that they don't
take away from real estate for the
screen so all of that sensors and stuff
like that are all dumb packed at the
bottom so now let's actually see if we
can power this thing on so just press
the button got a little vibrate and you
can see the Motorola symbol here kind of
reminds me of the bat-signal and inside
you can see the startup screen I show
you some of the mechanics inside of a
watch and here you have the Android wear
boot up so what I'm gonna do now guys is
I'm gonna set this thing up and I'm
probably gonna play with it for a little
bit and give you guys my first
impressions
now before I set this thing up I'm gonna
let you guys know some of the specs of
the 360 it's got a 1.5 inch screen and
it's got a resolution of 320 by to 90
and that 290 is because of the black
bezel at the bottom that cuts off so
it's 320 by 1 290 and it also has a
three hundred and twenty milliamp
battery so it's supposed to last a full
day but some people say that it only
lasts half a day so I'm gonna let you
guys know in my review how it's worked
out for me it also has 4 gigs of
internal storage I don't think you'll be
able to store anything on this but I'm
sure that's for like future updates and
handling firmware and software and stuff
like that it also has 512 megabytes of
RAM bluetooth 4.0 which is how it
connects to your phone or Android device
and it's also waterproof and dustproof
so you can probably take a shower with
this with no problem you don't have to
worry about that but that's enough of
the specs let me get this connected to a
device and I'll let you guys know my
first impressions alright guys so I
finished setting up and once you start
the initial setup process you actually
have to charge it some in order to
actually use it I think I have to start
so at least about 75% until you let me
mess around with the settings and
actually get into the 360 and for some
of you guys who don't know what Android
wear
all about it'll pretty much allow you to
use Google now on your Android wear
device so you'll be able to see
notifications and all the different
things that Google now offers right from
your watch without having to pull out
your phone now with this you can also do
like Google searches you could do
navigation you can all find all kinds of
information on here and I think that's
really useful now there are also apps
that developers make so that you can
actually go in and you know add
different things to be watched but I'm
not sure how much all of that is going
to consume the battery so I'm gonna let
you guys know in a full review but so
far my first impression is that I am
very happy with this it looks like it's
a quality device it feels very premium
it definitely seems like it's worth the
two hundred and fifty dollars that you
pay for it
but I can't make any final decisions
about the overall experience
until I've used it for a bit and I
actually mess around with the software
some but the actual feel itself is very
premium very high quality stuff I'm
impressed so far but I'll let you guys
know in a full review how it functions
and all the good stuff so if you're
