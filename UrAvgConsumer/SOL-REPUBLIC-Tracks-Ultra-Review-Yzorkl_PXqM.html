want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone at your average consumer and
today I review for you guys of the SOL
Republic tracks ultra arch let's not
wasting time let's get right into it
alright guys so here we have the SOL
Republic tracks ultra now these are some
very nice-looking headphones I'm quite a
fan of the design I think they look
really good I really like the color I
don't think they'd offer too many colors
I think this is the only one actually um
this cost about 170 $9.99 for the tracks
ultra the tracks HD cost 120 $9.99 and I
think just the regular tracks cost about
a hundred bucks if I if I remember
correctly so this is quite a step up in
price compared to the others so in this
review I'll see if it's outside I'll let
you guys know if I think it's worth that
$50 price jump from the HDS
now let's talk a bit more about the
design this has a pretty nice design um
it's really interesting this whole new
take on you know headphones I like the
fact that these ear cups can just come
off just like that and it's all very
interesting it's like a four piece set
you got your wide cable here and it's a
wide cable because it has the UM the two
inputs and sitted ear cups that going
here so it's no shaped like a Y if you
can see that and you know it has two ear
cups which are very nice I really do
like the design of these ear cups it has
like an aluminum finish as you can see
they kind of spin there how the light
spins on it the only problem with these
ear cups though is it seems really easy
for debris to get inside and for it to
look a little messy as you can see if I
have like swipe it or something you can
I'm not sure if you can pick it up I'm
you know I'm gonna give you guys a
close-up so you can see what I'm talking
about
alright guys so here are the ear cups up
close I'm not sure if you can see like
this little white stuff going right here
and the little scratch I made these
little things are like you know these
happen a lot
it's very easy for this to happen and
all I'm not really sure why but you know
it does but one thing is don't you know
if you just swipe up in US in a circle
circular motion it kind of gets rid of
it so you know it's not bad it's not
like a permanent problem or anything but
it's just annoying that like you know
without realizing it it can get like
that and um you don't want to be walking
around looking like your and phones are
scratched up or something or it's just
dirty so that's the only my only real
complaint as far as the ear tips go also
this um just white cushion it can get a
bit dirty since it is white um you'd
really don't want these like lying on
your jeans for long or anything like
that so that might be a problem so the
white cushion is also another little
thing about these ear cups and the
headband also has um that same white
cushioning and you know when you're
sweating from your head and you know it
can be quite the problem so not really I
like the color of the white and blue you
know it's a good mix I think but it's
just not practical when um you know for
everyday use cuz these will get pretty
dirty alright that's my take on that but
I still do like the design I think the
color scheme was great this is a great
blue it's kind of like it's kind of teal
almost and you know till just random is
a random color but that happens to be my
favorite color so I'm a real big fan of
these they look really good um and the
band is really strong you know they say
it's virtually indestructible you can
kind of twist there all kinds of funky
ways and not have to wear a lot of
snapping here you can do a 180 on it and
nothing breaking no problem now that's a
cool feature no but it's not really
practical at all
no one should be bending their
headphones like this or you know
twisting it like this um you know it
just goes to show you how durable it is
you know just some bonus points the only
time you'll have to worry about it being
able to twist like this is if you end
sitting on it by accident on a couch and
you're gonna probably put pressure on
one side more than the other so I don't
have to worry about it snapping easily
like that but pretty much that's like
the only real situation that it's um
that that bending factor is gonna be
really good for it it being squished by
you or maybe something in your bag
that's about it but overall it is still
nice to have the ability to you know
bend the headphones like that and not
worry much about it being getting messed
up or anything like that so that's
always really cool and you cannot
confirm making it that durable it's only
a good thing I know a lot of people
don't like that headband because they
say it looks cheap but you know you
can't complain when you're have been you
know it's not gonna snap so I think it
kind of throws the cheap argument out
sentences you know it's a very durable
pair of them know very durable headband
so I can't really complain um these are
also very comfortable the cushions are
very nicely plush it's also nice up top
can't complaints are very comfortable I
think that because of the way the band
is made it doesn't have it's not really
tight so it's pretty comfortable
sometimes I feel like it's a little too
loose on my ears but that just me might
be me used to some tire headphones but I
think that that was that's probably a
good thing for most people because it's
gonna feel pretty nice and um you're not
too worried about it clamping on your
head anything like that so that's
definitely a bonus and it's still secure
a while on your head like that so that's
always a good thing
definitely some pluses there so overall
I really do like the design of it I
think they're great looking headphones
one thing I do wish that these could do
that they obviously can't is fold you
know no matter how indestructible you
don't want to you know fold these in and
tuck them away don't want to risk
folding them too much no you know I
thought wish that it folded it makes it
a bit more compact when taking these
places with you it actually comes with
this little carrying case which if you
saw my unboxing
I think that this looks pretty similar
to a like an iPod I'm not a tablet case
or sweetie rather and you know it's
really interesting take on you know a
traveling pouch and this is how they go
in so you can slip I flip this in your
book bag or something I don't know maybe
change the song to something I'm not too
sure how you want to go around with it
but you know it's a little on the clunky
side even though it is a bit flat it's
still like a big this big square shape
not too fond of that so well I wish it
could fold so it can have like a smaller
compact design as far as the case goes
but really not not too much to complain
about this does protect it from
scratches and things like that so that's
always a good thing and that's pretty
much when I think about the design
they're really nice looking pair of
headphones and what's really cool about
soul Republic is that you're able to
change swap out the headbands for other
different kinds of have bends so you can
get yourself like a different look
different kind of style depending on
your outfit who knows what you want to
do you want to switch it up so it's
pretty cool that you can have these
interchangeable head pins and you know
they cost about $30 a pop so it can get
pretty expensive when you know you try
to get a lot of colors or collect a lot
of colors or something like that but you
know it's really cool that you have so
many options with these headphones so
I'm really I really like that now we
spoke about the durability to comfort
the design aspect now I'm sure you guys
want to know about the sound quality the
sound quality I must say um I wasn't too
wowed by these I have tried the SOL
Republic tracks HD and I really cannot
tell the difference between these two
months the only difference I really
could tell well I can't tell the
difference in what makes these better
than the HDS um the hd's had more bass
than the ultras so that was very
surprising to me I'm not sure what kind
of sound they're going for with these
but the HDS have more bass and outside
of that I couldn't tell a difference
between the two sound quality's like I
said I'm not an audiophile or anyone in
industry or audio industry so I can't
pick up on the little things and I don't
think your average consumer can pick up
on the little things like that either so
what I recommend you guys shop there's
an extra 50 bucks for these over the HDS
I definitely do not like I said it has
to be a noticeable difference
considering that these look exactly the
same as the HDS these look exactly the
same
these don't even same so republic ultras
on them or anything like that they don't
mention also us anywhere on the
headphones so you're really
I'm not official what you'd be paying
for aside from the fact that you know
it's one of the new ones or maybe the
fact that you might want less bass but
outside of that there's really no
benefit to these that I can pick up and
that I think your average consumer will
be able to pick up as well but overall
it still sounds decent I would still
definitely go with the Trax HD over the
other you know any time but I do like
those better than to use so that pretty
much wraps up everything I have to say
about them as far sound quality that
looks durability all that good stuff so
now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
show you how it looks on and around my
head alright guys so here you are with
the Trax ultra around my neck and as you
can see this is it tablets on the side
pretty cool and here it is on my head
there you are this is how it looks like
from the front and from the side so like
I said not a bad looking pair of
headphones I really I'm a fan of the
design myself I think they look really
good and overall guys my impression of
the ultras are on the decent pair of
headphones because the tracks HD are
cheaper look exactly the same and sound
better I would go for those instead of
these if you're maybe an audiophile I
think that you might be a baby be able
to pick up on the difference between the
two aside from the fact that the HDS
have a bit more base um but as further
average consumer
I don't think that there's a reason to
pay another $50 for these over the HDS
so that's just my opinion letting you
guys know what I think about the track
salt truck and hopefully if you like
