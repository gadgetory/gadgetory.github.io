consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day in the life with the
iPhone 8 and 8 plus and if you've never
seen one of my real data live videos
you're pretty much gonna be spending a
full day with me and the new phones so
we can see how they stack up in the real
world so we're gonna be testing out all
kinds of stuff like battery life
performance those new cameras and a lot
more so let's see how they did all right
guys so I've got the iPhone a plus in
hand I was rocking the iPhone 8 we got
em all charged up to 100% so we're gonna
let you know how it works throughout the
entire day but we've got a ton of
different laces to go to videos to shoot
meetings to go to so we'll let you know
how it goes alright guys so we just made
it to this place
foofie poochie's our little monster over
here is going to get groomed we actually
had a what a 20-minute ride using the
GPS to find the spot and I was using
some apps before so right now I'm about
83% we've got about an hour and 49
minutes of usage don't got eighty-three
percent so that's solid so I think right
now is a good time to take some before
and after pictures of cookie test out
this camera let you guys see how it
works so let me see if I can get her to
cooperate look all right you know what
this will work cookie tree oh you want a
treat monster alright I think I got a
decent shot here I think it looks pretty
good she looks like a hot mess but it is
a very full
the quality on this camera is insane
though there's a very sharp shot colors
look great
really vibrant those dope alright guys
so right here this is a scooter board
and we've shot I don't know maybe three
videos with this board they're all gonna
be coming out on the channel and
whatever order but for those of you who
don't know it's a mix between a
skateboard and a scooter it's electric
so it goes on its own and it's really
cool so I'm gonna be using this to see
what the stabilization is like on the
iPhone eight plus so it's got optical
image stabilization we're gonna see
house to move the video we can get from
it so I don't drop this bone
tracking the street
right now I have to upload a video but
obviously I'm outside I don't have Wi-Fi
so I'm gonna turn on my personal hotspot
but instead of having to jump into my
settings and turning it on like that all
I got to do is swipe up with the control
center and long press over here and then
boom I have access to it right here I
just tap it and my personal hotspot is
on that's one thing I really like about
control center you kind of get
everything you need right at your
fingertips and if you don't see it
immediately you give it a long press and
you have access to a lot more settings
so that is an awesome feature and I just
think that that's one of the best
changes that you're gonna find with iOS
11 now gotta upload this video all right
guys so we're finally back at the studio
but I want to talk about the design but
first up don't mind the mess we're still
trying to figure things out guys but
let's talk about the design here so
we've got both phones here this is well
I'm gonna take this real quick so over
here we have the gold iPhone 8 we got
the 8 pluses over here silver space grey
now I think that these look awesome I
think anybody who came from like a seven
or seven plus even though these don't
seem like a really drastic change in
terms of design once you get introduced
to this new glass back it kind of
changes the game now it's glass so you
know you have to worry a little bit
about scratches fingerprints and you
know things of that nature but you can
always slap a deep brand skin I'm
actually going to be applying this
dragon skin in just a second I'll show
you guys what it looks like but you can
add that onto here so that you can get
some more grip out of your phone but
honestly you're really getting pretty
much a very similar design the new glass
back you know that's nice but you're not
getting much else you're getting a glass
back and a little bit more heft in terms
of the design that's all that's really
changed and that gold of all the space
great looks different too this is like a
replacement for jet black but just a
little grayer you know it's all good
though so look what we got back so
instead of using the rear camera this
time we're gonna go ahead and use the
front-facing camera and take some
selfies with the little girl and we'll
see how that turns out
all right let's see not that I in the
camera I mean while on the screen it
looked a little overexposed but actually
looking at her she looks pretty good
really good exposure sharpness is there
hey listen
iPhone 8 and 8 plus have really really
good cameras and in terms of battery
we're looking at about 35% with 4 hours
of usage at 4 hours and 16 minutes of
usage really good it's 238 so we still
got more of the day left but I've been
testing it quite a bit today so we've
been draining that battery like crazy so
right now guys we've got the GPS on even
more
we got a 26 minute drive ahead of us and
at 34% so we'll see just how much
drainage that takes up out of the phone
now something we're not taking full
advantage of with the iPhone 8 plus
right now is the fact that it has
wireless charging now this dock that I
have for my car actually has wireless
charging built into it but because I'm
testing the battery to see how long it
lasts throughout the day
I'm not utilizing that feature but if
we're just a normal day I'd have it
plugged in and while I'm using the GPS
to do all these different things and go
all these different places I wouldn't
have to worry about the battery draining
at all because of the wireless feature
built-in and that's one of the real
benefits of having wireless charging you
have them all in these different little
spots in your house or your car wherever
it may be
and then you don't have to worry about
battery life as much as you would on a
normal day so we just got back that was
like I said a twenty seven or eight
minute ride and now we're down to 27
percent it's to be twelve so we'll see
how much longer it lasts right now we're
at four hours and 47 minutes of usage
which with a lot of other phones if only
be dead by now so guys just interesting
thing this is my first time actually
using a white-faced iPhone one of the
silver colors and I'm usually all about
that Space Gray life and I gravitated
towards the dragon skin for that but
since I have a lighter phone I think it
makes more sense to swap over to this
concrete skin and I think this looks a
bit better and matches overall I think
I'll be rocking out with this for
okay five o'clock and I've got 1% left
now hear me out
this is pretty bad I actually spent
almost I spent like two and a half hours
using the GPS I've been using it for a
longer than just one day and this isn't
even the best that I've seen obviously
the GPS has killed it quite a bit more
but I've gotten way more I think close
to eight hours
there are many phones that can do that
yeah so today it was a bit of an anomaly
we went out a ton went to a bunch of
different places so we destroyed the
battery with GPS but we get to use the
fast charging feature that it has built
into it so kind of works out this is the
$80 fast charging option for you guys
out there oh and the screen on time
we're looking at six hours and 21
minutes so let's try this out we're
gonna plug this up I'm gonna have me
some McDonald's and see how much juice
we get in about 30 minutes all right
guys so thirty minutes has passed let's
see what we've got
so right now 65% it was pretty good
pretty good that cost eighty bucks but I
think that's uh that's really expensive
which kind of sucks because you got
phones like the galaxy s a d1 plus to
have fast charging built into the
packaging you can just you know plug in
and you have access to that it's
expensive feature but it's nice to have
alright guys so we ended up in Best Buy
and there's like always a ton of good
lighting in here so we tried out that
portrait mode feature and we got some
pretty interesting results and here's
one that we just got and it did pretty
well but something that I like about it
is that you can access the portrait
lighting features that Apple introduced
with the new a plus by simply editing
the photo and then picking the one you
want later on and you get some
interesting results to do light allows
some more light on the face like it's a
studio shot contours darkens the shadows
a bit and then you've got the
interesting ones like stage light where
it kind of gives this blacked-out effect
in the background and it doesn't work
that
well not yet anyway and you also got
stage like mono which kind of turns it
black and white these are okay in terms
of like alright I don't know you I think
you probably need like a very nice
setting in order to do this I don't
think I'll just off-the-cuff random
pictures are gonna make it look as good
as a candy but as right now it's
probably on the mode that you're gonna
want to use a lot and over here I
already actually made a pretty
interesting observation now there's a
bit of light on the tip of my nose but
if you go all the way to the mono light
you can see that light was counted as
the background so it kind of cuts off a
piece of my nose got that Michael
Jackson look going so that's what
happens so it's not perfect yet
hopefully they work on it and you know
we see improvements but as of right now
the first three modes work pretty well
the last two not so much so now that
I've already told you guys how long this
thing can last during the day I plug
back in my wireless charging dock over
here and all I got to do go it in and it
starts charging immediately so now I
just take it put it in take it out I
don't have to worry about plugging
anything in any more now time to go
and that's pretty much my day guys
now I was running around like a chicken
with his head cut off and doing a ton of
traveling way more than I would have
liked so I didn't get a chance to show
you guys any real content consumption
you guys know I like to watch my anime
during some downtime but I didn't get a
chance to show you guys that but based
on my experience outside of that single
day I have no real complaints about the
display I think it looks awesome the
only issues that I have with it is the
fact that it's not OLED a lot of
displays now are OLED a lot of the
premium flagship displays are so it
would have been nice to see that here
also the fact that it doesn't have the
thin bezels that's something that we're
gonna be seeing with the iPhone 10 as
well as OLED but it would have been nice
to see that with the new 8 and 8 plus as
well but it still is a functional
good-looking display but if you really
want something new to kind of shake
things up you're gonna want to take a
look at the 10 and speaking of constant
consumption when you're watching your
videos or maybe just listening to music
with the speaker you can definitely see
an improvement with the new speakers
Apple says they're supposed to be 25%
louder and have a bit more bass and
honestly you can see the difference if
you compare an iPhone 7 or 7 plus to an
8 or 8 plus you will absolutely see the
difference they did a pretty good job
there and I want to say these are the
best speakers I ever heard on a
smartphone before HTC but they are
definitely an improvement so if you're
upgrading you'll like that change but
like I said to keep that display looking
good Apple introduced a new wide color
gamut as well as some features like true
tone display honestly the true tone
display is interesting it changes the
white balance based on the lighting in
your area so it'll change depending on
where you are honestly I wasn't too
crazy about it I know that it's a
probably a way healthier option on your
eyes so that if it's nighttime it'll go
a bit to the warmer side so it can help
you fall asleep at night it's definitely
a nice future for those who are
conscious of that kind of thing but
honestly I just can't handle the color
change and when it comes to performance
that a 11 Bionic chip is beastly anybody
using the phone is gonna have a buttery
smooth experience I had no issues
whatsoever and it's so powerful that it
also allows to do a lot of cool things
with augmented reality or
see a lot of new apps taking advantage
of that from shopping to games to all
kinds of stuff so it's gonna be
interesting to see how developers take
all that power within these phones and
bring them into real world applications
and when it comes to that a new camera I
was able to get some really nice shots
Apple actually introduced a new color
filter which makes the photos seem quite
a bit more vibrant and colorful those
are the kind of photos I like I like a
lot of saturation I like very colorful
stuff I like my shot to be ready to go
as I take the picture that's honestly
been one thing that I thought Samsung
always had a leg up on Apple with a nice
colorful vibrant shot from their cameras
but now I think the iPhone is definitely
able to match that with some awesome
quality and you also get some great 4k
settings here I was able to get some
really nice smooth shots great looking
video even the front-facing camera was
able to perform really well area was
extremely happy with the selfie she was
able to get and I gotta say guys I was
impressed as well now when it comes to
battery life this is where the A+ really
shines I've always been able to get
really good battery life from the plus
versions of the iPhones but the A+ kind
of takes that to the next level I've
been able to get from 6 to 7 hours of
usage and I know some people are even
getting 8 which is just insane and with
my real name to life you guys saw me
abused seriously abused the battery by
using more than two and a half hours of
GPS and that's actually at max
brightness so I was doing quite a number
on it and it still lasted me to the end
of the day really but I was able to use
fast charging and get a ton of juice
back within like 30 minutes
but either way guys these are really
solid phones and if I'm gonna be
completely honest with you while I think
they're great my heart is really set on
the new iPhone 10 that's when we're
getting that OLED display that new
beautiful design the new front-facing
camera is gonna have all kinds of
features like face scanning all kinds of
cool new stuff is gonna be on that phone
that's kind of like the phone to wait
for that doesn't diminish the fact that
these are great options but I feel like
if you pick these up before that phone
drops you're gonna be pretty obsessed he
and everyone else walking around with a
new 10 but that's about it for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it till
then it's your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
