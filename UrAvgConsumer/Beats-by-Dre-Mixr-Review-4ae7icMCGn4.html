want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey guys it's your
I'm a consumer and today I review for
you on the beats by dre mixers
that's not wasting time let's get right
into it and here you have the beats in
their hardshell case that it comes with
and it's a really tough case and you can
see that there's a great B on both sides
and it's made out of some real soft
coating but it's really tough it doesn't
look hard but it is and when you open
them up inside you have your headphones
and a little pouch right here that holds
your headphone cables you have your
standard headphone cable with the
control talk and I think you have a pair
of DJ headphones and these are similar
to the pros but these are much smaller
compared to those I know the coil is
smaller and I'm assuming that takes away
some length these are actually kind of
like a hybrid between the pros and the
solo HDS so when you take them out you
can just slide them on it's held by this
band here and then you just pick them
out from the top right out and put this
on the side and here you have them
what's interesting about these
headphones is that unlike the other
beats where they have a collapsible of
collapsible form factor for their ear
cups these actually rotate inwards and
all you do is you pop them out and
you're good to go
these headphones have are made of a
great material it's like a metal
material and you know that adds to the
durability of these headphones which is
a great thing because people complain
about headphones snapping the headbands
of the other beats like the solos I've
heard people complaining so many times
about how it snaps
and has poor quality but I really don't
think anyone can complain about the
quality that these have and the insides
like the others are still soft so you
don't have to worry about something hard
pressing up against your head another
great thing about these headphones is
the dual input on both sides on both the
ear cups now typically you use one just
to you know listen to your music but if
you're with someone else you can put
another pair of headphones into the
other slot and you can both listen to
music on the same device that's really a
great feature for people who maybe take
the bus a lot or on a plane you can you
know basically share your you know you
can share your audio without disturbing
others when you're watching something on
like your iPad which i think is a really
great feature I'm sure it has some other
uses outside of that but I think that
for your comp you're a regular everyday
person that'll be like the best use you
can get out of it also as far as the
design I think something really great
about these headphones is actually the
logo on them typically the logo is a red
bead with a gray background but this one
has a black background which actually
goes really well with it it makes it
look even sleeker than it already is
because it doesn't stand out so much
when you're outside because it all just
blends in together which I think gives
this a lot of bonus points for as far as
style as you saw before that these kind
of flip up it's a really nice feature
that they have they flip up and they
pretty much stay on you one year this is
really nice I happen to use it for when
I'm outside and you know someone stops
to talk to me or maybe I get a phone
call I don't have to stop listening to
my music I can just put one cup up and
keep speaking someone one thing that I
happen to have a problem with was
actually the size of the headphones
because of its a metal band it's really
tight so you
and encounter some pain depending on the
size of your head I have another video
where I go into that a little bit more
if you happen to wear earrings these can
really press down on them ear on the
hearings because these are on ear
headphones they don't go over the ear or
anything because it's really tight
these can predominant rings and that
could cause you some pain that's one of
the very few issues that I've come
across with these headphones but because
it caused pain it's a pretty big issue
but it is the only issue that I've had
with them so far the only other possible
complaint I could have but it might just
be me nitpicking would be the adjusters
on these that I just can't tell where
how far apart they are from each other I
to make it even guys you like to have a
headphones even with my solo HDS I
typically just you know put my finger in
between so even though how far apart I
make sure they're even can't really do
that with these but that's just me now
the sound quality on these are great
they are probably the clearest beats
that I've heard so far it doesn't have
as much bass as though like the wireless
happen to have this doesn't have as much
bass as that the bass matches up to the
solo HDS I would say but it is clearer
like you can hear the words of the
artists a lot clearer than you can on
solo HDS I did a lot of listening
between the three of my current beats
which is a high bias the solo HDS and
the mixers the mixers gave me the
clearest sound so I got good bass it's
not overpowering clear words like I can
hear every word every lyric and it was
just great I can't complain that all
about the sound so I definitely give
this a thumbs up as far as sound quality
goes I'm not an audiophile so I can't
tell you about highs and lows or you
know hearing things like treble I can
give you an opinion on
but for your everyday person who's
listening to music on your iPod on their
way to work or class these are great I
give a thumbs up on these and I
definitely recommend them to anyone
who's interested in purchasing them all
right there you have it I think that
these are a great pair of headphones
with really good sound quality
it's got great durability because of the
material I also think that it's very
stylish so I definitely would recommend
you pick these up if you're interested
in as long as you're not concerned about
it being too tight or something like
that because it will feel tight if you
know you have a larger head I definitely
recommend it sounds great looks great
feels great spy has it for two $49.99
and I think that's the standard price if
you do get it from Best Buy I do
recommend getting very warranty or the
insurance because if something were to
happen to them you can easily just go
back get them replaced without any
problems you just bring your receipt
bring the headphones and you get a new
pair I highly recommend you guys
purchase from Best Buy and get the
insurance phone with it alright well
this is your average consumer I hope you

questions you have and I'll be sure to
answer them
