want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone and she average consumer I know
a lot of you guys have been waiting for
this video so today I'm going to be
doing my review on the beats by dre pros
so let's not waste any time let's get
right into it alright guys and here we
have the Beats pros now these are some
really great headphones hands down these
are great headphones nobody can say that
these aren't really nice
now I'm sure an audiophile can pick up
pick these apart and you know find stuff
to complain about I don't know what they
would I'm not an audiophile so I can't
tell you but for your average consumer
these are going to sound amazing
alright I personally think this is
probably one of the best headphones I've
tried up to date now these have some
great great sound quality the clarity on
the music is really clear it offers a
lot of bass and for all you know your
hip-hop lovers and you know things in
that genre dubstep all that this is
going to be great um if you listen to
softer music than that that's going to
be fine too because this offers some
really nice clarity so you can really
hear you know voices and stuff really
well so that's really nice about these
headphones so I really have no
complaints for audio whatsoever these
are just really great when it comes to
audio the build quality is also really
good on these now they have like a an
aluminum finish on some parts some parts
of you know feel like it's metal but
it's realistic you know seems like the
metal coated but you know the overall
feels like a really high-end product so
it feels like you'd pay something you'd
pay a lot of money for the only real
problem I had would be is after a while
they tend to be a bit uncomfortable and
I think that's due to how tight they can
be after a while now these are made to
swivel up with the you know the ear cups
to swivel up for like you know DJ use
and things like that so that does
definitely play a big factor into why
these are so tight they're not as bad as
the mixer is a lot more comfortable
the mixers but I definitely think that
these DJ style headphones are a little
tighter because of the swivel feature
but you know all that is good and all
and it makes sense but you're not going
to have the swivel your ear cuff
swiveled most of the time so majority of
your time you're going to have it
regularly and it's going to clamp down
on your ears and it's going to cause
some pain after some time so I've
definitely something to consider and
these are definitely like some big ear
cups and one of the things with this is
it's not big enough the cushion isn't
big enough to get your ear completely
inside of it as you can see this is a
very circular ear cut these are supposed
to be over here headphones but because
it's a circular is a small little circle
here it's not going to completely go
over your ear some of your ears going to
you know be right in between here and
some of it is going to be on the actual
cushion now the cushion is soft and
that's fine but this pressing down with
the kind of pressure that these things
have on your ear is going to cause it to
you know have that pain after a while
and you know these are big ear cups as
you can see here these are the beats
Wireless and now you guys if you guys
watch my videos enough you'll know that
these are like my go-to headphones these
are my favorites and you can kind of see
how much bigger they are in comparison
just so you guys can have an idea I'm
gonna give you guys a close-up alright
and here you can see just how much
bigger the pros are to the wireless the
Wireless aren't very small headphones
but they um there are a lot smaller than
the pros so here you can kind of see
just how much bigger the pros are to be
Wireless as far as ear cups go and the
headband is really nice it seems to have
like a two part thing going and going on
inside there can't really see but there
seems to be like one band here and
another band up top and you can kind of
like squish them together so that's kind
of what the band is made of and but it's
very comfortable and very comfortable
the build quality is really nice on they
seem like very durable
phones they can become even though
they're very large they can um become
really compact so I just can see here
these can get really small so you can
put these inside their little carrying
pouch with no problems and to show you
guys how easily it fits inside this
little pouch when you have it like this
you just slip it right in and then of
course you're going to want to throw in
your cable incenses tangle tangle free
cord you can kind of just crumple it up
throw it inside there and you just pull
the little string and there you have it
really nice and small this is definitely
easy to store it's not big at all even
though they're big headphones they
really really do get a lot smaller
inside their little pouch so it's really
easy to store throw in your backpack or
do whatever you want to do to travel
with them now my only other complaint
doesn't have to do with the headphones
themselves but the price tag these are
$400 headphones and you know as an
average consumer I don't see what
warrants that $400 price tag uh if you
guys are just looking for a nice pair of
headphones did any want beads definitely
consider one of the lower ranges
I definitely think these are called
beats pros for a reason I think that
professionals are the only ones who
really should be giving interest in
these headphones unless you just have
money to blow then by all means do
you're going to enjoy these if you buy
them but if you have to like save up or
something like that I don't think the
pros warrant that one $2 price tag is
gonna you know plus tax it's gonna cost
more than 400 bucks now I definitely
don't think if you're not involved in
music in your daily life besides just
listening to it that does these are
worth that kind of money so especially
there are other beats products out there
that you know are really great my
personal favorite is the Beach Wireless
so you know there are things like that
you can look into that are cost
substantially less than what these cost
they're still expensive but they're
still good less than this and they will
probably get the job done but overall
guys these are really great pair of
headphone
I really enjoyed them I love the way it
sounds
I love the look I love the durability I
just like I really like them these are
great headphones I just still can't want
paying $400 for them because they're
just headphones and I'm not you know a
professional so I don't think that these
would you know really fit my taste or
your taste if they're if you're not in
the music industry in some way if you're
willing to pay the price of $400 for
them you're not going to be disappointed
I don't think any average consumer can
be disappointed by the quality of just
headphones or the sound that they
produce so I don't think there's
anything wrong with the headphones
besides the you know comfort after some
time I don't think there's any problems
with the headphones themselves just not
too fond of the price tag but on that's
about it guys so if you enjoyed this
video please feel free to rate comment
and subscribe subscribing definitely
does help a lot as it keeps you guys
updated with my latest videos so that's
about it for this and till the next
video guys it's your average consumer
