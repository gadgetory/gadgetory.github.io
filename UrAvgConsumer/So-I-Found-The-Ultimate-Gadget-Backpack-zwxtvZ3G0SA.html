and today we have an interesting video
we are back with another backpack but
this time it's a little different I
think I found the ultimate gadget
backpack but I don't know if it's gonna
work out now I'm not gonna go through
all the tech that's inside of this guy
but I do want to show you guys just how
good of a backpack this thing is so this
backpack is by System G this is their
gaming + backpack and this is made for
gamers people who want to bring around a
ton of tech peripherals laptops all that
kind of stuff
it's supposed to go inside of this bag
and I will tell you guys this thing is
high quality now when I first got my
hands on this during the massive tech
unboxing I believe they had a
Kickstarter campaign going for this I'm
not really sure what's going on with
that but I still wanted to talk about
this thing because I actually started
using it recently and man it is insane
but let's go through this thing guys so
this is the overall backpack and the
first thing you'll notice is that it's
got this huge hump over here and we are
going to talk about that in a bit but
this is actually a hardshell case so if
you have anything precious things that
you want to protect inside of here
you're gonna be able to do that with no
problem at all now this thing is
absolutely loaded with compartments and
I'm telling you guys this is a very
well-thought-out backpack so all over
the backpack you've got these little
latches to kind of make sure everything
is nice and secure and it's great for
security because no one can just run up
and unzip your backpack look at this see
me struggling so you can actually open
up the very front this pouch has some
pretty cool stuff going on so you can
open it up and you have access to point
a few different spots right inside of
here
you have this little orange bag and this
thing is cool because you can use it to
store all kinds of cables and
accessories whatever it is you want to
bring around you can put it right inside
of this guy and strap it right to this
part now you've also got a little straps
for things like pens and pencils you
guys know I always like to carry some
with me and over here you've got these
little pockets that look like they were
perfectly made for a Nintendo Swiss game
so I've got a couple lined up over here
I think that is absolutely awesome that
you have a dedicated spot to put your
switch cartridges I love the attention
to detail and if you look over here we
have a couple of more spots some more
compartments that you can throw whatever
you want inside of here I got a USB C
dongle over here you got a little pouch
over here that feels so high-quality
like from this to the bag itself
everything inside of here guys the best
quality I've seen in a backpack ever and
the sound of this thing you can put
whatever you want I think on their
website they showed a passport or
something I've got a portable charger so
that's something that I keep right
inside of here
it's very very nice feel so so premium
and you probably hear me say that a lot
now that's just this little compartment
up front here you have access to the big
compartment now what's cool is that you
also have these little clips right here
so that you don't have to open this all
the way but if you want to pop them open
and boom you get access to everything
right here at the very top I've got my
xbox elite controller so this is like
the cold gaming aspect here you can
throw controllers it's probably made for
sunglasses or something but I threw a
Xbox elite controller inside of there
and you can put other things like
portable chargers I have like two mini
inside of here but I have the ability to
bring all of them because there are just
so many compartments little pockets like
this stuff like air pods
I have even more earbuds it's just
really nice more portable chargers right
here you can actually hold a pair of
headphones so that's kind of cool that's
not how I'm using it but you can do that
but if you just felt the material that
this is made out of guys I'm telling you
best quality backpack that I've ever
seen now yes there are tons of pockets
over here so check this out we go to so
they've got this little addition here
that you can actually pop right
and you can carry some stuff inside of
here too so two pockets at the bottom
holding all kinds of moment lenses you
guys see all kinds of moment lenses you
can pretty much put anything that you
want inside of here I also had a mouse
so I had a gaming mouse at the top I've
got a pair of headphones so I can listen
to my music whatever it is I can fit all
of this inside of here and we we haven't
even gotten that deep guys what's also
cool is that you have this little netted
area where you can throw something in
like a t-shirt or maybe a change of
clothes whatever it is you can kind of
put it inside of here and you have like
a dedicated spot for that and when you
get past that you guys can see I've got
a couple more things here a full-blown
Nintendo switch case this is not a small
case but it fits right here perfectly
got my switch inside of here a bunch of
games so I have access to all of that
and right here I have my 3ds so this is
always coming around with me as well
spot dedicated for it right here and a
half and iPad just lots and lots of
space guys and even up top here you have
a zipper they can get access to
something me with this being a gaming
backpack I of course have the razor
phone too this is the gaming phone so
it's only right if I'm in a gamers
mindset that I have something like this
here but you can fit pretty much any
phone if you want to put it over here
that's okay
you of course have these side pockets
that can hold onto stuff I think I have
something over here so you can fit
whatever you want whether it's a water
bottle whether it's a piece of tech you
can do that but not only do you have
that you also have a little spot on the
side to hold a little something else I
don't know what you would put inside of
here but you could put something inside
of here and there's actually another one
on this side as well so you get an extra
pocket right here in the back Oh Dan you
get on both sides as well
it's like unlimited pocket space but
let's get to the back of this thing you
can unhook these little security hooks
and boom you have access to a slot for
your laptop and heck there's even a
pouch for another laptop work tablet I
carry around two laptops with me yes I
know I'm crazy who needs all this stuff
oh yeah you have a slot for your laptop
tablet or another laptop and a little
something else and this is the 15 inch
model of this backpack so gonna hold a
15 inch laptop no problem but I believe
they also have a 17 inch version but
yeah this is plenty big to carry a ton
of stuff
now the compartments don't end here you
also have some over here at the very
bottom who would even think but you have
some right here you've got these little
slots that can probably work as a wallet
it's kind of crazy but you got these
little two things on the sides this is
actually good for holding keys you can
have your keys stored inside of here and
then just pull them out when you get
home or something and on the other side
you got the exact same thing so this
could be good for cards or maybe some
cash if you want but you can pretty much
fit anything inside here I probably
throw a tiling there would be nice but
what's also great is that there's a
little zipper here at the bottom that
gives you access to these latches which
hold on to this guy I believe this is a
35 inch mousepad so when you're gaming
going crazy you got space for your mouse
your laptop you can just kind of go nuts
and I believe this is one of their extra
accessories this is like an add-on but
it is very very high quality along with
everything else so you can strap that on
to the bottom but if you don't want to
you can take these straps and kind of
tuck them away at the bottom here zip it
up and boom they're gone
but what's clutch about this when you
have it open is that you can pull these
out and you can put this over a suitcase
so if you want to put this thing over
the handle of your suitcase you can pull
your suitcase in this at the same time I
like when backpacks have that feature
and there is plenty padding so this
thing feels comfortable but I will say
the straps here always get loose
whenever I've got my stuff in it
probably because I'm carrying a lot but
it would have been nice if this thing
has some kind of locking mechanism so
that it's not always falling down my
back I could kind of stay in place I
wish it had that now this seems like the
perfect backpack but I'm telling you
guys I just I just can't use it as my
daily because it's too big look at this
thing it's gigantic
and this hardshell case that's not
helping man while it's nice to be able
to pull all the stuff inside of here and
be sure that it's protected it's just
way too big what I throw this thing on
my back guys I will bump into things
without even realizing it there's a
level of clearance that you expect to
have with your backpack but it is so
hard to judge with this thing because it
is just so so long there have been times
where I bumped into walls by simply
turning because I didn't expect that I'd
hit it so that is my biggest complaint
if system G makes a version that doesn't
have the hardshell case but with all the
same materials that they made this out
of best backpack hands down and I'm
telling you guys I love this thing but I
just can't use it I'm like president and
CEO of turtle gang
I can't rock with this I might try
though because I really like how it
holds everything that I have with me and
honestly it's pretty inexpensive this
thing is less than 200 bucks from what I
saw on Kickstarter I believe if you
backed it it was as low as $80 so that
is an amazing an amazing price I think
the 17-inch is of course gonna be a bit
more money I don't remember how much
that one cost but I'll try to have like
their links down below in the
description but system G if you're
listening you gotta make this without
the hardshell case and you've got
yourself a winner but what do you guys
think of this do you care about a gaming
backpack do you care about something
that's as high-quality as this and such
a cheap price would you trade mobility
to have access to a high-quality bag
that can hold all of your stuff let me
know with a comment down below
I really hope to see more from this
company because they they knocked this
one out of the park
it is a Kickstarter campaign so who
knows what's really gonna happen with
that but then if this thing actually
comes out it's a game-changer but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
I'm going to continue trying to use this
just to see what my experience is like
such a good backpack but till the next
video guys it's your average consumer
