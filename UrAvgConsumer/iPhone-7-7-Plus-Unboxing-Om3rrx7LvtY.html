consumer and you know she is Ari
and happy iPhone day I swear today
really feels like a holiday right with
the way everybody lines up and gets
ready right now so if your team a on
joining you don't celebrate iPhone day
don't be offended just keep watching but
today we've got the new iPhone 7 here
I've got it in black and she's got it in
rose gold I have the 7 plus here we're
gonna go through the box see what's
different and give you an idea of what
you get because mine isn't the new color
this year I'm like last year and the
blacks were all hyped up we're gonna
start with the rose gold and just see
how it looks you gotta wait for people
so this a little different from last
year which is a little bit disappointing
you have a little tab to pull out as
opposed to just ripping a plastic but
that's not that sweet sounds like let's
see if we hear it
sorry your execution was weak alright
say this last one fit to the side and
this is how the Box looks it just says
iPhone digital specification at so 7 or
6s let's pop that sucker out it's like
it's like oh alright good so we have
Comex yes very much so you have right
here just the booklet we're going to
toss that so it's not like we always do
and then we have this beauty oh there's
a tab
and we'll put that to the side because
you know we always got to wait for it
box looks like this you have the earpods
your pie earPod all right what's under
the earpods is bang that lightning
adapter nice and then you have your plug
here and your lightning cable so nothing
too special besides a adapter as well as
the I guess the ear pod to themselves
yeah and it was really surprising
because Apple did skimp out they
actually included the connector idiot
after we thought they were going to make
people pay for it so definitely I was
gonna be 30 bucks
ya think I've got more favors and for
the best part now you can make it you
could you can execute better this time
alright let's do it and I slow I'm
dressing of this bad boy
okay I did a good job
okay all right so what's different here
what's different here Harry
so we have two cameras on the back this
time one of them is like your standard
camera and the other one allows you to
get a closer zoom and the trackpad
touchdown oh my god the home button the
home button is different here as well
what else is different as far as like
cosmetics in the body it's really the
button and the extra lens yeah I still
think it's beautiful this is definitely
what I'm gonna rock the rose gold well
what is different is this black so we're
gonna open this up let's see what's
inside now I now talk about a smack
already so you need an extra kiss I got
to make sure that mom pressures on that
I got to do it right oh it was good to
see I think those I just an expert on
the board I already know to expect some
booklets I wish this came with some
black stickers or something but these
are pretty standard all right I feel we
need a drum roll for this
so if it's new like we did last year all
right you give me a drummer okay okay
there it is oh this looks so good it
looks good people we don't have to go
through what's inside of here same thing
no it's just called black but it's
pretty much a matte black it looks like
Matt looks clean this is nice man yeah I
don't think I agreed okay today like
come on doesn't BAM like it's pretty
beautiful either way this is the new
iPhone 7 I want to try out the new home
button all right don't feel the same and
it takes some getting these two oh my
god what I took for so much free here oh
my god that is so weird
alright guys so we went through the
setup process a bit and now we're at the
part we can actually like choose the
type of clip we want for the home button
I got a chance to kind of like play
around with a little bit it it's super
weird me personally I like one as my
option because it gives the Lilith
least amount of shake I guess for your
entire phone but alright guys that about
wraps it up for this unboxing hopefully
you enjoyed it this is the new black
color I like it quite a bit more than
Space Gray I think it looks a lot nicer
especially than that rose gold right
there but hopefully you enjoyed if you
