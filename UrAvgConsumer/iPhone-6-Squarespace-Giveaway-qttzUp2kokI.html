Squarespace what's going on everyone in
travers consumer and today I think we'll
have a contest now you might be
wondering what's this contest thing
about well I'm teaming up with
squarespace and I'm sure you guys have
heard of them they have an easy-to-use
platform so that you can build your own
website or use one of their template to
create your own website and it actually
makes making a website pretty easy and
that's what I actually use for you a see
reviews com now this is where you guys
come in if you head over to squarespace
com / your average consumer of course
you can actually sign up for a free
trial or use my coupon code consumer to
sign up with squarespace for ten percent
off now what you're going to be doing
with that sign up it's actually create a
website now don't get alarmed
Squarespace is very easy as i said to
you so you can actually make a website
or use one of their templates you don't
have to know how to build a website from
scratch I definitely definitely don't
know how and it's actually been pretty
easy so I what I want you guys to do is
head on over there use one of their
templates if you have to and create a
cool website I want you guys to make
something that you know you enjoy
something you like something you're fond
of whether it be tech cooking whatever
it may be make a cool badass website so
you guys can completely take the reins
on this and make it whatever you want
and then I'm gonna be judging you guys
I'm gonna be judging the website and i'm
going to pick the best one and that
person is going to win a brand-new 64
gigabyte iphone 6 now you might be
wondering what am i judging these
websites on and it's just two things
really the first being a clean user
experience now what i mean by this is
something that is easy on the eyes not
too cluttered nothing overwhelming and
luckily if you're using one a square
spaces templates you're gonna have a
pretty easy time doing this and that's
because they offer a ton of nice
clean-looking templates and boom
that's one down now the second thing is
a cool concept like I said before you
can make this whatever you want as long
as it's cool it really shows how
passionate you are about whatever you're
going to build your website on I think
that's a good idea now bonus points go
to a site that can actually be used by
someone else something that could be
really useful and boom there you go
those are the criterias and I think
that's pretty simple and I can't wait to
see what you guys come up with and like
I said I am gonna be the one who's
judging this so I'm going to be picking
a winner now to get your submission in
for this contest we're gonna want to
make sure you're subscribed to my
channel and you're going to want to send
the URL to your website to the email
that I have linked down below in the
description and that is UAC submission
at gmail com now don't send it to your
average consumer a gmail com because
that's not gonna be an official entry
and I'm not going to count it so you
want to make sure you send it to you AC
submission @ gmail.com and really that's
about it guys I'm gonna be picking a
winner in two weeks so that's gonna be
februari 13 Friday the 13th mmm but it's
gonna be friday the 13th and then that
is when i'll be picking a winner so make
sure you're following on social media
like Twitter and Instagram and Facebook
so that I can let you guys know who the
winner is I'm going to be posting it to
all those sites so definitely follow me
on there so that you can know when the
winner is chosen and who it is and of
course the prizes are 64 goodbye iphone
6 and a one year subscription to
Squarespace so you can keep that website
that won the contest alive and pretty
much that's it guys hopefully you enjoy
this kind of cool contest I'm a little
more interactive than your typical leave
a comment down below deal so let me know
what you guys think I can't wait to see
some of your websites but I'll catch you
guys in the next one total Dennis your
