and it's that time of year again
tell them talk about my top five
favorite headphones in beta 5.0 so first
on our list a blind man could have seen
coming is the sony xba-40 bt now i've
talked about these headphones in so many
of my videos and that's because it's
really one of my favorites it's one of
the best values you can get especially
since these are bluetooth headphones
that you're going to get for under a
hundred bucks now this has an over ear
design and unfortunately isn't foldable
but it can be laid flat so it can fit
into a bag or a backpack with no problem
now one thing that I really love about
these is that even though they have some
pretty large air cups that one of the
most comfortable you'll come across it's
really lightweight and with those
comfortable ear cushions this is going
to be perfect for long listening
sessions now when it comes to bass this
thing is unmatched and it performs
pretty well in other areas but that bass
is definitely the highlight of the sound
and it even has a bass boost button
which takes the basis of ridiculous
levels and you can find these for less
than a hundred bucks online and the fact
that they're bluetooth it just does a
lot right all in one headphone and next
up our pair of headphones that I used to
talk about a lot back in the day I've
got some rekindled love for it and
that's the v-moda m100 now these used to
be my absolute favorite of all time
because they were just so versatile in
terms of sounds you're getting awesome
bass clear vocals and it just performs
really well in moles on rus' now what
really sets the m100 apart from most
headphones is that it's got some insane
durability this thing is built like a
tank and not only that it also has a
really compact form factor so if you
don't have a lot of space in your
traveling with these it's not going to
eat up a lot of room these things you
should retail for about 300 bucks but
now you can find them for 200 which is
an absolute steal for the quality that
you're getting we build also offers a
lot of customization so you get tons of
different colors and different layouts
so you can change these up SEPTA's your
style and that's what I like about these
they're super compact high durability
great sound and a lot of customization
you really can't go wrong with these and
that's why they're on the list and next
up we've got something that you probably
haven't heard of before and that's the
Sennheiser HD 630 DB quite the name but
really solid headphones and like all the
other headphones these have an over ear
design and they're a bit bulkier than
the rest I must admit but it has some
really cool features that you don't
really see much on the right ear cup you
can find volume controls and a play and
pause button but what's interesting here
is that these aren't battery-powered so
they're not functioning like bluetooth
they actually work like an inline remote
so once these are plugged beam you have
full control over your device and what's
awesome about this is that you can even
switch to what kind of device you're
using so if you have an iPhone or an
iPad that you want to plug these into
you just put the switch up but if you
have something like a galaxy phone you
hit the switch down and you can control
that as well I just think it's really
cool that there's a switch built into
the headphone that allows you to control
I o S or Android devices but if you've
got that iPhone 7
you need that adapter now another
awesome feature and this kind of deals
with the sound quality is that you can
completely control the base there's a
base dial on the right ear cut and just
turning that thing pumps up the base or
brings it down so you can use this with
a variety of different music so pair
with all-around good sound quality these
headphones are really versatile you can
use them with different kinds of devices
and you can switch up the sound quality
that you get depending on what kind of
music you're listening to it's pretty
expensive but definitely worth it if you
really enter your audio now next up
we've got the Sony here on wireless
headphone now actually saw this at CES
last year and didn't know what I was
going to think of it but when I actually
got my hands on them man these really
surprised me they have really great
overall sound quality some pretty decent
bass for bass lovers and overall it just
has a really nice build nice feel to it
and it comes in a few different colors
so depending on what you like you can
pick that me I love the fact that it has
this peel looking color that I can use
with my setup so it works out perfectly
for me well it's also really great about
these is with the wireless version you
get active noise-cancelling and the
active noise-cancelling here is on par
with some of the best ones that i've
tried out so if you're looking for some
premium headphones that don't stick to
the standard black look these are
definitely something worth picking up
and honestly these are my favorite
all-around headphones and there's a
wired version for those of you who don't
care about wireless features and want to
save a couple bucks now I don't do this
often but I've been test
a lot of gaming headsets recently and I
really fell in love with the logitech
g930 3 Artemus spectrum and I happen to
have a special edition here in white
which works perfectly with my setup but
what's special about these is that sound
quality
this has virtual 7.1 surround sound so
if you're playing games you get that 3d
effect and you can kind of hear where
people are coming from which is a really
nice feature that allows you to have an
immersive experience and they're
wireless and if you couldn't tell I'm a
fan of wireless headphones
so these worked out perfectly you have
really deep ear cuffs and the padding is
very soft so if you want to gain for a
long period of time
this is going to be just fine it's super
comfortable and what's really awesome if
you're a gamer you got to have some RGB
lights on there and with the software
here you can completely customize the
look of these and obviously I did the
teal things and it looks great you can
kind of switch these out to fit whatever
theme you might have with your setup and
it turns out looking really good this is
definitely one of my favorite gaming
headsets but if you guys are interested
in seeing some of the ones that I've
been testing out that I really like let
me know what to comment down below but
that about wraps up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it links to
everything will be down in the
description I'll catch you guys in the
next one till then javis from Summa</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
