high-quality smartphones for a less than
usual price tag but I'm sure we all want
to know which is the best one and that's
what we're going to find out today ZTE
reached out to sponsor today's video so
I can put their brand new axon 7 up
against a1 plus 3 so we're gonna do that
by first taking a look at the designs
when it comes to design there's no huge
differences here both phones have the
aluminum body we've come to know and
love from higher and smartphones today
but I've got to give to the axon in the
looks and comfort department it has
rounded edges and a curved back which
makes it way more pleasant to hold and
ZTE took a risk by adding thickness to
the phone since the trend tends to be to
create the thinnest phone possible but
it worked out really well with the axon
7 I found the slight added 1/2 to give
the phone a more solid feel in the hand
not to mention giving it a little more
room for a bigger battery but we'll get
to that later
and something I like with the axon 7 is
that the aluminum isn't just found on
the back you can also see it in the
front on the speaker grills which
definitely helps to give it a more
premium look rather than the simple
black borders that we typically see
around displays if you like your phone
to have some harder edges the 1+3
definitely has that but I've got to give
it up to the axon 7 in the design
department a nice bonus with the axon 7
is the inclusion of a micro SD card slot
in the SIM tray which the 1+3 is
unfortunately missing and one of the
most important specs for me is the
display we're looking at two large 5.5
inch AMOLED displays but the axon 7 has
a 1440p display which makes it a higher
resolution than the one plus three is
1080p this means you can expect sharper
images and to watch high-res content
online um like mine but the oneplus ones
display does get a bit brighter but this
is only a difference you'll notice when
comparing them side by side and we can't
talk about media consumption without
talking about those speakers the oneplus
one has a single speaker at the bottom
of the phone but the axon 7 has
front-facing stereo speakers which makes
watching videos and listening to music a
lot nicer and it also means you don't
have to do this
while it looks like the axons in the
lead the 1+3 shakes things up a bit in
the camera department the 1+3 is rocking
a 16 megapixel rear camera while the
axon sports 20 megapixels while both
phones are pretty decent and good
lighting one thing I did notice is that
the axons images came out quite a bit
softer and less detailed than the 1 plus
3s the axon 7 does have more features
like beautify for you selfie takers live
photos and the ton more shooting options
but ultimately it's all about the
quality of your shot and this is where I
feel the oneplus 3 has the advantage now
battery life this is one of the most
important specs of a phone but it often
gets neglected by most companies for
some reason but both phones do have
decent battery life with the axon having
a bit of an edge here it boasts a 3200
milliamp hour battery versus the 1+3 is
3000 milliamp hour battery the axon
lasts a bit longer on a charge which is
pretty impressive considering it as a
higher resolution display which usually
has an impact on battery life they both
feature fast charging capabilities with
the oneplus three getting 60% in 30
minutes and the axon 7 getting 50% in
the same 30 but the oneplus 3 requires
you to use their included - charger and
cable which kind of sucks but luckily
for the axon 7 Qualcomm's quick charge
feature is found in a lot of the new
charging accessories which makes it a
bit more accessible but one of the most
important things we can talk about with
these phones is their actual performance
they both use snapdragons 820 processor
but the axon 7 has four gigs of RAM
versus the 1 + 3 6 gigabytes I really
don't think the end user is going to see
a difference in performance with these
specs but when you start to see the
difference is the skin and the interface
1 + degree has a pretty stock version of
Android with a few tweaks and
customization options while the axon 7
is pretty heavily skinned the skin on
the axon 7 does a pretty good job of not
getting in the way of the basic features
of Android but I know a ton of people
out there love stock Android so one plus
we might have a slight edge to some
people for 400 bucks it's pretty insane
what you can get out of the smart phone
these days and it's awesome to see
openes like ZTE joining in the fray in
providing a flagship level phone for an
affordable price but not only are they
providing a flagship level phone for an
affordable price they're providing one
