want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on guys
three average consumer today I'm going
to be unboxing mobis magic charger for
the apple magic mouse alright so let's
not waste any time let's get right into
it alright so here we have the mobi
magic charger and there's not much to
the box here you know has a load
instruction tells you how it works what
comes inside of it here you can see the
picture of it I'm pretty pretty much
standard stuff so let's get this thing
open take off that all right and there
you have it now let's open up inside the
box let's see box has an interesting
little design here trying to force my
way in okay here we are and here you
have some really interesting packaging
going on makes you just pull this out I
guess it's to protect it very little
really interesting i get all deserve it
too he is formally be there it goes so
here you have the charging station and
this is what your magic mouse is going
to be resting on so it's really small so
if you want to see what the magic mouse
looks like on it here you are they seem
to have almost the exact size not too
much space to do anything else just rest
it on top of here in charge so back to
the unboxing here you have the charger
this is the battery pack for the magic
mouse here you have the little to ease
as well and pretty much that's that you
also get inside the box
a USB cable that looks very similar to
Apple's and pretty much that's all you
get inside the box you also have like a
little quick install guide shows you how
to put it in how to plug it up and how
to charge it also with some indicators
on how it's doing as far as to charge
and goes and that's about it for inside
the box and pretty much these are the
three pieces you'll have I made as well
install it during some boxing justice
show you guys take out my little
energizer batteries out here and here
you have the charger you plug it in very
simple installation that took about two
seconds although it does seem to keep
coming out okay you have to really push
it in there alright so that's there and
you just peel this off sticker put that
on the side and you can just rest your
magic mouse right there and with the USB
port I'll be plugging this in and you're
getting this bad boy charging alright so
here we have a charging and like I said
before it's not much more space but then
to just lay it down on top of than that
and here you can see the little
indicator to show that it's charging and
when it's off the charger you have this
little red light that pops up I'm not
sure if that's because this is a low
battery or if it just stays on all the
time but when it's on top you can see
instantly turns green and pretty much
that's all there is to the mobi magic
charger for the apple magic mouse and I
hope you guys enjoyed this short little
unboxing video and if you like it useful

see you guys in the next video until
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
