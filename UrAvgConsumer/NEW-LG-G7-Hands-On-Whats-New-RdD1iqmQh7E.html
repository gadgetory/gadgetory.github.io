consumer and this is the LG G 7 so I got
a chance to check out the new phone by
LG and here's what's new with it so
first let's talk about the design is
rocking a 6.1 inch quad HD plus display
and the body is similar to that of the
LG v 30 which I'm actually a fan of and
the back you'll notice was got a glass
back for wireless charging and you've
also got those dual cameras as well as
your fingerprint scanner you won't find
anything groundbreaking with the g7 but
LG did introduce two new things to it
first being a new button on the side and
this is a dedicated button to pull up
Google assistant and they're calling
this their AI hotkey and I was freaking
used to you right now this is currently
not mapable so you can't use this button
for anything else but it is software
related so hopefully LG will come out
with a software update in the future so
that you can access different apps with
it please LG this is a step in a great
direction don't let it go to waste and
second there's a notch love it or hate
it guys companies are making the move to
phones with notches to get as much
screen real estate as possible out of
these phones and LG is no different and
of course as someone who used the iPhone
10 on a daily basis I know the notch
doesn't bother you after a while you get
used to it I'm still not crazy about the
idea of so many rumored phones following
Apple's design choice luckily this extra
screen space is what LG is calling its
second screen kind of like what they did
with the v10 and the V 20 and if you
really hate it there there are software
options that allow you to bring back the
bezel you can even change the design of
the second screen from the colors to
even the edges and something that's
pretty cool about this display is that
LG went beyond the typical RGB pixels
that are found on the screen and decided
to have white pixels so that the screen
can get even brighter you can go into
this boosted mode that allows you to go
outdoors if it's really sunny and boost
this beyond its standard max brightness
and having used it myself for a bit you
can definitely see the difference so you
have those options but overall we're
looking at the V 32 design on LG's G
line and in terms of specs the g7 is
gonna have a snapdragon 845 processor
four to six gigs of ram depending on
your region 128 gigs of storage and a
3000 milliamp hour battery and you can
also expect wireless charging a micro SD
card slot ip68 water resistance and even
a headphone jack but more on that later
now you might have noticed in these
clips the back
the phone actually says think you I
guess the full name is LG G seven think
you basically it's like think the word
think yeah that's what it is and LG's
going with this branding for all their
product lines that have AI integrated
into them just like the g7
but beyond the AI hotkey another place
you'll find AI is in LG's camera here we
have dual 16 megapixel cameras and the
front-facing camera is an 8 megapixel
and one of those rear lenses is packing
a wide-angle lens which I'm very happy
to see I've said it in previous videos I
find the wide-angle lens to be more
useful than a telephoto so I'm very glad
at seeing the g7 with the AI integration
and the camera software the phone will
be able to detect things that you're
taking a picture of and provide the best
setting and filters for an ideal shot of
whatever you're shooting and something
that's kind of interesting about LG's AI
camera is that you can see all the words
of the things that it thinks it's
detecting until it sees the right one
which makes you feel like you were
watching the phone think no pun intended
my brief testing I had some success with
plants fruit and other basic things but
the strangest thing is that it had
trouble picking up dark faces and those
the camera instantly detected people
with lighter complexions but not so much
for people with dark ones I tried this
for both myself and marques and pretty
much got the same results but I'll save
my judgments till I get this thing in
hand and test it more extensively now in
terms of shooting in the dark it's
supposed to do really well at taking
low-light photos
there's a bright mode that you can jump
into if you find yourself in a low light
situation but if it's really dark the
bright mode is automatically enabled and
it seems like LG's really considering
the low-light performance of these
cameras from the fast apertures to the
introduction of pixel binning which
allows the camera to take better
pictures and low-light so it's cool to
see LG focus on these things but we'll
have to see how it performs in a real
day in the life they've even introduced
their own portrait mode feature now and
from my very very brief time with it it
seemed to perform pretty well but of
course gotta test it some more but I do
like the fact that you can adjust the
blur before and after the picture but
now moving on from the camera we also
have LG's new boom box feature the LG G
7 is sporting a 39% bigger speaker and a
much bigger resonance chamber it's
actually pretty interesting because the
ip68 ceiling for water resistance allows
it to have a bigger a resonant
chamber which should result in much
louder audio and even being able to feel
some bass from the phone which is
unheard of and I got to test out the
speakers with some music and it's
actually pretty loud and it's cool to
feel the bass coming from the phone and
the g7 even features DTS X virtual
surround sound that you'll be able to
experience through speakers for 7.1
surround sound as well as headphones I
was just super crazy about what I heard
when I first saw it but I'm gonna
actually wait until I get it in hand and
spend more time with it before I make
any rash judgments and thankfully LG is
not skimping out on audio at all that
seems to be a real focus for them which
I love and they're even doubling down on
bringing high quality headphone jacks
with a 32 bit high v quad DAC over to
the G line that used to be exclusive to
the V series and this is something I'm
very happy to see LG doing and I wish
more companies would copy this rather
than the notches overall this is looking
like a pretty solid phone and my hat
goes off to LG for focusing on audio
low-light performance with the cameras
as well as bringing premium materials
and features over from the V Series
kudos to LG we're gonna have to see if
all of that stuff transfers over well
and if it actually works once I get my
hands on it but hopefully you guys
enjoyed this video if you did be the
cool guy bro that gives us video thumbs
up and let me know what you think of the
g7 down below and I'll catch you guys in
the next one till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
