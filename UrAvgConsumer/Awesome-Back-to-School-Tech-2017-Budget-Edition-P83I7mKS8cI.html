consumer and unfortunately it's that
time of year again time for
back-to-school but we do have some
awesome back-to-school tech and this
time we're looking at the budget edition
because students are broke but we do
have a bunch of cool tech inside of here
and the first thing we're going to look
at is this tech backpack from Hank now
first of all it's not your traditional
backpack it doesn't have any pockets or
access to in the front most of the stuff
is all in the back and this is actually
supposed to be an anti-theft feature so
in case someone is trying to go into
your backpack and steal your stuff
they've got to go all the way in the
back to do that and if you're wearing
this there's no chance of getting robbed
so I think that's a neat little feature
but you get access to everything from
inside here let's open us up and first
thing you'll notice is that this has a
very very different design than what you
see with typical backpacks especially
since it opens from the back we've got
this large compartment that pretty much
houses everything and a bunch of smaller
compartments for all your gadgets and
whatnot but this is great because you
can put all of your textbooks maybe even
some sneakers or maybe some shirts or
clothing you can all fit that inside of
here while still having places to put
all of the other things that you may
want to carry with you now just to be
clear this isn't a backpack setup video
but the tech we're talking about is
inside it here so you can get a good
idea of how the backpack works so we had
a book in there something that you guys
are probably going to be carrying to
school but let's see some of the text
down here in this little mesh
compartment we've got some cables these
are by anchor you guys know I'm a fan of
anchor cables they're very durable they
look good and they're inexpensive and
they also have options for any device
that you may have so if you have if you
need a micro USB cable or USB type-c for
even lightning they've got all of those
options as well and you guys know
there's a good chance your friends are
going to ask to borrow your cable so
you're going to definitely want
something durable that's going to
withstand you using it and your pals and
those are really great cables for less
than like ten bucks so better than going
into like the Apple Store or something
like that
so definitely check those out if you
guys need to get cables and speaking of
cables over here to no one's surprise
we've got a portable charger
now one thing you'll notice is that this
portable charger is connected to the
backpack so something about this
backpack is that right here on this flap
on the inside we've got a USB port that
connects to the portable charger and
allows you to charge your device while
you're on the go without having to look
for your portable charger which is
awesome now notice when you're able to
find that feature and a lot of backpacks
nowadays so this is awesome that we can
have it here and for a backpack that
only cost about 40 bucks I think that is
an awesome awesome value so reportable
charger that we have over here is
actually the anchor power fusion 5000
now why I like this is because they have
5,000 milliamp hours so it'll be able to
charge your phone at least once and
change but you can use two USB ports and
plug it into a wall adapter so that you
can charge it whenever you need to so
you don't need to plug this in with a
micro USB anything weird plug it in
charge the device at the same time if
you want to very good and solace
portable charger if your student you
definitely want a portable charger
because if you're sitting in class or
maybe you're walking around campus
you're not going to exactly be able to
plug in your phone right into an outlet
so having something like this will keep
your phone juiced up while you're on the
go and of course you've got regular
compartments for things like pens I've
got my favorite pilot g2 pen students
still use pens right they still use
color pencils I don't know you guys
probably all have on keyboards mm no
okay but up top that you've got a zipper
that gives you a nice big pouch but
inside of here I've got a couple of
flash drives now
there's of course cloud storage in the
world but I think it's always good to
have flash drives in case you don't have
access to the Internet you can still
keep any documents that you may need for
school write on these now these two in
front of you have special features and
that they can actually go into your
phone and you can access the scores
right from your phone so I think that's
really cool this one right here uses USB
type-c so if you're using something like
the Samsung Galaxy s8 you can access all
of your documents photos whatever you
want to put on your drive right on your
phone and of course you can flip it over
and plug it into your computer so you
can access them there as well and
surprisingly enough there's also an
option for the iPhone of course you'll
have to download
and apt to access the files on here of
course you can plug this into the
computer as well and this is made by who
- and this one's made by SP something I
have the link down below in the
description to these as well as
everything else in the video and I
almost forgot to mention that right here
on the strap you've got a little
compartment for small little things that
you want quick access to while you're on
the go and I've got a pair of earbuds
now these are by G chord and you might
have seen it in my tech survival kit 2.0
these are some awesome gear but they
actually upgraded it you sound pretty
good they're very inexpensive if you're
not trying to walk around with big
headphones you just want to quickly pull
out some earbuds to do whatever you want
to do while you're on campus at school
you don't want to draw a lot attention
to yourself these are a great way to
listen to whatever is going on on your
phone or some music so I really like
these and I like that you can access
them right there from the strap IRSA
those are probably the best sub $10
earbuds that I've ever tried they're
super durable and they sound pretty good
for the price so those are definitely
worth looking into if you're on a budget
and over here you guys know I don't play
I'm talking about a backpack you know
there's a microfiber cloth involved
every time expect it every time got to
keep your stuff clean baby but over here
we have on this side all compartments
this is probably for tablets but I found
it as a useful spot for a pair of
headphones now these are sewn xb6 50 BT
now you guys probably hear me talk about
the 950 BTS or 90 pn1 a ton on the
channel but this is like the baby
brother if you don't want to invest in
one of those headphones we want
something a little bit more lightweight
something that a bit nicer on the pocket
this is something that you want to look
into now these are a pair of bluetooth
headphones so regardless of what phone
you're using you'll have no problem
using this they sound great excellent
base of course and they're just a very
nice fit they're very soft and cushions
great pair of headphones four-way left
and on is about
so if you're commuting the school on
your way back home you'll definitely
some great headphones to rock out to and
kind of keep everything else at bay and
just focus on music and over here you
guys can see that this has a laptop
compartment and inside of it
I have a 15-inch MacBook Pro which I am
not recommending in this video we all
know to say in a budget laptop but what
I do have as a laptop option is right
over here now over here we have a lack
do laptop slave and I think even if you
don't want to use a backpack this is
something you might want to pick up if
you're like a college student or
something and you're just going to like
one or two classes in the day and you
just want to bring your laptop and maybe
a few things this thing has some nice
slots and zippers so that you can store
things that you may want keep some
paperwork in the back this is definitely
very nice offers a ton of protection for
your laptop so this is definitely worth
picking up but inside of it we've got
the Acer Aspire 5 now this is a awesome
laptop from pretty good specs and it
only goes for about 450 bucks and as you
guys can see this is a pretty large
laptop so it wouldn't be inside of this
backpack but it is still very very good
and so you guys have a bit of an idea
what kind of specs you're working with
this is a core i5 has 8 gigs of RAM
comes with like a terabyte of storage so
you have a ton of space here and which
is kind of spec you'll be able to do all
the typical things a student needs to do
so word processing web browsing you
might even be able to do some light
gaming on there's nothing too crazy but
you'll be able to handle all the typical
stuff now some of the things I really
like about this laptop is that you get
access to a number pad a really solid
trackpad and you get of course got a
1080p display but what's really great is
that it's a good-looking laptop that
also has some great i/o so over here on
the left side we've got a USB C port an
HDMI port which is great so if you want
to plug this up to a TV that you may
have in your dorm room or something you
can definitely do that and watch your
Netflix there when you're not working
but you'll also get a USB 3.0 port SD
card slot and two more USB ports on the
right side as
a headphone jack but I think this is a
great laptop you want to sacrificing
much even though this is only four
hundred and fifty dollars and it looks
good still pretty sleek even though it's
a little bit on the larger side but
definitely a solid option if you're
looking for a back-to-school laptop on a
budget but that's about it for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it this
is an awesome backpack that has a lot
more going on with it then I even got a
chance to mention here and these are all
great things that you can pick up that
will help you with a school year without
breaking the bank so if you enjoyed this
video be the cool guy or girl that gives
this video a thumbs up and definitely be
on the lookout for the baller edition of
this video and that'll probably be right
here-ish yeah right here you guys can
see the next video so be sure to check
that out so next one guys please</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
