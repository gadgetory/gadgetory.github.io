consume right and we need to talk about
the iPhone 10 our I've been using this
thing for the last week and honestly I
think it's gonna be the most compelling
iPhone for a lot of people this year but
let's talk about it all the good and the
bad for those unaware the iPhone 10 are
was announced alongside its more premium
brother and sister the iPhone 10s and
10's max and I personally was pretty
happy to see Apple offer an option that
was essentially the same phone with just
less premium hardware but with a $250
cheaper price tag now I say essentially
but there are some pretty important to
know compromises overall you're getting
all that the iPhone 10s has to offer
like face ID the powerful a 12 Bionic
chip louder speakers wireless charging
dual-sim capabilities iOS 12 and the
updated wide-angle camera sensor but you
are spending 250 dollars less and that
brings me it's my first good the price
now I am by no means saying seven
hundred and fifty dollars is cheap but
when you compare to a thousand dollars
it's a pretty good value all things
considered something about it with that
$250 you can get a dope case a screen
protector a fast charger which should
absolutely be in the box but you can get
all that and have money left over I mean
come on now what makes Apple able to
offer it at that price tag is the fact
that it only has one camera lens in the
back an aluminum casing instead of
stainless steel an LCD display instead
of OLED so that brings me to my first
bad and that's the screen and you guys
know me I am NOT that guy that goes nuts
about specs so when I first held the
iPhone 10 R I knew had a lower res
screen you could barely tell and I
honestly wasn't bothered by it you only
really notice a difference if you're
comparing it side-by-side with the 10s
and you're looking for it it's the
plenty bright and vibrant but the reason
why I'm listing it under the bad is
because that lower resolution and the
viewing angles do kind of hurt the
experience when sharing the screen with
another person or even watching content
at a certain angle other than directly
in front of you you do get a dimmer
experience the screen does look a bit
less bright off sensor but this is only
impacting you if you're sharing your
screen or if you're coming directly from
an OLED alright
if you're coming from the eighth or
earlier you're already used to this kind
of screen behavior but honestly guys
this is not a deal-breaker for anyone it
shouldn't be but it might be something
to take note of if you're trying to
decide between the 10r or maybe the 10s
or 10s max but talking about the display
brings me to my next good the size.i 6.1
inches the 10 R is almost smack dab in
the middle of the five point eight inch
10s and the 6.5 inch 10s Max and it
really feels like the right size guys
it's been really nice to me to have that
big display without an oversized body
and for those folks out there who have
been using the plus-sized versions of
the iPhones you can get something like
this and it'll feel just right from my
personal experience the 10s max took me
a little bit longer to get used to than
normal but the 10r immediately felt like
the perfect size they felt great in the
hand and using various gestures is a
breeze and it's definitely a big enough
screen for constant consumption except
for those bezels which brings me to my
next bad the bezels kind of suck and
it's almost unfair because I'm coming
from a 10 and a 10 s max so those bezels
were immediately noticeable to me but if
you're coming from the eighth or earlier
the design is going to be a vast
improvement but if you compare it to
something like the 10s it's quite a
difference so if you are upgrading and
you want that bezel this edge to edge
experience the 10s is the better bet you
just gotta think about is it worth
shelling out the extra $250 for now even
though we got a lower res display that
does mean better battery life the
battery life that we're seeing with the
10r
is probably better than any battery life
that we've seen with an iPhone yet this
battery will easily last throughout the
entire day it did for me and that's with
me gaming web browsing be on social
media all the stuff that you'd expect
and it kind of handled that with no
problem I was honestly hoping for this
kind of battery life with the 10s max
but when it comes to battery life the
10r is the winner
not to mention because of that glass
back it has wireless charging and you
can also fast charge this thing so
battery life absolutely not an issue
with this phone but aside from a lower
res display the body is also what helps
to keep the cost down like I mentioned
earlier you have an aluminum body
instead of stainless steel and while
some may view this as a negative thing I
actually think it's a positive for two
reasons one you get better durability in
the sense of not having to worry about
scratches with the stainless steel and
you also get a ton of color options the
10r comes in all these really fun colors
I think will appeal to both a younger
and older consumer base so I think this
is going to be a really popular choice
even though it does feel a little bit
less premium than the 10s or 10s Max and
that's not to say that this phone
doesn't feel premium though because it
still has that nice glass back which
also gives us some nice half but we do
have to talk about one more compromise
here which is probably my biggest one
and that's the camera because we only
have the wide-angle lens here which
really does work well we only have
access to software based portrait mode
and while it does work well it is only
limited to working with people so that
means no portrait mode photos of your
pets or any objects so if you're someone
that relies on portrait mode or you
really want to upgrade from an older
phone so you have access to that feature
this is probably not the phone for you
but honestly the cameras are compromised
only if you care about portrait mode and
some of those portrait lighting effects
which honestly applies to a very small
group of people I did a quick poll among
my tech enthusiasts audience on Twitter
and 40% of the people who have portrait
mode don't even use it and this was kind
of surprising because I used it all the
time Porsche motor side as a regular
camera it works well and takes beautiful
sharp photos same as the 10s and another
thing that might be considered a bad
that you're not getting 3d touch you're
getting half dick touch so now you're
gonna be long pressing on something like
the flashlight or the camera app but for
me I actually really like 3d touch when
I was using something like Google Maps
so if I wanted directions to home I
wouldn't have to jump into the app to do
that can't really do that here so that's
a little bit unfortunate and something
that I had to get used to while using
this but overall guys I really do feel
like Apple did something great here I
truly believe this phone was made for
someone who isn't a crazy tech
enthusiast but still wants an iPhone at
all the iPhone 10 features like face ID
access to an emojis and all that kind of
stuff with the same body who doesn't
care that this phone has an LCD screen
versus OLED or aluminum casing versus
stainless steel this is really made for
the average consumer I just feel like
this phone is for people who want the
features of an iPhone 10 but don't want
to pay a thousand dollars to get it
interestingly enough there's not a ton
of buzz around this phone but I feel
like this is what everyone's gonna be
picking up around Christmas because they
don't want to shell out a thousand bucks
for a phone and for those interested the
10r comes in at 750 bucks
for a 64 gig option and there's a max
capacity version of 250
six gigs that goes for $8.99 which is
still a hundred bucks cheaper than the
base model 10s but you guys let me know
what you think of the 10r
is it an option for you let me know with
a comment down below and if you enjoyed
this video be the cool guy girl that
gives this video thumbs up I'll catch
you guys in the next one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
