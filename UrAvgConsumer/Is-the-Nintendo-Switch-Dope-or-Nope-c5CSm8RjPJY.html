consumer and today we're checking out
this guy the Nintendo switch and boom
two of them not only one so we're going
to figure out what we're going to do
that second one in a bit but let's open
this guy up I am super excited because
the portable system maybe I'm all about
that life so what we're going to do here
is pop this sucker open
I'll even in the baccala the killjoy
but let's just see here so we're going
to pop this tab right ready for the fire
am I ready for it okay so we're gonna
pop the tab boom oh oh this is small
what oh this thing is tiny it really
isn't the phone with the phone all right
so I got my iphone 7 plus switch let's
pick it off the plastic and this is only
a bit bigger of crazy let's check out
what else we got we have the joy Khan
controllers this I was very curious
about they're tiny
I don't care anybody says you're tying
controllers and pop them out okay I can
see it though I could work with this now
inside the box you also get this little
strap so you can throw this on to cajole
calm controllers and this does a couple
of things it gives you the strap so that
you don't pull your joy con controller
out the window or something but you also
get these extenders for the L and R
button so at the very top this makes it
a bit easier to press those buttons and
of course you get two of them for each
toy con controller now you also get this
joy con risk so that you can get a more
traditional feel with the toy con
controller so if you want something
that's a bit more standard you can build
them onto here and play like normal and
this right here is the infamous dock
that you throw their switch into
whenever you want to play on the big
screen it actually does a couple of cool
things it ups the clock speed of the
switch and also brings it to a 1080p
display
what the switch is working with right
now is a 6.2 inch display running 720p
which is not a big deal 720p sounds
terrible but coming from a very long
time portable gamer I know that it's
going to be an ok screen because
actually on the Vita the 3ds XL which
has much lower resolution but this will
go even better than those so I'm stoked
well like I said once you put this into
the dock on the big screen it's going to
go to 1080p so no worries there and you
can actually open this thing up and you
have a typical connectors got your AC
adapter USB port as well as an HDMI out
so you can get this plugged up and
connected to your TV now something
interesting is that this users USB
type-c a lot of these phones are using
it and this is what this which uses on
the handheld portion as well and this is
pretty cool because let's say you have
one of those new phones that means
you're not carrying around multiple
chargers you can just lean around one
USB type-c cable plug it up and you're
good to go
and it works even with portable chargers
so that's going to be awesome since this
could have some shaky battery life
depending on the game you're playing
also kind of like the fact that it has
some cable management stuff going on so
that you can hide the cables when you're
hooking it up to the TV
good thinking Nintendo and you get books
and lastly inside the box you get those
cables HDMI USB type-c AC adapter and
though I'm ready to hook this thing up
now I am going to do the test I'm going
to see what it's like to actually throw
this sucker on and let's see how simple
it is oh okay oh nice so this is
actually not bad now like I said I play
a lot of portable games for the Vita I'm
pretty used to having a wide system in
hand this is quite a bit wider but this
is not so bad I can get used to this
especially with a screen this big this
is much better than the Wii U remote
this is very nice and like now what we
haven't looked at here is a game so
right here I've got Legend of Zelda
breath of the wild and let's take a look
at what the cartridge actually looks
like
Oh Justin really is small wow this is a
tiny tiny cartridge it's actually
smaller than the Nintendo 3ds cartridge
that's actually very surprising so up
top here there's a little slot for it
pop this open you throw this in and this
is actually very reminiscent of the
PlayStation Vita it looks a lot like the
slot where you throw into the games into
that now I've got my switch together
pops in my game now it's time to test it
out and see all the different oricon
options and let you guys know if this
thing is dope or nope but before we get
into that let's talk about that second
switch so this guy right here obviously
isn't for me it's for one of you so one
of you guys is gonna has a chance to win
a brand new Nintendo switch and you've
got some simple rules as always make
sure you're subscribed to this channel
and leave a comment down below
tope good luck to you guys the let's go
try out the switch and see if it's worth
your time so guys check this out right
now I've got the switch inside of its
dock so it's hooked up to the TV and
everything and what I like right now is
that this thing seamlessly fits in with
my entertainment system so it's not a
giant sore thumb thing fits in very
nicely so kudos to Nintendo for making
that look so good but this is it now
I've got the joy Khan controllers in
hand and I can just play like this so
this is crazy I'm walking around and
moving all over the place player Zelda
this is nuts
so great thing about the switch is that
if someone comes in they want to use the
TV for whatever reason all you do is
take your joy Khan controllers slide
them into the switch pick it up and boom
instantly goes over to a handheld system
so if I have to give up the TV for
whatever reason I got a little spot over
here for portable gaming anyway and the
switch that's right in so I can actually
just sit back have the speakers blasting
on it and enjoy now I did mention that
there are multiple ways to use switch
with the joy Kahn control
obviously this is the main way playing
it like a regular portable system but if
you want this also a kickstand which by
the way has a micro SD card slot right
under here in case you want to up your
storage which is probably a good idea
because you don't get much onboard but
when you're playing you can pop out that
kickstand and also play like this so
this is another way you've got a
controller in each hand that you're
playing like this or if you want you can
use the included joi con grip and then
you slide each of these on and boom
you've got a whole new way to play as
well but if you're playing with someone
else
you take your droid con you pass one
along and then you're playing like this
now this is going to be a very
interesting way to play the controls are
pretty small when in this form so it's
going to be interesting but I definitely
think you can get the job done I'm sure
the two player games on this system
won't be too complicated where you're
going to need a more robust controller
than this but it'll do the trick but
since this is a portable systems it only
makes sense to go out and test it in the
real world so let's see what it's like
to actually play this outside all right
so this which is all about portability
so of course I have to see if it'll fit
in my gadget backpack now it is a little
on the wide side which is a bit of a
problem when trying to pack it away but
what's cool is that the joy content
rollers can be broken down thus making
it a lot easier to pack away so all you
gotta do is grab it grab my controllers
and I'm pretty much good to go now
something to keep in mind is that this
is a larger system while it is portable
it is bigger than something like the
Vita or the 3d XXL
so if you're used to using those systems
you're going to have to do some
adjusting because this is quite a bit
larger hey guys this is though I'm in
McDonald's playing yourselve the
Brussels wild if there was another
console this wouldn't be able to happen
and what's even cool about the switch is
that if I had a friend coming over to
meet with me
I could just pass him one of these toy
cons and we be playing a two-player game
while at McDonald's but something to
note is that when I was on my way here
playing it with no problem in the
sunlight I have my screen brightness at
max but I was able to see everything I
needed to miss no problem so the real
question here is is the Nintendo switch
dope or not' well I think that this is
absolutely dope the intended always
comes out with some really interesting
concept I think they took the concept
with the Wii U and took it to the next
level here this is a perfect system for
someone who wants a pretty decent
console but doesn't maybe doesn't have
time to play at their TV all the time
you can take your system and take your
games on the go so if you happen to have
long commutes you can play your system
that's I think that's awesome now for
$300 right now you're not getting a huge
library of games but you're getting some
awesome potential probably the most well
is the most powerful handheld system
that has ever come out so I'm sure
Nintendo is going to make some good
things happen with this I'm pretty
stoked I'm excited I'm all about gaming
on the ghost and I don't usually have a
lot of time to sit in front of the TV so
I'm interested in seeing how they do
things here I'm just glad that I have
the option to play this however I want
and I think a lot of people will enjoy
that hopefully you guys enjoyed this
video if you did be the cool guy or girl
that give it a thumbs up make sure you
into that giveaway free till next time
guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
