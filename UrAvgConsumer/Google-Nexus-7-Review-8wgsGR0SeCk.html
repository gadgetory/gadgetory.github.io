want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone in travers consumer and today
I'm going to be doing a review on the
Google Nexus 7 so let's not wasting time
let's get right into it alright guys so
here we have the google nexus 7 this
tablet is made by asus and it's Google's
first Nexus tablet and when we say Nexus
tablet that means it's going to have
stock Android and there's not going to
be any skins on this at all so it's
going to be as pure Google as it can be
so that means really fast updates so
when the next update comes out these
will be among the first devices to get
them along with like the Nexus phones so
that's really a great thing here and
what's really special about this is the
fact that it has a two hundred dollar
price point now tablets are usually
ranging much higher than that we all
know that the ipad is really expensive
to transform a prime and infinity which
are very popular Android tablets are
also in a much higher price range so for
200 bucks this is a really great deal
this is a 7-inch tablet and it comes
with a quad-core processor is an NVIDIA
Tegra 3 which is really nice for gaming
and things like that and with project
butter on Angela 4.1 it makes it really
really nice to use to play games and you
know move around the screen and such and
let me give you guys a quick example of
what a game would look like on this so I
don't even know if my camera is doing
injustice but this game looks pretty
good this is sonic believe sonic
adventure for episode 2 so this is
really nice and the touchscreen is
soaking on a small enough that it makes
it very comfortable to use this with
them
you know to play this so it's not like
the awkward holding it like really far
apart and playing the controls are
really nice because they're so close
together that it really makes a pretty
nice experience playing playing with so
there you got a glimpse at how nice the
quad core processor and the tiger three
chip work with the um you know with
gaming and project butter and in the
7-inch form factor which makes it really
nice and easy to play games and you know
the 7-inch form factor is really nice is
a 1280 x 800 resolution which means you
can watch HD videos the only thing is
this is a 16 x 10 aspect ratio so that
means no matter what you do you won't be
able to see games in like you'll see
this little black bars I'm sorry enum
when watching a video let me see if I
can pull something up all right I'll
just grab my latest video and even
though this is shot in 1080p you can see
that um it has little black bars they're
not very noticeable but it's just
something to know now as for the feel of
this this feels very nice in the hand
you can hold it with one hand and kind
of you know do whatever you have to you
can jump into whatever programs you want
and it just really is very nice and easy
to use it's very portable you can really
stuff this in your pocket even if you
wanted to so it's really nice that it
has this nice form factor very great for
traveling and just so you guys can see a
comparison of what the 7-inch form
factor looks like you can see it here
compared to my HTC One S that has a 4.3
inch screen and you can see just how
much bigger the Nexus 7 is compared to
it but it's really not by two too much
so it still gives you that small
portable feeling but for those of you
who think that you know this is too much
too close to the size of a phone it's
really a lot bigger when you put aside
by side so you still get that tablet
experience because these are big phones
by not like by no means as this a small
phone this is a pretty big phone and
this is much concern really bigger so
it's definitely still going to give you
that tablet feeling and the back has
this really nice um feel to it so it
makes gripping it really easy you don't
have to worry about all you'll have to
worry much about like scratches or
anything like this with this kind of
material so that's always a plus and
unfortunately like on the back there's
no um rear camera but I think that's
okay taking pictures on tablets is
pretty awkward and you know it'd be much
easier to just grab your phone and take
a picture but the nexus 7 done at least
include a 1.2 megapixel front-facing
camera which is good for like you know
using google talk to video chat or skype
or anything like that I've used it and
had no problems actually really enjoyed
it I've been able to hangout on Google+
and you know just very very happy with
the quality that i was getting here so
one of the really great features with
the nexus 7 is google now and being able
to ask the Nexus 7 pretty much anything
and it's got a wrist really quick and
very accurate so here I'm showing you
guys an example who is the Emperor of
Japan and there you go you have the
Empress of Japan and what's really great
is that it also gives you that answer as
well as on some Google search results if
you want more information so that's
really really neat and the same way that
this has been very accurate you can use
this for typing messages and emails just
by talking to the keyboard and it will
write out everything you say boot really
great accuracy i'm going to give you
guys a quick example and here you guys
are about to see me use the dictation to
talk and convert that into text all i
have to do is hit the microphone button
I am currently reviewing the nexus 7
period I hope everyone likes it period
and there you go very accurate very very
nice and very fast so this can be this
can help you with create some really
quick messages as long as you you know
speak clearly into it and it works
really fine so this is definitely one of
the my favorite features and I really
like the way that this works and how
accurate is now this comes in 8
gigabytes and 16 gigabytes for two
hundred thousand two hundred and fifty
dollars respectively um but the thing
about that is I've opted for the eight
gigabyte version because there's just so
many things that i use on here that I
can access through like Google's cloud I
can go to access all my music from the
play the google play app and anything
else is pretty much online so i really
only used the space to fill it up with
about apps to be honest and that's been
working out just fine for me if you're
someone who travels a lot and you know
you want to put your music on here
because you won't have access to Wi-Fi
or your videos then maybe the 16
gigabyte might be a better choice but me
personally since i'm always around Wi-Fi
i figured i just opted for the UM a
gigabyte version and this thing is
packing a 4325 milliamp battery which
means is going to last you a pretty good
amount of time I've been able to get a
couple of days on this without a charge
so like with really be no light usage
decent usage I've been able to do that
my only um gripe with this tablet
altogether is the lack of flash support
as you guys might or might not know
adobe flash has been um ceasing all of
their updates for their flash app which
is really kind of bothersome because we
would love to see that on 4.1
and with google chrome so google chrome
doesn't really support flash and flash
isn't really supported on jelly bean or
anything like that but what you can do
you can't avoid the whole issue with
that and you know sideload flash on to
here and use something like firefox i'll
probably put a video up to explain that
a little bit more but it's really nice
that you can still at least find a way
around flash what's not having to you
know hack your device has rooted or
hacking in any way so that's still a
pretty good thing the only other fault i
would have is not being able to rotate
the screen on it like rotate the home
screen but there are apps to you know
remedy that as well here in my
notification bar I have a nap I forget
what it's called i believe is the
ultimate rotation or something like that
i'll put a link down in the description
to let you guys know but with that I've
been able to flip the screen with no
problem and kind of avoid the whole not
being able to you know rotate the screen
so there is out there are options out
there if you're worried about that so I
really like that I can still do that a
lot of the drawbacks there are ways
around it and I love it so you can make
you can make full use out of this tablet
as long as you know know the little tips
and tricks to get you there and with a
two hundred dollar price point I just
feel like this is a great bargain it
doesn't have the craziest specs compared
to some of the other tablets out there
but for 200 bucks this thing will do
everything you wanted to end quickly and
very smooth thanks to project butter and
Android 4.1 jelly bean pretty much
that's all I have to say about this um
tablet guys it's really great I'm very
unloving the experience so far battery
life is great the screen resolution is
great it's just on point unfortunately
this is my third one my first one had a
couple of pixel issues but and where it
functions fine but it had some really
weird pixel issues it'd be harder to
explain it then
it'd be worth so that when I got
scrapped the second one was absolutely
terrible I think it had every problem in
the book as far as a dead spot in the
screen the screen side was lifting there
were tons of issues and it was even
weird were left in an air-conditioned
room it started to freak out and do
things on its own which I've never seen
anything do before so it's really a hot
couple of things some people have been
getting some faulty products some have
been getting lucky but you know it's the
first couple of you know weeks so
there's gonna be bugs at first I'm sure
they'll get that down but overall my
experience of this has been really
wonderful wife soon as I got a
completely fine working one and I
definitely enjoyed it I definitely
suggest you guys check it out if you're
interested I would recommend it to
anyone who wants a low budget tablet
that functions just as well as a higher
budget one so this has been my review on
the Nexus 7 guys if you have any
questions please feel free to let me
know if you're interested in the tips
and tricks video to learn any of the
stuff like I have here please let me
know and I'll get to that as well but
till then I'll see you guys in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
