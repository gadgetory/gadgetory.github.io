to let you guys know that this channel
was made with the average consumer in
mind alright let's get to another tech
video what's going on everyone in
Traverse consumer and today I'm gonna be
doing a review on the Google Nexus 7
so let's not wasting time let's get
right into it
alright guys so here we have the Google
Nexus 7 this tablet is made by Asus and
it's Google's first Nexus tablet and
when we say Nexus tablet that means it's
going to have stock Android and there's
not going to be any skins on this at all
so it's gonna be as pure of Google as it
can be so that means really fast updates
so when the next update comes out these
will be among the first devices to get
them along with like the Nexus phones so
that's really a great thing here what's
really special about this is the fact
that it has a $200 price point
now tablets are usually ranging much
higher than that we all know that the
iPad is really expensive to transform a
prime and infinity which are very
popular Android tablets are also in a
much higher price range so for 200 bucks
this is a really great deal this is a
7-inch tablet and it comes with a
quad-core processor is NVIDIA Tegra 3
which is really nice for gaming and
things like that and with project butter
on Angela 4.1 it makes it really really
nice to use to play games and you know
move around the screen and such and let
me give you guys a quick example of what
a game would look like on this so I
don't even know if my camera is doing
injustice but this game looks pretty
good this is Sonic
I believe sonic on adventure 4 episode 2
so this is really nice and the
touchscreen is sold from a small enough
that it makes it very comfortable to use
this with um
you know to play this so it's not like
the awkward holding it like really far
apart and playing the controls are
really nice because they're so close
together that it really makes a pretty
nice experience playing playing this so
there you got a glimpse at how nice the
quad-core processor and the tiger
three-chip work with the you know with
gaming and project butter and in the
seven inch form factor which makes it
really nice and easy to play games and
you know the seven inch form factor is
really nice it's a 1280 by 800
resolution which means you can watch HD
videos the only thing is this is a
sixteen by ten aspect ratio so that
means no matter what you do you won't be
able to see games in like you'll see
this little black bars I'm sorry in numb
when watching a video let me see if I
can pull something up all right I'll
just grab my latest video and even
though this is shot in 1080p you can see
that um it has little black bars they're
not very noticeable but it's just
something to know now as for the feel of
this this feels very nice in the hand
you can hold it with one hand and kind
of you know do whatever you have to you
can jump into whatever programs you want
and it just really is very nice and easy
to use it's very portable you can really
stuff this in your pocket even if you
wanted to so it's really nice that it
has this nice form factor very great for
traveling and just so you guys can see a
comparison of what the seven inch form
factor looks like you can see it here
compared to my HTC One S that has a 4.3
inch screen and you can see just how
much bigger the Nexus 7 is compared to
it but it's really not by 2 to much so
it still gives you that small portable
feeling but for those of you who think
that you know this is too much too close
to the size of a phone it's really a lot
bigger when you put
side by side so you still get that
tablet experience because these are big
phones by like by no means is this a
small phone this is a pretty big phone
and this is a much concern really bigger
so it's definitely still gonna give you
that tablet feeling and the back has
this really nice um feel to it
so it makes it dripping it really easy
you don't have to worry about um you
don't have to worry much about like
scratches or anything like this with
this kind of material so that's always a
plus and unfortunately like on the back
there's no um rear camera but I think
that's okay
taking pictures on tablets is pretty
awkward and you know it'd be much easier
to just grab your phone and take a
picture but the nicest 7 does at least
include a 1.2 megapixel front-facing
camera which is good for like you know
using Google Talk to video chat or Skype
or anything like that I've used it and
had no problems actually really enjoyed
it I've been able to hangout on Google+
and you know just very very happy with
the quality that I was getting here so
one of the really great features with
the Nexus 7 it is Google now and being
able to ask the Nexus 7 pretty much
anything and it's got a wrist really
quick and very accurate so here I'm
gonna show you guys an example who is
the Emperor of Japan and there you go
you have the Empress of Japan and what's
really great is that it also gives you
that answer as well as on some Google
search results if you want more
information so that's really really neat
and the same way that this has been very
accurate you can use this for typing
messages and emails just by talking to
um the keyboard and it'll write out
everything you say really great accuracy
I'm gonna give you guys a quick example
and here you guys are about to see me
use the dictation to talk and convert
that into text all I have to do is hit
the microphone button
I am currently reviewing the Nexus 7
period I hope everyone likes it period
and there you go
very accurate very very nice and very
fast so this can be this can help you
with create some really quick messages
as long as you you know speak clearly
into it and it works really fine so this
is definitely one of the my favorite
features and I really like the way that
this works and how accurate it is now
this comes in 8 gigabytes and 16
gigabytes for two hundred thousand two
hundred and fifty dollars respectively
but the thing about that is I've opted
for the 8 gigabyte version because
there's just so many things that I use
on here that I can access through like
Google's cloud I can go to access all my
music from the Play the Google Play app
and anything else is pretty much online
so I really only used the space to fill
it up with about apps to be honest and
that's been working out just fine for me
if you're someone who travels a lot and
you know you want to put your music on
here because you won't have access to
Wi-Fi or your videos then maybe the 16
gigabyte it might be a better choice but
me personally since I'm always around
Wi-Fi I figured I just opted for the UM
8 gigabyte version and this thing is
packing a 4325 milliamp battery which
means it's going to last through a
pretty good amount of time I've been
able to get a couple of days on this
without a charge so like with really you
know light usage decent usage I've been
able to do that
my only um gripe with this tablet
altogether is the lack of flash support
as you guys might or might not know
Adobe Flash has been um ceasing all of
their updates for their Flash app which
is really kind of bothersome because we
would love to see that 14.1
with Google Chrome so Google Chrome
doesn't really support flash and flash
isn't really supported on jellybean or
anything like that but what you can do
you can't avoid the whole issue with
that and you know side load flash onto
here and use something like Firefox I'll
probably put a video up to explain that
a little bit more but it's really nice
that you can still at least find a way
around Flash what's not having to you
know hack your device has rooted or
hacking in a new way so that's still a
pretty good thing
the only other fault I would have is not
being able to rotate the screen on the
like and rotate the home screen but
there are apps to you know remedy that
as well here in my notification bar I
have an app I forget what it's called I
believe it's the ultimate rotation or
something like that I'll put a link down
in the description to let you guys know
but with that I've been able to flip the
screen with no problem and kind of avoid
the whole not being able to you know
rotate the screen so there is there are
options out there if you're worried
about that so I really like that I can
still do that a lot of the drawbacks
there are ways around it and I love it
so you can make you can make full use
out of this tablet as long as you know
know the little tips and tricks to get
you there and with the $200 price point
I just feel like this is a great bargain
it doesn't have the craziest specs
compared to some of the other tablets
out there but for 200 bucks this thing
will do everything you wanted to and
quickly and very smooth
thanks to project butter and Android 4.1
jelly bean pretty much that's all I have
to say about this tablet guys it's
really great I'm very I'm loving the
experience so far battery life is great
the screen resolution is great it's just
on point unfortunately this is my third
one my first one had a couple of pixel
issues but and where it functions fine
but it had some really weird pixel
issues
harder to explain it then it'd be worth
so that when I got scrapped the second
one was absolutely terrible I think it
had every problem in the book as far as
a dead spot in the screen the screen
side was lifting there were tons of
issues and it was even weird when I left
in an air-conditioned room I started to
freak out into things on its own which
I've never seen anything do before so
it's really a hot couple of things some
people have been getting some faulty
products some have been getting lucky
but you know it's the first couple of
you know weeks so there's gonna be bugs
at first I'm sure they'll get that down
but overall my experience of this has
been really wonderful why as soon as I
got a completely fine working one and I
definitely enjoyed it I definitely
suggest you guys check it out if you're
interested I would recommend it to
anyone who wants a low budget tablet
that functions just as well as a higher
budget one so this has been my review on
the Nexus 7 guys if you have any
questions please feel free to let me
know if you're interested in the tips
and tricks video to learn any of this
stuff like I have here please let me
know and I'll get to that as well but
till then I'll see you guys in the next
video peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
