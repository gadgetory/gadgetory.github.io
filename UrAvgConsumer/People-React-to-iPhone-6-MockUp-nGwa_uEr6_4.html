consumer and today I've got a special
video for you guys I'm actually in New
York City and I'm going to be going up
to random strangers asking them what
they think of this possible iPhone 6
this is the iPhone 6 mock-up so we're
gonna see what people think of the
change and if they'll like it compared
to the old one so let's not waste any
time right into it so have you heard
about the new iPhone 6 for anything
about it at all I haven't heard anything
nope anything about the design
now I fight to suicide concept where the
whole phone is the screen there's no
buttons that's really sure I have my
hope so are you guys familiar with the
iPhone 5s yes I do actually I have
currently I have a 38 payable for good
reason well we are the experts in all
right so what if I told you I have a gun
so you might get an idea what it might
look like well I might just take it from
you okay now I want to see you well wow
it's really late
well it's not a real phone boss I mean I
wouldn't be surprised if Apple actually
made it this way yeah
it's very light
I guess that's because it's not real
and release
to see one there yeah yeah actually it
looks very much like the iPod Touch oh
there's still three iPod touches
beautiful I like it I like the color
this is some of an option I'm sure
they're gonna have different colors all
available yeah yeah
it looks pretty slick it's a little big
though
let's put in a back pocket
I like it oh I don't like it guess it's
big okay yeah
even being a taller guy yeah I know
exactly I you see like for someone you
know we might have to compensate maybe
they want a bigger phone or something I
don't know but I'm not into big folks
yeah like it's a mobile phone I want to
carry it around I like this I mean the
screen is huge
stuff like that it's definitely a huge
improvement
everything's much work there's no
problem with you I mean I guess
in the hand feel it feels good yeah it's
- what do you think yeah it's just
getting bigger
what is it is throwing me off about this
it's just like the round right yeah
they're at a edges yeah so what do you
think about this outgoing I'm I'm part
of the group that I it's well I'm fine
with the size
yeah definitely like I get to the point
where if I start figuring out how to
reorganize my pocket space to
accommodate my into me that
it defeats the purpose of the not
abandon to look like I just thought
maybe because you know I'm afraid to
change you know I don't know what
Obama's doing with this country my Obama
with these new iPhones if this was
actions of desire which by it it's just
based on the design I prefer this design
better so I wouldn't buy it just look at
the design and I don't really care like
I'm satisfied with my screen right now
I would think about personally I
would've liked
yeah it's definitely something out there
for me I'm not sure I'm so attached to
this right now
but I think that eventually I probably
would well yeah I probably would buy it
because I need a new phone it's like
yeah it really depends on what qualities
perhaps or rice like you camera there
playing it really would depend on the
technology that's in it for now
mask us I'm broke like what I like
bottle down I wouldn't switch over the
size of the screen yeah yeah existence
largest nicely I would I'm a big apple
fan I have had the hype adam ak Book Pro
Apple TV and everything so I would feel
almost and fine especially because I
didn't get the s2 5s probably I've had
an iPhone since the first one my only
concern would be like it's in my pocket
like a jeans pocket more than anything
just how far in a bend over like snap so
the design works for you the sound does
work I like it it's really really nice
I look forward to seeing if it actually
comes out like this
yeah I like it it's really awesome you
have it and all right guys that pretty
much wraps up this video we got a ton of
different answers from a bunch of
different people and it seems like a lot
of people do like to design they like
how sleek it looks so we'll see what
Apple actually does with it it's
interesting that some people wanted to
buy it regardless of the design but
that's about it for this video guys if
