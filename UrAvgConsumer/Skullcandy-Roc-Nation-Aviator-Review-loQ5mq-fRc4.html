consumer and today I have a review for
you guys of the rock nation Skullcandy
aviators
so let's not wasting time let's get
right into it
and here we have the Skullcandy rock
nation aviators I think we can all agree
that these are some really classy
looking ad phones the color scheme in
styling these are great and they just
seem riddled with branding from Roc
Nation and Skullcandy alike but not in a
bad way less if you guys can actually
keep count of how many pieces of
branding you see on these bad boys
throughout the review but that aside
let's take a look at the case they come
in taking a look at this case we can see
that it's made of a plethora SH material
and I think it really helps to add to
the aviator theme that these headphones
are going for when you feel it you
notice that it has a soft yet sturdy
feel to it and just like the headphones
you'll find a ton of branding on this
case as well when unzipped
we're greeted by this big red banner
that says rock nation all across and I
hope you guys are still keeping count
when we get past that you can find those
ever so stylish headphones that we all
came to see but let's get back to this
case inside of it you'll find that it
has two little pouches that you can
store things inside of a microfiber
cloth would be a good idea since these
ear cups are pretty glossy and might
attract some fingerprints overall the
case itself is pretty stylish and offers
a great way to carry the Aviators and
since it's a softer case I wouldn't
trust it with protecting the headphones
from hard impact but it'll definitely
soften the blow and protect them from
any kind of scratches now let's get to
the headphones as we take a closer look
at the headphones you'll notice that the
headband is pretty reminiscent of a belt
as you can see is pretty soft on the
inside while having that tougher
exterior this is kind of like a dual
headband because the actual headband
piece and that little extra golden
portion above it that leads down to the
clubs and the ear cups are actually
pretty cool to look at since they're
see-through and you can see a bit of the
mechanics inside you'll also notice the
wire sticking out from the hinge and it
kind of reminds me of the look of the
beats by dre mixers some might not be
too fond of the adjusters though since
they kind of go passed down the ear cups
but I don't think it's an issue or
anything one of my favorite aspects of
these headphones is actually the ear
cups they're made with a great oval
shape that allows the air to fit inside
very comfortably giving you that over
ear feeling comfort is also the least of
your concerns with the aviators as they
have very plush cushions on the ear cups
and the overall comfort of the
headphones are pretty good due to all
that soft material used although I must
say I don't feel comfortable calling
these headphones durable because of some
of the smaller parts on them there are a
lot of skinny pieces that I would fear
to put under any real pressure and fear
of snapping them or anything like that
overall I'm pretty happy with the design
of the headphones and if you're not
someone who's going to toss them around
you should be just fine with the overall
build quality of them and here you can
see the cable of the skull candies
the top has the red lines going around
the input and as you go down a little
more you'll get the remote it has an
annoying remote that works with all
Apple products has volume up and downs
and the playing pause button and of
course no lack of logos here it says
skull candy and it has the skull in the
front and of course it has a mic and
towards the bottom you'll find that the
other end of it of course has another
skull and you know there's nothing wrong
with these skulls they're not intrusive
or anything
they still do well and they it looks
fine and I'm a fan of this kind of input
because it goes well into like my
devices such as my HTC One S there's no
real problems getting it in the l-shape
can be a problem sometimes and I just
find that this is a pretty good input as
headphones go and now of course we have
to talk about the sound quality if
you're looking for a cheaper option than
the solo HDS these are a winner
I was pretty happy with the overall
sound quality that I got from these of
course from an average consumer
perspective these will more than satisfy
your listening needs it has some decent
bass and clarity and the bass isn't too
heavy so I don't think you'll need to
worry about it being over the top or
drowning out your music
I think this falls in line with the
beats solo HD and the SOL Republic
tracks HD kind of category I'm also
pretty happy that you can use the inline
remote a bit with Android minus the
volume control features but like I said
before I'm pretty happy with the sound
quality and I'm confident that the
average consumer will be as well now to
show you guys what it looks like around
the neck and also be sure to leave a
comment down below letting me know how
many times you guys saw various branding
from rock nation or skull candy in this
review all right guys now I'm going to
show you what they look like on here it
is around my neck
not bad like I said I'm a fan of the
look I just think it looks really great
here it is around the ear and here you
are very nice stylish looking headphones
very happy with these um I think for the
average consumer these would be a great
pair of headphones like I said before
they sound great um in comparison to
things like the solo HDS
this is you this will definitely be
right up there with them if not better
so I'm really happy about these I'll end
their cheaper than this always these
these are run for about 150 so it's
pretty good umm like I think the average
consumer will definitely enjoy these so
I definitely do recommend it if you are
interested and that's about it for this
review guys if you enjoyed it please hit
that thumbs up button and rate comment
subscribe all that good stuff and I'll
see you guys in the next video till then
you have a consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
