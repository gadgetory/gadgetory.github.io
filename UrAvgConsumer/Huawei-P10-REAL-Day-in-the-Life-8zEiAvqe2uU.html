consumer and today we are going to be
spending a real Dana light with the
Huawei p10 now for those of you who've
never seen a real day in the life video
like me we're going to spend the full
day with this phone
testing out things like its performance
seeing what that screen is like the
camera battery life all the stuff you
want to know and how it performs in real
world usage so let's check it out
all right guys so we've got the huawei
to 10 and 10 I've got a few errands to
run today so we're probably going to go
hit up Michaels first get some picture
frames for some dope artwork that I got
my hands on but we'll see how this thing
lasts awful day so the p10 has this
fingerprint scanner at the bottom you
know kind of like a home button but it
also has the buttons the on-screen
buttons which I kind of don't like it
feels redundant so I'm going to get rid
of these buttons and use this one but
it's got pretty weird setup so I could
jump into the settings hit the
navigation key and instead of using the
three here I just use that home one but
it's got like I said a pretty odd set up
so when you want to go back you tap the
home button once or the fingerprint
scanner and if you want to go to the
home screen you have to double tap it
and if you want to see your recent apps
you Schleich left across it so as you
can see I can do that there so I mean
it's not like a dedicated button it's
not a physical button nothing you can
actually press in so it's going to take
a little getting used to but I prefer to
have that extra real estate on the
screen okay so we keep the frames
they've got plans and you guys know you
got a plan for your videos doesn't look
though I'm actually going to try out the
camera and see if I can get a nice shot
of this it over color it's great so
let's see here got my camera
hold this up got some focus let's see
how this look oh this is pretty shot
wow it's really sure let's try one more
hey I'm Michael Jackson in the back all
right yeah Wow
so far so good anyway I'm thinking of
this plant alright so getting a frame
for those pictures is a bus so I'm gonna
have to look elsewhere they cost about
115 cerf picture and I have two of them
I don't know I can't spend over 200
bucks on picture frames I can't do it so
we're waiting for on a Starbucks if you
guys can even see that but I'm playing
some Pokemon go to kill the time this
green is actually pretty good this is
after speak percent brightness I can see
it pretty well I can see if not showing
up that well on camera but the screen is
plenty bright for use at a lower
brightness level and a full brightness
here it is this looks really really
clean outside so direct sunlight I'm not
going to have any issues so we're in
Petco right now these girls are looking
for an outfit for our dogs which is
crazy but they're looking for an outfit
because cookie is turning to and like a
week lots of more important things
I want to touch on the battery life so I
jumped into the battery usage details
you guys not look to jump in and let you
guys know give you guys a quick update
on how the battery is going but so far
this screen isn't populated with any
real information that I can use so I
can't tapping of these there's nothing
going on here so I'm not sure what the
screen on time is like it is currently
almost 12 p.m. and we're looking at
about 73% battery life which is you know
okay
nothing mind-blowing so far but I have
been on it quite a bit taking a couple
of photos here in there playing some
Pokemon ago so I'm not bad but if that
screen does populate I'll be sure to
give you guys an update on the exact
screen on time
so right now we're actually on our way
to Best Buy but look over here we got
some dope colorful flowers perfect
chance to try out the camera again see
if we could get some nice cool shot all
right so I'm ready to mess with a flower
right here so I'm going to see if I can
grab this guy on camera all right looks
good
I gotta say I'm actually really
impressed by this camera it's definitely
really solid good stuff alright guys so
I got what I came for
uh-huh these are the Sony xb9 50 and one
you guys know half of about the BP so I
am super hyped to get this I don't know
what studio is going to come out first
cuz I know I'm going to rush to do this
one so it might be this video I don't
know but you know what I love about Best
Buy like the light it is always so
bright in here video always looks so
good I think I'm gonna take some selfies
in here because I have the perfect
lighting so this does 4k over here so
this is the perfect spot going to take
my selfie right now see how this goes
oh my god there's this weird portrait
mode thing on you got to take that off I
don't like that that's automatically on
okay this is normal and overt folks
all right let's look at the quality now
all right it's a little soft I'd say
this first one actually came out a bit
better but this one was the best I'd say
but it's like overexposed so crazy
alright guys so we are going to the
movie theater and we are going to be
checking out Logan we are super late
I blame I play meri and I blame her too
you haven't been around we're going to
see it now but we're actually shooting
this with the camera on the p10 and the
audio so everything you see in here is
what you get when you use the camera
anytime right out make a page I can hear
you right yeah all right so we're using
the front-facing camera right now and we
just came out of Logan good good I got
ridiculous dresses we're doing in Petco
a lot she looks like a fish poor dog
we're back in the studio we spent a lot
of time out got a couple errands done
even went to see a movie
but I didn't get a real a chance to tell
you guys about the actual design of the
phone things you could kind of expect
with it some specs we're not going to go
to some crazy respect because you guys
know but let's see first of all the
design I gotta say it looks like the
iPhone let's be straight up it has a
very very similar design the antenna
bands the curved body it looks like but
it's still a very very good looking
phone but if you're looking for
something that doesn't look like
anything on the market this is not that
phone but I don't like what they do with
the cameras these are there like a
branded cameras they've got two lenses
here so you've got a 20 megapixel and a
12 megapixel lens so you can do some
special effects like the portrait mode
that the iPhone has where you can lower
the back
it's a really nice effect and what's
actually way better about this phone
than the iPhone is that you can adjust
just how much of that blurry effect you
want to include so that is a really
really nice touch I think it's called a
wide aperture mode so it looks good it's
very nice you've also got their own
processor I'm not if you're going to go
into all the details of what that
processor is all the clock speeds all
that from what I can tell this thing is
super snappy I've been able to do
whatever I wanted with it with no
problem jumping in and out of apps have
been no issue even playing some games
that I've had issues with on other
phones like Crazy Taxi that game has had
a little bit of lag on some phones that
I've used in the past and over here it
runs super smooth so shout out to them
you know this is honestly probably the
smoothest I've ever played Crazy Taxi
that is though because I like playing
Crazy Taxi you guys old school asking
that was my game back in the day with
Dreamcast now I've been able to play
Crazy Taxi on phones like the g6 or the
Google pixel XL no problem but it wasn't
as smooth as I'm seeing here this is
probably the smoothest I've ever seen
Crazy Taxi play now that's just one game
but to me that says a lot in terms of
how good this processor is and how it
can handle I guess an intensive port
like the Crazy Taxi game so that's
actually really impressive to me now
guys this is a skinned version of
Android but I gotta say I kind of dig it
now this is what they're emui
I'm not really crazy about skins I think
I've kind of made that clear and most of
my videos about phones but this one I
don't know that they I feel like they
kind of got it right it might be all the
transparent effects that are getting to
me but I do love the look of it the
buttons are nice and small not too small
that you can't see it but it's the deck
just they're just really clean now even
their icons have let me jump into here a
lot of their icons have this themes look
going for it
now and you can change that if you want
I think it actually looks kind of nice
and I didn't notice any slowdowns
because of the skin which is also a very
very nice touch so you can jump into all
of the settings that you need to the
only complaint that I have is that going
into the battery settings I can't really
see what I want to see so that is
probably my biggest complaint in terms
of the skin but um overall I kind of do
like it only thing I can see with this
battery so far is that I've been using
it for 5 hours and 42 minutes I'm not
really sure what it's tallying maybe
from when I first unplugged it but that
is absolutely not screen on time I still
have 42 percent left 7 p.m. I'm not
gonna lie I wasn't on this thing all day
I did go see Logan did a couple of
errands so I wasn't crazy on the battery
but this battery is pretty decent
I think it's 3,200 milliamp hours so
that's a pretty pretty nice amount
considering this is a 5.1 inch display
so the screen isn't picking up a ton of
battery as 1080p as well so battery life
has been pretty decent but as for my
main point the UI even though it's
skinned I actually really enjoy it
typing one this is great is using Swift
keyboard so a swiss key you can use that
as your keyboard and it's um you know in
Krita sandals can't complain and i just
realized i said that i liked something
that people typically have an issue with
being the skin so i just want to make it
clear that Huawei is not sponsoring this
video I just like the skin you don't
have to go there oh and bonus this thing
has a headphone jack such that we didn't
have to mention that nowadays but it's
here so if you want to use your regular
headphones you can do it as you're
getting used to this home button I'm
still getting used to it but it's
definitely doable just takes a little
time for a muscle memory to kick in
alright guys so we spent a full day with
this phone and of course that's the more
time with it after that and I think it's
safe to say I like this phone I think
this is a clean looking phone although
it does look very familiar but if you're
looking to switch it up they do offer a
blue
Green versions so if you want to stand
out a bit you can go that route the only
other thing I wish they added in terms
of the design and hardware
we've been some nice capacitive buttons
on the left and right side of the home
button that would have made things a lot
easier instead of having to deal with
those little shortcuts if they're not
bad you get used to them but those would
have been some great additions but in
terms of performance this thing did
exactly as I'd expect it handled
everything I do added just fine
it's 2017 so like I said in most of my
videos I'm expecting no performance
issues with most of the phones in this
price range but when this phone actually
really surprised me with playing Crazy
Taxi I mentioned that earlier it
performed that as in a lot of the folks
that I've been using lately so that is a
very very nice bonus I'm pretty
confident that this thing can handle a
lot in terms of the cameras I like how
they perform I got some very nice sharp
photos there are lots of options lots of
little menus that you can jump into to
tweak your photos that had that
controllable portrait mode feature so
all cool stuff I wasn't too thrilled
about the front-facing camera the video
that I got out of the front-facing
camera wasn't that hot some of the
pictures were a bit overexposed so front
facing cameras match but the rear camera
is the dual cameras they performed very
well and this thing has a 3200 milliamp
hour battery which is pretty good for a
phone this size and I was able to bump
break all day while driving around I
played a bunch of games to test out the
performance even use the camera quite a
bit to try that out and still use it for
everyday things like checking my emails
searching for things so everyday stuff a
bit more than normal it handled it all
really really well and I think what
really stood out to me with this phone
has to be Wii UI everything was nice and
clean nothing was overdone things didn't
get in the way had a very mature
businesslike feel but of course that can
all be changed because this phone
supports different themes so if you want
something a little bit brighter happier
you can go ahead and swap that but I do
like what it initially came with and it
even offers some nice little tidbits
like when someone calls you and you have
that missed call notification you can
see how long the phone rang so
don't values you don't have to go in
Russian call them back now if any of you
guys are interested in getting your
hands on a free P pen I'm actually going
to have something going on over on
Instagram so be sure to check out my
page we look out for that giveaway post
and be sure to enter but not about apps
out of this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy
like this video thumbs up and I'll catch
you guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
