to have dinner and of course we have a
home-cooked meal here as always but it's
just that we didn't cook it
someone else did but um yeah this is
grateful this is oxtail if you guys

a delicious this is you make it dish
yeah Jamaican dish you definitely have
to try it out from a Jamaican restaurant
or somewhere it's great great stuff and
we've got some Pokemon cars here last
time we didn't open them on the actual
vlog because we didn't think you'd be
interested but some of you were actually
interested in knowing what we pulled if
we got anything good so we're gonna do
that right after we chow down
first tank yeah so we got wet cars guys
week we pulled not even a hallo
wack last time we got last time we got
some great cards yeah yes on the scene
you got we got to TX clubs which are
like some really rare cards so we got
some nice stuff this time was a bust
it's the packs didn't want to you know
show off the vlog so no luck well yeah
that is it now we're going to just relax
apparently now I might just be um oh
also one thing we wanted to know as you
guys probably have noticed now that
we're slowly into the block there's no
there's no honor Anna wasn't able to
hang out with us she's been busy since
she got home essentially she got our
hopes up so there was no real chill time
for Anna and stuff so maybe the next
time when she comes and visits whenever
that may be
it should be here all summer so you will
definitely see her at some point
so whenever that is you'll see you here
and yeah but we're gonna relax and then
we're gonna do our girlfriend tests and
then we'll be done so I'll go pack for
New Orleans ah fun times
