consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day in the life with the
iPhone 10 are and for those of you who
have never seen one of my real
day-in-the-life videos you're pretty
much gonna be spending a day with me and
the iPhone 10 are as we test out things
like performance the single camera the
new body and we're gonna see how it does
in the real world but let's take a look
at how it did okay guys so now we're
starting our real day in the life it is
10:42 a.m. and just looking at the
viewfinder here or my screen it looks
like the quality is really good so this
is the front-facing camera quality that
you could come to expect as well as the
audio quality and it looks pretty solid
here but we'll wait till we actually get
it on a computer to make any real
judgments but we do have a couple of
things to do today we got some videos to
shoot I had a lot of videos to shoot
because next week
headed to Japan baby so I got a lot of
stuff to do before we go started so the
first thing I want to do guys is kind of
talk about the body of the iPhone 10 are
now this is slightly bigger than the
iPhone 10s and you know the iPhone 10
this is a 6.1 inch display and speaking
of the display guys this thing has you
know some of these borders over here
people will complain about it it kind of
sucks that it's bare but I will say
after using it for a while you kind of
get used to it and this is coming from
someone who's been using the 10 and now
the 10s max so borders aren't that bad
but some people will probably dislike
them I know area does she hates the
borders and yes guys we are back in the
kitchen and I know certain parts of it
still aren't done it's been a long time
I know this but we'll get to it
I'm actually curious about what you guys
think about doing an empty house story
which we shot one day how I'm going is
she one like a few months ago like two
three months ago guys a couple things
have changed since we shot that video
but let me know if you guys want to see
it we're building the ultimate smart
home and I want to know what you guys
think if you guys want to see it before
and after so let me know what a comment
down below I'm really curious about that
but back to this iPhone guys people
complain about the resolution on this
guy but it's really not that bad
honestly just taking a look at it from
here
I can't tell the difference between this
and an iPhone 10s or 10s Macs in terms
of resolution and it being clear this
thing is super clear it looks just fine
but it is a lower resolution but when it
comes to just straight-up navigating the
phone that's not gonna be an issue I
promise
and no apples not sponsoring this video
so that I could say something nice about
it it's just the truth honestly guys
just watching one of my own videos it
still looks like a really high quality
video even though this thing has a lower
resolution
it still looks just fine it doesn't look
like I'm watching a low res video
because of the lower resolution I'm not
just saying that making excuses for this
or trying to give it a pass this is what
my channel is all about your average
consumer as tech nerds we can go ahead
and say all lower resolution film it
sucks but for the everyday person
looking at this thing they're gonna just
say oh wow that looks really good
without any idea about the numbers
they're just gonna see what they see
with their eyes and I'm telling you
you're gonna look at this and say wow it
looks good something you don't hear
people talk about a lot when watching
content with the 10r is that it has
those improved speakers that the 10s and
10's Macs have but because this one has
a bigger body than the 10s it actually
has a better sound output than it does
too so check this out guys yeah guys
this thing has improved speakers it
sounds really good in terms of content
consumption this thing is right up there
with a ton of other flagships out there
right now alright guys had to stop
everything I was doing I head over to
the barber get a cut got a wedding to go
through this weekend
I gotta go to Japan too so I had to make
sure I was fresh and not bad okay guys
so we haven't been doing too many
battery updates because honestly it's
just an iPhone there's not gonna be that
much difference in terms of the overall
everyday experience but there are a
couple of things that have changed with
the 10r especially because of that
screen so this is an LCD display that's
kind of why we have these thick bezels
here on the sides that's actually where
the backlight is coming from so that the
display can be nice and bright but it's
a bit of a different display because now
because of those back lights we don't
have the ability to have forced touch or
is it 3d touch I think it's 3d touch now
they changed it so now we don't have 3d
touch which means you can't long press
or press in on a on an icon and have
something come up so the only place
where you get something that's similar
to it which is called haptic touch is on
the lock screen so now you can hold and
then has something like the flashlight
turn on and then hold it and then it
goes away
so that's kind of where haptic touch
comes in you no longer have 3d touch it
also works in this control center so if
you wanted to go ahead and do that you
can same goes with this so those are the
only places where you can really take
advantage of haptic touch my favorite
thing to do with Google Maps is to go
ahead and 3d touch it and then I have
access to my favorite places but now you
don't have access to that anymore which
is a bit unfortunate so I have to go
jump into the app typing where I'm going
that kind of sucks
alright guys right now we are on our way
to the post office we're almost there
just about two minutes away I have the
GPS going stop long overwrought that
long of a ride so I don't think it's
gonna hit the battery that hard
so we lost like 1% since using the GPS
to get here so right now we're at 32%
and it's 539 and it's a pretty much
winding down but we got a good bit of
battery left and in terms of screen on
time guys 4 hours and 41 minutes
this thing is a battery champ alright
guys so we are back in the studio I was
actually editing a video but gotta take
a quick break from that I wanted to post
something on Instagram and this is where
the camera comes in I gotta say guys
it's a little disappointing my favorite
way to take a picture is with portrait
mode I love portrait mode but with the
10r you can't really use the portrait
mode effect unless you're taking a
picture of someone so inanimate objects
pets those are no longer options if I
wanted to take a picture of this Xbox
one elite controller here they'd say no
person detected so it is not gonna give
me that effect ah that's the one
drawback now I know most people I'm sure
most people don't really care about
portrait mode but for me it matters but
one thing I know most people will
probably use portrait mode with other
people so it will still work with that
but just nothing like this this just
this ain't gonna do it
see I said at the top no person detected
but if I were to pull out my 10 s max I
can go into portrait mode and bam I
don't know if you guys can actually see
it but it's got that blur effect going
on in the background right now but there
is something cool about portrait mode
even with the 10r take a look at this
guy's so when you're in regular photo
mode and you swipe over the portrait the
10 s max or the 10s or regular 10 they
use the telephoto lens in order to get
the photo but with the 10 R you can see
it uses the single lens that it has in
the back now the reason why I think that
is really cool is because when you're
taking a picture or portrait mode with
one of these phones you got a like a
step back move back and then take the
picture but with this you pull it out
you don't even have to move back or
anything you just take a picture of your
subject I think that is really really
cool and one of the benefits of having a
single lens but I still want to get my
Instagram picture so I am going over to
the tennis max to get it got to show the
people this beautiful
and bam oh that is so clean guys and if
I were to try to take it with ten are I
still probably get a clean photo not
portrait mode but let's see definitely
still clean photo is the same lens as
with the iPhone tennis and tennis max
it's just missing out on the telephoto
and that Britain was wrapped up our day
guys now I did use the phone until the
battery was completely depleted and I
gotta say guys the battery life Wow
amazing stuff this thing almost got 7
hours of battery life something that
I've never been able to do on another
smartphone before I've seen some phones
hit 6 hours which i think is absolutely
amazing and this thing got almost 7
hours of screen on time which is
something I've never seen on a
smartphone before so the 10 are
absolutely has the best battery life
I've seen on any iPhone period so I
think a lot of people are gonna be happy
with being able to have a phone that
lasts almost all day and I did a lot of
gaming guys so I'm sure this thing can
go even further if you're trying to
decide between the 10 R and the 10s
honestly guys they're pretty much the
same phone with some slight differences
one of course being the frame around the
body with the 10 are you have that
aluminum with the 10s and 10's max you
have that stainless steel and while some
people may think of that as a downgrade
I think for everyday people they're
actually going to appreciate not seeing
as many scratches with a 10 ARS aluminum
body as you would see what the stainless
steel I'm not gonna lie to you guys
while that stainless steel looks nice it
does get a lot of fine scratches now
let's just cut to the chase guys is the
iPhone 10 are worth it absolutely while
some people will complain about the
lower resolution the borders yes
the phone has its flaws in comparison to
something like the 10s and 10's max but
as a standalone phone it is a really
really good phone it's just as powerful
as it's more expensive counterparts
while there may be some trade-offs with
the 10r
I think if you are a regular everyday
person who just wants an iPhone 10
experience this is going to be a really
really good value considering it starts
at 750 compared to a thousand bucks
that's $150 can go a long way I think
this thing is going to sell
well over the holidays whether you're
buying it for teens or someone who
doesn't really care about the
differences between it and be more
expensive versions this is really going
to be the best iPhone option for the
average consumer and I'm not just making
a play on my name guys I think regular
everyday people are going to enjoy this
phone and walk away with a really solid
experience it's really easy for us tech
enthusiasts to walk around with
pitchforks when we see some numbers are
smaller than others but honestly when it
comes down to the overall experience
it's odd but that about wraps it up for
this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it
iPhone 10 art is a good buy I'm not
afraid to say it but till the next video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it if you did
be the cool guy or girl that gives it a
thumbs up and I'll catch you guys in the
next one
till then is your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
