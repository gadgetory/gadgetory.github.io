consumer and I am back in my hometown of
Brooklyn and today we are taking out
another space but this time a classroom
and I figured let's do something better
than just your typical video why not
give back to the place where I grew up
so right behind me we have PS 208 and
then this school that is this really
awesome teacher called miss Karpinski
who aims to make learning fun and
engaging and she wanted to do more
project-based learning and I figured I'd
give her some text to help out with that
and we put some pretty cool tech inside
of there let's check it out
so we got to the school before any
teachers got there and we proceeded to
set up mr. Prince T's classroom and we
had to move quickly because she gets to
school pretty early and we wanted to
keep this a surprise so we started by
replacing her old slower laptop with the
Dell XPS tower a special edition and you
guys might remember this from the retro
desk setup that I made a couple of weeks
ago we're also throwing the Dell
ultra-thin 27-inch monitor so that she
has a nice good-looking display which
won't take up too much room on her desk
so she can still have room for all her
supplies we also gave her these desktop
Logitech speakers with a subwoofer since
she had to use a small Bluetooth speaker
before that and these pitas are actually
really good for the price they also
include this little dial so that you can
control the volume connect headphones
and also use it as a Bluetooth speaker
and with that sub they'll definitely
have a little kick to their audio now
for these laptops we got her we got
heard these Dell g3 gaming laptops
because she's really into project-based
learning and we wanted her to have
awesome machines that can handle that
with no problem
so that means when the kids are working
on big projects in her classroom they
won't have to worry about using dated
machines that move slowly and he's also
packed dedicated graphics cards like the
NVIDIA GTX 1050 T eyes so if Miss Carr
Pinsky's feeling really nice they can
play some educational games really
easily and these officers is really
impressive for what you get in terms of
the specs and the overall design with a
cool backlit keyboard iridescent logo it
just looks really nice overall I really
do like these laptops and would
definitely recommend them for anyone
looking for a decent gaming laptop for
under thousand bucks
now onto some of the smaller pieces here
you know how hard it is for me to not go
with the best when talking about
headphones but I had to remember that
these were 10 year olds so I went with a
more budget-friendly option
with these little Sony headphones they
only cost about 15 bucks so they didn't
break the bank because I know there's a
high chance the kids will break them
these are pretty decent dependable
headphones that the kids can use while
they're working on their projects on the
laptops and the project happens to be
with a partner we also got them these
headphone splitters so that two kids can
use a laptop at once this way they're
not resorting to using earbuds which
isn't the most hygienic and both kids
can work together and of course we had
to reveal this all to miss Karpinski
how's it going I know you have your
whole setup here with your laptop is
still there
but right here we have this really cool
desktop computer fan bell so right here
we have three laptops that it can't have
dedicated graphics they're good specs we
also have some like headphone Oh awesome
that is great to hear and I also got
some headphones players students can
gather around put two headphones one
laptop I know you were using this little
Bluetooth speaker here I got some
desktop speakers right here so that we
can connect right to it so then you'll
have a lot more control a lot louder
sound yeah and we also got you a little
Starbucks gift card no problem and she
seemed pretty excited about all the
changes but of course we had to reveal
this to the kids and needless to say
they were pretty excited
this is for these speakers so this is
the dial so if you want to put the
volume up or down I can do that and
although guys I was just really excited
to head back home and give a little
something back to some of these kids and
an awesome teacher who was helping them
learn it was just really nice to share
some of the tech that I get to use on a
daily basis and help them get access to
some of that stuff but that about wraps
it up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy or
girl that give this video a thumbs up
till then guys our average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
