want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with dad which consumer
in mind all right let's get to another
tech video what's going on everyone it's
your average consumer and today I have
another unboxing for you guys of the
brand new Kindle Fire HD so with not
wasting time let's get right into it
apart of guys so here we have the Kindle
Fire HD and it's a very interesting
package that a packaging that it comes
in because usually amazon has those
little brown cardboard boxes and you
know this is a little different I guess
because it's their special you know
they're their special product that they
want to switch up the packaging so it's
very interesting to see this around the
box pretty much this is it it has my
shipping information in the back because
that's all that came in and here you can
just see us as Kindle Fire so nothing
too special about the box at all here I
guess you can just kind of rip this
little part off I don't know how walls
are some work I've never seen something
like this it was pretty simple actually
didn't get the whole thing off but
overall that's it and this is a Kindle
Fire and let's see we have a little
pocket is that little tab at the bottom
here so just terms of policies and
getting to know your Kindle so nothing's
are special there we have the Kindle
Fire and we have the what is this micro
USB micro USB cable and that's about it
for the box guys really really simple
packaging not too surprising when it
comes to Amazon so let's put this left
to the side you can even put this to the
side and let's see how well I don't know
if this has any juice it's a very it's
very small it feels even smaller than
the Nexus 7 I could be wrong here
they're both 7 inch screens let me see
something real quick alright so I just
grabbed my Nexus 7 Oh No pretty much the
same well next time is slightly taller
and the Kindle Fire HD is wider so I
came off looking small
but I guess that's just seven inches
seven inch form factor for you so let's
pop this open lie just out it looks like
I must have hit the power button already
I got some streaks on here from the
plastic but that's alright alright guys
so this thing is powered up but before I
get into it let me show you guys a
close-up of everything around the Kindle
Fire HD alright so first things first we
have a 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera
and if we look to the side of the Kindle
Fire HD you'll see that we have any
speaker right here and this is supposed
to be their new dual stereo speakers so
I think there are like two drivers
inside here two drivers being like two
little speakers over here at another two
on the other side and also on the right
side you'll find the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack as well as the volume
rocker for up and down and the power
button right here now this seems like it
really blended into the device so I I
can already see that this might be a
little hard to press in the future but
overall this is it and this is the back
of it there's a rubberized back on the
Kindle Fire and it just feels really
good and um very smooth maybe it'll make
holding this very comfortable like I
said the other side has the other
speakers and at the very top here you
can see that it has a a microphone and
at the bottom you'll have your micro USB
to charge it and plug it into your
computer and on this side is the micro
HDMI out so if you have a micro HDMI
cable you can plug this into your
monitor or HDTV or anything like that
and pretty much that's about it for this
um close up guys and alright guys before
I wrap up this unboxing I just wanted to
show you guys just real poking a little
size comparison between these and some
more other popular tablets that are out
right now these this is the Nexus 7
right on the left
and the iPad so as you know these are
both 7 inches over here and the iPad is
927 there's a problem for probably like
10 inches so this you can see the size
difference I thought it looks smaller
than the Nexus 7 at first but that's
because of the wider bezel it's actually
bigger than the Nexus 7 but it looks a
little more stout because of the wider
bezel on the sides where the next it
looks really slim and long so I thought
it was a little small shorter but it's
actually not quite bigger but in
capacitance with the iPad you can see if
it's right down to MIT right in the
middle of DT iPads total screen so it
can fit right in between the bezel and
everything so just something just so you
can note the size differences here I
also wanted to to note that when you put
in your information it's interesting
that every time you power on the device
or wake it from sleep you have these
different little advertisements that
come up and I don't know if you can
change that I don't think that you a
mess on would allow it but well I'll let
you guys know in the review it's very
interesting um
no nobody really likes advertisements
that much so it's gonna be interesting
to know if you can take this off or not
but pretty much that wraps it up guys um
