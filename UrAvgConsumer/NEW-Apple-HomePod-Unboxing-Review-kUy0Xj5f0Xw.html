of the game it's time for dinner
what's going on guys the Travers
consumer and today we have the brand new
Apple home pod now this thing has been
getting a lot of press recently but I
got my hands on this a little bit early
so we're gonna do a quick unboxing so
you guys can know what's inside and this
thing is so so like look how small this
is
is it bad did you expect it to look like
this it is so much smaller than I
expected
now with this being an Apple product you
don't get much you get a couple of
stickers I'm assuming and okay you get a
sticker and some paperwork a QuickStart
guide and some warranty information but
for those of you who don't even know
what the home pot is this is pretty much
a smart speaker in a small compact body
it has Siri built into it so it'll be
able to answer your questions take
control of the apple homekit ecosystem
but we're gonna try all of those things
out in just a bit out there so we don't
need this box anymore so and this is
pretty much it this is the home pod
there's not much to it it's got a really
tiny form factor one thing to note
though is that the power cable is
actually built into it so this is not
something that you can just attach is
built into it and it looks pretty long
from what I can see yeah this is the
cable it's got some pretty decent length
to it and it's actually covered in this
cloth like materials now one thing I do
want to do is compare it to the other
smart speakers that are out right now
just to give you guys a size comparison
and in the world of smart home speakers
that have voice assistance that can
control your smart home products and I
can answer any questions play music you
asked for it these are the things you're
gonna be looking at we've got the Amazon
Alexa this is the second generation of
course the home pod is over here and
we've got the Google home max but yeah
this is just a quick size comparison so
you guys didn't see the best speaker
that each of these companies offers and
how they stack up in size but now it's
time to go ahead and set this thing up
and show you guys all the different
features that it has alright guys so
here we've got our home pod this is a
little setup that I've got going on for
it right now
right now you'll see that it has
white light that's blinking at the very
top that's indicating that it is ready
to get paired and just like anything
that has a w1 chip like the Apple
earpods or the Beats Studio wireless 3
you can just get your phone next to it
and then you should see a little
indicator showing that it's ready to get
set up so here we've got it here tap the
button and we can indicate where we
actually have it so this is we'll call
it the living room continue or enable
personal requests we of course want Siri
on here agree the terms and conditions
all the good stuff transfer our settings
and that guy's is pretty much the setup
process now something that's pretty cool
about the home pod is that it can detect
where it's placed so there's no need to
find the optimal placement for it so
some people I probably I guess I touched
it by accident so if it's against a wall
it'll be able to detect that if it's got
things near it detects that as well and
then it sends the audio directly towards
you in the best way possible after its
analysis that was great is that there's
no special setup process for this it's
constantly doing it with the aah and it
does it within a few seconds now one
good thing about having Siri built into
the home pod is that it of course can
read the messages on your iPhone and
notifications so I can say something
like hey Siri do I have any new text
messages you have a new message from
Mary of the game yes when you want to
say give me 15 more minutes
your reply to Terry says give me 15 more
minutes ready to send it yes no that's
awesome because I don't even have my
phone nearby so being able to tell sunna
to send off a message like that is super
convenient and what's great about that
is I don't even have to put down the
controller to do it so just bought
myself 15 more minutes okay so this is
pretty much how I would use a speaker
while I'm working getting footage I'd
have some music playing in the back
what's great here is I don't have to
pull out a phone or anything I can just
kind of speak to
theory and have her place of music for
me so I can say something like hey Siri
play this year's Grammy nominees
playlist the 60th Grammy Awards nominees
now playing can you feel that that's
clean let's clean audio right there hey
Siri set volume to 80% that's impressive
hey Siri pause now what was pretty
interesting is that you guys saw that
Siri listened to me at 80% volume I'm
gonna test it out and see if she can
hear me out 100% she's got six
microphones built into her so she can
pick up my voice even though some loud
music is playing so let's see if that
works
hey Siri set volume to 100% hey Siri
pause nice nice when we're talking to
our Amazon echo we usually have to yell
over her to make sure that she can hear
me
so that is awesome cuz I wasn't even
close to it and she still heard me oh
you're a Lexus system I'm glad I can
help she did not have now the home pod
also acts as a home kit hub so that
means you can activate any home kit
enable smart home device like lights or
your locks so I can say something like
hey Siri activate kitchen kitchen you
got it
I actually use these colors for another
video but I can say hey Siri activate
kitchen time kitchen time and now and
now we're back to some normal lighting
and now this is what you call a scene
with an home kit if you have a bunch of
home kit enabled devices you can set
them up to activate and do different
things like change different colors or
turn on or turn off whenever you have
your scene set up so you can go down
into the app and actually customize that
but you can do it based on whatever
have available to you so I've been using
the home pod for about a week now and I
know the big question is is it actually
worth picking up well if you're not on
an iOS device you don't even have to
consider it because it will not work for
you
the home pod only works with iOS devices
so whether that's an iPhone iPad or even
an iPod Touch those are the only devices
that it's compatible with and will allow
you to set it up which is pretty
unfortunate because I think this is an
awesome speaker with some great sound
quality technology and hardware inside
of it but it isn't compatible with
everything so it really does limit who
can actually use it but if you do have
an iOS device that's compatible with it
I think you can expect the same Apple
experience that you do with most of
their products something that's really
easy to get into works really well and
obviously has some awesome hardware to
go with it and you guys were able to see
how quick and simple the setup process
was how impressed I was with the overall
sound quality and even how well those
mites work when the music was blaring at
100% still picked me up with no problem
and even being in a completely different
room Siri was able to hear me which was
a little freaky but it goes to show how
good those mics are and that only can
control the home pop through voice
commands but there's also a touch panel
at top with volume controls and you can
even hold down the sensor to call up
Siri and well I personally think the
hardware on the home pot is top-notch -
the exclusion of an aux port it does
lack a bit in the software Department
and as you'd expect Siri is the voices
system for the home pod but this is more
like a watered-down version of Siri than
the one you're used to on your phone for
instance if you're big on using your
online calendar Siri won't be able to
check any events that you have coming up
or make any new ones which is kind of
puzzling considering it's Siri
that's what series all about really just
being that personal assistant but you're
not able to do that with the home pod
just yet but I'm absolutely sure that
that's something that's gonna be coming
out with a future software update
there's just a little bit surprising
that we're not seeing this feature with
the launch
I give Google home the same slack for
not being able to check calendars as
well that came with a future update so
there's no surprise that there's gonna
be one coming for the home pod now
something that I like about the home pod
is that you can ask it to read or answer
some of your text messages but one thing
that was kind of surprising was the fact
that you can't actually ask Siri to go
ahead and make a call for you
I think of course we'll come in a future
update but that would have been nice to
have it launched as well and from what I
can tell
Apple focused on creating something that
excels at its primary function which is
playing music the home pod does that
very well while still having smart
functionality but in order to take
advantage of the home pod and all of its
greatness you are going to need to be
pretty deep in the Apple ecosystem from
having an iOS device to set it up and
get it paired with so also using the
Apple music listening service you can of
course see music from other streaming
services over to the home pod but you
won't be able to call it Siri and have
it play music from something like
Spotify but as of you guys watching this
right now the home pod is officially
available at 350 bucks and somebody who
loves audio I really like what Apple did
with this thing the engineering that
went into it to make you sound like this
and to be able to be placed anywhere
whatever you want and get the best sound
quality out of it it's really impressive
so if you're looking for a smart speaker
that looks good doesn't take up a lot of
space it has amazing sound quality this
is something to take a look at that is
if you're on iOS let me know also
comment down below if you plan on
picking one up if you guys want to see a
comparison video between the home pod
the Amazon echo and the Google home let
me know by hitting that like button down
below and I'll catch you guys in the
next one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
