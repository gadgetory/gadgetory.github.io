consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real tender life with the
Galaxy S ten plus now if you've never
seen one of my real day in the life
videos you're pretty much gonna be
spending a day with me and the phone now
we're gonna see what it's like to use
the phone in the real world test out
things like the camera performance
battery life everything you need to know
and then some but we got to give a huge
shout out to today's sponsor t-mobile
for making this entire video possible
and it's crazy because I've been using
t-mobile for like 14 years now they're
the network that I use for all of my
real being the live videos whenever I
swap out my SIM card
I'm on the t-mobile network and there
are fast and reliable network which is
why I've stuck with them for so long
but let's see how the phone does in the
real world alright guys so we are
starting our day it is currently 9:52
a.m. and we've got a lot planned today
but first and foremost this is the
front-facing camera on the galaxy s 10
we're shooting in 4k which is a first
for smartphone front-facing camera so
I'm happy to be shooting this in 4k
finally and this is also the mic quality
you can come to expect from it but we've
got a lot planned today guys we got to
go do some videos I'm also getting my
car wrap today so it's gonna be a pretty
interesting day but it's going to be a
long one so we'll see if the battery can
keep up with us I think right now it is
currently at 93% I was browsing on
social media for a bit too long this
morning but let's get our day started
alright guys now let's talk about
getting into the phone and you might
know there are a couple of different
ways to get in here
there's a built-in fingerprint scanner
right here at the bottom so you can just
press there boom you're in and it's
pretty quick you can even use it when
it's off and you get right in or
something that's built into the phone I
gotta say there's no real complaints
there it's nice and simple
no more pressing something on the back
boom not super super fast but it's more
than adequate so in the top right corner
you'll see that that thing scans for the
face it's actually pretty quick not as
fast as like the oneplus but it is
definitely good enough now when it comes
to the feel in the hand even for a plus
model this actually feels pretty
comfortable to use it's not a heavy
phone even though it feels very solid
and still pretty
it doesn't feel too heavy which is nice
the 10 and the 10
those feel a lot more comfortable since
you can palm those with no problem but
for a plus model I still feel like this
looks and feels pretty good
now one thing though if you guys I don't
know if you guys will really be able to
see it but the prism white version even
though it's white you can still see
those fingerprints and this might be a
better angle for you guys to see those
fingerprints you can see them right
there with the light yeah I wouldn't
deter anyone from getting prism white
because of this but I know I'm just
crazy okay so like I said before we are
about to go get my baby all wrapped up
protect this paint and we have some
options over here
I got a pic which one I want before I
get there and I think I might enlist
some of you guys to help me make that
decision I probably go on like Instagram
live or something and get your thoughts
no I need everyone's thoughts alright
guys so we're headed over there but
right now we are going to be using the
GPS to get there since it's like in New
York we've got 80% battery left and
we've got an hour and 18 minutes rive so
we've got some time ahead of us we'll
see how the GPS impacts the battery life
see how goes our of driving yay okay so
we completed our trip and that was an
hour and 13 minutes of driving and we
are now at 66% so it's a good 14% hit
that's a long drive though I guess now
is a good time to jump on and scream
live alright so we're in like Long
Island I've never been here before but I
am happy that we've got full bars in
terms of our service on the t-mobile
network so little quick speed test see
what we're working with and now let's do
this
oh please are you kidding me what you
know these speeds are crazy
83 megabits down 78 right now oh this is
more than enough upload speeds are what
really matters and we've got nineteen
point four so we are good to go live so
let's do this check in connection
no live yo yo yo yo what's going on guys
hey sup I just love that once the live
starts you see hearts start pouring and
it's like the ultimate love but what's
going on guys right now we're doing a
real danger life with the what is this
phone yes 10 plus No I gotta ask you
guys your opinion I'm going to be
wrapping the Tesla so I want to know
what you guys think what's rap I should
go with so I'm gonna swap the is that
iris s hello she's Manning the camera
right now alright so let's see guys what
your opinions are this is the gloss
metallic gray and we also have this guy
this is the gloss anthracite
so which one metallic grey or anthracite
Oh left or right yeah let's make a make
a simple left or right guys okay a lot
of people stay in left you guys just
reassured me re Aires the one who threw
this one in and I picked this one but
you know I wanted to give her a fair
shot okay but alright guys I just wanted
to jump in real quick
by the way am i coming in clearly for
you guys what's the quality like no but
nobody's complaining about it being
choppy at all or anything so but alright
guys I'm going to jump out sorry to make
this so quick but like I said I am right
at the shop and we need to go get this
rap picked out and selected so thank you
all for your help you guys are amazing
so many people saying the quality is
good alright I got that good data
connection right now what till next
video guys video all right later y'all
okay so that worked out really well
everyone said the quality of the stream
was great I got my answer I know which
color I'm going to go with for my rap
let's do this shall we shall we okay
guys so since this will be the last time
I'll probably see Killa as it is right
now
I want to get some pictures we'll test
out the rear cameras on the s10 plus and
you know see what the quality is like we
have three different lenses to work with
so we'll get a variety of shots
unfortunately Killa isn't in the best of
shape right now in terms of being clean
but as it gets wrapped it'll get washed
I wasn't too worried about it but I got
to make these memories so let me get the
camera out oh man this is such a such a
good-looking car mmm now what I'm really
interested in is the wide-angle lens
right here okay so oh the wide-angle
lens my goodness you get so much in this
hot Wow
so it's a crazy difference between the
wide-angle shot and the regular wide you
get a lot more in your shot guys but
that aside let's take a look at the
detail here and as i zoom in em and
we're really getting really sharp photos
so that is really really nice and you
can see the HDR in effect here where
we've got the sky in the back and we
even have dark shadows on the car but
you still see it all pretty clearly so
this is actually a really impressive job
done by the s10 plus okay
so I guess time to take her in look yeah
I'm going to say less I feel your wrap
and shout out to marques for putting me
on two phenomenal vinyl they are the
ones who are going to be taking care of
this guy YouTube videos help they really
do all right so we got Ari taking a
selfie over here
so thoughts I think it looks really good
and I never liked anything about my
iPhone selfies well this is really nice
oh you look sharp Doug see oh my poor
okay okay guys so now we're in an uber
I'm officially Carles left my car behind
it's gonna get rapped but I wanted to
watch some video while I wait to get
back home it's a pretty long ride but I
figured I'd throw an awesome video I
know Austin shot some content and HDR
and you upload it on YouTube and so I'm
gonna take advantage of the HDR display
that the s10 has so I've selected the
max resolution that we can watch on this
phone and it's all an HDR this is a
beautiful video Austin and his crew
really killed it and on this display it
looks nice man it's adaptive brightness
on right now what's going on this is
kind of weird
it's like going brighter on its own so
this looks really good but we are seeing
some weird behavior with the brightness
I don't have auto brightness on but I am
seeing the brightness shift like crazy
yeah I'm not seeing anything that would
interfere with it but there's definitely
something going on here now I'm not sure
if it's because this is HDR content I'm
gonna do a little research and see if
that's something that happens if it
messes with the screen but there is some
weird behavior but I will say the
dynamic range on the screen though it's
so good hi guys so quick check-in it is
726 p.m. we got 36% of battery left and
in terms of the screen on time we're
looking at I honestly hate looking in
the menu for this thing the menu has
changed so much so things are a little
bit harder to find I feel like okay the
Vice care such a weird spot so 4 hours
and 3 minutes of screen on time
which is actually pretty good so I'm
sure we're gonna hit at least that
five-hour mark probably get close to six
hours so I'm actually pretty happy with
a battery life so far four thousand one
hundred million power battery is what
you expect I thought we've been pretty
lucky with the service right now
this area has awesome service so I'm
able to do this multiplayer game that
usually disconnects but right now I'm
actually playing with no problem now I
have a set catalogue of games that I use
to test out performance and there are
usually two components on whether or not
those games will perform well that's the
hardware as well as the internet
connection honestly I've never really
had any issues because I've used
t-mobile for all of my real day in the
life so that's never been a problem and
the other part being hardware depends on
the phone but at least I know Internet
wise since I'm using t-mobile I'm always
pretty good and as of right now the s 10
plus the thing is gonna give me any
issues on my gaming this is handling
like a champ as you'd expect from a
Samsung phone coming out this year okay
guys so now you're gonna lie to you
knocked out right after we ate so it is
pretty late it's 3:15 in the morning we
got about nine percent battery left
let's see what our screen on time is so
we've got about five hours and six
minutes of screen on time so the standby
time actually gave it quite a hit but as
you guys can see I'm pretty much gonna
end the day here and I'm gonna be using
this for more than just today so I'll
give you guys my final wrap-up right
after this and that about wrapped up my
day guys now the S 10 plus is an amazing
phone I am absolutely in love with it
some quirks here and there but my
overall experience was a very positive
one honestly think that this is just a
really good looking phone I wasn't too
sure about that whole cut out for the
cameras up front but they don't really
get in the way I really have no issue
with them all the text that was in that
information has been moved over to the
left a bit to the side of it so
everything still looks good it really
doesn't get in the way but I will say
when watching content instead of having
that cutout in the top left corner I
like to turn the phone around to have it
in the bottom right
it makes content watching a little bit
easier that hole doesn't become as
noticeable as it is in the top-left so a
little pro tip for some of you guys
watch with the cameras in the bottom
right corner and honestly watching
content on this is a joy because they
have that new dynamic mm OLED display
and with that you of course get HDR 10
plus and they really keep that up and
that's with the S 10 plus so watching
content on this it is a joy I've been
using that prism white color and it is a
beautiful phone but you still notice
some fingerprints for those hawk-eyed
individuals like myself I do notice them
I still use a microfiber cloth on the
back but overall guys it is a beautiful
phone now I did say in the building the
light that it's pretty comfortable to
use which it is the overall size but I
will say though that it is slippery so I
suggest getting a case because with all
that glass you do not want to drop this
thing and have it shatter definitely get
a case even if you got to get a
transparent one to still see that nice
beautiful prism color and performance
wise come on guys this is a Snapdragon a
55 processor whatever you throw at it it
is going to handle it like a champ now
where I feel like I really got to see
the performance was when I was playing
games for long periods of time and the
battery started to get low usually
phones throttle and then the games start
lagging a bit but nonetheless it
performed well here even when getting
warm thankfully now another performer we
got to talk about is the camera the
cameras are so so good guys I've been
able to get some really sharp vivid
photos with this guy and thanks to that
ultra wide camera lens now when it comes
to low-light shots the phone performs
very well but if you're looking for a
nitesite kind of feature like we saw on
the pixel 3 the s10 does not have that
so you're gonna be a little bit
disappointed if you're looking for
something like that but the performance
overall when you're dealing with lower
light settings are gonna be just fine
now of course we got to talk about the
video quality because this cameras video
capabilities are insane
I wish we had access to the wide-angle
lens when recording video unfortunately
we don't but something that we do have
access to is super steady video with
that you can take really really great
shots while walking around and still get
really nice buttery smooth video I
tested this out myself and guys it is a
game-changer now software wise this
thing is buttery smooth
I find the menu to be a little bit more
confusing than it used to be before it
had a lot of stuff in the menu lots of
options to go through but now you have
to like kind of dig a bit deeper to find
certain settings so for me personally
I'm not too crazy about how the setting
menu looks now but it does look a lot
cleaner now in terms of battery life the
s10 plus performs just as I'd expect you
get about 5 to 6 hours of screen on time
and I even used it for like an hour and
change just straight up using the GPS
using Google Maps so I know that was
even more strenuous on it but for the
regular everyday usage this thing is
going to hold up like a champ 4,100
milliamp hours it is what you would
expect but one cool thing that the s-pen
does have when it comes to battery is
the wireless power share feature with
that you'll basically turn your s10 into
a wireless charging pad and it allow
other devices charge right on the back
of it and you don't have to worry this
thing isn't going to kill your battery
it will stop using it at about 30% so
under 30% you won't have access to that
feature so you don't have to worry about
leaving something on top of it and it
completely eating up the entire battery
life now let's talk about a couple of
the cool things I think Samsung added
that makes the overall experience using
the phone just a lot better one thing I
really like is the shot suggestion with
that the phone basically helps you get
the perfect framing for your shot so
you'd be able to get straight clean
photos that is something that I think a
lot of people could take advantage of
especially if you're not that great with
a camera that feature should help a lot
if you like the idea of creating your
own emoji Samsung has vastly vastly
improved the AR emoji they did a good
job cleaning it up so if you're
interested in customizing yours and
using it to chat with your friends there
are much better options provided within
u.s. tens and of course the phone has
fast gigabit LTE and you guys all have
in the real day-in-the-life how I was
able to take advantage of that with
t-mobile's networks I was getting some
insane speeds during my live stream and
even you guys said that the quality was
amazing so I'm very happy with the
performance here another thing that I
want to mention about t-mobile bet
personally really sits well with me is
the fact that I'm gonna be going abroad
and every time I go to another country I
don't ever have to worry about my data
plans
you get to G speeds but you still get
access to the Internet which is the most
important thing especially for someone
like me who's
on social media like crazy so I'm not
gonna lie guys I'm very happy to
actually be working with t-mobile on
this video I've been using them for over
a decade so it is great to finally team
up and do something on YouTube but the
burning question is do I recommend this
phone and the answer is a resounding yes
of course this is an amazing phone it is
one of the best all-around errs that you
can possibly get your hands on and even
though the s10 plus is a thousand bucks
in the world of today's flagships being
around that same price range I think it
is a really good pickup and if you don't
want to spend that kind of money there's
always the s10 II which is a two hundred
and fifty dollar savings but you still
get a very very similar phone just with
a couple of things missing but you
really can't go wrong with either one
but that about wraps it up for my video
guys hopefully you enjoyed it hopefully
this was able to help you if you enjoyed
it be the cool guy girl that gives this
video a thumbs up and I will catch you
guys in the next one till then it's your
average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
