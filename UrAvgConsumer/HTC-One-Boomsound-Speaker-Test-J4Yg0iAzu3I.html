consumer and today I've got a special
video for you guys it's another test and
today we're going to be testing the boom
sound speakers on the HTC One now the
HTC One has some amazing speakers I
think almost everyone loves them
so we're gonna see how it sounds in
different conditions indoors outdoors
maybe in a car
so let's not wasting time let's get
right into it the first thing we're
going to do is try the bloom sound
speakers indoors through a regular phone
conversation and just see what kind of
quality we get from it so here we have
it hey what's going on we have to think
we have to go today
I know I just got off work I'm kind of
tired support and be really emotional
the corner why not I think I need some
support myself right now and the quality
is pretty impressive when indoors just
being on the phone I don't think anyone
will have any trouble really hearing you
sounds really crisp and clear I had no
problem and hopefully the audio on this
video will be able to kind of
demonstrate it but take my word for it
it does sound pretty clear now we're
gonna try it out outdoors regular phone
conversation see how that goes
hey what's going on man
okay okay quick question for you
what happened are you using away
okay okay okay okay well there's a
little channel on YouTube called your
average consumer but I definitely think
you should check out they've got our
I've got I've got I've done a lot of
reviews on beats headphones but there's
a lot out there that people don't really
know about other brands like audio
technica stuff like that so I would say
give it a look some good stuff on that
channel and there you have file doors
it sounds pretty clear even though
you're outdoors where you know you're
able to hear less it sounds really
Korean crisp so definitely some good
stuff and now we're gonna still be
outdoors but inside of a car a lot of
people use their speakerphone inside of
cars so we're gonna try that out and see
how that goes you know the main one
forget you guys are losers nothing much
actually on the channel right now
recording for the speakers of the HTC
One
you know the boom sound trying it out in
a car setting some people use their
phones and cars
none of this would be possible bit of a
funny conversation there but as you guys
can see it did sound pretty good I
wasn't disappointed whatsoever and I
think for sound quality or call quality
at least when using the speaker you're
going to be very impressed I'm it's
definitely impressive when you're using
it for music listening or watching a
video and here's just a demonstration on
that with listening to some or watching
a YouTube video rather and here it is
indoors
and there you guys have it that was a
series of different tests to listen to
the speakers or the boomsound speakers
which are extremely impressive on the
HTC one and you got outdoors indoors in
a card all kinds of little scenarios and
like I said I'm very impressed and I'm
sure anyone who purchases this and
speakers are a big deciding factor for
you you're gonna be very happy here
so that's about it for my little average
consumer test and hopefully you guys
enjoyed it if you did please feel free
to rate comment and subscribe definitely
be sure to leave this video a thumbs up
if you enjoyed it and I'll catch you
guys in the next one till then it's your
average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
