consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the sennheiser hd25 1/2 so
let's not waste any time let's get right
into it all right guys here we have the
sennheiser hd25 1 - these are some
professional-grade headphones and
although I don't consider myself to be a
professional or audiophile I want to
give the average consumer who is looking
to upgrade to some professional
equipment some insight on these cans now
the hd25 have been around for some time
and have quite a good reputation
these monitor headphones are primarily
for studio and DJ use and they're often
referred to as reference headphones due
to having a pretty good balance in most
areas of sound but let's talk a bit
about the design and overall build with
these headphones the hd25 may not be as
flashy as some of the consumer targeted
headphones out there but that's ok
considering these are monitor headphones
that are intended to be used in the
studio or DJ booth they are made of a
plastic material but actually have a
surprisingly sturdy build quality now
the first thing you might notice about
these headphones is the headband now the
headband is actually pretty interesting
because it can actually split in two
being able to change and adjust the form
factor is one of my favorite things
about this headphone you're able to
adjust how wide or narrow the space
between the bands are with relative ease
this provides a pretty secure fit and
leaves you without worrying about it
slipping off all those flipping off may
not be much of a concern considering how
tight a fit you get around the ear cups
and speaking of the ear cups you have a
pretty interesting design where you have
the cables that go directly into the air
cuffs above them and if ever needed
these can be removed and replaced now
taking a look at the cushions of the ear
cups you'll see that this one is made up
of velour material and this comes with
the packaging although it wasn't the
standard ear cup material and I found
these to be a bit more pleasant and
comfortable to have on when listening to
music and here you'll see a standard ear
cushions that come with the headphones
they're made of a plethora SH material
and although I prefer the velour some
people have said that this is actually
very comfortable
and they've enjoyed it as well so I
really think it comes down to personal
preference and as I did mention before
this is for studio and DJ use so you've
got a rotating ear cut that can be
rotated on any side you can go from left
or right depending on how you want to
wear it but as I've come to notice like
with other DJ headphones these are
pretty tight ear cups and some might not
find that comfortable but this is done
on purpose it also features a double
wired cable and taking a look at the
input you can see that is a bit on the
larger side all those should work fine
with most mobile devices although by how
uniformly it fits with this quarter inch
adapter you can tell what these are
truly built for but because of how
portable it is it makes a great option
for taking this on the go as I mentioned
before these are very balanced pair of
headphones and what I mean by that is
that these don't overdo it in any
department when it comes to the sound
now of course sound quality is very
subjective so others may disagree but I
found that this hits right in the middle
without overdoing anything you would
think that the bass would be pretty weak
based on that kind of description but
it's actually pretty good
it won't rattle your brains by any means
but it's definitely still present this
wouldn't be my first pick for rap or
hip-hop but this does work well with
most genres and I find that electronic
music pop or rock even would do pretty
well with these headphones and with the
amount of detail that this provides no
wonder that it's geared towards studio
use these retail for about 250 but you
can find them on Amazon for about $200
and I think that's pretty good
considering the level of equipment that
you're getting here so if you're looking
to make that step into professional gear
you definitely have my recommendation
for these cans now of course I have to
show you guys what they look like on so
here's a look and all right guys it's
time to show you what these look like on
so here you have it
and of course I have it like this or you
can have a clothes like this either way
it's fine I personally like to have it
open a little bit gives it more of a
secure fit on your head and put those
details out there who use the earcup
feature like this you can swivel it up
and boom so there you have it guys
hopefully you enjoyed this review I
think these are some really great
headphones for those of you who are
looking for a professional pair some
studio monitors these are really great
these are renowned you can find reviews
everywhere that say these are like just
some really great headphones they're
considered legendary now for the average
consumer I'm not sure if it's something
you'd be interested in but there are
average consumers out there we just want
to know that they have the best quality
out there that they have a sound
professional pair of headphones even if
they necessarily aren't professionals
themselves but they want to have that
professional equipment so that's what
these are and if you're that one of
those people this is definitely a go for
you i really suggest it and that's about
it for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did please feel free
to rate comment and subscribe and i'll
catch you guys in the next video till
then is your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
