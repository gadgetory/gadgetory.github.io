consumer and today I have an unboxing of
the Bose QuietComfort 15 so QC 15 you
guys have been asking me about this for
months now and I finally decided I'll
pick up a pair that you guys know what I
think
so let's not wasting any time let's get
right into it alright guys so here we
have the Bose QC 15s like I said before
you guys have been asking for this for
months
and I finally decided to pick up a pair
this is my first product from Bose um
I've tried them out before in different
locations I know the noise cancelling on
this is pretty awesome but this is gonna
be pretty cool finally get this and open
it up for you guys so let's get to the
unboxing we've got some tape at the top
so I'm gonna use my unboxing knife here
slice that open I think that's the only
piece of tape and these do retail for
$2.99 95 so that's like what three
hundred bucks so it's not a cheap pair
of headphones whatsoever but considering
it's bolas that's not surprising inside
you have this headphone case and it's
wrapped up in plastic you've also got
some instructions and absorb warranty
information all that stuff and some
silica gel so we'll leave all the books
and all that in there let's put this box
to the side and
let's open this so not much you get in
the packaging really pretty simple stuff
not really hard to UM unbox at all this
is the case it's a nice soft pace the
back has a little pouch here it's got
this little hook so that you can hang it
like this and of course it says both
acoustic and always cancelling
headphones so let's open this up and
here we have them we've got let's see a
little pouch here at the top
I wonder if this can come along yeah
this actually can come off that's pretty
cool so we've got some courtesy cards
here and these are to kind of if people
ask you questions about them you can
kind of just give these out and they can
answer the questions themselves so I
mean that's consider it and here of
course we have the QC 15s very
minimalist design very small very
lightweight very very lightweight so
let's put the suicide first see what
else we got here now this is the one
that I don't know I think they both they
all come with inline remotes for Apple
products but mushy and inside the case
is like a lot of velcro you can pull
this thing off right here I guess is
where you can store some accessories and
cables and things like that so that's
pretty cool close this up take a look at
what we get inside of this we've got
some batteries I see so we've got your
airline adapter so that when you're on a
plane you can plug this in use your
headphones no problem we've got one
triple-a battery so you know these are
battery-powered let's see these are some
cables here but they're different kinds
so I'm gonna give you guys a quick
close-up and all right guys here we have
the 3.5 millimeter headphone cable and
over here we have the part that actually
goes inside the headphones and on it you
can see us as level high
low so I guess that's the kind of output
that is gonna give if you see here we
can plug it in just like this and boom
there you have it so this is one of the
two this is the one without the inline
remote as you can see it's a straight
cable so let's take a look at that one
with the inline remote alright guys so
pretty much this is the other one this
is the inline remote right here we've
got the play and pause in the middle
volume up and down over on the sides and
the back has the mic and everything else
about it is pretty much the same as the
other version without the inline remote
so that pretty much wraps this up
alright guys and here we have the actual
bose QC 15 let's take some of this
styrofoam off and I gotta say these are
some pretty soft headphones
I know these are supposed to be really
comfortable as I've already mentioned
they're lightweight very lightweight and
these are over the ears so your ears
will completely get inside and it's got
really deep crevice here so let me give
you guys a close-up of the actual
headphones alright guys so here we have
the bose QC 15s up close of course it
says quiet comfort at the bottom we've
got the on and off switch on the sides
and we have the little slot here to
throw in these inline remotes which I'll
just do right now and there you go so
it's a little more complete now you
still need to put in the battery but
what's really cool to me is that these
are over the ear headphones and it's got
a really deep crevice to get your ear
and I don't know if I can actually show
you guys how deep this is but let me see
if I can alright guys so now we have an
even closer close above the actual ear
cups and as you can see there's a lot of
space inside to allow your ears to sit
inside comfortably and I've never seen
ear cups that allow this much space
inside so it's gonna be interesting to
see how comfortable these are and let's
see if I can get the battery installs
here on the left thumb knob believes
it's the right side of it there's a
little compartment here you can kind of
just pull that open and let's see
even throw it in here and close it up
see if we get any okay and I'm cool yeah
we have some power you see the little
green light and that pretty much wraps
this up alright guys that pretty much
wraps up this unboxing was really quick
and simple not too much inside the
package and really easy to get through
so I'm going to have more videos on this
of course I'm going to be very
interested in seeing how the girlfriend
test works out with these since they're
they've got such crazy noise-cancelling
and I also can't wait to see what the
sound quality is likes and so many of
you are recommending that I try these
out so we'll see how that goes I'll let
you all know my review and the
girlfriend test video how they work how
they fare so alright guys this has been
the Bose QC 15 summer average consumer
if you like this video please feel free
to rate comment and subscribe and I'll
catch you guys in the next one till then
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
