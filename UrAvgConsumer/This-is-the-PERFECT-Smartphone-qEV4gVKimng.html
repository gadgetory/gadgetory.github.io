average consumer and a couple of weeks
ago I asked you guys over on Instagram
and Twitter what your perfect smartphone
would look like what did it be made of
what it could do and thankfully we've
got this awesome guy on the team who can
make these concept renders so you could
see what some of your dream phones would
look like in the real world and first up
we've got this wish list from a man
Joshua over on Twitter so he wanted a
completely bezel as 4k display SLR
quality camera wireless charging as well
as USB type-c connectivity Google OS
which I'm assuming is Android he wants
his hybrid processor of snapdragons 845
chip as well as Apple's a 11 Bionic chip
and all that has to go on a 5.5 inch
display while still rocking the
headphone jack my man not to mention he
also wants a fingerprint scanner as well
as Dolby speakers all on a four
millimeter thick body if only this were
physically possible but nonetheless
let's take a look at what it looks like
right off the bat this thing is dope
it's completely bezel is which gives it
an edge to edge display which means
you'll feel like you're literally
holding whatever content you're watching
in your hands especially since it's got
a 4k display now the backs a bit busy
with all of the requests made but here's
what's going on we've got a glass back
for wireless charging while still having
that USB type-c port and we've also got
two Dolby speakers in the back not the
ideal location for speakers I know but
we have to put it in the back since we
have that completely bezels display
you'll also find a fingerprint scanner
back here but what's amazing is the SLR
quality camera we decided if we're gonna
give a true SLR quality we got to give
it SLR quality lenses now I know you're
not gonna want to have this big
protruding lens whenever you throw the
stay in your pocket so it's going to
have a built-in cover so that it can
protect the sensor detachable lenses for
a smartphone would be a really cool
thing to see in the future and when the
chipset that this thing is packin it'll
easily be one of the most powerful
Android phones on the market but one
thing I think that's pretty interesting
about this phone is that you wanted a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack on a four
millimeter body that is like so
impossible and I'm telling you guys we
got some really crazy requests one guy
wanted computer parts inside of his
smartphone which is impossible
but we did it anyway so my mana might
one in a 4k 144 Hertz screen with a
Verizon seven to seventy X processor SLI
GTX 1080p is 16 gigs of ram a 1 gig SSD
a 6 inch bezel as display USB type-c
connectivity a headphone jack wireless
charging a 100,000 milliamp hour battery
passive cooling full windows 10 support
you know just the basics he says here's
what we did so we have to give Mike a
beautiful 6 inch phone with a 4k bezel
is displayed running at 144 Hertz so if
you're gonna be gaming on this thing
this thing is gonna look amazing you
also have the USB type-c port on the
bottom as well as that headphone jack
which I love to see obviously and if a 6
inch 4k bezel is display running at 144
Hertz
was it a marvel on its own we had to go
and throw in 2 NVIDIA GTX 1080 T eyes in
SLI which changes the entire dynamic of
this phone we even threw in that rise in
2700 X processor so if you're trying to
do gaming then you got it you win and
the thingies even has a 100,000 milliamp
hour battery I don't know if Mike's
trying to take this thing into space and
never come back
but you've got the juice to do it this
thing is just insane so of course when
you have a body like this you can't just
hold this thing normally it's like
holding a brick so we even made a little
cutout for the back of the display so
you can just throw your hand in there
it's got a nice little pouch so you can
be comfortable when you're holding it
now even conceptualizing this whole
thing wasn't easy and making it work and
a form factor that works with a smart
phone not not an easy task but this is
what it would look like you got this
whole structure on the back of your
phone obviously you gotta give'm
portability and size here if you want
all that power this is obviously a
two-handed device
I can't imagine you trying to take
selfies but this is your idea man this
is what you wanted and with full
windows10 support this is easily the
most powerful mobile device ever
good job now moving on we've got another
pretty interesting suggestion coming
from Instagram the perfect smartphone
would be like with super element OLED
display most probably with a TV or 10 GB
RAM the iMac ethnical processor the 10
GB RAM but the color of the smart should
not be fixed they should be option to
change the colors like we can we could
change to black white blue green
whatever we want
now this was more of a spec heavy phone
with a ton of crazy space that we see on
the iMac Pro and some crazy battery life
but what was interesting in the design
aspect was the fact that you wanted to
change the colors of the overall phone
which got me thinking with this kind of
phone with what you're requesting it
would be really cool to see a phone that
has a little dial on the side that
changes the entire back of the phone so
that you can change the color just like
you wanted whenever you want so whenever
you feel like switching up the look of
your phone you want to change those
colors like you said all you got to do
is hit that dial and boom you're able to
change between all the colors that are
available so if you feeling like blue
black white teal you can do that with
just the turn of a dial now this one was
actually kind of interesting because the
guys thinking what could actually make
this work technology wise a screen being
the back of your phone was the only
logical thing that we could think of but
at the end of the day we decided to just
go with magic and computer rendering and
boom that's what we got now in the spec
side of things this thing is an absolute
beast we're using iMac pro parts so of
course it makes sense that this thing
would be a monster so that is actually a
very interesting concept I'd be happy to
look to the day where that actually
existed now we got to see a bunch of
your phones but here's my list my
personal creation on what I think would
be the perfect smartphone for me now in
terms of the overall design I'd go with
the iPhone tens body I really like the
way this thing is but I would change a
little bit here what I would do is I
would change up the sides so that it's a
bit flatter instead of as round as it
currently is just so that I can have a
bit more grip and of course I would
change up that display I would get rid
of the knotch
of course you know I would do that so
it'd be a bezel list display I'm fine
with a little black border around my
screen
to edge I'm not super crazy about that
so like how Apple does their screen just
get rid of the knotch
and of course I'm not gonna not have
front-facing cameras and taking the key
from the vivo apex I'd have a pop-up for
my camera so that I could have all of
its sensors and the lens right there and
you have this nice little door that it
comes out of I think that would be
really really cool
me personally I don't use my
front-facing camera that often at all so
I'm okay with it being tucked away and
hidden especially if that means I'm
going to be getting a full display on my
phone now one thing about this phone
you'll notice there's no cutouts for
speakers or anything like that
and that's because I actually wanted to
go with the technology that Sony uses in
their TVs the newest TV line I don't
believe they have any speakers there
this screen actually vibrates and that's
what creates the sound I think there
might be some phones out there that have
that technology as well I know the vivo
apex as well also carries that idea in
its concept but I think that's what
would make the most sense in terms of an
aesthetically pleasing phone that still
has a full display and pretty decent
sound quality like I said overall this
is the iPhone tens body with a few
changes the camera now is the Google
pixel tools camera because that is the
camera to beat it's the best smartphone
camera on the market right now so that's
what we've got over there that's the
camera I want on my phone but when you
look a little bit lower something
interesting that you'll see is the Apple
logo now the Apple logo here is going to
be RGB backlit so that I can change
colors depending on whatever color you
want I think that would look really cool
and I would love for it to double as a
fingerprint scanner now I am completely
fine with touch ID over face ID for me
and touch ID was just always a bit
faster so I want that here as the main
source of getting into my phone and
having it on that Apple logo that's the
best place to put it honestly right
there on the back on the logo it's
perfect now of course you know I'm gonna
bring back the headphone jack on my
phone and next to that is actually a USB
type-c port but I wanted to go
Thunderball 3 because why not those
apples big thing with their computers
has Thunderbolt connectivity I decided
why not bring that over to the phone and
it uses a USB type-c shape so that I can
charge it up with all of the MacBook
charges I have around so it would just
make my life a lot easier and speaking
of charging and of course would have
fast wireless charging a four thousand
milliamp hour battery would be perfect
for me
what makes this phone really special to
me is the switch here on the top right
corner with this guy you'll see that it
has a white side which gives me access
to iOS and when I hit the switch it goes
over to the green side which gives me
Android best of both worlds on one
device I think that would be amazing
being able to swap between the two call
it boot camp call it whatever you want
but having both OSS on this device so I
don't have to carry around two different
bones would be amazing I always carry
around an iOS device and an Android
device but having it all in one that'd
be a game-changer but that's what I
would want if you guys can make your own
dream phone let me know what the comment
down below tell me which one was your
favorite
she shoutout to J for making all of the
renders these things were amazing I'm
glad this video could come together it
took weeks and weeks of planning and
getting everything right so huge shout
out to the people who submitted their
ideas I really appreciate it
but this was fun hopefully you guys
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy
girl that gives video a thumbs up
definitely gives a thumbs up this was a
lot of work for Jane man but so the next
one guys hopefully you enjoyed it peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
