consumer and it's been a while since
I've done an unboxing video so I figured
when I bring them back with one of
Samsung's latest phones and that is the
Samsung Galaxy s6 so let's not waste any
time scare right into it by my side
and all right guys here we have the
Samsung Galaxy s6 I do have the 32
gigabyte model and I did get this with
t-mobile I'm taking a quick look around
the box there's nothing too special but
the back does have some specs for us to
read off so this is 4G LTE capable it's
got a 64-bit octa-core processor a 5.1
inch quad HD Super AMOLED display 16
megapixel rear facing camera five
megapixel front facing can be charged
wirelessly yada yada yada
alright so enough of the boring specs
you guys want to see this phone so let's
open it up so we can just slide this out
I'll throw this in the back here and
we've got some tape on the sides so I
will be using my unboxing knife and here
we have it so let's pop this thing open
we've got some tape on the side so I'm
going to start with this and some over
here boom so now set this down and put
the unboxing knife away now to open this
up let's see we'll just take this off
and boom here it is now just looking at
it from the front straight up it looks
like a Galaxy s5 but I'm sure yes once I
take it out that it'll look very
different man this looks really good Wow
Samsung definitely stepped up their game
in the design department and it kind of
looks like an iphone but we'll get to
that in a second we'll put this to the
side a some card stuff for the sim and
blah blah blah let's see what else we
get inside the packaging so this I'm
guessing is a Start Guide let's see what
we get inside here there's definitely
paperwork so let's see what kind of
booklets we get so we've got your Start
Guide accessory guide advertisements for
milk music warranty and safety
some recycling stuff and some return
policy information so we'll put all that
paperwork to the side because we're not
reading any of that and let's see we've
got your wall adapter this is how you
charge it up and your USB cable now this
isn't a 3.0 USB device anymore they went
for a regular standard USB and they do
have fast charging in this phone so
that's what this is going to do I
believe that the fast charging they'll
get you four or five hours of use within
like five ten to fifteen minutes so
that's some pretty crazy stuff but uh
yeah and we've also got a sim ejector
here so you've got everything you need
to get this thing started up and it does
of course come with some earbuds these
are some decent looking earbuds it kind
of reminds me of the ear pods the shape
here that's hilarious
but it wouldn't be Samsung if it did it
now let's put this stuff away and let's
take a look at the phone because I'm
pretty excited to see that
alright so tables cleaned up accessories
are put away and the phone is in hand
and I don't really have to do anything
but slip it right out and man this thing
feels nice Wow it that Samsung hats off
to you you made a device that feels
premium I am stoked this is nice guys it
reminds me of the galaxy s5 the front
does for sure but it's like a mix
between the galaxy s5 and an iPhone 6 I
got to say it and hey maybe some iPhone
4 in there as well with this glass back
but let's see if this thing has any
juice let's boot it up or actually
before I even boot it up let me give you
a tour around the actual device on your
left side you've got your volume rockers
your up and down the bottom you have
your 3.5 millimeter headphone jack your
micro USB charging port and your speaker
and on the right side you'll have your
sim tray so that you can insert your
nano SIM as well as a power button the
top has an infrared sensor so that you
can control your TV and do all kinds of
Samsung stuff with Samsung
and in the back of course you got your
16 megapixel camera with your LED flash
and it says Samsung Galaxy s6 at the
bottom and I am really impressed guys
I'm really impressed I love the way this
looks and feels uh I definitely only
feel like this needs a case cuz of all
this glass but I don't want to put a
case on this thing looks great as it is
but of course up top we've got your five
megapixel front facing camera and this
actually records in higher than 1080p I
think it recorded up to 1440 so that's
going to be pretty awesome
you've got your sensors up top of course
and at the bottom you've have your home
button as well as your back and your
recent apps button now what's cool about
this home button is that it's no longer
a scan a fingerprint scanner like it
used to be you don't have to scan it
anymore now you kind of just place your
finger on it and it should work
similarly to the touch ID so that's
going to save a lot of time but enough
of the device tour let's actually turn
it on and see if we've got some juice
now while it's booting up I do want to
ask you guys what do you want to see as
far as videos on this device you've got
some t-mobile jingle for you but yeah
let me know I'm courting I'm gonna have
a review and all that good stuff but if
you want to see anything special
anything that maybe you're not seeing on
other channels or maybe you want to see
my spin on certain things let me know to
comment down below and I will get to
those kind of videos so we're gonna
start this off we're going to turn on
some Wi-Fi what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna set this up with Wi-Fi login all
that good stuff and then I'm going to
show you guys what it's like when you
first go through the menus and alright
guys so we're all set up and this is the
galaxy s6 this is what it looks like it
looks and feels great I'm so in love
with this device right now as on first
impressions any way that it's going to
be an easy transition for me to go from
my Nexus 6 to the s6 and speaking of if
you guys want to see some comparison
maybe to the Nexus 6 or maybe the iPhone
6 or 6 plus let me know what a comment
down below as well so I can know which
phones you want to see this compared to
but yeah so far I am loving this thing
this thing just feels great this feels
like what Samsung should have been doing
it for a long time now what just going
through it this is of course Android
lollipop so it's the latest version and
you know you've got some a couple of
apps on here not too much bloatware but
I see that it's got some Microsoft stuff
a couple of Samsung things as well and
of course a bunch of Google Apps but so
far guys first impressions I am blown
away I love this and the form factor
feels great feels good in the hand like
I said I'm used to carrying the Nexus 6
and the iPhone 6 plus around so this is
going to be a nice change of pace with a
much smaller device a lot more
comfortable but that's about it guys I
just wanted to give you a quick unboxing
so you can know what you get in the
packaging as well as what you get expect
when you get your hands on it like I
said my first impressions of this are
really really good
I probably fanboy it a bit from the
design and the feel of it but that's ok
because I do like the way this feels and
looks but yeah that's about it guys let
me know in the comments down below what
kind of videos you want to see on this
new phone and I'll catch you guys in the
next one stay tuned for the Samsung
Galaxy s6 edge unboxing that's gonna be
pretty awesome as well but till next
video guys ravish consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
