average consumer and MSE es2015 and the
new Z board is here and you guys know I
had to check that out so let's not waste
any time let's get right into it so this
is the Z board - there's a blue and a
pro model and I actually got a chance to
ride the blue model so Z board improved
a bunch of different things on the Z
board - and even the blue base model
version is much better than the Z board
Pro it has a top speed of 20 miles per
hour it has a 16 mile range weighs only
16 pounds which is amazing comparison to
the 25 pounds that the original Z board
had it also has handles on both sides so
you can carry it with either hand and
you also have some super new wheels so
you'll be riding much faster and one of
my favorite things with the Z board - is
the improved charge time not only takes
90 minutes to charge it to max which is
amazing in comparison to the 5 hours
that the original took and God I'm glad
that they changed that so we took the Z
board - to downtown Las Vegas and you
guys already know that I'm a pro on the
Z board now and I had a smooth smooth
time it did take some getting used to
the smaller frame on the Z board but a
couple of minutes and I was cruising now
it is much faster and the shape of the
foot pads just makes more sense it gives
you more control for brakes and
acceleration and leads to a much better
experience now Z board did listen to
some feedback and added a couple of
features that you guys have been asking
for one of those being the new battery
indicator right on the front of the Z
board the indicator changes color to let
you know when your battery's gonna die
on you and that way you're not gonna get
stranded now another thing that you guys
have been asking for is for this thing
to be splash proof and that's what
they've added here as well now this is
coming out later this year but I was
able to check it out early and if you
guys enjoyed this beautiful guy that
gives it a thumbs up and if you want to
see some of the behind-the-scenes stuff
of how this video was shot go over and
over to John's channel and he has an
awesome video of how everything went
down but hopefully you guys enjoyed this
and definitely stay tuned for more
coverage from me I'll catch you guys in
the next video till then it's your
average consumer
