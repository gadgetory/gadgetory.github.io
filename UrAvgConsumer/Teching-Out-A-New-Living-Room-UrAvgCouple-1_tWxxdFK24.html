currently in Aries parents home yeah
welcome to my Brooklyn home the home
that I grew up in and my parents are not
here right now they're on a cruise for
my dad's birthday
I yeah they do this every year they go
on this cruise for his birthday but this
year we decided for a birthday gift we
would check out the living room yes I
know I was all on board for that oh my
gosh he spearheaded this whole thing so
my dad the live room was like my dad's
special place when he comes home from
work the man came yeah that's like his
place and he just like stays here for
hours my mom runs upstairs she has like
a whole makeup room and everything so
hit this his place and we decided to
take it out for his birthday
so pretty much I'm going to be giving
him a similar setup to what I've got
going on at home he's got an Xbox one
Kinect as well as the Amazon echo hi
Maggie
Madison so the Amazon echo and we've got
a couple of things to work with the echo
so he can kind of come home and tell
Alexa to turn on all the lights and you
know different kinds of stuff so that's
gonna be really cool and he's got the
nest smoke detector and he's got a
couple of nest products so that'll be
kind of building up to this for little
gifts from birthday and Father's Day
yeah so with all that he's got a little
ecosystem going so that's gonna be
pretty cool we've got some stuff some
like smart switches that can work with
the Amazon echo he can just speak to it
and have it turn anything he wants on
which is really cool
a digital frame so that you know can see
pictures of the family and all that good
stuff we've got the LG musicflow
surround sound system so he's going to
be using that to get all his audio from
his television or Xbox whatever he wants
to do and or phones since this bluetooth
really cool either way we've got the
Philips hue bulbs which is also going to
be working with the Alexa one of the big
things that I wanted this living room to
have so that he can just control it with
that and what else do we have some
stands of course to kind of give these
little speakers some surround sound
placements and some lamps for the
Phillip Hughes stuff and he's also got
this Samsung 50
Vince uh Smart TV this is actually the
one that we had previously we gave it to
him cuz a couple of months ago and he
never took advantage of it yeah my dad
is really strange he insists on like
saving things but I always tell him you
cannot save tech it goes out of stuff
very quickly just enjoy it so we are
just going to push him into this and put
it up ourselves so you could just use it
so we're going to be taking down his old
Samsung 55 inch plasma TV check them
bezels guys okay but we're going to be
taking this guy down and throwing up the
new one and it should be a good time so
we came in to CBS to get some extension
cables for the setup but lo and behold
we're looking at makeup surprise
surprise
Harry is on a new phase guys you know
some time has passed so a new face has
come and she refreshed free yeah she is
the rishis revisiting her makeup place
she I started YouTube channel and be
sure to subscribe to your average
girlfriend she's taking forever
somebody hug so check this out re got
Chloe my costume for Halloween
she is a hot dog what a cute hot dog
she's like thinking of ways to kill us
if only I could get out of this bun all
right guys so after what took all day
actually which really all day it's about
3:00 in the morning right now she's
moving on and we're done um so knockout
we fell asleep on the couch and woke up
sort of a mess excuse my hair but yeah
anyway check it out it's like our life
so we've got the sound bar hooked up
here Xbox Kinect and here is a this a
new Samsung TV obviously those nasty
bezels are gone so hooray
so what else do we have here we've got
the the speakers here for the surround
sound system of the LG musicflow so
those are on these stands that I picked
up um we've got the Amazon echo over
here Alexa turn on lights while they're
already on so and we've got three lamps
so they all have Phillip Hughes bulbs so
Alexa can control them Alexa turn off
lights okay love that my dad is also
half Jamaican half Chinese and it's
funny cuz I just realized like he has
wooden setup like this but all of his
like ethnic like black themed things
uses you're making flag and my other
things here and then cuz they travel a
lot and then on this side like the Asian
stuff some people appear you'll see like
a little Asian themed thing so you like
half the living room is like black beans
half is the kitchen
I'm a fan of this sword that's for sure
this thing looks cool I never noticed it
before I think looks awesome what's
going on right now yeah I'm gonna tell
you too because I'm gonna report these
people so this the second time this
happened it's 4:00 in the morning okay
we're at McDonald's don't judge us but
anyway we're here and they tell us they
preface our order with
cash only the screens aren't working to
show us the are ordered how much it
costs they're doing something she's
second time this happened the first time
I reported that place in New Jersey I
don't know if anything happened to that
and the second is the second time they
both get reported to I asked them for
receipt are the agent of justice
oh yeah it's not nice to make sure
things and it's like you know whatever
then I'm passing us please know we're
honest but it's not right I get my food
what if we didn't have cash to me please
don't like that we need more people like
you boo less people like me corruptly I
just want to eat I got no problem this
is SID so what's up said what's up guys
so Sid is my dude that's gonna be
helping me out with a lot of the videos
he's learned quite a bit so far learning
how to use the FS Evan you know right
now we're trying to get some footage for
the Moto X pure and it should be pretty
crispy his name is this listen 15
why did you take my man Abbas has been a
massive please don't ever call miss it
that's just says just said that don't be
too casual sit me
don't worry John when we first started
hanging out oh my do you want me to
clear gender and hip point judge on when
when we first hung out I didn't feel
like I was close enough for her to call
me judges which is what my family calls
me she didn't care at all just kept
calling each other and I just gave up
and the names the name spread beyond my
family thanks to her so whatever I don't
mind all the cables and we're working I
don't know where we got we got the
special halo five xbox one with the
gunmetal colored teal and you know it's
basically the best Xbox one out and if
you know anything about judging he loves
steel boom
I picked it look at this thing guys this
gonna look sick
now this is absolutely business guys
rody it's a picture of it you could love

have to do it on video I respect the
channel okay geez
anyway guys this thing is beautiful
let's get it out the box alright go get
out of here alright so this is it the
Xbox one this is a one terabyte this is
a bundle so it comes with Halo 5 before
it actually comes out by the time you
guys see this video the game should be
out but it comes with a couple of extras
as well so as you can see it comes with
the Xbox one um a hard shell carrying
case or a game case I think a figure and
of course the I guess promotion code to
download the game and a couple other
stuff so this looks pretty cool but I'm
just honestly excited about the color
scheme it looks amazing
alright guys so right now me and Sid are
working on the Xbox one halo 5 bundle
unboxing and it is requiring way more
work than we expected and right just
this metal figure thing sticking forever
right now there's like a little figurine
that you have to build and you think
that in a bundle a special edition
bundle that it come pre-built nope you
got to build this thing so it's like
Gundams all over again so this is its
first time working on something like
this yeah
no idea what I'm doing here well it's
taking so long though that we just might
leave it out of the unboxing we kind of
showed it already but I don't know if
we're gonna show the full figurine it's
just taking too long I want this video

class and this minivan and it used to be
no it wasn't this one he had this other
one that green one the Winstar okay is
green ones he used to pick you up from
the hair salon with this one though and
used to be embarrassed I remember that
the thing is like when you go to the
drive-through stuff you have to open the
door place your order because the window
and this side doesn't work in the winter
the heat just works in at once - I don't
know why he just keep this he has other
very nice cars he can choose from but
this is the one he hey man I mean even

couple weeks so I hear yeah see if I can
find the pencil somewhere right here
