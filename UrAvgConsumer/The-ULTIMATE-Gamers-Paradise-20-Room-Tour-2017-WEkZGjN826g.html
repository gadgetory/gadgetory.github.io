started baby and welcome to the gamers
paradise or welcome back to some of you
who saw the first video but this is the
gamers paradise 2.0 I meet a lot of
Awesome upgrades in here and I'm gonna
show you guys everything but for those
of you who aren't familiar with this
gamers paradise idea I try to have every
aspect of gaming in this room and so I'm
going to show you everything that's
inside of here but first off we are
going to take a look at the console area
this console area has a bit of
everything we've got the PlayStation 4
Pro down here the Xbox 1x Scorpio
Edition as well as a Nintendo switch on
the side and a Nintendo Wii U but you
know whatever
and of course I'm playing it all on this
65 inch samsung KS 8500 I believe it's
called this is the same TV that I used
last year it has 4k HDR everything that
you need to take advantage of some
awesome gameplay LG if you're listening
we need to get a wallpaper TV up here 77
inches maybe but I'm gonna show you guys
what's on the TV stand over here we did
change some things right here we have
the JBL pulse breeze this is the
upgraded version from the twos obviously
there's no more net around the lights so
this looks really good and clean and to
the right of that we have the
PlayStation VR this is on a stand
honestly I don't even really play this
like that check this out guys look at
all this dust it's it's it doesn't get
any play what can I say
but the stand is cold because it holds
the move controllers as well as the
DualShock 4 controller and next to that
we've got the apple 4k TV and this
supports 4k as well as HDR but what I
really like about that is that it has
this app called the TV app where you can
go in and it'll house all of the
different streaming sites that you use
and all the shows that you're currently
watching I don't like that because you
can just use the app to just keep up
with some of the shows that you've been
watching makes it really easy to find
now to the right of that we have
gaming headset of course this is the
Astro a 50 so these are wireless they
got good sound lots of cool features I
did a video on these I have it linked
down below if you want to learn more
about it but what's great about this is
that not only is it Wireless but it has
this base station I have two here and
this is where you charge it up and if I
want to sync it through my Xbox one I
just put it down there but if I want to
play with it on my ps4 all I gotta do is
pick it up drop it over there and boom
pick it back up and I can play with my
ps4 so syncing between consoles super
easy and of course I got the cameras for
the ps4 as well as the Xbox one this is
the Kinect I can't let the Kinect go
I know Microsoft is not supporting it
anymore they're done with it but I still
love it I wish I didn't drop it
but whatever to the side of that we've
got a cradle to house some joy cons I
actually got some special joy cons up
front here
these are made by the guys over at kala
where to have a Nintendo NES classic
look so these look awesome
and you're gonna see a lot of color
we're gearing here they got some awesome
stuff just like this Nintendo can I get
this in just like this been in Tendo
switch over here this is my baby right
here man it has the gamer paradise theme
with the teal black/white completely
customized by color where this is my
heart and soul right now man I love
playing this thing and it even has the
dock to match I just love the way this
looks I'm a huge fan of Nintendo switch
Nintendo killed it this year and of
course I got that Logitech Harmony
remote the nest cam and the other JBL
speaker to kind of just round out the
look I just realize I didn't tell you
guys about the Sonos playbar that I have
here this is part of the surround sound
system and please note the clean look
here with no cables the cable management
is on point but I still got this regular
a Sonos playbar
as well as the play ones on the sides I
love the way this thing works in the
room sounds great I'm waiting for the
Sonos to come out with a Dolby Atmos
version but until they do that I'm
sticking with these guys and I know you
guys asked
about the stands that the play ones are
on so I'm gonna have that link down
below as well so you guys can finally
get your hands on it and we haven't
talked about the actual consoles yet but
check this out this is my ps4 Pro and
it's got that retro ps1 look going for
it kala where did this and this thing is
beautiful if you play PlayStation back
in the day you can definitely appreciate
that over here we've got the Xbox one X
the most powerful console out right now
and this is the Scorpio edition so you
can see that it looks a bit different
the color changes when you get to the
right side so this is awesome and I've
also got a four terabyte hard drive over
here so I can store all my games going
digital is the way to go for me anyway
so I like having them all right there
and of course under each console I have
a bunch of accessories to go with it a
bunch of remotes and controllers for the
ps4 I got a bunch of controllers I got a
One S over here a regular Xbox one
Elgato streaming and just a bunch of
Nintendo accessories that are probably
never ever gonna be used again but it's
all good in case you guys didn't know I
am giving away a bunch of games and
accessories and controllers and all that
stuff over on Instagram and on Twitter
so if you're not following me there
you're missing out on some free stuff
but yeah that's what we've got going
over here and over here this area hasn't
changed much this is where I have all
the game cases for the games that I've
picked up now I'm probably not gonna be
adding much more to this because I'm not
doing a lot of physical purchases for my
games a lot of digital games are what
I'm looking for because it just makes it
easier to switch between games but I do
have some in terms of switched games
that just came in this year I like sonic
forces I don't care what anybody says
and I also have some Gundams so I've got
the whole Gundam Wing crew except for
Shenlong up on this shelf I'm gonna talk
more about the Gundams don't worry you
guys gonna see the whole collection
there's a lot of them now a ton of you
guys got on me about not having some
kind of mini-fridge in here but I
couldn't just throw in some kind of
regular mini-fridge so I had to do it
the right way and over here this coffee
table probably the most advanced coffee
table you will ever see so right here we
have the sober Oh coffee table and you
know that mini-fridge we were talking
about coming over here baby
we got them drinks we got drinks we've
got water gatorade Mountain Dew for the
cameras
sprite Capri fun for the kids me so
everything you need is right down there
and not only that there's a lot of tech
inside of here besides just a fridge so
oh forget the tag for a second check
this out
we got the snacks - we got the snacks so
now you guys can't talk about me now
having a mini fridge I got snacks got
drinks we're good to go but the second
drawer at the bottom has a bunch of
different remotes so if I want to play
my playstation 4 I just grabbed the
remote turn on the TV
got my ps4 controller and as you can see
all the controllers in here
we're customized by color where to match
the setup and not to mention I even have
a remote over here so if I want to
control the shades but aside from that
you see I got some cables right and a
microfiber cloth and I got USB ports on
the side of the coffee table so this
thing can charge up your phones and boom
good to go you just shown right there
and you've got two USB ports as well as
an aux cable because this thing has
built-in speakers so you can listen
through a Bluetooth or you can plug in
the aux cable to play some jams which is
awesome and on the side here if you need
to charge up a device like a laptop or
whatever you can just plug them in right
here it has four outlets two on this
side two on the other and I don't know
if you guys notice but down here we've
got LED lights that can change you can
change and control all the colors right
from this control panel and you can do a
ton of different things you can change
the temperature of the fridge if you
would like you can change the lighting
scene that you have going on you can
even put an alarm all kinds of cool
stuff you can do that here this coffee
table is just it's insane and it's a
must if you have a man
cave and you want to add some nice
aesthetic piece to it that's also super
functional and of course gamers paradise
we got the razor phone the gamer phone
so we got that here and we also have the
surface book to which I personally love
because I can take this on the go in
game whenever I want I really really dig
that it's not meant to just do gaming
but it does it really well so it fits in
perfectly in here and check this out
guys I even have a little book for the
coffee table all about Gundam model kits
I'll keep everyone entertained with this
now moving on you guys might remember
this this is the portable gaming section
the collection has grown quite a bit we
have the two PlayStation Vita's the two
PS PS through the SX cells through the
SX cells with the Pokemon legendary
themes on there
we got two Nintendo 2ds and some regular
Nintendo 3ds with the Charizard and
Blastoise theme from the 20th
anniversary right I yeah
20th anniversary as you can see you kind
of like Pokemon in here and over here
we've got our gaming chair this is the X
rocker right here we've got speakers on
the sides so if you're playing your game
you can just grab one of the system's
grab the cable plug it in you know you
got an enhanced gaming experience but
one thing you might have noticed on the
actual X rocker is this sub pack so this
is the sub pack m2 and honestly when it
comes to gaming and audio this adds a
whole new dynamic so right here we've
got the sub pack m2 and basically what
this does it's a bass enhancing backpack
so you just kind of throw this on and
anything if you're listening to music or
maybe playing a game you send the audio
in through here and with that you're
gonna be able to feel the actual sounds
that are happening within your game or
the music you're listening to so when
you got gunshots flying off you're
actually feeling it you feel all those
vibrations this is just a crazy addition
to playing any game so the sub pack
could be pretty dope for gaming I
actually really like it how did I even
miss this
check this out guys inside of here we
have a buttload of Xbox one controllers
if you guys have seen my massive tech
unboxing videos and you see the
controllers that I get almost every
month you see that they kind of stack up
I got a buttload of them so shout out
some Microsoft keep sending them out I
appreciate it
but some of them are actually customized
by myself with the Microsoft design labs
so these two I'm particularly proud of
these guys right here I made myself if
you couldn't tell by the colors uh-huh
but I'm really happy with these but
between those you guys might see some
very very special Gundam kits that I
have here let's start with this guy this
is the winged zero this is the high
resolution version completely customized
and painted by my boy curio Ventura that
guy is a mastermind when it comes to
putting these bills together I have a
lot of Awesome Gundams I've got guns
that I built myself I've got some really
really great metal builds and some very
special ones that a boy curio Ventura
customized for me the guy's a monster he
auctions some of these things off so if
you guys are interested in seeing some
of the Gundams that he puts together
I'll have his information to his
Instagram link down below check them out
definitely follow him do you see this up
here this is my 1 million subscriber
gold play button I used to have the
silver play button over here but you
guys are awesome and you decided to
follow me so I finally got my hands on
the gold one and it looks awesome day I
got my biggest Gundam kind of guarding
it making sure that things stay safe if
there's an earthquake its rap for that
thing though because all of this stuff
will come crashing down but over here oh
well first stop
but next one we've got the Amazon echo
show this is pretty much what controls a
lot of the things in this room I've also
got a Google home in here that does a
lot of controlling too but I randomly
speak to whichever one comes to mind
first they pretty much do all the same
things nowadays
except this one has a screen so you can
interact with it in that way but they're
all the same pretty much but moving on
here we have a desk set up that I put
together just to have a little space for
my MacBook
the MacBook isn't completely essential
here I can swap that out with my surface
book too but they all work here so this
right here is a nother Gundam bacterial
Ventura this is a hi new Gundam made to
go with the black and teal theme we have
this a subscriber counter clock by Lu
metric and it does a lot more you can
program it to do a ton of different
things but behind that what do we get
this we went to Florida right millennium
mall so we went to the M&amp;amp;M store you can
get M&amp;amp;Ms in like any color so I decided
to go with the UAC theme here and right
next to it we've got the Microsoft
invoke this is kind of like the Amazon
Alexa and the Google home and I'm still
messing around with this to see how good
it is it's in the very very early stages
it's definitely not a full-blown
competitor to the other two just yet
but it sounds awesome and it looks great
so it's got that going for it as you can
see I have an LG 4k monitor over here I
forget the exact model number they all
have these crazy model numbers I have it
connected to my macbook pro with touch
bar all with one USB type-c cable I've
got the Apple keyboard here with the
magic number pad as well as the Magic
Trackpad - I do wish that this had a
touch bar Apple please if you are
listening bring the touch bar to the
magic keyboard I've also got this
awesome Razer mousepad over here
actually gives a nice little rest here
whenever I'm using the mouse and right
here under this Galaxy Note 8 I have a
ravpower wireless charger this thing
provides fast wireless charging and I've
also got this Anker PowerPort plus USB
hub so this doesn't it's not a USB hub
for the computer but it charges
everything up quickly
it also has USB PD so I can charge up
the iPhone 10 the a day plus with quick
charging and I got four other USB ports
to charge up any other device
want to I've got to audio engine tools
here I think this is it a 2 plus so
those sound pretty decent definitely
good enough for this setup and on this
brain waves headphone hanger we've got
the Sony what they changed up the name
on this it throws me off all the time
it's the WH 1000 X mark twos most
advanced headphones you'll find but they
shouldn't change the name and back here
I know you guys probably will ask me
about this lamp this is actually from
Aki right they sent me this I don't know
if they actually came out with it I know
they sent me I think it was supposed to
be a prototype at the time it's pretty
cool has some touch controls but I'll
let you guys know if it's actually out
and you might have noticed this is a
Gundam bus I believe it's called but
this is of the new Gundam and as you can
see here I've got a poster of it even I
used to have my boy egg up there but egg
has to had to get moved he's gonna be in
another spot so you guys got to keep
your eyes out for that set up now this
area might be a bit familiar to you guys
this is where I have my gaming setup my
serious hardcore machine all on this
desk this is where everything goes down
this is like the command center now
before we get to everything that you
guys see up here we got to talk about
the beast that's powering everything and
that is this custom PC by the dudes over
at Origin PC now the first thing we got
to talk about is the look this thing
matches the UAC color scheme perfectly
we got the black and white and the teal
on the inside and look down here guys
that right there that is my logo the UAC
logo so this thing is custom painted
onto the side of the machine so it looks
great but this thing is a powerful
machine guys it's got some awesome specs
we're working with a core I 9 processor
with 18 cores which is just mind-blowing
for me to have that many cores and power
into this PC and it's got 64 gigs of ram
also crazy and we're running with an
NVIDIA Titan XP graphics card so not
only is that being powerful for
Gaming but we can also use it to do some
real video editing rendering tons of
stuff so this is a workstation as well
and the CPU is water-cooled and you see
it's got that seal coolant so it just
matches the whole look and vibe I just
think this thing is awesome we've also
got the LEDs on the sides of course but
all that power is housed in Origen pcs
millennium case if you guys are
interested in their millennium cases as
well as all of their other pcs I'll have
them linked down below in the
description definitely be sure to go
check them out I personally love being
able to get an awesome powerful PC
without having to build it myself I know
a lot of people enjoy building their pcs
I honestly just don't have the time so
being able to get something powerful
made by some professionals I can't
complain again I got to give a huge
shout out to the dudes over at Origin PC
for sending this out and powering the
entire gamers paradise this thing is a
beast and you guys might have remembered
flood that used to be here but I wanted
something very very powerful for the
gaming PC thus the upgrade but I
actually don't have a name for this one
like I did for flood so that's where you
guys come in if you have a cool
suggestion based on the look and the
power leave a comment down below with
what you think I should call this guy
I'd love to see what you guys come up
with but now let's talk about the gear
that I'm using with the PC and as you
can see the monitors are pretty much the
same these are the Acer predator X 30
fours
I'm waiting for the X 35 s to come out
those look very promising it's I'm
really excited to get my hands on those
I'm kind of waiting for that one but I'm
still rocking the X 30 4s which are
really great but now in terms of the
actual accessories here over here I have
the Corsair k95 Platinum keyboard this
is with the Cherry MX brown switches so
they're nice and clicky I love these and
as you can see they've got the UAC
theme going here as well and the months
of choice over here is the logitech g502
you guys might have saw the g6 o2 i had
on the other desk but the 502 it has
actually been really really nice I never
thought I'd like a wired mouse but I'm
loving this one I'm also got the Razer
Firefly mousepad over here still this is
just an awesome mousepad with the LEDs
on the side so that
great this is actually a way better
controller than I thought the Razer
ultimate Wolverine
I like how clicky all of the buttons
feel it's actually just been a really
enjoyable experience playing with this
and over here also by Razer we have the
Razer base station now this is an
awesome headphone stand not only because
it has these cool LEDs but it also has
three USB ports so if you want to put
something up to your computer you don't
have to go down to the computer even
though mine is accessible I can just
plug it in right here on top of the
keyboard yeah my to notice the gaming
headset that I have here this is a bit
of a throwback this is the PlayStation
pulse wireless headset now I absolutely
love this gaming headset its vibrations
all day that extreme crazy bass I love
it they don't make these anymore
so this is like the last one a lot of
people's broke but I still got one left
and I love it although you do kind of
have to baby them and over here I have
the Sennheiser mk4 digital mic so if I
want to do any twist streaming at some
point I might be able to do that with
its quality mic here instead of using
what's on my Logitech Brio webcam but to
the side of that we have the oculus rift
actually picked up the controllers for
this as well so now whenever I play it I
got the controllers to go with it so
it's actually pretty fun to use this
instead of an Xbox one controller so
these have been pretty cool and of
course like I said I had that Google
home right here in the back color you
know well in play so we got that Google
home and we have some Alex drawers over
here from Ikea all with a bunch of
different stuff as you can see we've got
stacks and stacks of cellphones buy a
ton of different manufacturers yeah it
just kind of never ends but what I do
want to show on my throwbacks LG G won
the very first Android phone LG g2 and I
even got my sidekick from high school
days the memories and under that I've
got a ton
of different mice or Mouse's they both
work look it up uh uh but yeah I have a
ton of different ones got some from
Microsoft I got a lot guys there's a lot
but the g502 is the what actually stays
on the desk right now
and down here nothing too special I got
some hard drives flash drives a couple
of Android wear watches and some remotes
for all the different RB RGB lights that
I use in here and at the bottom I keep
all of my cables in Ziploc bags so I
have access to them I can keep things
nice and clean and the chair that I use
between the two desk setups is from
Herman Miller I plan on getting another
one at some point these things are
really expensive though so I've been
slacking and oh this right here guys
this is okay first of all the logitech
headphones you guys have seen this it
goes with the pc goes with the whole
theme looks good
still there but this guys this right
here this is my baby
curio venturus spent like an entire
month making this thing as perfect as he
could and this is my new gundam
completely customized to match my theme
it's got even the the hexagons going on
the sides matches the computer matches
the panel of there the thing even
clothes in the dark I don't know what he
did to make that happen but it is
amazing and if you're wondering about
these speakers there are the audio
engine a fives I have them on these
stands I'll have the stands link down
below as well time to show you guys the
final piece of the room which is the
closet now the closet special if you
remember and we'll see what changes we
have here there's a lot going on in here
so as you might have noticed there are
quite a few more headphones here
throughout the entire closet there's
probably we're probably gonna run out of
space pretty soon a lot of new gaming
headsets got in here Astro razor hyper
eggs a lot of them and over here we
have a ton of backpacks I'm obsessed
with backpacks what can I say but I do a
lot of testing to see which ones I can
actually recommend to you guys so this
is the result of that and that actually
speaks to the battery packs that I have
here as well all these different
portable chargers same thing with these
Bluetooth speakers these are all
Bluetooth speakers some of my favorites
are in here like the Bose the V mode is
down here lots of good stuff
regular speakers these are bluetooth
speakers as well if these are B&amp;amp;O yeah
lots of good stuff here guys and we even
have a section for earbuds
so whether they're normal earbuds or
wireless earbuds wireless earbuds are
becoming a bigger deal to me bluetooth
anything is becoming a bigger deal since
the headphone jack is and of course as
you can see we've got a ton of Gundam
boxes some of these have not even been
touched yet haven't built any of these
up here only this guy has been built but
all those other ones not yet we even got
some headset stands down here so if I
gotta get a new headset out there I'll
just grab one of these and place it got
my boy Aang who's gonna be going into a
different set up but I miss him used to
have a really nice spot over there but
that's pretty much it guys the closet is
pretty much almost packed to the brim
but yeah this has been the gamers
