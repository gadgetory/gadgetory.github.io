all-in-one conferencing solution what's
going on guys it's Travis consumer and
today we're gonna be checking out a
bunch of Amazon basics tech and pretty
much this is the tech that you find on
Amazon when you're looking for something
and you see that generic version that
they make baby much the foodie owes to
Froot Loops that's what we've got over
here and we're gonna basically see if
you can trust them now for this video
guys I'm pretty much gonna be using all
of these products for the very first
time and of course I'm gonna start off
with something where I'm able to play
some apex legends and that's this wired
Xbox one controller and this looks
interesting it feels a little rough but
overall it's the same Xbox layout should
work just fine is it not working oh
what's it doing I can't I can't move
around the menus this is the down button
broken this is not a good start y'all is
not a good start at all so I'm gonna
unplug this and plug it back in and see
if that changes anything
check out the USB plug it back in this
is this thing a dud already let's take
this out come all together let's get
this Xbox one controller over here yeah
okay I'm gonna give this one more shot
I'm gonna turn the Xbox off turn it back
on and see if there's any hope for this
controller so we've got it back on this
is not working
alright don't buy the Amazon basics
wired controller for the Xbox one I mean
it could just be a dud I've never had
this happen before ever
alright guys now on the off chance that
mine just happens to be defective it
happens with all kinds of products out
of the box
uh let me at least give you guys my
opinion on how this thing feels like I
said it's a hard controller it's a
little bit rough definitely doesn't feel
as nice as one of the controllers that
Xbox gives in the box but these triggers
are pretty clicky that's nice I mean I
feel like I could have played just fine
with this I really liked the triggers at
the top this would have been cool now
how much you think this costs
Malcolm pip this thing goes for 25 bucks
y'all so $25 I'd be really upset if I
didn't have an Xbox controller I spent
25 bucks on this thing and then this
happened so okay so the next item right
here is a gaming headset from Amazon
basics now the idea here was to use this
with the Xbox wired controller but we
saw how that way so we're gonna try this
thing out with the regular controller
that I have over here so this thing has
a standard 3.5 millimeter jack so I'll
just throw that into the actual
controller now in terms of the feel for
this guy not bad
made out of plastic but it does have
these nice cushions at the top and
around the ear cups so I'm expecting
this to be pretty comfortable snug and
soft at the same time I like this this
is a very comfortable headset so this
cables got some pretty decent length
we've got our mic over here we've also
got the remote
so with this remote I can control the
volume and of course you mute the mic so
you have access to all that pretty much
all you really need for a gaming headset
so let's just go with that get the
volume up all the don't hear anything
please God please work where's the audio
oh all right we got it to work y'all I
just had to unplug it and plug it back
into the controller also not a good sign
the fact that I had to do that on my
first try again yo man quick question
for you how's my mic audio sounding to
you pretty good okay let's get to here
I'm doing this test right now to see if
this is legit so from what this guy just
said he says the mic audio sounds pretty
good the audio that I got from the game
wasn't bad whatsoever if I was stuck
with these if I have no choice and I got
these I wouldn't be upset at all like I
could use these at home and not really
complain so these were really
comfortable I definitely give these a
pass except it was kind of weird what
happened in the beginning
but we'll let that slide it knows it's
kind of cheap so right here we got an
Amazon basics charging stand I've never
put this on here before should be pretty
simple uh just okay there we go
and let's see this thing feels it's like
it's made out of metal the base is made
out of metal
now the only thing about this charging
stand though is that it's a USB charging
stands so you got to plug it into your
Xbox but one thing that's awesome though
is that it also comes with a
rechargeable battery so if you need one
of these you've got a rechargeable
battery and you've got the back to go
with it and then you can just throw it
on the charging but overall though what
you get here isn't bad I just wish this
cable were a bit longer since you're
gonna have to plug it into your Xbox but
Malcolm what do you think this cost so
this one goes for twenty bucks
definitely a good price because just
getting a rechargeable battery in itself
is probably close to that price so you
get the charging stand which is pretty
good quality I like the way this thing
feels it's a good charging stand now
there's also one for the PlayStation and
that's this guy over here you got two
charges in one so you can charge two
controllers how do you okay you just
kind of just dock it in like that okay
nothing too special here one thing
that's nice though is that this thing
has a regular plug so you can just throw
that thing into the outlet have it be a
standalone device so I like that a lot
to to a once not bad at all this one
only goes for 12 bucks and the build
quality even though it's amazonbasics
doesn't seem too bad okay guys so we had
to get away from the gaming stuff and go
to something that's a bit more Universal
so we have some desktop speakers over
here these are tiny little babies but
we'll see if they pack a punch we will
never know so we got some music over
here
okay this song usually has a punch when
the when the music kicks in and I got
none of that none of that whatsoever
like right here that part last night
took like bass this thing has no bass at
all this thing owes me bass right now oh
my god alright but let me see if I put
up the volume a bit how that's gonna
sound I'm trying to put the volume up to
kind of make up for it but the
distortion kicks in and it just sounds
pretty horrible my goodness maybe
something that's not bass heavy
something a little bit more low-key
okay so that's not horrible let's
compare that to the IMAX speakers and
see what we got
okay I'm next speaker so way better
don't buy these never buy these these
are horrible now the next thing that we
found on Amazon basics which was
surprising to see that they even made
was a shotgun microphone for cameras so
if you got like a DSLR or something you
need some cheap audio Amazon has that
for sale which is just mind boggling but
now in terms of the audio quality this
is kind of how it sounds we're gonna
switch right now to the mic malcom get a
little bit closer let's see how it
sounds when you're a little bit closer
so this is the audio when it's a little
bit closer how about we take what we've
got right now and hear how it sounds on
the computer so my voice doesn't sound
too bad coming from it but I am hearing
a lot of the environment which isn't so
great but overall if I needed just
better audio than what you get on a
standard like camera and I didn't want
to spend a lot of money I'd kick this up
but I wouldn't expect anything super
great this is just to slightly improve
the audio quality that you get out of
your camera
malcom re 15j this guy goes for
twenty-five dollars
alright so now our last thing is this
amazon basics mouse but we're gonna see
if this thing is worth picking up maybe
if you just need something really
inexpensive let's check it out now this
mouse comes with a dongle so there's no
Bluetooth or anything you're gonna want
to take this guy and plug it into a USB
port dang this thing got some sharp
edges hold on let's take this thing out
holy mess yeah so this dongle has some
really sharp edges be careful there this
is a small mouse but the ergonomics are
pretty decent I like the way my fingers
rest on it feels kind of cheap though
grow wheel feels pretty good so just
scrolling this nice and you can actually
change the DPI on this so there's like a
little button here and when you press
this button the DPI basically changes
how fast the mouse will go all over the
screen if you have big hands this is
going to absolutely take some getting
used to so overall I do like this mouse
it's a little bit on the smaller side
but in terms of what you're actually
getting the kind of ergonomics the feel
of it
it's not super bad does feel a little
bit cheap but I think it's definitely
something you want to pick up if you
were looking for a really cheap mouse
not a bad mouse and this one I'm gonna
ask Malcolm this guy only goes for 1099
so you're spending 11 bucks on it if you
got bigger hands I would not suggest it
but for a cheap amazonbasics item it's
not bad so I think with this
amazonbasics line you pretty much get
what you pay for some items might be
better than others but you absolutely
don't know what you're gonna get until
you get it but before we head out we got
to give a huge shout out to today's
sponsor go-to room by logging it in this
one's for all my business owners out
there goats room is an all-in-one
conference room solution meeting rooms
can be pretty annoying to set up
especially when you want to do online
conferencing since you typically need to
put together multiple parts goat room
room gives you everything you need right
inside of the box which actually isn't
that much and setup is really simple
with his pre-configured software and
surprisingly you can set this thing up
literally in a few minutes and forget
about it and the dedicated hardware is
pretty impressive as you get a high
quality camera mic and even speakers for
better communication and if you guys
want to learn more about go to room of
course have links down below in the
description for you to check out but
that's about it guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy or
girl that gives this video a thumbs up
and I'm gonna catch you guys in the next
one till then it's your average consumer
