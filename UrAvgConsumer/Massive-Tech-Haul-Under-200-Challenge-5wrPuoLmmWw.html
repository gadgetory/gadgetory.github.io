wind is blowing like crazy but we are at
Best Buy and you know that means it's
time for shopping challenge this time
we're working with bucks that's not
gonna be easy
yeah but and we still only have 20
minutes to pick up everything that we
want for under $200 yeah we're gonna be
jumping in there picking out a bunch of
tech and you guys gonna let us know who
won and we got the best stuff with a
comment down below and we're gonna have
a pole at the end so team Mary we got
this we won last year we're gonna win
again this let's go see for ourselves
folks okay guys so we're about to start
we've got our timers ready three two one
boom all right let's go kill this thing
make it really tough this time is that
we only have $200 but I'm pretty much a
master at making a dollar stretch so it
should be pretty easy that is the
challenge we've got to find good stuff
that you know you guys probably haven't
seen before maybe we should buy Best Buy
some lights oh my god so the first thing
I wants to do is get a game for my
switch I'm getting kind of bored of it
out don't really have mini games and I
love Kirby so I'm looking for Kirby and
it just came out like last week and I
played the demos and I want the real
thing it's not here and I'm wasting time
looking for it so let's go to the game
section yeah you've got like a budget
like this it's hard to pick up anything
great so I didn't really come prepared
with what I really wanted I only wanted
Kirby so I'm gonna cheat a little bit
but it's not really cheating because we
didn't send me rules so I'm going to
beat you guys and hopefully people can
give me some good ideas okay so here's
the tweet that I wrote you guys
hopefully someone in here will give me
something good because then I could
shout you out later on okay so hopefully
you guys come through for me noise
cancelling Sony headphones for 40 bucks
that's my bad it's wired though today's
day and age gotta go wireless
but this is this is good
hmm should I self-sabotage and get up
[Laughter]
okay let me stop playing someone to lose
and I'll be mad oh this is a bomb
looking Mouse right here of course their
dark hair dark core RGB 70 bucks though
nah I'm gonna get these these are good
right noise-canceling 95 percent ambient
noise reduction and guys I want you to
check this out you see this loser over
there look at this what don't be looking
at my product
what could you get here I hate him he
already had two things I'm feeling
nervous no one's helping Oh a tripod
okay something functional all right okay
all right now we're gonna put this back
though I'm not confident enough in these
Sony headphones to actually eat up my
budget with them tomorrow you still have
hope we are not on the losing squad I
hate him he already had two things now
that's gonna mess with my head okay got
some sony earbuds these are 50 bucks but
they have a much smaller design not bad
this is actually pretty cool cuz
Jaybirds and all those are like in the
hundred dollar rings this is only 50
bucks I'm picking this up alright so
we're at the search section already
hospital to municipal tune and Mario
Kart
I need Kirby imagine if the one thing I
wanted is just not here that would just
be fantastic and it's not why is this
happening
let's get to K I know that's a favorite
a fan favorite so let's get to K because
everything else I want isn't here audio
and TV yeah you think we could afford
that sure I can't oh look at this a
smart Wi-Fi plug mini now I like T P
link smart plugs so this is nice because
it's a much smaller design works with
Google assistant this is nice
ting that's 150 already with just three
items yeah okay thank you very much so
on my own I happen to find by the reason
the gaming section so we're gonna just
get some good stuff here might have to
put this back even though I really
really want it but if there's killing my
budget right now I think oh this is
pretty cool so I need a new editing
mouse my 6:02 has been messing up so
let's take a look
Oh left-handed configurations I'm a
lefty in case you guys didn't know so
let's get this Hey okay do you Ares over
there looking I'm gonna have to put
these behind my back
somebody likes to cheat and you know
alright no I'm just saying don't don't
even look over here I'm looking at
products oh don't don't don't don't look
over here when I say ooh see this one
isn't configured for lefties but it is
seventy bucks gaming mouse pad gotta
have one of these let's see how much
time I've got left
all right so five minutes alright so
five minutes and only thirty dollars
left so I want to get one more good day
nobody was like a his stuff did you get
a peek I'm not gonna live guys I've seen
air out his hands kind of empty so I
don't see struggling so at this point I
have 41 seconds so I think we're done
hopefully this is $200 and I don't have
to put anything back I should bring
something as a backup though just in
case I'm not walking away feeling as
confident yeah it's over wait a minute
let's make sure she stops because he's a
cheater open box oh there goes the timer
okay
you better stop looking airy times up
I'm Jenna oh my way to be register why
how do you have so many things I figure
I smell victory oh wow okay 223 I see
the thing is I have a maximum budget of
$200 do you guys in military discount
understand sir we're seeing right now if
I have a coupon you know I rack up a
couple things sometime so hopefully I do
all right I'm good in terms of my
pricing so I'm not worried I'm gonna
take this off sounds like she's
budgeting over there for her if you go
over here you'll see my subtotal I want
you guys to be aware that my subtotal is
199 96 tax you know a government they
put us over our butts so got our stuff I
was over here asking me what I got
already okay I saw you budgeting over
there alright guys so here we are time
for the reveal see who won this
challenge and just to make sure we get a
proper winner we're gonna be giving away
somebody's bag over on Instagram and
what you're gonna have to do is make
sure you follow us we're gonna have a
post and in that post you're gonna
comment hashtag team re or hash tag team
Judd for whose bag you want to walk away
with you ready let's do this so who goes
first
oh well first we got a we got to show
the receipts alright so I've got one
ninety six and twelve cents Wow okay so
I actually couldn't came really close to
200 199 96 dang I know four sons away
right absolutely more money no we're
absolutely including tax
my mistake I mean you didn't specify to
1321 one of your items don't count no it
absolutely counts because last time
that's how we did it see she's a cheater
let's see how you did yeah go first
you got more items of sure start by
saying I think I should win mainly
because no explanation dropped the puck
dragged across the subscribers so if you
see my if you guys saw my tweet I asked
you guys but you want to see in this
shopping challenge so I made sure to
carry early back and I got things that
you guys wanted so here we go shut up -
I think his name is MH tweet he said he
really wanted to see a nice tripod and I
got this one
that's a 42-inch tripod how much is that
this one was there 30 bucks I think
alright 30 bucks I got something for 30
bucks so I've got this tp-link smart
Wi-Fi plug mini listen listen it's a
tripod don't even try it so I went with
the tp-link smart Wi-Fi plug because
this is a smaller design I feel like
it's not gonna take up a lot of space on
people's outlets can turn things that
aren't smart smart controller with your
phone yeah I like it actually
just cut this explanation out cuz we've
seen this on the train like five times
so anyway next I got a game for the
switch but I just got this NBA 2k 18 how
much is that now is that like in the
discount section no no this is 60 bucks
you spent $60 on that it's a game I
think it's 60 bucks
all right well I didn't get a lot of
points for 2k 18 so that's the little
annoying
so 2k 18 that's a hard act to follow up
and then go lie but from people on the
budget looking not to spend so much
money portable speaker blue speaker only
15 bucks so to me that's a deal
you got some savings got some audio so I
you know I considered budget as well but
I still wanted to have that someone's
brain that you can trust so I went with
Sony
these were MDR ZX voice yeah so I'm
gonna put that down right yeah I'll put
that down
I mean if you got headphone jack still
let me know will it cut me down boy
anyway 40 bucks noise cancelling
headphones I think it's pretty it's a
pretty good deal for that hope you ain't
rocking the iPhone I also went to Sony
route but I thought about the kind of
phones people have nowadays you know
they got the Jaybirds and all those for
a hundred bucks 50 bucks guys so save
some money got your Bluetooth Bluetooth
audio no auxiliary port needle oh you
okay Aires almost done
you got you on your last item actually
went over budget
