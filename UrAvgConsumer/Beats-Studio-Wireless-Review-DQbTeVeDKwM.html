consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the Beats Studio wireless so
let's not wasting your time
let's get right into it
this video is brought to you by
Squarespace alright guys here we have
the Beats Studio wireless in matte black
and this is the newest headphone of the
beats line and let me start off by
saying it ain't cheap this is the second
most expensive of the headphones in the
line excluding the special editions but
let's take a look and see if it's worth
your three hundred and eighty dollars
plus tax now if you're familiar with the
new Beats Studio you pretty much know
what the studio wireless are all about
almost taking a look around the
headphones you can see that it looks
exactly like the new studios in every
way except for the new matte-black
finish the studio Wireless also come in
a few other color options and you have
your standard black blue red and the
second new color titanium the matte
black finish is my favorite amongst the
selection as it helps the headphones to
have a really sleek and low-profile
design something you don't often see
with beats the matte black finish isn't
as prone to fingerprints unless you have
greasy fingers in which case you will
end up seeing some fingerprints but it
cleans up pretty easily with a
microfiber cloth the overall design is
very nice with the studio Wireless and
I'm actually pretty glad that they went
with the exact same look as the new
studios they feature a strong
comfortable headband and that's saying
quite a bit considering one of the
biggest concerns people have with Beats
is the build quality but there are no
concerns to be had over here as these
are quite durable unless you plan to
mangle them and there are stress tests
all over YouTube to prove it and the
headband is also adjustable for those
with the cranium of the larger variety
as well as a comfortable headband you
also have extremely comfortable ear
cushions and these are easily amongst my
favorite headphones to wear when it
comes to comfort the cushions are large
and very plush and your ears should have
no issue fitting in for a nice over ear
experience now let's talk a bit about
the features if you couldn't tell these
are wireless headphones so they're
packing Bluetooth technology and
although they look identical to the new
Stu
they actually have a different left ear
cup which actually packs all the
Bluetooth controls above the beats logo
you'll find the volume up and under the
volume down the logo itself is a button
that functions similarly to inline
remotes found on headphone cables you
see today such as iPhone earbuds you can
press it to play and pause music double
tap it to skip a track or triple tap to
go back to a previous song when I first
saw these headphones I didn't think it
came with any of these controls because
of how fleshed in they were with the
overall design of the headphones the
headphones don't have any indication
that it has Bluetooth controls built
into it unlike most Bluetooth headphones
that usually have buttons all over for
you to press so bonus points for that
and as these are bluetooth headphones
they also include a built-in mic for
those of you who want to have a
hands-free phone conversation you also
get some pretty good range with the
Bluetooth feature they advertise about
30 feet range and I'd say that's pretty
accurate from my experiences the studio
wireless also features a battery
indicator to give you an idea of when
you'll need to get your next charge in
when using bluetooth you'll get about 12
hours of battery and about 20 hours if
you're using the cable and for those of
you wondering you can use the cable with
these if you don't want to use the
Bluetooth features however one of my
biggest gripes is that you still need
power in order to use these headphones
if the battery is drained you won't be
able to listen until you charge it again
luckily you get quite a few hours of use
but I'm really not a fan of this
limitation one of the other new features
is the ability to automatically turn on
and off the headphones by plugging in or
removing the cable that comes with it
you can also turn them on or off by
pressing and holding the battery
indicator now let's take a look at some
of the accessories that come with this
first things first this comes with a
black tangle free cable and I'm glad
that it comes with this because it's a
very low profile pair of headphones and
having to use a red cable would
definitely take away from that however
it is just a straight cable so there is
no inline remote and it also comes with
a red cable that does feature the inline
remote for those of you who are looking
for that and for the travelers you get a
hard shell carrying case that will
definitely provide protection from
impact or anything of the sort
however I wish it had a pouch or
something to hold the accessories
as is if you bring cables along with you
they won't have a place to sit securely
in and now what you've all been waiting
for the sound quality now this might not
come as much of a surprise but these
sound exactly like the new studios B's
did a great job improving the sound
quality of the new studios over the
older headphones in the line and I'm
glad to report that the studio wireless
carry the same great sound quality you
have great clarity without overpowering
bass that many have complained about in
the past and vocals are very clear and
you can hear high-pitched sounds come in
more nicely and the bass is more
controlled but it's still very present
as someone who loves bass I wasn't
disappointed at all however if you're
coming from something like the old
studios don't expect it to have the same
amount of bass whatsoever while I love a
ton of bass I can definitely appreciate
it when it's more controlled because it
allows you to hear a lot more of the
other stuff going on in the music which
these headphones do a pretty good job of
bringing to your ears
now we all know beats are great for
genres like rap dubstep hip-hop and the
likes but these also do really well with
other genres that aren't so bass heavy
pieces very smart for carrying over the
sound quality and just about everything
else from the new studios over to the
studio Wireless the studio Wireless are
essentially the exact same headphones as
in new studios but with Bluetooth
features and I'm okay with that if
having bluetooth features isn't a huge
draw for you though I would suggest
saving a little cash and going with the
new studios instead these aren't the
first bluetooth headphones in this price
range but it's still a hard hit on the
pocket for most people so you really
want to take into consideration how much
you want the Bluetooth features and what
it offers and now it's time to show you
guys what these look like on but before
we do that I'd like to take a quick
second to thank our sponsors over at

in the description and all right I'm
going to show you guys what it looks
like on so what's nice about these is of
course no wire so you can just throw
these on and boom you're good to go so
here it is from the front you've got
some side action here you guys can see
the head boom so it's all really good
stuff I really do like the matte black
version because it's very low-key you
can't really even tell that you're
wearing beads unless you know you get up
close so I really do like that it's very
low-profile really good stuff really
nice design and like I said guys this is
pretty much the new studios but with
some wireless features and I definitely
think it's worth it if you are in the
realm of looking for beads now you can
just go with the regular studios it's up
to you how much you value the wireless
Bluetooth feature me I would get it
because you guys know I love wireless so
I would get it but if you want to save
some money if you're not really going to
use bluetooth like that then definitely
just go for the $300 version and you
know just go without it either way it's
a good buy in my opinion so that's about
it for this review guys hopefully
