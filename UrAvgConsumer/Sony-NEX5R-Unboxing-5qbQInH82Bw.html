average consumer and yes I know I'm in
another location but I have an unboxing
for you guys and I figured that might as
well get it out regardless of where I am
so today I'm gonna be unboxing the Sony
nex-5r so let's not waste any time let's
get right into it all right guys here we
have the Sony nex-5r
not really sure what they're going by
with the NEX thing but I'm calling it
the next 5r and I picked this up
recently at Best Buy to kind of do my
vlogging it has a swivel screen and all
that's good stuff so I was looking for a
point-and-shoot that I could use to
travel around because the DSLR was just
too big for me so I wanted something a
little more compact that was still a
pretty decent camera so I picked this up
and I'm gonna be using this for vlogs
and stuff like that so um as you guys
can see here it gives you a lot of
details as far as what comes what it
comes with
um you can see that it has the camera
the lens which is an 18 by 55 millimeter
and a flash and of course you know
you've got some other information here
kind of stuff it's compatible with works
with the ps3 very interesting I didn't
know that so that's gonna be pretty cool
and I think this thing is has become a
bunch of cool stuff going on with a lot
of accessories so it's gonna be really
interesting but enough babbling get to
the unboxing can pull this open here so
we get inside of course we get tons of
manuals and all this good stuff got a
whole bunch of limited warranties movies
all kinds of stuff so we're gonna take
this put it over here and let's see what
else do you get inside that's what it
looks like so first thing I pull out
here is the wall adapter so this has a
USB port so I'm assuming this charges by
USB cable and you know it goes into wall
says Sony so that's that
and let's see this is the strap that it
comes with um if you guys are interested
I'll show you that right now and here we
have the strap pretty thin strap um
luckily this is in the heavy camera so
you don't have to worry about the thin
strap being um weighing down on your
shoulder or neck or anything like that
so that's pretty cool
this is the strap that it comes with as
we get a little further inside this uses
a micro USB cable since that so common
is gonna be great to charge this up
really happy about this I'm gonna put
this over here as well since we all know
micro USB cables are like and it comes
with a lens hood interesting I didn't
know that so like as you guys can tell I
know nothing about this camera really
I'm pressing out for the first time I
read a couple of reviews heard it's
great so I'm really learning as I go
here alright and I believe this is the
actual camera and there's some more
stuff inside of here so let's see what
we've got it
there's two more things inside this box
so this is the pot on the battery so
it's a pretty small battery let's see
how many milliamp Syd is it's a 1080
milliamp battery now that doesn't sound
like much to me so I don't know how the
battery life is gonna be maybe this
doesn't require that much power but
there's a 1/2 1080 milliamp battery put
that to the side as well and oh this is
the actual flash so I'm gonna show you
guys what this looks like it comes in a
nice little case as well so that's
pretty cool but here we are I'm gonna
show you guys close-up and alright guys
this is the actual close-up of the flash
add-on so you can put this on top of the
actual camera you can mount it and it's
going down on the hop well it performs
it's very interesting that it's um got
this little part covered right here and
the flash seems to be tilted towards the
bottom so I don't know if it's really
going to illuminate much but we'll see
what happens um there seems to be a
little dial in the back here I'm not
sure what that's for but I will
definitely figure it out and let's see
there's oh yeah it opens up ello okay so
this is where you actually lock it there
you go
so this says lock on it
so this is where you lock it close the
top and it will stay in your camera and
now to the actual camera itself let's
open this up take a look here now this
is still pretty big for a camera that
I'm going to be walking around with
since the lens is so huge but there are
other options when it comes to different
lenses I can get a flatter smaller lens
so not really too worried there but
overall this does look pretty cool I
can't wait to give it a try let's see
here I'm going to give you guys a quick
close-up and give you a little tour of
the camera itself and all right guys
here we have the NX 5r so I've heard
really good things about this line I
can't wait to give this a try so you
know I suppose to a ton of like a couple
of people at Best Buy they really
recommended this for videos and all that
and I'm gonna give it a try see how it
works out if it doesn't work out well
then you know I can always change
exchange it for something else I was
also really looking at the end net then
the rx100 I know that gets tons of great
reviews but I heard that this might be a
little better for me and there's a lot
more features for the price the price
difference there's only 50 bucks more
and I can do a ton more with this so I
really wanted to check this out so as
you guys can see this lens can come on
and off they're interchangeable lens
here so I can always switch it up it's
almost like a hybrid between a DSLR and
a regular point-and-shoot so it's gonna
be really cool to try this out the
really cool thing about this as well is
that it has this little swivel
screen that you can kind of use it to go
like this which is gonna be perfect for
my vlogging as I'll be able to see where
I am if the cameras in focus or all that
good stuff and also this thing is Wi-Fi
capable I believe they said something
about it having apps so I'm not sure if
it's a huge library of apps but it's
gonna have some apps and the 16
megapixels what else is there about this
yeah that's I mean that's about it
that's about as much as I'll go into for
this unboxing in the review I'll have a
ton more information I'm gonna
still trying to keep the average
consumer friendly of course so you guys
can know if this is something you should
invest in it's a different kind of
camera for sure and we'll just see if
it's worth the price tag this is this
does retail for about 700 and of course
with accessories different accessories
it's gonna cost a little more and pretty
much that wraps it up guys you get a
couple of stuff here you get the lens
hood you get the flash you get on the
battery of course micro USB cable wall
adapter and a strap as well some user
information and all kinds of stuff and
that's about it guys
I'll trust me I will have a lot more
information in my review about this
camera and I'll let you guys know how it
is then alright thanks for watching this
is your average consumer it's a little
