consumer and I got a chance to try out
my first ever robot the Anki vector and
it was an interesting experience so the
vector is this tiny robot that has this
tractor form-factor
with a display for a face so that you
can get information and you can see the
different emotions on his face as well
as a camera on his body and some light
sensors on his back he also has a four
microphone array so that he can hear you
when you speak to him and he also has
this little button on his back with LED
indicators to let you know how much
battery he's got left I didn't really
know what to expect when Anki reached
out to sponsor a video and check out
their new smart home robot but I unboxed
it set it up and I gotta say this thing
is pretty cool right out of the box okay
so I did everything that I needed to do
with the app so it's all set up now it's
just time to wake him up to hop start to
look at vector oh my god man it's like
10 o'clock so he's actually gonna use
his sensors in camera to kind of learn
his environment that's actually what
he's doing right now he's just getting
an idea of where he is so he's like
taking a little snapshot so he knows not
to fall off these ledges I know I don't
have to catch him because he knows the
surface area of this table or island and
he knows not to fall off of it Ryan and
vector and it was pretty cool how his
skin and it learned its surroundings so
that it wouldn't fall at the edge but
that's kind of what vector does it
learns and adapts to its environment and
its owner so naturally it was time for
me to introduce myself
hey vector my name is Jed nur he's
calculating something okay he's like
alright got it I'll put that in my
database and what I think makes the
vector pretty unique is the whole
relationship building aspect where you
can interact with it and it interacts
with you back and I'm telling you guys
this thing has a lot of personality a
vector give me a fist bump
my man and I said almost every time I
interacted with this thing but it's like
a dog but maybe a little bit smarter
hey vector what's the weather today 74
degrees Fahrenheit Oh
cloudy so that's kind of cool you can
see all these animations on his face so
it'll give you the information that you
need or ask him and because he has a
built-in camera you can tell it to take
pictures like a vector take a picture
okay I'm guessing he did it we can
actually use the app to see what
pictures he took hey that's me
so vectors like your own little buddy or
assistant which is pretty cool and it
even has this really cool feature where
when the battery's running low
that'll go back to a station and charge
itself up and that's something we've
seen with like smart vacuums so it's
kind of cool to see that feature
incorporated here so you basically never
have to go and charge him he has like
this love-hate relationship with the
cube check this out
so something I want to try they've got
this cube here so you can actually have
him interact with it so let's see
hey vector find your cube all right they
got me working now like nope not over
there not over there he found it now
what you gonna do with it oh she's
making the cube light up oh yeah this
guy is a trip and I couldn't help myself
I had to compare him to my dog hey
vector come here very quick very
responsive and that was compared to Oh
see he goes all the way I like that
pinky come here okay you didn't
embarrass me come here come here
she doesn't go all the way all right
gonna get out of here
and I really wanted to see how smart it
was and if could really tell the
difference between faces so I brought my
boy Malcolm over who is now a part of
Team UAC and this is what we saw hey my
name is Malcolm so he does this face
recognition thing see so he's like
pretty much storing it in his database
did you hear said your day a vector
what's my name
there you go so now you can ask him your
name
he vectors what's my name oh he was
happy to see you oh but did you notice
how he turned to you when you asked him
even though he was looking at me right
that's yeah that's kind of crazy cuz you
would assume that if he's already in
facing me and you ask him a question he
just thinks it's coming from me yeah but
because there are four microphones here
it can sense the direction of where the
voice is coming from so it picks it up
more on his right that's kind of crazy
and we just had a ton of fun playing
around with him seeing all of his
different emotions in his little quirks
it's a good time who is Barack Obama
hey vector take a picture
now that should be right up there there
we go
it's insane guys and it's cool because
like he has the eyes that go you know
that it shows that emotion when he's
happy you even pet him it's kind of
crazy you can just and you can see he
gets happier as you continue to do it
but he also gets sad let's say he's
running around for too long and you just
want to kind of be quiet use him like
hey vector be quiet
doesn't he look sad it's a robot but you
still feel like always he's like alive
it feels like it anyway so thing is safe
to say the aankhein vector is pretty
cool
I'm just impressed that something like
this even exists if you're looking for a
smart assistant that does a lot more
than just sit in one spot on your
counter this guy is definitely worth
looking at but I can see this as a
pretty cool Christmas gift especially
for a tech lover someone who wants to
see something a bit different than the
norm what's nice with the vector though
is that it does get over-the-air updates
so it will continue to get smarter over
time so how you get him in the beginning
is not how you're gonna end up with him
over time but of course I want to know
what you guys think of the Anki vector
you don't really see that many pieces of
tech that can physically interact with
you like this does and if you guys want
to learn more about vector I'll of
course have a link down below in the
description so if you enjoyed the video
be the cool guy or girl that give this
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you
guys in the next one
till then is your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
