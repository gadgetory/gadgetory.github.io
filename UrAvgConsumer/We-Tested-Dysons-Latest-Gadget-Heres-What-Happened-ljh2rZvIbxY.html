consumer and today we're gonna be
looking at a peace attack that will fit
perfectly in any smart home this is the
Dyson cyclone v10 absolute now you might
know Dyson for their unconventional but
high-tech products like their bladeless
fan supersonic hairdryer but they also
make smart home products but Dyson will
no longer be designing courted vacuums
all of their future models will be like
this one cord free so I gotta give a
huge shout out to Dyson for not only
sponsoring today's video but sending me
one of these before it was even released
but of course you guys don't have to
unbox this thing and see what it could
do
alright guys this is it this is Dyson's
cyclone v10 absolute this is supposed to
replace a full-fledged vacuum this thing
it's so skinny but this is pretty much
it this is the torque drive cleaner head
this is the standard head that you would
put on it if you just want to vacuum up
the floor and it of course has some
extra nozzles and accessories here so
you can kind of switch it up depending
on how you plan to clean and this
thing's got a v10 motor which had about
25 engineers working on it yeah and it
took them five years to develop this so
it's supposed to be really powerful even
though it has this compact body so you
ready to hear it alright I'm gonna put
on I'm gonna put a straight up for max
all right here we go
Chloe so tiny even a big bar so yeah
it's pretty surprising that something so
compact and skinny could be this
powerful but you guys know we had to
test this thing out and see if it was as
powerful as they claimed all right so
we're gonna do a little test with the
brushes we're gonna do a real-life test
if you have any little kids running
around or if you're as clumsy as Ari
yeah yeah so we're gonna take some
cookies oh it's gonna be a waste of good
cookies but we're gonna crunch them up
and have it they leave a spot on the
floor and see if how well this thing can
actually pick it up and this is like my
nice I love this rug and I can imagine
the crumbs getting all inside of this so
I'm a little worried but this is for the
sake of science oh my gosh that that
that crushes my soul that I won cookie
that's all no no oh geez Ari that's like
embedded Oh as you see there's some big
crumbs too and you can actually move
this thing so you can take in bigger
pieces so it has a little slot so if you
need to think in bigger pieces you can
do that ready
hold who do you see this
what I I was afraid that's like oh great
this thing is gonna fail this test cuz
you really got it in there yeah that big
Crum like it's nothing so right now
we're about to do something that I've
been meaning to do forever but first I
want you guys to take a look at this see
what's inside of here it's nothing but
dust
but you see right here on the floor
don't mind the little tiny white pieces
it's the black hairs that you can't see
that come off Aries head all the time
that are all over this carpet so we're
gonna try this out and see what we pull
up
wow that is a lot of hair I told you
your hairs get everywhere got time to
clean it up though the brush was pretty
cool but there was the second one that
caught my eye the second I took it out
the box and that's the soft roller
cleaner head that actually has a roller
inside that has a soft fuzzy material
and surprisingly it does a really good
job okay guys so right now we've got the
soft roller cleaner our head and this
one's actually pretty interesting
because it's got like this fuzzy
material it's really soft to the touch
and this is used for sensitive surfaces
and to pick up things like dust and
powder so we've got some right here
we're gonna put it to the test and see
what it can do so let's try it out this
is on max let's see if it gets this
whole thing
that's actually really impressive
so that was baking soda we dropped a ton
and this thing picked it up in one swoop
that's pretty awesome and what's even
more impressive is the fact that there's
not like a ton of powder all over the
brush it still looks brand-new now the
main tool tools are great but it also
comes with a ton of different
attachments and accessories but what's
also awesome is the fact that this thing
can be broken down into a much much
smaller foam factor so if you want to
get into small little crevices places
that you typically can't reach you're
definitely going to be able to do that
with this and I actually think it's
really convenient
so overall the Dyson cyclone v10 is very
impressive and in terms of battery life
this thing has up to 60 minutes of usage
and what's nice here is that even if you
get closer to depleting the battery you
don't have to worry about the power
fading it stays consistent the entire
time it also takes three and a half
hours to charge but unless you're
vacuuming for a really long period of
time that's not really going to be an
issue because where you actually dock
the vacuum and put it away is where it
actually charges so when you're not
using it it's getting charged up and
speaking of battery life the battery
interface lets you know how much juice
you've got left as well as if there's a
blockage or if you need to change the
filter as for the filter this thing has
a built-in HEPA filtration system if you
happen to be allergic to dust or dander
like re you're gonna really appreciate
this and according to Dyson the air that
gets pushed out of this vacuum is
cleaner than the air that we typically
breathe which is kind of crazy
and even though overall this thing is
pretty light with a smaller form factor
than your typical vacuum it still has a
large enough bin where you won't need to
stop to constantly change it so let me
know what you guys think of the v10 is
this something that you would want in
your home are there other pieces of tech
that have really unconventional designs
that you find work really well let me
know what's a comment down below I'm
really interested in hearing your
thoughts but I'll catch you guys in the
next one hopefully enjoyed this if you
did be the pool guy girl that gives it a
thumbs up and I'll catch you in the next
one till then it's your average consumer
