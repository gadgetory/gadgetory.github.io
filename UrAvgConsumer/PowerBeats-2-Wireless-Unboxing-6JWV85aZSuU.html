consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of the brand new
powerbeats2 Wireless now ever since you
guys heard that these were coming out
you've been asking me if I was gonna
unbox and review them of course I am so
let's not waste any time
let's get right into it
yup and alright guys here we have the
powerbeats2 wireless or power beats
squared however you want to look at it
but this is it and one thing I want to
mention is that their packaging looks
amazing this looks great
it's definitely a new look by Beats as
far as like you know the packaging is
concerned and we know beats likes to Wow
in the looks department so good job for
them and just taking a quick look around
the box we've got LeBron James here back
here it shows us some of the features so
it has wireless bluetooth connectivity
this is Wireless of course it also has
six hours of battery life so it's a
little less than what I'm used to from
my blue buds X it has remote talk it
also has sweat and water resistance it's
adjustable ear hooks and it comes with a
carrying case also here you see a full
picture of it but here it is so let's
get to the actual unboxing of it here we
have a little tab that we're going to
just rip off so we can get rid of this
little seal so so far it looks like no
need for the unboxing knife so boom
there we go with that and let's see how
do we do this okay so you can just pull
it up from that little tab there and
here you have it
okay so here says charge me up before
you turn me on and this is a quick
charge is 15 minutes so you get an hour
of playback within 15 minutes of
charging which is actually pretty cool
so it has a quick charge feature 15
minutes of charging one hour of playback
so if you want to make a quick run to
the gym charge these up for a little bit
and you're good to go so there we go so
we can pull this down and let's see what
else we've got here let me see if I can
pull this whole thing out
all right so got that out so we've also
got a carrying case here um over here
should be some earbuds let's see what
else and of course you've got some
booklets and all right that's everything
that's inside the box and then they did
a really good job with packaging all
right so first things first let's check
out the boring stuff the paperwork it's
got a little seal here a little sticker
so let me pop this thing off and let's
see here so our first pieces of
paperwork are a QuickStart guide and
this will give you more information on
how to use the actual earbuds tensity
have adjustable hooks
it's got battery life so it's giving you
information about that different ear
tips how to adjust it so all that kind
of information is inside of this
QuickStart guide we've also got a beats
sticker as well as some warranty and
safety information so we can put those
two things aside so that's that for the
paperwork now let's see what else we get
inside of this little bundle here looks
like it's a charging cable so let's see
if we can pull that out it's a small
charging cable and you also you also get
something else this little box is
interesting there we go pop it open a
bit more little ripped it not cool all
right and you guess you got some ear
pads here that are stuffed to it with
some kind of adhesive and they've got
little pictures of this so you can I
guess just tear these open they have a
little slit so you can tear it open so
we can use the earbuds that you want
with them your power beats now this is a
really tiny charging cable I hate when
tiny charging cables are included is
just like why not just give a long one
so we can plug it into the wall and be
good to go but either way that's what's
included these are the I guess the
little accessories here and also
included is a travel case so this is a
hardshell traveling case and it's a
little on the large side definitely
should be able to hold those with no
problem since these are bigger earbuds
so let's open it up and see what else we
got
so all we've got is just the case there
is no pouch or anything for extra buds
you just got the case it would have been
closed they included a pouch here
especially considering these have
different ear tips so putting the ear
tips in there would have been nice but
um this is all you get it's a hardshell
case new oval design so that's nice so
not I've gotten through all of these let
me clean here up a bit and then we're
going to look at the actual powerbeats2
alright so now that we've gotten here
cleaned up a bit let's see what these
powerbeats2 Wireless are like so you can
see the ear buds are here in the back so
you want to pull these out and then boom
they're attached to that and boom
they're free so I might have to fix
these ear bud back down in place and
here we have it guys these are the
powerbeats2 Wireless now they've got a
short cable and they actually include an
inline or a remote talk control which is
has a rubberized feel to it which is new
has a rubberized feel of course it
includes a microphone and all the
standard buttons play/pause volume
controls and I'm pretty sure oh these
will actually work for Android and Apple
devices because it's bluetooth so these
all will work instead of just the plain
pause which is really nice as you can
see here at the bottom we have these
little clips to kind of adjust the power
beats so the length of it so if you want
this to be a little closer to your neck
you can do that and then have like a
little string hanging off but this is it
but overall the length isn't bad at all
it really does remind me of my jaybird
blue buds ex but I'm pretty curious as
to how these will feel in the ear can't
wait to try these out but let's take a
quick look around and see what kind of
buttons and features will find on the
actual headphone so far it looks like
there's a power button at the top where
you just hold that down and then a
little white light will shine so you'll
know that it's powered on and also at
the bottom of the left ear bud you'll
see a little tab here I think you can
kind of pull this down
or okay so there you go you can pull it
down and then it gives you access to the
microUSB charging so like I said guys
this thing features six hours of battery
life that's what it is saying on the box
um not much else to this earbud that's
all there is to it I'm sure you can pair
it using the different buttons here so
that's about it for this unboxing guys
it's a really quick unboxing but it's a
first look at the powerbeats2 wireless
the ear hooks are supposed to be
adjustable so I'm gonna see if I can
fiddle around with that doesn't seem
that adjustable as right now but that's
why we have the Quick Start Guide I'm
gonna check it out let you guys know
what I think and then I will let you
guys know in a full review how these
stack up against other wireless earbuds
like the Jaybirds bluebloods x and if
it's worth your two hundred dollars
these retail for two hundred bucks so
we'll see how that goes and yeah that's
about it for this unboxing guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy that hits a thumbs up
button and subscribe to the channel for
more coverage on these new powerbeats2
wireless earbuds hopefully you enjoyed
it till the next video guys peace
