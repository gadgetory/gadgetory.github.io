consumer and it's that time of year
again time to check out some of the best
tech for the holidays and we're gonna be
doing a ton of gift guides this year so
be sure to be subscribed to the channel
and hit that Bell notification button so
that you can get notified whenever we
drop these new videos but before we
continue we got to give a huge shout out
to away for sponsoring today's video so
this is the away carry-on luggage now
I've got to carry on here but all of
their sizes include its German
polycarbonate materials 360 wheels so
that you can pull and walk with it
upright a tsa approved combination lock
to keep your stuff secure and as a bonus
you even get a removable laundry bag but
what I really want to highlight here is
the fact that their carry ons are able
to charge your tech I love not having to
worry about an outlet while I'm at the
airport and keeping my stuff close to me
while it charges and I even includes a
10,000 milliamp hour portable charger
right inside of the suitcase with this
you'll be able to charge your cell phone
a few times your tablet or wireless
earbuds whatever you want you'll be able
to try to write with your suitcase so
obviously this thing's going with us to
CES in January and they've even got
accessories and bags in a ton of sizes
and colors that come with a lifetime
guarantee and 100-day trial so even
those are some good gift options or you
can do what I do most years and grab a
gift card if you guys are interested in
checking it out and you want to save
twenty bucks on a suitcase head on over
to away travel comm slash your average
consumer and be sure to use the promo
code your average consumer at checkout
and first up on our list is this
dashboard camera now I think that this
would be a great gift because
unfortunately in November Ari and I and
even my in-laws got into separate car
accidents and I just couldn't help but
think that it would have been great to
have a dashboard camera so that we can
capture everything right when it
happened so I found this dashboard
camera called the e 2.7 K ultra dash cam
this dash cam it's got a 2.7 K
resolution which isn't quite 4k but it
gives great quality nonetheless and his
wide angle lens spans three lanes which
should cover all bases in case anything
happens it's got an F 1.9 aperture lens
which should help it to get really good
shots even at night and as a bonus it
even has voice controls this means you
can take pictures start recording or
even stop recording without even taking
your hands off the wheel now you guys
know how much I love voice controls so
buying this was a no-brainer
so I had this feature overall I was
pretty pleased with the quality that I
got out of this camera so I think this
will be a great gift for someone you
know who's a driver especially if they
do
uber and related to voice commands I of
course had to include the brand new echo
- when I first unboxed is doing my
massive tech unboxing I wasn't too sure
what this did differently from the
original
echo besides coming in a completely
different footprint but after messing
with it for some time I'm starting to
understand what they did here the Amazon
echo - does all the things the first
iteration does like answer questions
plays music from streaming services
control smart home appliances and it can
even make calls and distinguished voices
but it can now also play music from your
phone directly to its speaker so that
you can finally use your echo as a
Bluetooth speaker for your phone or
whatever other device you want to
connect to it and what's also nice is
that it can connect to an external
Bluetooth speaker so if you have
something a bit more powerful you can
connect the echo to it which the first
one couldn't do before
and personally this is a feature I was
waiting for the main echo to get because
it seemed like a waste to have that nice
speaker and not be able to connect my
phone to it I personally think that this
is a great gift for someone to have if
they're interested in starting a smart
home or they want something that's just
pretty useful to have around and
especially for older relatives because
this kind of enters them towards having
that smarter home what it also does is
that it opens the door to being able to
give smart home tech as gifts and you
can kind of help that person tech out
their home and right now it's only 80
bucks which i think is absolutely a
steal and another way to add an extra
bit of tech to someone's home is through
a smart picture frame this one by next
is eight inches and can display both
photos and videos it has a 720p display
which is the perfect resolution for this
size and it's also got speakers for your
video playback with this you just plug
in your micro sd card or a flash drive
and your media starts to play but one of
the coolest features about this photo
frame is the motion sensor this photo
frame will detect when you walk into a
room and turn on and it'll turn off
whenever you leave and unlike the one
we've currently got in our bedroom this
one's got a cool calendar and clock
display that you can turn on or off and
your best belief we're gonna be
replacing ours with this one but I do
wish the bezels were a bit smaller
though but I still think that this makes
a great gift because we take pictures
all the time and we very rarely
print them out anymore so it's nice to
take those digital pictures throw them
on the frame here so that it could be
displayed in your home and next up we've
got a ghost tech and our g2 bag and
messenger bag and I featured this bag in
one of my favorite tech of the month
videos a few months ago and it was
easily the most talked-about product in
the comment section now what makes this
bag special is the fact that they
include built-in portable chargers and
all you got to do is connect your USB
cable to the bag and you'll be able to
charge any device with a sixteen
thousand milliamp portable charger
that's found in both the backpack and
the messenger bag and it even includes a
battery indicator right on the strap of
the bag so you know exactly how much
juice you've got left and when you're
gonna need to charge it which i think is
genius and on top of that this bag has
got a ton of compartments so you'll be
able to fit your books all your
different pieces of tech and it's also
water-resistant so you don't have to
worry about your tech getting ruined in
the rain
and while the messenger bag isn't as big
as the backpack it still has quite a few
compartments but you're not really
looking for bulk if you're looking at
the messenger bag anyway but a word of
warning with these bags is that the
colors can be a bit in your face the
messenger bag looks pretty normal on the
outside but inside it has a red interior
I believe this is the only color
available for it and it's pretty bright
but the backpack does come in quite a
few more color options I of course got
the teal but there are some normal same
color options as well like black and
grey so you can get whichever one fits
your needs I honestly think this is a
great gift to give someone or even
yourself having a portable charger built
into your backpack could definitely be a
lifesaver and last but not least we have
the Bose Soundlink micro 2 the sound
like you need to is hands-down one of my
favorite Bluetooth speakers that I've
tried this year and this is like its
baby brother and a $60 cheaper this
little guy comes in at a hundred and
nine dollars but it produces some really
impressive sound now this thing is
surprisingly loud for a speaker its size
and it has way more bass than I expected
and when I compared it to other speakers
with a similar footprint it beat them by
a longshot
those because we're quite a bit cheaper
but you can absolutely see the
difference in quality due to that
difference in price not to mention this
thing is waterproof and it's got a
rugged rubberized design so that this
thing is perfect for taking out on the
go especially if you're gonna go near a
pool as makes a great companion for that
and I found that Bluetooth speakers are
great gives
for teens so that they can take their
music with them on the go and listen to
it with their friends but if you guys
are interested in the micro two or maybe
even the meaning two I'll have them both
link down below in the description you
can't go wrong with either one but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed
I'll have more gift guides coming at
different price points so you guys can
see what hot tech is available for
different prices but total x1 guys are
average consumer if you enjoyed it be
the cool guy girl that give this video a
thumbs up and I will catch you guys in
the next one so then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
