consumer and today we're gonna be
spending a real day in the life with the
oneplus 60 McLaren Edition and for those
of you who have never seen one of my
real dating life videos you're pretty
much gonna be spending the day with me
and the phone as we test out things like
the performance camera battery life all
the things you'd come to expect and
we're gonna see how it performs in the
real world but first shout-out to
ExxonMobil for partnering with us for
today's video but let's see how the
oneplus sixty did in the real world okay
guys so we're officially starting our
day with a one plus sixty McLaren
Edition it's 11 a.m. and we've got a
hundred percent battery but can we stop
for a second and take a look at this
beautiful design this thing is
absolutely gorgeous it has like these
nice orange accents and this carbon
fiber under this black best looking
phone that oneplus has made yet
hands down very easy to say that for
those of you who don't know what the
difference is between the McLaren
Edition and the regular one plus 60 this
thing has 10 gigs of RAM which is insane
this thing has more RAM than some
computers have right now and it also has
what oneplus is calling warp charging
it's all about speed this thing is
inspired by the McLaren f1 and I'm just
really excited to try it out it's also a
pretty awesome unboxing experience most
of the accessories that you get are
black and orange so it kind of fits with
the whole theme and it also comes with
hype this little book that gives you
more history about the McLaren but we've
got some pretty exciting things to do
today we got stopped by New York for a
meeting and then we are going to be
moving in to the new studio guys so
assume you're gonna have to say goodbye
to this place because we got a new spot
y'all alright guys so now we're on our
way to New York and I gotta say now that
I'm out here where there's concrete on
the floor this feels scary to leave just
like it is it's a very very beautiful
phone and I feel like you just have to
look at it the way it is putting a case
on it seems blasphemous but it just it
feels wrong to use it it just feels
wrong but I feel super nervous right now
because this is pretty slippery I'm not
gonna lie it's a pretty slippery phone
let's just hope nothing happens - I'm
gonna go caseless I'm being brave y'all
so right now we are headed over to the
city got about a 28 minute drive started
off at like 30 so we're gonna see how
that impacts the battery right now we
are sitting pretty with 84% battery all
right guys now in New York and I needed
to make a pit stop at Home Depot get a
few things for the move that we're going
to be doing today and I'm actually gonna
go take a picture of the store front we
got some clouds
I think this be a good shot for testing
out some dynamic range snow that is a
clean image it's a little bit dark in
the shadowy areas but overall I am very
happy with this you've got a little
point here to see what we can get with
this guy oh nice oh there's a lot
sharper than I expected that's a pretty
clean image you guys can see the detail
on the little ribbon here can't even
tell but when you zoom in see all that
detail us that's a good look sharpness
is on point guys look at these bins
right here it's like they knew I was
coming in you all right guys so that has
to be the worst Home Depot experience
I've ever had way too many things went
wrong so that's we're just gonna leave
it at that but right now I need to get
some gas
so Exxon's got this really cool speed
pass plus app where you can just open it
up and since I'm at Home Depot right now
all I have to do is hit fine station and
boom I know exactly where I need to go
and I can get my directions so it's that
simple if you ever lost and you need to
get gas you don't have to do much work
just open the speed pass plus op ok guys
so now we're at the Mobil station and
we're gonna use this B Pass Plus app to
pay for our gas all right guys so I've
got the app open and all I have to do to
get started is hit pay for fuel and
what's nice is the app will
automatically detect which gas station
I'm in and then I just hit what pump I'm
at - so I'm at number 1 as you guys can
see over here and all I have to do after
that is hit authorize pump
and with that I'll be able to select my
payment method and start pumping and
this is probably one of the easiest ways
you'll find to pay for gas but what's
also really nice is that in gas stations
you'll typically find a lot of people
get their credit card information stolen
thanks to scammers unfortunately but
with this way it is completely safe no
credit card information is going into
the scanner here so you're 100% safe and
I think that's just a way to do it
so no personal information given gas is
pumped and we're good to go so not only
is this a safer way to pay for your gas
well you can also add on your rewards
plus card so that you can earn towards
future purchases and like this you're
paying for your gas and earning rewards
at the same time which is a no-brainer
and if you guys want to learn more out
of course have links down below in the
description there's a game changer
alright guys so right now we are on our
way back to the studio it's a 46 minute
drive ahead of us folks I'm not looking
forward to it but can't stay in New York
okay so the days pretty much winding
down it's like 7 p.m. I was just getting
some food I guess I dinner lunch
whatever you want to call it first time
I ate today which isn't good but it is
7:05 p.m. and just to give you guys a
battery update we are sitting at 38
percent which is actually really good 30
percent at the end well close to the end
of the day end of a normal workday this
actually is pretty solid and we have
about 4 hours and 45 minutes of screen
on time wow that is really really
impressive
so while eating I was watching this
video about this guy who trained like
Michael B Jordan for 30 days and I will
say screen is good the colors are nice
this is a very very nice screen to enjoy
some content on and what I like is when
i zoom in for you know watching a
youtube video in full screen on a 18 by
9 phone the notch isn't that bad like
you can obviously notice it when there
isn't a black background here but it's
not that bad there have been worse
notches out there
but watching on this the teardrop notch
is probably the best notch I've seen so
far and might I add I tweeted this but I
am not very proud of myself watching
these guys train talk about having a
great diet after I just destroyed a ton
of food like I'm almost embarrassed how
bad I did this ok guys so we just moved
a few things into the new studio let me
give you a quick super quick tour of it
over here we've got a closet and then we
got a kitchen and then we've got another
open space there's a lot of stuff going
on here guys right now this is just a
few things that we picked up from the
studio it's gonna look crazy messy
inside of here soon but if you guys want
to see a full studio tour once we get it
all hooked up definitely leave a thumbs
up on the video but in terms of the 1
plus 60 I'm probably gonna call it a day
for work I'm gonna take it home use it
as much as I can and then we'll try to
kill this battery which has been doing
really really well and this is just one
of the spaces here guys I've got another
space to show you in another video okay
guys so got back home not too long ago
it is 12:30 6:00 in the morning I am
working on a video right now for
tomorrow the grind never stops but we do
have to finish talking about the oneplus
60 honestly guys the battery life is
just absolutely insane on this guy let's
see where we're at in terms of screen on
time 20% left 5 hours and 25 minutes of
screen on time so that it's absolutely
insane I think what I'm done with this
video I'm gonna let it render out and
while I wait for that to happen I'll
probably play some games try to kill the
battery a bit and then maybe take
advantage of that warped charging and
I'll let you guys know how that goes but
let's talk about the overall experience
that we're getting here so one thing
about this phone when you swipe up
you'll notice at the very top you got
that black and orange color scheme and
that is of course because it is the
McLaren edition of the oneplus 60
matches the back which is a fingerprint
magnet if you
I can't see tons of fingerprints
throughout the day so if you really want
to see that carbon fiber you're gonna
have to look through those fingerprints
first and now there's something we
haven't talked about on the channel yet
and that's this in screen fingerprint
scanner and I gotta say it's okay it
definitely works so if you want to just
use it that's okay it's not as fast as
like the original that was in the back I
think that was a bit faster but honestly
nothing beats the face unlock check that
out that is just so fast guys
now performance wise this thing is an
absolute beast has the latest snapdragon
845 processor and it also has ten gigs
of ram now let's try something out with
all this ram you'd expect to be able to
go deep deep back into your apps and
maybe not have it reset if I can jump
into this app right now
kugali Alost is a game that if you open
too many apps it'll definitely restart I
don't know maybe it's really RAM
intensive but let's see Oh guys I am in
complete shock right now
you don't understand how many times I've
opened an app after using Google you're
lost like if I was on the camera what
sometimes it'll just kill the game that
game restarts this is shocking to me now
that for me is a huge indicator that
this ten gigs of ram is doing its job
Wow
okay guys I'm tired it is 2:00 in the
morning it's 214 we got seven percent of
battery left it's time to try out the
warp charger even though I'm gonna make
it to see it I'm so tired
what time is it the unnie what battery I
don't screen on time 6 hours 18 minutes
I think this is officially the longest
battery life I've had on a smartphone or
7% die from tinder I might have had more
I don't remember either way extremely
good battery life but let's see what
this warped charge
about you're supposed to be able to get
50% in just 20 minutes
look at this cable - this is a braided
orange cable black and orange says worth
charging McLaren looks really good I'll
take a screen shot so that I can keep
that for my records okay guys so it's
been about 20 minutes and it's shown 56%
battery so that is a good look the
claims were right so you get at least
50% in a 20 minute charge which is
insane and I know I just asked if
there's a special sign or something that
comes up when your warped charging and
there you have it it's pretty nice but
all right guys
2:39 in the morning I'm getting some
sleep and there you have it guys that
was the day and I will tell you guys it
was a very long day but what was really
impressive was the fact that the oneplus
60 was able to hang with me throughout
the entire day I even had to do a little
bit more to kill the battery life at the
end playing a couple of games but I was
really surprised at the overall
performance of this phone I think the
Standard Edition is a really good value
starting off at five $49.99
but you can spend a little bit more if
you want more space more RAM the McLaren
Edition does have the most space in RAM
that you could possibly get and it also
looks good but that is completely up to
you on whether or not you think it's
worth the extra 150 bucks compared to
the very base model but from my personal
experience with it if I had the one +16
McLaren Edition and someone told me it
was a $700 phone I would completely
believe them and think it was a
justified price but just knowing there's
that much cheaper version out there if
you're looking for a great value that's
probably the one you want but with the
McLaren Edition you do also get the
addition of warp charging which will
give you at least 50% within 20 minutes
of charging which I found to be true and
I gotta say guys it is amazing that this
phone can do that especially with the
size
it has inside you're not gonna be able
to kill this phone this hole is
definitely going to last with you
throughout your entire day it's a solid
performer I really do think that it is a
good buy now the only issues that I have
with it is that this one is a bit
slippery it's an amazing phone to look
at but it will definitely slip in your
hand because of that glass back but
you'll probably throw a case on here but
if you I don't know it's kind of hard to
really justify putting a case on this
one when you're buying it for its design
and possibly other features but honestly
I would throw a case on it for everyday
usage but basically guys this phone did
everything I would want my smartphone to
do it performed really well played all
my games without any hiccups especially
when it was on the verge of dying under
10% usually my games tend to start
acting a little funny start lagging a
bit but it held up just fine here so
that was really impressive so
performance definitely not an issue it
has a beautiful design the body looks
great the screen looks really nice so
watching content on it it's great even
that teardrop notch looks really really
nice I think it has like a classy look
when it comes to notches can't believe I
just said that the camera also performs
really well I'm still gonna be honest
with you guys didn't say I am spoiled by
the pixel 3 but this one does a good
enough job if we're not even considering
the pixel 3 or anything
this one does really well only thing I'd
say is that the darker areas in a shot
tends to be pretty dark but is
absolutely usable especially considering
that there's also a night mode so if you
want to take photos at night where it's
not very well lit this will be able to
perform just fine this is just a really
good phone I absolutely recommend it and
honestly this McLaren Edition I think it
might be the phone that I carry around
in my pocket alongside my iPhone it
might be the Android that I take around
I'm gonna have to get rid of that pixel
3 camera but as an overall phone I think
I like the oneplus 16 a bit more but not
about wraps up for this video guys if
you were on the fence about picking up
one of these oneplus sixties I
falou think you should it is a great
great value it is a high-performing
phone I think it's worth it McLaren
Edition it's up to you but personally I
like the way it performed it did a lot
of surprising things for me in terms of
keeping apps open with all that RAM so
that was really solid and that fast
charging or warped charging can't beat
it but that about wraps it up for this
video guys hopefully you enjoyed it if
you did be the Polgara girl I give this
video a thumbs up I'll catch you guys in
the next one
till then is your average consumer case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
