and today we've got another favorite
tech of the month video this time for
the month of August and this is a video
where actually you guys some text that
I've taken a real liking to in the past
month whether it's old or new tech and
first up we've got this guy
the ghost Tech in our g2 backpack now
this is an awesome tech oriented
backpack and it has a lot of cool
features so first thing you'll notice is
that it has a USB port and that's
because there's a built-in portable
charger now why that's awesome is
because most backpacks that have this
feature usually require you to put your
own portable charger in here but this
one has it built in so it has a
dedicated portable charger which is
16,000 milliamp hours which is quite a
bit so that's a really awesome capacity
and when you need to charge that
portable charger you have a little slot
here with a micro USB port where you can
just charge it up you don't have to
worry about pulling out the portable
charger or anything like that just plug
in your backpack and you're good to go
now another really cool feature about
the whole portable charger thing is when
you have it on or even if you don't have
it on right here you have an LED
indicator that lets you know Justin just
how much juice you've got left so with
this you can just know when you need to
go charge your portable charger there's
no guessing games here still looks like
a regular normal backpack but it's got
this cool functionality so you can keep
your device's charged honestly this
thing is just an ideal guide your
backpack
I do wish this color was just black on
the inside they could have just left
these as accents but they've got other
colors as well they've got black a thing
they've got grey and they've got red so
you don't have to stick with this but if
you also worry about theft and getting
your laptop stolen or anything like that
you don't have to worry because it has
these flaps here so you can actually
just pull us over and then you have
access to your laptop compartment as
well as your tablet compartment and you
can put some more stuff like books in
here so you don't have to worry about
being able to carry things like that
and it's waterproof or water resistant
which is great for your tech and if this
kind of backpack isn't your style they
also offer some other options as well
they've got like this messenger bag
which has the exact same features it
itself has a ton of compartments so you
can fill this up with a ton of stuff and
they've also got this little satchel
here that also has a 16,000 milliamp
hour battery with the exact same
features LED indicator all that stuff
yeah they offer a pretty wide range of
gear with these awesome features so I
have it all linked down below in the
description as well as everything else
in this video now guys do you see this
over here just please just just take a
look at this
my baby's missing she's in the shop
though she'll be back that's why the
screens are all black my heart but
moving on over here this is what my baby
got me she got me the Z board too
she worked with Z boards who will get
this in house but guys this thing I love
it as you can see there's a lot of where
i've been using it quite a bit but this
is just a great take on the electric
skateboard now z boards the company that
actually got me into Electric
skateboards and what's really awesome
about how they go about it is that in
the front and back you've got these foot
pads that are your acceleration up front
brake in the back so what that means is
you don't need a remote of any sort to
move so it's all pressure-sensitive so
based on how much you pressure you put
down on the front how much you lean
forward depends on that determines how
fast you go and if you need to stop you
just lean back on the brakes and boom so
what I like about the Z board too is
that it is now way way lighter than the
previous version so this one is
manageable to walk around with if it
dies on you you don't have to worry
about chugging around a really heavy
board so they did some really really
great improvements and something that
says the Z board apart from other
Electric skateboards is this thing has
crazy range so instead of having like
six to eight miles of range this thing
can go up to 16 miles and I think there
are pearl versions 24 so you can use
these things for a hot minute without
worrying about it dying on you can go up
to 20 miles per hour and one thing that
I really do like here
is that they've got headlights as well
so with the power button you can just
kind of turn on the headlights whenever
you need so you can make sure that
nobody misses you while you're out and
about if it got taillights as well so
you can see that they're having that
there huh so few shots as eboard and not
baby forgetting this in house now the
next thing we got to talk about is this
guy this is the Razer hammerhead bTW so
these are Bluetooth earbuds that
actually really surprised me these are
by Razer and you know they're known for
gaming headsets and gaming peripherals
but I didn't know that they made regular
headphones or earbuds for listening to
just casual music and after trying these
out I was actually pretty surprised
these are nice they have quite a bit of
bass which I'm a fan of you guys know
this but the one thing that I really
like is the design here so you'll notice
this thing in the back which is when I
first saw it I was like what is this why
it has a magnet but what it does is let
me show you so you put on your earbuds
like this right and you take this you
put it on the collar of your shirt and
then you let us stick together and it
pretty much holds on to your shirt so
you don't have to worry about your
earbuds moving or falling off that's
just pretty strong magnet so they stay
together and you can just move around
with no problem now why I kind of like
this is because you guys know I've been
falling in love with that little neck
band design but this kind of takes the
deed for something like that away so you
could move around not worry about them
falling out because it's actually
secured on to your shirt and it makes it
easier to store you can just kind of
take them crumple them up throw them in
your pocket so you get the same
functionality as a neck band almost but
with this more typical design now you
still get all the stuff like an inline
remote of course you get eight hours of
battery life and you also get this
pretty cool feature of having a pulsing
light right on the logos of the earbuds
so you know
razor does things green lights
everywhere but this is actually really
nice surprising and it's less than a
hundred bucks so you get all the typical
stuff that you expect from a pair of
Bluetooth earbuds like this and a pretty
nice functional design so I'm a huge fan
and lastly since this is favorite tech
of the month I got to show you guys all
the things that I've been using and I
have been on splatoon too with the
Nintendo switch like crazy like it is
extremely hard for me to put this down
so every time I have downtime I am on
this game and I know a lot of people
don't have the switch or maybe if you do
have the switch maybe splits in two
might not be on your radar but let me
tell you when this thing was out for the
Wii U I didn't care for it and never
looked interesting but after playing it
it is a fun game so the idea of this
game is to ink up all of the territory
that you're gonna be playing on so the
whole map you want to get as much ink on
it as possible and it is just so so fun
now at first it seems kind of juvenile
because of the way the characters look
but it is deceptively fun and me and how
you have been playing it non-stop in
this game is surprisingly competitive
there's tons of weapons and different
specials lots of different things or
ways you can go about playing it and you
know basically winning the game and I
honestly I died at the end but yeah guys
that's listened to it's a great game if
you have a switch and it hasn't been on
your radar because it looks too kitty
trust me it is worth the try but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that give this
video a thumbs up I'll catch you guys in
the next one
so Dennis your average consumer piece</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
