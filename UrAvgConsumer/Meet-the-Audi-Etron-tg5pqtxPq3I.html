consumer and right now I am in San
Francisco out he was cool enough to
sponsor a trip for me to come out and
see the brand new all-electric SUV this
is the Audi e-tron now the e-tron is
awesome but what was really cool is the
little event that they had leading up to
the announcement we were on this cool
boat we have tons and tons of food guys
you know I had to indulge having me a
lot of good shrimp it was definitely a
cool time got a chance to talk to a lot
of cool people talk some cars but what
was really great was the announcement
now as per any launch announcement ow d
of course went and talked about the
mindset behind creating the e-tron and
something that actually really stood out
to me during the event was the fact that
they didn't claim to be the first to do
this but they really put it out there
that they wanted to do this thing right
and I feel like they really focused on
this since the e-tron has been a concept
since 2009 and nine years later we've
actually got a car to look at it's that
guy right there this is the Audi e-tron
it's actually positioned between the q5
and the q7 in terms of size now there
are a lot of cool features we're gonna
talk about but unfortunately some of
them won't make it over to the u.s. of
course regulations and all that stuff so
some of these features are gonna be in
Europe only but you got to talk about
the cool tech that's actually in it
though now with this thing being an
electric vehicle of course we're not
talking about one of the most important
parts about it and that's how you charge
it so right here look at that you just
press the button and you have access to
the socket where you actually plug it in
charge it up with the standard charging
that you'll probably have in your home
it'll take about nine hours to charge
but on the actual road when you're on
the highways the high-voltage chargers
are gonna be able to get this thing to
80% in 30 minutes
there are cellphones that can't do that
guys now there is no official rating in
terms of how far this thing can go in
terms of the range that's still to be
announced but based on the European
numbers we might see somewhere close to
the 200 range now fast charging is one
thing but we got to talk about the
batteries and the batteries are actually
all right under the bottom of the car so
as you can see these are each of the
individual 36 cells and interesting
enough the batteries are actually liquid
cold so even though there are 36 of them
here and when you're using them like
crazy liquid
system allows it to just keep going and
not overheat and here we have the front
motor and even here you'll see that it's
liquid cool this is this little chamber
here that allows the motor to stay cool
and you've even got it here on the rear
motor which is a bit bigger than the
front motor you can consistently try and
go push this thing to zero to sixty the
liquid cooling system allows that to
happen without a problem now what's
really unfortunate guys is that there's
some really cool tech when it comes to
the rear view mirrors but for the us
we're gonna have standard mirrors and
this is pretty much what we're missing
out on guys this is the rear view mirror
this is an OLED screen right here so
with this you can see behind you now
something else that's really cool and
unfortunately also not going to be in
the US just yet
is matrix lighting matrix lighting is
basically going to be able to detect
when cars are around you and pretty much
keep your high beams on but when there's
oncoming traffic it'll actually turn it
so that it doesn't get in the way of the
other drivers well let's take a look
inside all the cool things that they've
got going on all right guys so now we
are inside and check this out guys
we've got two displays here this is of
course where you can control pretty much
everything and you've got your climate
controls down here at the bottom so
you've got a second display now one
thing that's really cool about these is
that when you press an actual button you
get a haptic feedback so it feels like
you're actually pressing something so
you can get that you know real button
feel you know you kind of press
something you want to feel it and I like
that you can do that but if you don't
like that you can turn it off you can
even turn off the little clicks that you
hear as well and even in the back you've
got a small capacitive touchscreen so
you can control the climate in the back
as well this is all powered by a video
so you can expect that this thing is
going to feel very smooth and fluid and
guys we know that this car has a ton of
cameras and sensors all around to help
with all kinds of features but when you
press this little Park Assist feature
when you can see all around you you can
see all kinds of angles but there's a 3d
mode and check this out
so with the 3d mode I just see awesome
Zevon's little legs over here so I could
see mr. Evans legs I can see all around
the car I think this thing is just
awesome so when you're parking you know
exactly what your car is dealing with
this thing is in 3d guys 3d and crazy
enough guys
the car actually has Alexa built into it
unfortunately I can't show you here
because we don't have a data connection
could you imagine just going home and
saying Alexa turn on all the lights or
something or turn on the lights in the
garage that's gonna be nuts and of
course in a car like this you're getting
access to car play as well as Android
auto and that's kind of what I've been
enjoying about out of these cars they
just give you a lot of different options
and you know smart features right at
your fingertips
and something else that's pretty cool is
if you happen to be low on a charge the
car will automatically let you know the
nearest location so you can go ahead and
super charge this thing and get yourself
all juiced up and of course you've got
your virtual cockpit over here I've had
some experience with this with the Audi
q7 you guys might have seen that video
if you didn't I'll of course have it
linked down below in the description but
this thing has been updated with
high-resolution display and it's got
some like cool effects to it we're in
something like sport mode you guys can
see the gauges just kind of come over
now something that's also pretty cool is
if your phone supports wireless charging
not open Apple pay but you can see the
little battery your wirelessly charging
your phone so I think that's really
awesome but of course some of the
biggest features that you'd come to
expect on this like the adaptive cruise
control traffic jam assist are all
present here but what's actually nice is
that this is a capacitive touch steering
wheel and what that basically means is
when you're using something like
adaptive cruise control in the car is
just going for you of course it's gonna
want you to keep your hands on the
wheels at all times so you can take over
in the past it might have given you a
warning to keep your hands on the wheel
even if you might have kept it on the
wheel but you didn't move it at all but
now with the capacitive touch even if
you keep like your finger on it it's
going to know that your hands are on the
wheel and not give you any of those
warnings hey guys that's Austin but I am
actually really excited to see this
thing hit the streets it's supposed to
be out in spring of 2019 so that's not
too far off pre-orders are actually
available right now so if you guys want
to go and check it out I'll have that
link down below in the description but
hopefully you guys enjoyed this video if
you did be the cool guy girl that gives
us a thumbs up I'll catch you guys in
the next one let me know what you think
of the each one down below until then
