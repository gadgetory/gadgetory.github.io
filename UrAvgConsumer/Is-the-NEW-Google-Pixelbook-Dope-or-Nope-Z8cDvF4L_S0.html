consumer and today we're checking out
the brand new Google pixel book which is
supposed to be the best Chromebook out
so let's see what we get in the box but
before we get going we got to give a
huge shot to Full Sail University for
sponsoring today's video so let's get
this thing ripped open so first thing
we're greeted with oh by the way I do
have the pixel pen right here - we'll
get into that in a bit now this is
supposed to be - point of four pounds
and it's much lighter than is seen than
it sounds I know a lot of people will
complain it this is supposed to be a bit
heavy this is not bad at all
man this box is unnecessarily large but
what you get inside you get a cable you
get a double-sided USB type-c cable as
well as a wall adapter I think this is a
45 watt wall adapter so conduced this
thing up pretty quickly
and that's it for the box well that's it
unnecessarily large but uh whatever and
the pixel pen actually goes for about a
hundred bucks the pixel book itself
starts at $9.99 so a thousand bucks for
a Chromebook we have to see if it's
worth it but a thousand bucks here and a
hundred bucks here let's see you stir oh
yeah so tiny ol battery that just popped
out I didn't mention it but both boxes
do come with some paperwork I don't know
if you're gonna actually read it but
it's there that plastic baby where
things slides right out this could've
been dangerous this is clean and so a
quick look around this before we open it
up and get it powered up you've got two
USB type-c ports on each side a
headphone jack thankfully unlike the
phones
you also got a volume rocker on the left
side and all the way at the bottom
you've also got your power button and
this thing has a similar design to the
Google pixel phones it's got that
aluminum body and the glass Visor at the
top on the bottom though that has this a
grippy material here so that I guess it
doesn't slide around on the table so
that's actually kind of nice it's pretty
firm and here's what you get when you
open this
guy up on the palm rest areas you'll
have the same rubber material that you
got on the bottom here and this should
lead to a more comfortable typing
experience you of course got your
trackpad that's right in the middle it's
all kind of uniform which is nice and
you also have this little button here on
the keyboard which is the button for the
Google assistant so this has a dedicated
Google assistant button which makes
sense and you also have a backlit
keyboard which is nice but we'll see
that when we actually powered it on so I
just quickly ran through this out of
process when I realised I didn't speak
to you guys about specs so what you're
working with here this is actually the
base model so it has a seventh
generation Core i5 processor which can
be updated to a core i7 it also has
eight gigs of RAM which can be upgraded
to 16 gigs
it also has 128 gigs of solid-state
storage which can also be updated to 256
gigs or 512 and we're also working with
a twelve point three inch display that's
running at a 2400 by 1600 resolution and
that's a pretty good resolution and also
has a webcam and on their site it's a
720p at 60 FPS I don't know how many
megapixels one of you guys know feel
free to leave a comment down below but
you've got that as well and this is
meant to be the most powerful Chromebook
and you can definitely spec it out to be
if you want but I've got to put this guy
through his paces test out all of his
features and unless you guys know how it
does so first things first I love the
hardware this is a premium device at a
thousand bucks or starting at a thousand
bucks so you want the hardware to be
good and I really like what I see here
it's very comfortable the keyboard is
very nice to type on I like how thin it
is now as a laptop I can appreciate the
thinness but when you turn it into
tablet mode so when you flip it over
like this and you turn it into tablet
mode it's a bit thicker than any other
tablet that I've used which makes sense
and you've got this keyboard in the back
here that I don't know I really just
can't get over feeling the keys and even
though the keys aren't doing anything
when you have it in this mode it just
feels wrong to just have the keys
exposed and being touched like this for
the reason now why I do really like the
hardware it's something that I really
can't get over are the bezels so when
you're using it in tablet mode these
bezels they're just really big I'm not a
fan and the fact that this has an aspect
ratio
that isn't the typical sixteen by nine
when you're watching your videos this is
a lot of black borders I really can't
get over it to be honest it just doesn't
feel like a device from 2017 now I still
think the hardware is a 1 it has great
specs probably the best SPECT Chromebook
you'll find on the market but I do think
that the fact that it has these bezels
and in combination with that aspect
ratio it's not the best for media
consumption especially when you're
throwing it into tablet mode so that's
my only real gripe with it now let's
talk a little bit about the software
experience I've typically stayed away
from Chromebooks because I always felt
like Chrome OS was lacking in quite a
few different departments but it's safe
to say that this thing is evolved way
beyond what I'm used to so now with the
pixel book we get 100% Android app
support which means you can jump into
the Play Store and download any Android
app that you would like and it works
just fine now there are some caveats
here in terms of the quality of the apps
if I pull up something like Instagram
over here you'll see that it has these
black borders so that's something to
keep in mind if you are looking for a
full-blown experience here you won't get
a full screen but you can minimize it
and you have access to it here like this
would have been cool to be able to
change the size of this because it kind
of looks a little bit small but it is
cool to have that functionality
nonetheless now there are web-based apps
that you can go ahead and open up in the
Google Chrome browser which is pretty
typical for Chrome OS but you can use
the Play Store now to go ahead and
download those same apps in the Android
version so you will get two different
versions of the same application so
there's Gmail for Android and Gmail for
the Chrome OS which is the regular
everyday browser now for me I feel like
this can get a little bit confusing so I
think the best way to do it is kind of
just get rid of this pinned Gmail app
and boom now there's an additional
little piece here that you can pick up
for 99 bucks and that's the pixel book
pen now you might be familiar with these
pens pens are all the Krays now there's
the surface book pen Apple has there
10 and now Google is joining the fray
but this has been really nice to
navigate Chrome OS if you want it's been
pretty responsive now I don't honestly
don't use any apps that really require
it I don't use Photoshop or anything
like that so I just navigating it seems
pretty fine but one cool feature I think
would work for everyone is the ability
to do a Google search when you press
this little button right here so all you
got to do is press the little button on
the pen here find something that you
would like to get more information on
you circle it and your Google assistant
will let you know exactly what you're
looking at so right here it sells to me
what the definition of pumpkin is gives
me a bunch of different search results
for pumpkins pumpkin carving Mickey
Mouse so it pulled up all that
information just by me circling this
which is awesome now is the pen actually
worth the extra hundred bucks maybe for
a design student or someone who's using
those apps that really take advantage of
having a pen definitely but if you're
just an average everyday person like
myself I don't think there's gonna be
that much value in it especially
considering there's no real way to keep
track of it you can't really attach it
based on magnets something that I've
personally gotten used to with these
surface books now it does have that
pretty cool little googling feature but
that's really just a gimmick but it
could be useful sometimes but not worth
$100 you're not gonna walk around with
this as you're googling pen so final
thoughts on this guy I think that this
is the best hardware that you'll ever
find on a Chromebook and this isn't the
first time Google's done that they've
done that with their original pixel
where Google pushes the boundaries and
gives us something that's amazing to
look at amazing to feel amazing to use
but the user experience I think really
depends on the person if you're married
to the Google ecosystem and you love
Chrome OS this is the absolute best
Chromebook that you can possibly get
your hands on if you're using something
that's pretty old and outdated this will
be a very nice upgrade but at this price
range though you have to keep in mind
that there are other products out there
like MacBooks and surface books that do
quite a bit more than this guy does out
of thousand bucks
I don't think this is the best value for
everyone unless you're really really
into Chrome OS then this is the best
you can get on the market and again huge
shots of Full Sail University for
sponsoring today's video and chances are
if you're watching this channel you're
pretty tech oriented so there are two
programs I want to tell you about first
up we've got their online and on-campus
mobile development bachelor's degree
program where you'll learn how to
develop and market an app from start to
finish and second we've got their online
mobile gaming master's degree to help
you expand your skills and improve the
mobile gaming field and some personal
full self launch box program is a
macbook pro industry software and some
Android and iOS devices and since its
estimated that there's gonna be 109 is
having billion mobile app downloads this
seems like a pretty good industry to be
in
so visit full sell that edu slash your
average consumer or check the link down
below in the description if you want to
learn more but that about wraps it up
for today's video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy
girl that goes this video a thumbs up
and I'll catch you guys on the next one
till then it's your average consumer
