this is Ari hello and today we're gonna
be checking out some awesome Mother's
Day tag so it's our moms happy early
Mother's Day their pictures will be
ready but we got to give a huge shout
out to today's sponsor Chase Freedom and
what you're about to see is some uh
stuff I was able to order online for
Mother's Day using my Chase Freedom Card
and PayPal and yeah since I used the
Chase Freedom Card on PayPal she's able
to get five percent cash back which is
gonna be available from now to June 30th
but let's get into some of these
suggestions now I'm not gonna lie guys
I've bought tech for the women in my
family a bunch of times and they never
get used so I don't think I'm the best
at picking but first if you got me with
like some tech that's just like I got
her portable speaker her iPod back in
the day memory cards anyway I'm gonna
pass it on to her I think her
suggestions might be a bit better than
mine and in creating this list I thought
about all the different types of moms
that I know including mine so we're
gonna start with something for new moms
and that is this webcam slash baby
monitor and this one here is from
Project Nursery and I'm sure you're
probably thinking yeah you could
probably just buy any old security-cam
but this one actually has some really
cool tech and integrated into it that's
perfect for moms now of course she'll be
able to put this anywhere keep an eye on
your baby this is great for new moms who
are like a really obsessive about
checking their baby every second of the
day but you can also like pan and tilt
and move the camera around through an
app and testing this thing out was
really impressive because it goes our
really wide so you can really see a lot
in your movements and there's also night
vision and this thing stuff that may be
sleeping you'll be able to get a pretty
clear picture of it when monitoring them
but I think my favorite thing about this
is the fact that in fact she plays some
music for the baby so you can play white
noise or some soft music if they happen
to wake up in the middle of the night
there's also two-way communication so if
the mom you know wants to talk to their
baby they can do that and there's also
an SD card slot so if you want to record
certain images or take pictures you can
do that right from there and at a
hundred bucks I think this is a pretty
awesome gift for a new mom and this gift
I chilled with my mom in mind she died
were very much alike loved do our hair
our makeup and on the surface it looks
like just like a mirror but it's
actually one of the smartest mirrors
I've ever encountered so first there's a
built-in light which is really great if
you want to get a really precise makeup
application it's a dimmable light too so
you don't have to have that the
brightest setting but I think my
favorite thing about this
is a built-in speaker so you can connect
your phone right to this thing and then
play music while you're doing your
makeup see I guess really loud but you
can control it from your phone or even
the front here where you can just
control the volume press and play but
yeah like I said once your mom has
connected to her phone she can play
music from it
she can even answer calls or even access
Siri so you can just press this button
and then ask like the time while she's
getting ready or the weather and it's
right there for her so I love this night
kind of so I keep it for myself because
it's so cool yeah yeah I think I didn't
even know I needed this until I like
sigh I just love this thing
oh it is a bit pricey but you can do
what I do with my siblings we just like
get one nice gift and split it so you're
not paying a lot of money per person but
mom still ends up getting a really nice
gift yeah and I think one of the best
things about this it's really easy to
use so like my mom's not super tech
savvy but she'll be able to use this
really easily
now you guys are I'm sorry messing with
this thing this is what's next on our
list that it's a custom pop socket I've
talked about this a ton on Twitter and
my last gift guide I'm pretty obsessed
with them as I'm sure you guys can tell
but I think this is a great gift for Mom
for a couple of reasons first you can
customize this so as you guys can see
here I have cookie but forgetting this
to my mom your life maybe you could put
her kids on it her pet her loved one
whatever and I think just a really nice
heartfelt gift that's also really useful
so pockets are great for navigating
really large phones or even just
preventing Falls my mother is the queen
of dropping yeah how many tablets has
she broken headphones like she's broken
so many so I think she needs one of
these for sure and it's like I said a
really good gift a really inexpensive
price I think this is what fifteen bucks
so if you're interested in getting a pop
socket or anything else that I mention
in this video we'll have links right
down below and really quickly in the
same category I was like a pop socket
there's this ring here and then this is
good for moms who maybe don't want that
picture pops I could something more
discreet and stylish so that's pretty
cool too I'm gonna have that link down
below as well and if next is this a
digital photo frame as you can see I
have pictures of cookie yet again and
this is great for any mom who likes to
have pictures of a family around the
house and what makes this great is that
you can have just multiple pictures as
opposed to one static image and we've
seen stuff like this on the channel
pass but what makes this one really cool
is you don't have to preload all the
images on an SD card you can actually
send images through the cloud so yeah
the mom of your life can just store
bunch of pictures of the family or their
babies like my baby cookie here and you
can also use this thing in landscape
mode or portrait mode so there's a
little stand on the back that allows you
to do that really really easily and
there's really a lot you can do to
customize this thing so you can have
different playlists where you can play
maybe like someone's birthday or wedding
and I think overall it's a nice one of
those heartfelt gifts that mom will
really appreciate and you can keep her
updated and the next item on this list
comes from my personal collection you
can still buy it on PayPal with your
Chase Freedom Card everything like that
and that is this Dyson hairdryer I love
this thing in choosing this I really
thought about moms who don't have a lot
of times maybe to go to the hair salon
but still want to look nice and have
salon-quality hair styles and this can
definitely help you achieve that and
this comes with three different
attachments for different hair styles
and different hair types what makes them
really cool is that these are actually
magnetic and if you are used to hand
dryers you know it is never easy to
switch out the attachments so that's
really awesome so you have one for curly
hair so if your mom has curly hair this
will be great one for straight hair and
then those are gonna finish it one for
straight hairstyles that makes it really
really sleek so the included attachments
are cool what makes this thing really
impressive is the integrated technology
what I really love about this thing is
it really helps to cut down on heat
damage heat damage is a big problem if
you like to heat on your hair a lot and
when you turn it on it's actually super
quiet in comparison to some traditional
hand dryers out there so like that's
nothing usually I can't even speak or
hear myself speak when I have my regular
hand dryer on and when it's on there
actually LEDs here so you can monitor
how high the heat is and how high the
speeds are I didn't sticking with the
theme of cutting down on heat damage and
maintaining healthy hair there's also a
cool shot button here that's really
helpful other hair dryers have that but
I found this one to be really really
effective when I used it now we can't
ignore the awesome design here this is
much smaller and sleeker than your
traditional hair dryer it also doesn't
have blades with my previous hairdryer
my hair got caught into it and I had to
cut it off so this is really nice that
there's no external blades here so if
your mom loves her hair loves to protect
it but doesn't have time to go out to a
salon this is really an excellent gift
you can get her and I'm back because
I've got a suggestion get her a gift
card now you can use the chase ultimate
rewards platform to find a ton of
retailers and save tens
20 percent on select gift cards now
through May 31st so you'll definitely
want to browse around there if you want
to go the safe route and get some cash
back he had to return his mom's gift
this Christmas gift cart unscarred I
told you I'm not that great at this and
that about wraps it up guys and as a
