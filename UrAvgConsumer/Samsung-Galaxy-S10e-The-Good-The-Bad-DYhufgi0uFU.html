consumer and we've been talking about
the s10 lineup for a few weeks now but
it's finally time to talk about the s10
II so in this video we're gonna go over
the good and the bad but before we get
started we've got to give a huge shout
out to today's sponsor away now if you
guys follow me on social media you know
I've been travelling like crazy for the
past month and during those travels we
actually got our hands on the away
suitcase and this thing has pretty much
changed up the way we travel this
suitcase has a high-quality hardshell
exterior but what really changed up the
way we do things is the fact that this
thing offers a ton of organization I was
the one who usually packs us up for long
trips and she found herself really
liking being able to have dedicated
spots for certain items and it made it a
lot easier when we got to where we were
going to find exactly what we're looking
for and we've been rockin with the
carry-on size which is of course
carry-on compliant thus the name and
it's been nice not having to worry about
whether or not this thing will fit in a
plane or if we'll have to check it we
know exactly that this thing fits and it
works now organization and high quality
aside what's really nice here is that
this thing has some tech in it it has a
built in portable charger and you guys
know I love me some portable chargers
this thing actually has a 10,000 million
portable charger inside of it
so if you got to charge your iPhone
while you're waiting for your plane or
maybe even charge an iPad or something
you'll be able to do that here it's got
two USB ports so you'll be able to
charge multiple devices at once and with
10,000 milliamp hours you don't have to
worry about killing this thing and so be
honest I just like the way this thing
pops out of the suitcase when you're
ready to use it and you don't have to
worry about tsa stopping you you can
actually remove the portable charger
send it on through and you won't have to
worry about them stopping you for that
and this thing of course has through 16
wheels so you can get around the airport
or wherever you're going with no issues
and I think also has a lifetime warranty
so if something happens to this suitcase
you'll be able to get in touch with them
and get that taken care of so if you're
looking for a new suitcase there's four
different sizes to choose from multiple
colors and you also get a 100 day trial
so if you don't like it you can return
it for a full refund no questions asked
but if you guys want to check it out
they have a retail store in New York
it's an awesome suitcase and it's
definitely worth checking out if you
guys are trying to save 20 bucks on a
suitcase you sort of head over to Away
travel.com slash your average consumer
20 and
use the coupon code your average
consumer 20 at checkout but if you guys
want to learn more I love course have
links down below in the description but
now let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy
S 10 II now let's talk about the very
first good thing about this phone and
that's the price this thing starts off
at 750 bucks and compared to the s10 and
the s10 plus which are $8.99 and $9.99
that's a $250 savings or 150 $250
savings so that's actually a really nice
price in a world where we're seeing a
lot of thousand-dollar smartphones but
what's really nice about that price is
that you're very much still getting an
s10 but you are missing out on a few
things and that brings me to my first
bad with the s10 II you are absolutely
going to be missing out on a few
features that you just going to see on
like the s10 and s10 plus especially but
we'll talk more about those missing
features as we go on but before we get
into all that let's talk about the next
good thing and that's the form factor
with the s10 II you got a much smaller
design this is a 5.8 inch display so you
got a smaller phone here but it is so
easy to use with one hand and I just
love the size that is something I think
a lot of people will appreciate a lot of
people really do like a smaller form
factor and the ease of use is just it's
just on point so I like this overall
size when you got something like the s10
Plus which is a much bigger phone you
start becoming cognizant of how you're
using it and the fact that you got to
use two hands sometimes getting to the
top may be a little bit harder you got
to hold it a funky way but with this
it's just easy man it's just so so easy
and even though it's got a smaller
display it has to watch my anime on it
with no problem everything still looks
really good
so there's really no complaints there
their overall bonus of being able to use
this thing one-handed it's really nice
and while that's good at all I will say
you do sacrifice a little bit here when
it comes to the display this isn't a
quad HD display there's actually a full
HD plus so you're not getting those
extra pixels since this is a smaller and
I guess
less expensive phones but I'm gonna be
real with you guys you probably won't
even notice the difference unless maybe
you're trying to watch higher resolution
content on YouTube but I will say though
there is one more drawback with this
display you don't get that ultrasonic
fingerprint sensor built into the
display instead you have it built into
the power button over here on the top
right side now if you're big on having
the latest technology that's definitely
a bad but in real life I don't think
anybody's actually going to care it's a
cool party trick to just you know put
your finger down on the phone and open
it up honestly there's a really good
trade-off to having in the power button
because once you turn it on boom you're
right into the phone and I will say I do
think it's a little bit faster than the
ultrasonic fingerprint sensor so it
depends on what you're really looking
for if you're looking for functionality
I think this is better but if you're
looking for the latest tech and you want
to be cool you are missing out on it
built into the display now next good
that we cannot ignore and this is
important for anyone who's actually
thinking about picking one of these up
is that it's just like all the other
Galaxy S tens this thing is packin a
Snapdragon a 55 processor so in terms of
what it's capable of it's going to be
right up there with the S 10 and s 10
plus which is saying a lot since this is
the budget version which is 250 bucks
less than this guy not to mention you
also get 128 gigs of storage and you
also get a micro SD card slot so if you
want to add to that you can add up to
512 gigs extra so this thing's got space
for days you're really not missing out
on much but that brings me to the badge
and it's honestly not even that bad this
thing starts with 6 gigs of ram which is
nothing to scoff at but compared to
something like this that starts at 8
gigs of ram it's something to know by
honestly my point here is this isn't a
phone that you want to look at as a li
much lesser version of the other two
this is something that's just as
powerful although you make that small
compromise with the ram although that's
something that a lot of people will
really even notice now one of the other
good things about the s10 II is the fact
that it has wireless power share and for
those of you who aren't familiar with it
you basically turn your phone
to a wireless charging pad so if you've
got something like the Samsung Galaxy
buds which charge wirelessly you can
just throw it right on top of this guy
and it'll start charging it immediately
so that is a really cool feature Peck
you could even go ahead and charge
another phone if you'd like although I
probably wouldn't recommend it with the
galaxy s 10 II only because it has less
battery life than all of the other
Galaxy phones so this guy right here is
rocking a 3100 milliamp hour battery
which is less than the s10 which has
3,400 and the s10 plus which has 4100 so
it's like a thousand less but I will say
though guys this has a smaller display
and it's a lower resolution so it won't
be that bad but when it comes to our
wireless power share feature but your
numbers are your numbers so you'll have
a lot less to juice up other devices but
if it's a small accessory like the
galaxy Bud's not a big deal but that
feature does get a little less cool when
you've got less juice to provide other
devices and I think the next good thing
about the 10a that we really have to pay
attention to is Samsung's camera choices
so Samsung actually chose some really
good camera lenses to put on this guy
they put the ultra wide lens as well as
the regular wide-angle lens and I am
super happy with this because usually
with these kind of phones we see the
wide lens and the telephoto lens
Samsung could've went there with this
but instead they decided to keep though
ultra-wide lens ways I think more people
will appreciate than the telephoto cuz I
mean take a look at this guys if I
wanted to go ahead and let's say just
take a picture of something like this I
can take a picture of that but if I
wanted to just get the whole table top
that and boom I could just go ahead and
take a picture of that so just to show
you guys one more example here I can go
boom to take a regular photo here's the
wide and if I wanted to get a even
tighter shot I can zoom in one more time
and you guys can see for yourselves the
quality difference here this is a zoomed
in shot
this is not something anybody's going to
really complain about unless they're
like an actual photographer or something
so essentially I
got all three of my shots without having
to move the camera at all but without
the wide-angle I'm stepping back moving
back so that I can get more into the
frame but when it comes to the bat we
can't ignore the fact that this thing
just doesn't have that telephoto lens so
if you prefer to optically zoom into
your photos so you don't lose any
quality you're not gonna get that
telephoto lens here and with the front
facing camera you only get that single
cut out up front so unlike with the s10
plus you don't get that depth sensing
RGB camera up front so that means that
when you're taking their live focus
shots and you want that bokeh in the
background it's all gonna be artificial
basically be a fake blur so it's all
based on software instead of getting
that depth information from the other
camera but that is the kind of trade-off
you get with this guy but I'm curious
does that impact your purchasing
decision not having that depth sensor
and that's hella photo lens I really do
want to know what do you guys think down
below in the comments is that something
that's gonna sway you to get something
like the s10 plus instead now another
thing that we are missing in the back is
the heart rate sensor so with the s 10
plus you'll notice that over here we've
got the heart rate sensor so if you want
to know what your pulse is like your
heart rate is like you can go ahead and
use the sensor here to scan it not
something that you've got on the s10 II
but I'm gonna be really honest with you
guys
I've never used that feature since it
came out but you guys let me know is
that a feature that you guys need is
that something I should be making a big
deal about oh there is something that I
forgot to mention that is a good and a
bad with this display you don't get the
infinity edges that you get with
something like the 10 or the 10 plus
over here you got straight-up screen it
doesn't spill over to the sides so if
you like that infinity edge display it's
not available on the 10a this is just a
straight up panel but to be honest I
prefer this phone without it than the
one with it I'm not crazy about the
infinity edge display it's cool it's
nice to look at
it looks futuristic
after using this for some time I'm not
gonna lie guys it just feels nice to
have straight regular edges on the sides
that's my personal opinion but for those
of you who like that futuristic look of
having the edges spill over to the side
that's also missing on the 10e but I
actually like you without it but that
about wraps it up for the video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it hopefully this
kind of highlighted everything that's
good and bad about this makes your
purchasing decision a little bit easier
let me know your thoughts down below in
the comments then I'll catch you guys in
the next one
till then it's your average consumer
face be the cool guy don't forget that
part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
