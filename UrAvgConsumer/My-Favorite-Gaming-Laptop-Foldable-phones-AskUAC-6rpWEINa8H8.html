there's been a hot minute since we did
the last ask you AC so here we have the
first one of 2019 which smartphone
design of 2018 did you like the most now
for me that's a pretty easy answer I'm
gonna go with the Apple find X that
phone was absolutely gorgeous nobody can
deny that it had a full display in the
front no cutouts no notches
it just looked really really nice and it
had that really cool motorised mechanism
to get your cameras up with whether it's
the front-facing camera or the rear
camera of course having that mechanism
for the cameras introduced a lot of
concerns dust and dirt would get in it
you also worry about the motor over time
the phone had its flaws but design wise
that thing looks absolutely gorgeous and
that blue one oh god I wish I wish I got
my hands on that one but the purple one
looked pretty cool too it's just an
awesome looking phone oh and it was
super slippery but I digress that was my
favorite design even though it had its
flaws what is the video game that you're
most hyped for this year now for me
that's gonna be anthem that game looks
sick from the very first time it was
announced at e3 I was there and I saw a
person and I was blown away that game
has so much potential at least from what
it looks like in what I've seen online
now I think there was like Vegas out and
stuff where people got to play it lucky
folks out there lucky you I didn't get a
chance to actually mess around with it
at all so my hopes are still pretty high
if you guys got a chance to mess around
with the game whether it's the alpha or
beta whatever let me know what to
comment down below what you thought of
it I'm personally very very excited for
it come on
next mech suits you guys know I love me
some mechs is there going to be any new
series this year there's actually gonna
be a few new series this year area and I
have been racking our brains to come up
with some cool ideas and I think we've
got some really solid ones that we can't
wait to execute so you guys definitely
gotta stay tuned there's some awesome
stuff coming does your average
girlfriend or re-watch Gundam with you
trying to convince the wife to watch
them with me you my friend are fighting
an uphill battle
I've tried it and Men crash and burn an
adder he just has no interest whatsoever
she actually fell asleep during the
first episode I tried to show her much
to my disappointment but life goes on
hopefully your wife takes better to it I
would try to start her off with double-o
Gundam but man can't work out for me do
you think foldable phones have their
future yeah I don't know guys I I see
that a lot of manufacturers are really
trying to push the envelope with these
foldable phones I I just don't see it I
think the only phone that kind of caught
my attention was that Motorola phone
which is supposed to look like their
razor phone from back in the day if they
actually make that come out as I've seen
leaks and renders look then man they
might they might have a winner on their
hands but until then I think all those
other foldable devices that we've seen
so far
they look gimmicky they're too bulky I
don't think people will enjoy putting
those in their pocket I don't think
that's the direction phones are gonna go
but listen with these OLED displays that
are all foldable and whatnot there might
be something but as of right now that
razor phone is the only thing that I see
being remotely viable you still play
your PS Vita your thoughts on it and the
ps3 being canceled from PlayStation Plus
now honestly I haven't really played my
Vita in a long time I really wanted
there are some games that I just really
want to beat I picked them up I have
every intention of playing them and
finishing them but you know how backlogs
work guys I don't know if I'll ever pick
it back up I really want to though but
it's been a while and then being
cancelled I guess it makes sense I don't
know how many people are still on the
PlayStation 3 and Vita but I don't know
for me just doesn't get much action
anymore sadly what's the one thing in
Android you want to be improved in 2019
and what do you think about the next
Huawei and oneplus bones I think the one
thing that I really want to see improved
on Android is the stock messaging system
whatever you want to call that I'm not
talking about the messages app that you
get on every phone I'm talking about
like the Google hangout
kind of app and this is on Google this
is not even something that manufacturers
really need to work on I put the onus
all on Google they need to figure it out
they need something to compete with
iMessage if there was a really solid app
like that it would be amazing now as for
huawei phones and oneplus phones I think
one plus phones I really really love one
plus phones especially if you're on a
budget amazing stuff and while ways been
a heavy hitter for a while now they're
picking up a lot of steam I haven't
really been paying super close attention
through some of the stuff that they've
been dropping recently but oneplus
phones I've been all over those and then
they are really really good for the
price do you or your average girlfriend
have any experience with the new iPads
bending in the backpack or messenger bag
now I'm somebody who has a ton of stuff
in my backpack on a daily basis my iPad
is one of the things that I always have
on me and it is safe to say I've
encountered absolutely no issues with my
iPad bending so I don't know how that
happens especially I've heard sometimes
it happens in the box which is crazy but
it's not an issue for me it's not an
issue for Airi either that's what the
ones that I've heard have like a slight
Bend limit in the box
I don't know what that's about with
their apples manufacturing process but
in terms of actually using it and having
it just bend on you not an issue for me
whatsoever
and I use mine a lot on a daily basis
what is your favorite laptop notebook
ultrabook and why I gotta say my
favorite laptop right now is easily the
msi GS
stealth now that is an amazing laptop
one it's a gaming laptop and it doesn't
scream gamer when you look at it it's a
nice classy looking laptop with black
and gold trim it honestly just looks
amazing but not only that it's very
powerful mine has an eighth generation
Intel Core i7 processor 16 gigs of ram
nvidia gtx 1070 inside so it's got
everything it needs to game just fine is
a 1080p 144 hertz display so it's fast I
honestly just loved that laptop em aside
killed it last year but I gotta say I am
pretty
to get my hands on the r-tx laptops from
MSI we'll see how that goes but for
right now the GS 65 stealth great stuff
so I got a taste for progressive metal
if so what have you been listening to
absolutely still do have a taste for
progressive metal I haven't been jumping
into too many new artists I've been
sticking with intervals and native
construct I think native construct has
one album that I just listened to on
repeat all the time it's a quiet world
and intervals I listened to a few of
their albums and every time they drop
something I pretty much tend to love it
I wasn't you artists though if you got
something to suggest leave a comment
down below I am open to suggestions why
not wait for the Tesla Roadster now
don't get me wrong the Tesla Roadster
looks absolutely amazing I think what
really held me back is the fact that
it's a coupe I know it's got four seats
but come on the two seats in the back
are probably not gonna be that big so I
don't know for me it just didn't seem
practical enough and like let's not
forget the price tag and things like 200
grand I had the I got the 100 D but
that's money money all right
let's chill a little bit but I will say
that it looks absolutely amazing that
range and that speed oh my god I know
marques is gonna have this looking
jealous jealous out of here I know it
marques you got women getting a ride in
there man
stop playing it what is your current
favorites which game I gotta say my
current favorites which game Super Smash
Bros come on there's like a little
competition for it right now but the
game I spent the most time on it's
probably Xenoblade Chronicles that game
had my attention for a long long time
months and it was absolutely worth every
single minute that I spent on it I
highly suggest it if you're into RPGs or
you can action RPGs there's a really
good game but like I said answer to your
question is Super Smash Bros it's Smash
Bros I mean come on how could you not
have that
favor right now house the house would
love to see more tours it looks like
it's coming along really well the house
is coming along really well we still
have so so much work to do on it but
we're finally done with the kitchen so
we still got some stuff that we need to
add here and there but the kitchen is
actually pretty close to being complete
I'm just gonna have to add my little
pieces of tech but in terms of designing
in all the appliances and all that
you've got all that down but the rest of
the house
it's a minute it's been a bit of a crawl
we are working on it and those house
tour videos are coming really soon
kitchen is definitely gonna be first
why don't you include your average
girlfriend in more videos at least once
a week you gotta take that up with Ari
I'll have her social media linked down
below in the description tell her how
you feel tell her you want to see her on
the channel because I've been trying
maybe you guys might have more influence
than I do how did you first get into the
tech reviewing scene and what was the
first piece of tech you reviewed
honestly one day I just picked up the
camera and I was buying some tech and I
started opening it on camera
I called the channel your average
consumer because I was watching a ton of
tech channels where I would have to do
research and kind of learn what the tech
reviewer was talking about I wanted to
make videos too but I didn't want it to
be that difficult where I would have my
viewers go out and go somewhere else to
kind of learn what I was talking about
that's why I call the channel your
average consumer
so the everyday person can come watch my
videos and walk away knowing exactly
what I was talking about and how I feel
about a certain product well first video
I ever did was on a canon speed light
which was like a flash for a DSLR not a
very exciting video a very cringe-worthy
video actually oh my god that video was
pretty bad but hey that's what happens
when you first start out but alright
guys now that about wraps it up for this
video hopefully you enjoyed it we
answered a ton of questions here if you
have any more feel free to follow me on
social media my Twitter and Instagram
are linked down below in the description
so follow me there if you want to pick
my brain and also head over to my
discord server if you want to try and
get some personal time with me Ari
there we've got some great mods it's a
cool server so definitely hit us up join
the server but totally nice video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool girl I'll give the video thumbs
up and I'll catch you guys in the next
one
till then is your average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
