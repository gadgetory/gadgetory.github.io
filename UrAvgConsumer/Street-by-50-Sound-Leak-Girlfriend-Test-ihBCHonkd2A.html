want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video hey what's going on
guys - Travers consumer and today I have
a special video for you guys I'm gonna
be doing a sound leak test as well as a
sound isolation test and this here is my
girlfriend and she's going to be our
little test subject here to see if how
someone next to you will hear your music
if you have it on regular volume or
louder volumes alright so we're gonna
start off with the sound leak test using
the street by 50 cent and let's see if
you guys can hear me well you guys let's
see if you guys can hear the music or if
she can and she's about a foot away so
let's see how that sounds so this right
here is at about 50% I came here but I
can't make out the lyrics I can hear
like some kind of like tune but I can't
make out any other alright so we're
going to increase the volume let's say
about 70% I know here now so if you guys
have the street by 15 and you're
listening to music about 70% you
probably don't want to play this song if
you're a guy that in mind well let's
just see what it's like at 100%
I'll boast I don't recommend it because
that's bad for your ears well let's see
you
oh really hear it now yes you can
clearly hear that so if you're gonna
listen to this in lab volumes make sure
your music selection will be you know
not questionable and so that that's
pretty much it for a sound leak test so
I guess you guys see about 50% it's fine
about 75% you can probably hear a little
more there's someone's like right next
to you so you want to be careful if
you're on like an elevator or you know
something like that
so now we're gonna work on the sound
isolation test we this doesn't have
noise cancelling but it's an overeater
headphones so it kind of blocks out
sounds from the outside as it covers
your whole ear so we'll just see how
effective that is it's passive it's not
built-in so we're just check that out
right now and I'm just gonna say some
statements that I probably would
normally say to him um well call this
the girlfriend test alright so this is
about 50% let's see if I can hear what
she has to say
whoo don't forget to watch the dishes
percent is not enough guys I commuted so
let's get this a little higher and let's
see about 65% or like 70 the kitchen
really smells and you haven't been
putting everything together the way no I
can't make out what she's saying but I
can hear the noise so you're good if
this if you just want to block out the
words you're good here but you'll still
be able to hear her so you'll it'll
sounds outside will still kind of
disrupt your music if you know it's at
this amount and I'm pretty sure I 100% I
won't hear her but let's just try it out
anyway you will not believe what my
principal said to me today I do not want
to work here anyway alright so basically
we can see that at about 50% you can
still hear someone around 70 or 75 you
will hear third you know you'll hear
them but you won't be able to make out
what they're saying so if things are
that loud in your vicinity
you'll probably get the little
disruption with your music as it says
you know a passive
noise cancelling but I think it does the
job so good job for SMS audio and the
sound leak it doesn't leak a bit but you
know it looks a lot about yeah there's a
lot of thing so because even that 50% I
was still able to like a make out that
you were listening to music and what
type of music I just couldn't hear your
lyrics okay so at about 50% you can
still make out you can still hear the
music probably can't make up the lyrics
like she said so that's something to
consider when you're purchasing these so
yeah that's pretty much it guys alright
guys so this year average consumer and
this has been the Soundlink and Southern
Oscillation test aka the girlfriend test
on the SMS Audio Street by 50 cent
thanks for watching if you guys liked it

see you in the next video guys peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
