video what's going on guys drivers
consumer and today we've got some dope
tech to check out from the folks over at
Dyson as you can see we've got a couple
of things all over the studio and this
right here is the Dyson light cycle and
with a lamp that's been engineered to
the max and the first thing we got to
talk about is this whole track system
that is got going on over here so this
thing can move in any position that you
want you can set it to pretty much
anywhere and it'll stay exactly there
now not only can you control the exact
position of this guy but you can also
control the temperature with these touch
panels I can also adjust the brightness
all with this little slider so right now
it's at the max brightness and over here
we can make it warm or we can just make
it cool so the light cycle actually
comes with an app and this thing allows
you to synchronize all of your
information with the actual lamp and I
know we're in a crazy world where your
lamp has an app but it actually does
some really cool stuff so first things
first
it'll take into account the GPS location
so it'll know where you are the time of
day and if you're put in a personal
information like your age if you happen
to be a bit older it can adjust the
light based on that too so basically
what this thing does is it uses all of
that information to pretty much give you
the proper lighting situation at all
times and when it starts becoming a bit
later in the day where those blue lights
can harm your eyes is going to actually
gradually switch over to a warm light
and it's got all those cool smart
features but it also has motion
detectors so when you're not nearby
it'll automatically turn off and when
you're near it it'll turn on just so
that you can use it and not to mention
since this thing is living on your desk
it also has a USB type-c charger right
here so if you need to charge your phone
you can just plug it into your lamp and
charge it up but let's talk about why I
said this thing is engineered to the max
so you can actually take it off of its
track and take a look at this guys right
here you can see this copper pipe and
there is a droplet of water in here that
evaporates and pretty much cool
this whole thing so that it can last up
to 60 years and who's who's thinking
about that so this is something that
it's an investment but it's gonna last
and you might have seen my video on the
v10 but Dyson found a way to add some
cool new tech into this guy and upgrade
it a ton check this out this is a vacuum
as you'd expect but what we've got up
here is actually an LCD screen so that
you can get a ton of information while
you vacuum now of course this thing's
got three modes like previous Dyson
vacuums you've got your eco medium and
of course your boost it also does a cool
thing where it lets you know how much
juice you've got left as you're
vacuuming now they've integrated some
cool tech into the main cleaner head
where it has sensors to detect what kind
of surface it's on so if you're on a
carpet versus hardwood floor it's gonna
be able to detect the difference between
these and switch modes automatically so
that it's not using the same amount of
juice on both surfaces check this out if
I'm vacuuming hardwood surfaces I'm not
gonna need a lot of power but once I go
on carpet you heard it kick up a bit
you're probably wondering what else can
you do with this LCD screen and when you
open this up let's say you leave the
filter opened and you try to turn this
on it'll let you know the filter is not
sealed and it'll give you a little
diagram to let you know what you have to
do to fix it I know troubleshooting with
vacuums can be a pain because when they
don't work you're wondering like I don't
know what's going on with this now this
thing gives you actual diagrams to let
you know exactly what you need to do
shows you how to do it that is very
helpful and I mentioned the fact that
this thing has a filtration system so
they included a HEPA filter here so if
you happen to be somebody who has
allergies or you're really sensitive to
dust if you don't really have to worry
about that dust getting kicked up into
your face it's all getting filtered out
sorry you got no excuses to start
vacuuming you knew it was coming but
right here we have something new this is
the Dyson pure cool me now this right
here is an air purifying personal fan
and it uses crazy technology
to give you precise airflow and
basically what this does it takes all
the pollutants and gases in the air
around you purifies it and gives you
really clean purified air and it's very
cool of course that's why it's called
the cool me but Dyson actually had this
really cool diagram at their launch
event where I showed you just how
precise this thing is and it's crazy how
it works guys basically air flows on
this concave surface it goes in two
directions in towards the middle and it
comes out word and it creates that
really really precise air but this thing
is really awesome for those folks who
have allergy problems may be at a desk
near a window you can throw this down
even at night on by your bedside there's
a lot of good uses for this for those of
you out there who have a lot of issues
with allergies it even has a remote so
if you don't have this nearby you can
actually just hit a button and turn it
on it works with like ten different
speeds and this thing can really really
go and when you're done using it it uses
magnets to just stick on so you know
exactly what your remote is at all times
and we actually got a chance to go out
to England and see the dyson
headquarters ourselves area and I had an
awesome time over there but what's crazy
is we kind of take for granted just how
much research and development goes into
these kinds of products so it was kind
of cool to see firsthand what goes into
making these things shout out to them
for creating magic over there that we
call technology but if you guys enjoyed
this video be the cool guy or girl that
gives it a thumbs up I'll have links to
everything down below in the description
we are taking all of these products out
of the studio and back into our house
but till the next one guys it's your
average consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
