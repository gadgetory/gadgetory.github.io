and today I have a little video for you
guys because it's all about Max 27
wanted to see a comparison between the
beat mixers isolation ease and um I
don't have the studio so I can't compare
those but I do happen to have to be the
new beats Wireless so I can give some
insight about that um there's been a
couple of comments asking about you know
how it feels on Mina on your head if you
have a particularly large head now I
happen to think I have a pretty really
large head as you can see it's a little
you know on the white side and that
actually plays a big factor into how
these feel because the material on it is
pretty tough so it gives you a tighter
feel because it's not you know it's not
the right normal plastic so it doesn't
Bend as easily but I'm not trying to
knock the material the material on this
is great it feels really high-end it
feels much better than the plastic not
to knock these guy love to you Bob look
this definitely gives a high-end feel
but it is a little constricting um some
other factors that can play into this is
that the adjusters on the ear cups
actually come inside the headphones on
inside on the band's rather than come
directly down see for the solos big you
know comes as straight arch but for the
mixer it goes down and then it has the
inside part that holds the actual ear
cups so when just when you put this on
it can you know feel pretty tight
because of these two inside along the
tight band now I think the reason for
that is so that you can you know have
the swivel swivel movement here and you
know keep it on your head without you
know if falling
for anything let me show you an example
of why I mean of how it looks when it's
on my head so when I put it on you can
pretty much see that the two parts right
here are going into my head I've
actually had someone else try them on
and they felt that it was a little tight
to this isn't that you know this isn't
standard on all the other beats
headphones so it's never been a problem
but on these you can you can really feel
it for me anyway where as far as the
solo HDS you have all you know you have
all the space
no constricting feeling feels really
natural also with the tight feeling
comes a little something else because
because it's already tight and the
material that the ear cups are made of
the it looks soft on the outside but if
you print you know press a little harder
and you can see that in some it's it's
hard on the inside it might be the same
material as this covered by this you
know just a little cushion here but when
this is actually on your head you empty
end up feeling it you end up feeling it
pressing against your ears this actually
I don't know I suspect that this caused
me to have a headache one one of the
days that I was wearing it I might have
been another factor but I'm assuming
it's because the first day wearing and
I'm I don't typically get headaches so I
don't know that's just for me oh I'm
thinking I'm assuming larger headed
people will have a bit of discomfort
wearing this people with you know maybe
average two regular sized heads i I
don't know maybe you guys might not have
the same issues but it's definitely not
something I experienced with the solos
you don't have I experienced um with the
wireless head dumb the wireless speeds
the wireless B's have to pretty much the
same design it's a solo
so you know it has a regular arch and
when I put it on you know there's
nothing clamping against my head that's
fine
and yet back to the big ear cups because
of that heart like that hard until it's
not something I'm used to the solo HDS
you know it's very squishy on inside not
so much to be just in the wireless you
know they're squishy as well so it's
really soft and well yeah that's pretty
much it but like I said I do think it is
because I think the tightness is you
know because of the material and the
inside the inside um adjusters but like
I said I do think that is a factor when
it comes to the whole swivel feature for
like I guess DJs and such now you know
this is a pretty cool feature I love it
but I mean maybe that could be another
reason for why it's you know so tight so
that you know one side doesn't just
isn't it hanging off of anything and it
doesn't like fall off your a head or
anything but that's pretty much it also
I know someone wanted to see the
mixtures with the port inside or I do
like about the mixers is that you can
put the cord on whatever side you want
so that's pretty cool so you can see
that on any side you can have it just
like the pros and with it on matted hair
looks like this it's pretty fine
and I think I think we all know what the
floor looks like with the UM soloist I
don't think I have to go into that usual
Wireless no cord well I just wanted to
you know get some responses out to you
guys because you guys had a couple of
questions if you're having anyone feel
free to ask them and I'll let you guys
know what I know and if I if it's
possible I'll put a video to answer any
questions
alright this Jay I'm just consumer guys

rate rate subscribe comment like some
awful and I'll see you guys later in the
next video I will also I will have a
review and unboxing up for the wireless
