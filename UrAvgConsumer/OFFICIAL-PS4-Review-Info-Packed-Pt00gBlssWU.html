consumer and today I'm going to be
reviewing the new PlayStation 4 so let's
not waste any time let's get right into
it alright guys here we have the
PlayStation 4 Sony's official entry into
the console war and it's been seven
years in the making but it's finally
here and taking a look at the design of
the ps4 you'll see that Sony went with a
sleek parallelogram kind of shape and
Sony has proven time and time again that
it isn't afraid to leave the standard
rectangular shape in the past for
something that's different and
unconventional the ps4 comes coated in a
matte impart glass finish that really
gives it a high-end feel under the
glossy portion of the ps4 you'll find
the removable hard drive sony has made
it quite easy to replace the initial 500
gigabyte version for something of a
larger capacity or even a solid-state
drive that will increase the ps4 s
performance it's sleek and mature design
should prove easy to fit amongst any
entertainment area regardless of its
very different parallelogram shape in
front of the system you'll find a touch
capacitive power button as well as a
capacitive eject button for discs these
buttons are very flush within the system
it may actually be overlooked to those
unfamiliar with it and speaking of this
the ps4 can play blu-rays and DVDs but
it does not support playing regular CDs
or 3d blu-rays which is quite
unfortunate if you happen to have a
large collection of those also up front
you'll find two 3.0 USB ports currently
the only real use for these is to charge
external devices like your controller
phone etc and it's the same that you
won't be able to use an external storage
device to read any files other than
system software and this means you won't
be able to load up your system with mp3s
video files and such which is quite
unfortunate considering how great of a
media hub the ps3 was hopefully Sony
changes this in a future update in the
back you'll find the power connect that
uses the same sized plugs most of the
past Playstations have used an HDMI port
a digital out an Ethernet port and an
aux port which is used for the
PlayStation camera
take note that the back only contains an
HDMI port and this is something you want
to keep in mind if you don't game on an
HDTV yet now let's take a look at the
upgraded DualShock 4 controller its new
shape has been getting a lot of praise
all over the web and for good reason it
feels like it's a more streamlined
version of the ps3s Dual Shock
controller and is much more comfortable
in the hand I never had any issues with
the ps3 controller but I definitely can
feel the difference when I go back to it
after using the Dual Shock 4 there are
some welcome changes to it such as the
little ridges in the back as well as the
bottom of the handles which provide some
nice grip to the controller and you'll
also notice the thumb sticks have
changed as well they now have an
indented shape that allows for easy
thumb placement and more comfort the
ridges around the joystick also make it
easy for those of you who like to use
the edges for movement there are also a
ton of new features found on new Dual
Shock 4 and the most popular is probably
the new clickable touchpad found right
in the center there are too many games
that currently support this feature but
games like Assassin's Creed 4 and the
playroom app have found interesting ways
of utilizing it such as zooming in on
maps or throwing little robots around
your room you shouldn't expect the
performance that you would see on a
smartphone's touchscreen but it's
interesting nonetheless and I look
forward to seeing how its implemented in
more games on the side of the trackpad
you'll notice the share and options
button I found that the options button
is pretty much your Start button while
the share button allows you to send up
to 15-minute game footage and
screenshots to various social media
outlets under that you'll find an
integrated speaker and games like
resogun take advantage of the speaker to
provide warnings and other in-game
activities
and one of my personal favorite features
of the controller is the ability to plug
in any headphones into the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and use it to
listen to all game audio and party chat
this eliminates the need for an
expensive gaming headset if you already
have a nice pair of headphones and
what's great about this is that if your
headphone has a mic you can use it to
chat with people in your party also at
the top of the controller you'll find an
LED light that works with the
PlayStation camera and it allows it to
function as a PlayStation Move
controller and it also helps to
determine which player you are this LED
light also does some pretty funky stuff
like change colors to show your health
status in all honestly though you
probably won't really notice or find use
for the colored LED outside of
determining which controller is yours
battery life on the controller lasts
about 5 to 6 hours and now uses a micro
USB in order to charge if you play for
several hours at a time you might want
to invest in a long USB cable or be
ready to charge during your playthrough
overall this controller packs some great
technology and I can't wait to see how
developers plan to incorporate the
features into their games and of course
we have to discuss the actual software
side of things the ps4 is new operating
system is pretty simple at first glance
it's made up of two rows the main row
containing your games apps while the top
row contains PSN related content such as
your PlayStation Store notifications
messages friends and so forth while the
interface is pretty clean it can take
some getting used to recently played
games comes to the front of the list
which sounds pretty convenient but it
causes your list to change all the time
if you frequent multiple apps it isn't a
huge deal but it may cause a few more
seconds of looking for something since
the tiles don't stay in place and as you
download more games and apps the more
clutter this interface may become I hope
Sony adds the ability to pin your
favorite games to the front of the list
in a future update but the best thing
about this OS is how blazing fast it is
you'll have no issues jumping from app
to app here and going through the menus
are seamless and fast this is amazing in
comparison to the menu speeds of last
gens consoles the
als also allows you to have two apps
open at once one game and one
entertainment app this is very
convenient as you no longer need to quit
your game to switch to your favorite
video streaming application and
switching between the two takes almost
no time thanks to the very fast menu
overall the ps4 has a very clean looking
interface which is quite easy to browse
I'll bet the slight room for improvement
Sony has also introduced a Playstation
app for your smartphone in conjunction
with the ps4 and with this you're able
to see who's online send messages check
out what the latest activities of your
friends are so Sony's really trying to
push the social aspect as we all know
and they do it with another platform
such as the smartphone platform so I
think that's a pretty cool thing as well
sony also really extends the
functionality of the ps4 by allowing you
used Vitas Remote Play feature no matter
where you are as long as you have a
solid internet connection the Vita will
also turn on the ps4 if it's left in
standby mode to grant you access to your
system and no you don't need to purchase
an extra game for your Vita when you're
using Remote Play as you'll just be
streaming the game play from your
PlayStation to the Vita you can also use
both the PlayStation app and the PS Vita
to act as a second screen for games that
support the feature if you want to learn
more about the amazing Remote Play
feature as well as other great features
the ps4 has I have a few videos that go
more in depth and you can check them out
in the annotation here or in the links
down below in the description and
finally to talk about the games the
games look just as beautiful on the ps4
as one would expect and on the big
screen there's a ton of detail to be
seen and you can see just how much of an
improvement it is over its predecessor
the current launch lineup for the ps4 is
pretty decent but there aren't too many
noteworthy exclusives yet PlayStation
Plus currently gives you access to a few
free-to-play titles however such as
blacklight retribution and they're
already infamous resogun although the
library may be considered lackluster at
launch there are still a few good games
out for it with more in the pipeline and
one last thing about the games if you
want to play online multiplayer you will
have to invest in a PlayStation Plus
subscription I definitely think it's
worth the investment though because the
PlayStation Plus has a lot of huge
benefits like the instant game
collection which allows you to download
a couple of
three games every month as well as some
discounts for PlayStation Plus members
so that's really good stuff there
there's a lot of value added when you
have PlayStation Plus so I don't think
it's a real big strain on anyone who
wants to play online multiplayer to have
all those benefits as well and all right
guys that pretty much wraps up my review
of the PlayStation 4 and I definitely
think that it's worth the $400
investment you're getting a great piece
of technology here for a pretty low cost
considering what's out on the market now
I know a lot of you are wondering what's
better the ps4 or the Xbox one well I
can't give a definitive answer to that
as I haven't gotten a chance to fully
try out and use the Xbox one so I have
to save my judgement still after I given
the Xbox a fair shot I can't offer
however the reasons why I decided to
purchase the ps4 over the Xbox one and
firstly I'm pretty invested into the
PlayStation ecosystem with things like
the PS Vita PlayStation Plus multiple
PlayStation headsets so it made sense
that I went with a system that supported
all of those as I also have a pretty
unique setup for my gaming consoles
space was definitely a concern and the
smaller footprint of the ps4 definitely
appealed to me being able to play most
of my games at 1080p versus 720p was
also pretty important and I was able to
save 100 bucks so why not so that's a
bit of a look into my thought process
when I decided I wanted to pull the
trigger now this isn't to say that the
ps4 is a perfect system as it does have
its flaws such as having no ability to
add mp3s or videos not being able to
organize your menu at all and worst of
all currently no support for the
PlayStation pulse wireless headset
unless you use it with your controller
but these are things that I hope can be
changed in future updates and I look
forward to that happening but this truly
wraps up my review guys and if you
