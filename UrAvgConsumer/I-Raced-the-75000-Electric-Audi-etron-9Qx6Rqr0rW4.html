consumer and today I'm in the south of
Spain checking out Ali's brand new eat
Ron the all-electric SUV it is finally
here and Aldi was cool enough to sponsor
today's video and give me a very unique
opportunity to drive this guy in Spain
alright guys so we just got inside of it
and I will say this is a beautiful
dashboard my goodness I loved all the
hard edges clean lines but it is time to
finally turn this thing on
it's got the power button right here so
it has like three different screens
we're going to get into all of that but
right now we have our destination if you
go to let's go shall we
honestly guys this drive is so smooth
the e-tron handles these turns like a
cakewalk this is nothing to it and just
it's a nice drive I gotta say it's a
nice Drive but honestly what blew my
mind is being able to have navigation
features right on the heads-up display
on the windshields and that's something
I can really appreciate about outtie
when it comes to like adding tectum to
their cars they've got a lot in it and
one thing that's really surprising is
I'm in an SUV and there's like no engine
sound so it's like really quiet of
course because this is an all-electric
vehicle but man oh goodness the view oh
man look over there to the left guys
oh nice little town my goodness okay
guys so we just arrived at the Ascari
race resort and as you guys can see
there are tons of Audis here for miles
it feels like but there are a lot of
cool activities here there's like
off-roading racing they even have like
racing with the r8 so the lot of cool
stuff here I think the first thing we're
gonna try and do is probably the
off-roading alright guys so we just went
into off-road mode suspension went up
we've got dirt in front of us I am very
very excited we'll see how this goes
oh this is quite the hill I set up the
camera feature for you so you got a good
view on a road there we go you don't
under
hey here we go now you can release the
brake the colored brake automatically oh
man this is a trust experience right
here Wow so that was pretty steep going
downhill like that it was really steep
but the car was able to break on its own
don't do this to me I don't know if I'm
ready cuz that just now it was
apparently is nothing compared to what
I'm about to experience so it can go
over a few meters oh my goodness yeah
but you can see everything ikemen is
this is this the front yeah this is the
front view
Oh awesome okay so I can see everything
that's happening right here yep
so even though I can't see like this I
can see down here so this is actually
extremely helpful and no lift up pedal
this is so scary
Oh
Wow and then we got to do some more
off-road activities and you guys can see
it for yourself
this thing handles it all like a champ
which is big man I really wasn't
expecting that drop there so insane it
was absolutely insane guy
dissing Ari casually driving on a crash
but guys that was absolutely insane I
felt like I put my life in this cars
hands and it did not fail me I am still
here and of course it was time to hit up
a racetrack but with the e-tron all
right guys so we are in here and I'm
curious to see how fast we're gonna be
able to go all right guys so that was
just nuts I've never been on a racetrack
before at least as the driver so that
was a really really cool experience
Arie might not necessarily agree I was
in the beginning in the beginning he
weren't crazy about it but that thing
handles really well at no point did I
feel like I lost control of the car
which is great because I'm not like a
professional racecar driver or anything
but man that was an awesome experience
eat Ron it showed it stuff today I gotta
say all right guys so we are at the end
of our day this car has been so fun to
drive honestly I feel like I already set
it up really well so that we can kind of
see what the thing is capable of and
seem to stay handled the terrain the way
it did not something you'd expect from
an all-electric luxury SUV and that's
all thanks to that Quattro but when we
took it out for some racing that's when
things got crazy being able to
experience the handling from this and
doing those really quick turns going at
fast speeds and still happen control
really made me feel really comfortable
I wouldn't our SUV just like wow both we
try to do the same things we did today
but huge shout-out to Ally for having us
out and letting us experience this we're
in Spain and it feels good
but if you guys are interested in
learning more about the e-tron I'll have
links down below in the description be
sure to check it out I'll catch you guys
in the next one tell better drivers
