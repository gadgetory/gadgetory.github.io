and today we're gonna be spending a real
day in the life with the one plus 3t so
you guys are gonna see me spend a full
blown day with one plus 3t so we can see
how its features performance battery
life we're gonna check out how all that
stuff works in real world views alright
guys so it's about 10:00 in the morning
just got into the studio I've been on
the phone using social media checking
emails all that kind of stuff so I'm
about thirty minutes of screen on time
right now and 95% so so far so good
but check this out I've got a lot of
stuff so ship out for all these
different giveaways that I'm doing so
what I'm going to do is probably find
the ups nearby and get this stuff sent
out so it's part of my day all right
guys I've been getting some work done
for a couple of hours but I wanted to
take a break and show you guys some of
the stuff I got in this reviewers
package for the one plus 3t so if you
guys look at this it's got like a
traveling bag here this is pretty
interesting it's got like straps on the
inside it's pretty hefty dude it's like
pretty hefty heavy-duty stuff but I
don't know if I won't use it this is
like a tag for luggage and stuff like
that
but they do offer some other stuff like
earbuds I think they have packages that
they offer online so if you buy a one
plus 3t you can get certain bundles and
packages that come with sharing things
they included this case I really like
their cases because they don't increase
the profile of the phone at all I mean
obviously they do a little bit but it
doesn't feel bad whatsoever
luckily I have a few of them from my one
plus three they're the same size so they
can work together now one thing that I
like about the 1 + 3 + 3 T I guess is
that the feel in the hand is actually
really nice a case or not it feels
comfortable even though it's a bigger
front I have no issues using it typing
out a message or just doing whatever I
usually do on a daily basis this phone
also doesn't feel slippery which is a
problem with most phones especially if
they're made out of aluminum this is not
the case here this one feels very
comfortable in the hand just feels kind
of good
alright guys so check this
you know I like to play games whenever
I'm testing out a phone to kind of see
how the performances see if the game
lags at all or if there's going to be
any dropped frames so I usually like to
play these games and cool enough best
fiends forever wanted to sponsor today's
video and have me play while I'm testing
out the 1+3 T now some of you may
already know best beans but this is the
second game in their trilogy but it
still has all the same characters and
the same story but it's got a new style
of gameplay now this is a pretty cool
clicker adventure game which is kind of
a dick thing but you have to go as far
as you can as fast as you can and this
thing will give you a thumbs up workout
for sure alright if you right now I'm
trying to tell you guys about this game
but just can't stop clicking alright let
me see if I could go into a menu and
what's cool is that you can level up
pretty much anything so you've got these
fiends that help you out and you can
just raise their levels up so you can do
more damage as you go on so when you get
back into the game it makes it quite a
bit easier and they're actually
introducing limited time events we can
win special rewards and they're starting
off with slugs in space which is going
to start December 22nd and there's going
to run through til about January 5th so
you're not going to want to miss out on
that
and of course I'm gonna have links down
below in the description so it's free to
download so you might as well try it now
something that I can appreciate about
this game is that it's colourful so you
get to see how vibrant and crisps the
screen is on the 1 + 3 T and in terms of
performance I'm getting no issues at all
no lag no jitters and with a game like
this where you got to move really
quickly I'm not seeing any issues
whatsoever there's a lot of inputs going
into this game and I'm not seeing any
slowdowns at all so performance wise
this thing is handling it like a champ
and this is actually the perfect time to
try out the selfie cam what I'm gonna do
is take a selfie with this ps4 I've got
in the back over here and I'll probably
send it to the winner just to get them a
little excited
awesome so I see looks pretty good and
don't mind the back of the car folks we
got a lot of stuff to ship out Shh
gotta take some selfies with Bay ready
Bay not uni oh yeah there was though
sometimes you just gotta you know
spontaneously selfie with Bay when she's
not ready that's that's how you let her
know is real you'll take her whenever
however she is so something that's
killing me about this phone is that
every time I press the right button at
the bottom I always didn't get to the
back button instead of over on the left
but what's awesome about this phone is
that I can just go into my settings and
go to buttons and then I can just swap
it just like that so I don't have to
deal with that I can go back just like
this if I want to and then do that so
that's one of the nice bonuses and perks
of having this phone is that I can
switch up all kinds of settings so
probably the least fun part of my day is
going to be shipping all this stuff out
I've got a PC in there that I need to
get shipped out to so many giveaways
this comes with the territory
alright one more package got to send
this one out to this one unfortunately
is a bit heavier than the others but I
gotta send the stuff out man all right
guys somehow every single time I try to
make a real day in the life I end up in
a makeup store it's getting kind of
ridiculous so today I had a package come
it was in bad condition so same day she
had to go and return it right to the
store so that's why we're here
and right now I guess I'm gonna find a
spot for me to sit down and just mess
with the phone so if there's any
benefits coming with re to these kind of
places is that one that has awesome
lighting
I guess so they can do their makeup and
they got colorful stuff everywhere I
just snap a quick picture of something
like this kind of see how it does I just
can't sharpen looks pretty good pretty
vibrant all right yeah I mean this is
legit legit so Irish trying that
front-facing camera
taking a selfie so you think I I think
looks okay it looks a little soft to me
but that's what I thought too
yeah but looks good I think so we're
going to take a nice low light shot
since it's nighttime
we'll see we'll take a picture of the
car
you all say pictures of cars uh this
looks really good actually
hi guys so right now wearing game style
I'm here to pick up a game for my little
cousin I'm guessing I might get him like
Pokemon or something like that
but check out this little kirby look how
looks pretty awesome if I didn't have
enough Gundams all over the place I had
picked this up but instead I'll just
take a little picture Oh
autofocus was pretty fast let's see ya
look legit got some nice bouquet in the
back a lot of detail looking sword it
looks really good
this I'm a fan of this camera 16
megapixels I like it so guys let's check
the autofocus hmm okay that's not bad
that's actually really fast Wow all
right autofocus is legit now time to
build some hype with this guy send them
that picture that I took earlier that'll
do it it'll be there Friday and typing
on this is pretty easy guys and even
though this is a bigger phone typing on
it has been no problem even with one
hand and then sometimes I'll just swipe
boom and if a battery update is 7:49
right now and I've got 41% battery left
now let's see what that actually means
in terms of screen on time I've been
able to I've been using this up quite a
bit today so let's see there are three
hours and 24 minutes that's really
impressive guys I three thousand twenty
four minutes 41 percent I can keep going
for like another
I can easily get five hours out of this
before I have to charge it so battery
life is awesome I got to say guys the
one plus 3t is as solid as ever is only
a 1080p display but it still looks very
vibrant very crisp and even though we're
not getting a quad HD display like on
some other phones you're still getting a
very nice 1080p display that also
doesn't use up as much battery now when
it comes to performance this thing is
just crazy because some would consider
it a mid-range phone but it's actually
got the specs of a high-end premium
phone but at the mid-range price now my
experience this thing has been buttery
smooth and that's due to that awesome
hardware as well as the really clean
Android that's pretty much stock with a
few customizable options and I've been
seeing some really solid battery
performance here which makes sense since
one plus actually increase the battery
size from the original one plus three
and you even get - charging where you
can almost get a full battery in 60
minutes which is insane my only problem
with that is that that charging isn't
widely available you're not seeing a lot
of accessories with it but hey with that
kind of performance I don't mind and
honestly guys the one plus 3t is just a
solid phone you can't go wrong with that
price range and the kind of performance
that you're actually getting out of the
phone it's only been a few months since
the last one plus three but hey I'm glad
this one came out hopefully you guys
enjoyed the video I'll catch you in the
next one till then it's your average
consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
