consumer and by now I'm sure you've seen
your fair share of galaxies as 10 videos
but I got the s10 plus in hand just
picked it up yesterday so I figured why
not do a quick unboxing I also got the
galaxy buds which I am actually really
excited about but I know you guys are
really here for the s10 plus so we're
gonna open that up first I got my fancy
new unboxing knife check this out guys
Harry just picked this up for me tell me
that's not crazy
ain't she sweet so let's get this open
okay re sharp I see you but the box is
pretty simple guys at the black box says
that's ten who cares now the phone here
we go this is the s10 plus now I
actually got this one in prism white so
this is the prism white version with
this version you're gonna see some color
shifting just got like a little rainbow
effect we're going to put that to the
side real quick check out what else we
get in the box now right here we've got
the wall charger now this is the
standard wall charger that you get get
an adapter so there is actually a USB
type-c and it also gives you a regular
USB end now why this is useful you can
plug it up to your phone and then add
all kinds of different devices into the
phone since this thing is basically a
computer so it gives it a USB port and
this is our USB cable not fancy
well it's nice is that they give you an
awesome pair of AKG earbuds now these
are in earbuds let me let me get them
out so here we have the tips so boom
right there those are the tips you get
smalls and largest and the mediums are
already on the actual earbuds this is a
braided cable which is not the kind of
quality you expect from something
included in the packaging and we also
have this thing I guess this is where
all the paperwork is but one thing
that's interesting guys is look so we
got this little screen protector over
here and you see that little cutout
there's a little circle on the bottom
and that is because the display has a
built-in fingerprint sensor so I was
powered on you guys can see that camera
up front the dual cameras and you also
got the three in the back you got your
wide or you got your ultra wide wide and
telephoto and of course the flashes and
I'm not gonna lie to you guys this cut
out at the top I can see needing to get
used to it I feel like I'm not gonna
have any issues because I'm used to that
not being there this is different but I
feel like it's gonna be all in the same
category where you just kind of get used
to it over time okay so we got it all
set up now Samsung's clever the actual
wallpaper that it starts off with it's
got that little dark patch at the top so
you kind of don't realize that the
cameras are being hidden something Apple
did but it makes sense I guess now for
those of you guys who haven't watched
any s 10 videos yet and you don't know
any of the specs they all vary depending
on the model you go for but for mine
we're working with a snapdragon 855
processor eight gigs of ram 128 gigs of
Base storage which is on all devices and
you also get four thousand one hundred
milli amp hours of battery life now in
terms of features we're looking at ip68
water and dust resistance you also have
wireless charging you do get a headphone
jack here which is just amazing and of
course you get expandable storage up to
512 gigs but now can we please get to
the Galaxy buds I've been waiting and
waiting for these now everybody's
running around with the air pods except
for the broke boys but everyone's
running around with those and for me I
can't really use them because of the way
my ears are shaped so I need any ear
buds to actually go inside the ears and
stay and they only cost 130 bucks so one
$29.99 as cheaper than air pods right
air pods are like 170 I believe so
cheaper than air pods
50 bucks less and this is gonna be a
good option for those of us who can't
wear air pods not cuz we broke
cuz they don't fit alright cool so we
got the white one and hole this is so
much smaller this is a much smaller case
yo Malcolm can you grab the other gear
icon X dang so this is the original and
this is the new one so they say it's 30%
smaller but I thought they were just
talking about the buds I didn't know was
the case and everything this is gonna be
so much easier to take around with you
like you know you just put that in the
right position over there and then no
confusion okay now let's see what else
we get in the box
so these are just oh these supposed to
be like wing tips so if you work out and
you need something to kind of keep the
ear buds in make it a little bit more
secure you can kind of just throw these
in there I gotta say I'm very very happy
I got the white ones these looks so good
oh and they already include the little
wing tips on them so I throw them in man
there you go wow it is all like it is
noticeably smaller so if you're somebody
who already used the gear icon X in the
past
you're gonna immediately notice the
difference I think you just open it and
boom there you go
now all I got to do is hit connect allow
wow yes take all my info and it should
be pretty much Dutton right now I guess
it's syncing and there you go and that's
as simple as the I guess air pods
air pods are actually a little bit
easier it's just one button this one you
got to keep allowing it to do certain
things and that's just android for you
and I'm just noticing this but if you
guys go for the prism light version and
you go for the white earbuds this also
has like that prism look to it on the
actual sides so they match really well I
wonder what the other colors look like
but this looks
now something else that's really cool is
with the entire s10 line you get this
wireless power share feature which
pretty much turns this thing into a
wireless charging pad so I can take this
here put on its back and start charging
the actual earbuds heck I can even
charge an iPhone if I want it right on
top of that definitely one of the
coolest features we are seeing on
smartphones these days especially for me
it's great because I walk around with
more than one phone so that is gonna be
awesome since this one has such a high
battery capacity and I know Aaron's
gonna bug in for this feature all the
time too I can just see it happening I
can see myself getting annoyed but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that gives us video
thumbs up I'll catch you guys in the
next one till then it's your average
consumer piece why is this thing beeping
let me go figure it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
