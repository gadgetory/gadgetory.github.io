consumer and today I've got to review
for you guys of the J Burns Blue Bloods
X Wireless in here buds and guys if you
feel like this review tells you that you
do want these ear buds be sure to check
the description for a 15% off coupon
which is a limited time offer so that
you can grab these these retail for 160
9.99 so you got a good bit of savings
down there but like I said it's a
limited time offer so if you know you
want these be sure to grab that deal now
and hey let's not waste any time let's
get right into it alright guys here we
have the j-bird blue Bud's X wireless
earbuds and if you guys know me you know
I'm a fan of all that is Wireless and
these earbuds are no different but let's
take a quick look at some reasons why
the bluebloods X come with a very
stylish and hard shell carrying case
that has a nice rubberized coating it's
pretty compact and offers some great
protection but my only gripe with it is
that it can be a little difficult to
open but that's probably due to the
strong magnets that are inside that
keeps it together so just in case it
won't open up and have your earbuds fall
out and even if it does open up some
magical way there is a strong green band
inside that makes sure it's sealed and
nothing's going to fall out you are able
to add some stuff inside like the secure
ear fit cushions that you can keep
inside there and also it has a nice soft
coating inside very nice feeling this is
really a premium carrying case can't
complain
also inside of the packaging you'll get
the USB cable it's a micro USB and it's
very interesting because it's a flat
cable that you don't typically see
anywhere at first I thought it would be
like an armband but it's just a regular
cable and it's still pretty cool you
also get three pairs of ear tips this is
are the white ones and these are the
smallest of the three also you have two
more which are green and another that's
gray so these are all very comfortable
ear tips depending on your size you have
to make sure you get the perfect seal
for you
ears so that you can get the best sound
quality meaning personally I use the
gray ones because it gave me a great
seal and I was able to hear more bass
with it you also have the secured fair
ear cushions that when you put them on
the actual ear buds you're able to jump
around and exercise with these without
any problem and it's going to really be
secure
now you also get these two little clips
that are supposed to help condense the
cable depending on how you want to wear
it and I had a little difficulty using
these but there are instructions
included that will kind of guide you on
how to do this exactly and although I
had little use for it myself
it's very useful for those who want to
switch up their style or maybe they
don't like the extra cord that's offered
and now for the star of the show the
bluebloods X these are one of my
favorite pair of earbuds due to the
sheer versatility offered with them
earbuds are typically already compact
due to their small size but these take
it to another level as they're very very
small and they have such a small
footprint and there's just no dangling
cables here there's nothing that needs
to be plugged in you just sync it with
bluetooth and you're good to go I'm
really a fan of the design of these
earbuds and what's really cool about
them is that they also do a kind of a
curve into the ear canal so that it can
direct the music right into the ears I
love when ear buds do this and it just
helps with comfort and it really helps
to stay in the ear and as I mentioned
before these are really really small
there's not much to them as you can see
it's just the cable the inline remote
and the buds themselves a very small
footprint can't complain about the size
of this at all now you might be
wondering where do you charge it well
all you have to do is pull back that
little cap as you can see on the Left
earbud and pretty much that's where you
can find your microUSB cable input and
you just plug it in and you're good to
go when you charge it now when you
actually have it plugged in you'll see a
little red indicator that comes on and
it lets you know that it's charging and
when it's complete it'll turn green and
you know that you can unplug it and
start using them right away and here we
have the inline remote now this doesn't
come with all the track buttons you'd
expect on a
Bluetooth device but it does have the
volume up/down and the play and pause
button which also works as the power
button one of my biggest gripes with the
inline remote or the software used for
it rather is when you use the volume
buttons you'll hear a loud beep that
cancels out your music or call this can
be pretty frustrating when you're trying
to crank the volume to your favorite
part of a song as you might miss it
because of the beat also you can't use
the playing pause button to skip tracks
as it'll prompt you to use redial
instead these aren't deal-breakers but
they can be pretty frustrating now let's
take a look at the buds with the secure
fit ear cushions I was skeptical at
first on how much of an impact these
would have but surprisingly they did
quite well to keep the buds in place for
me and I really have no complaints here
as I mentioned before these earbuds are
quite versatile and you can even use
them in an over-the-air manner the
secure fit ear cushions helps to keep
this in place as well so it's really up
to you on how you'd like to wear them
and speaking of wearing them I have to
show you guys what they look like on
these are the regular way to wear them
note ear cushions or anything like that
and as you guys can see this doesn't
take up much space very simple design
not much to them and it's just clutter
free no cables dangling down I love it
and here we have the over ear version
and what's great about these earbuds is
because of the curved design of them
it's very easy to get inside comfortably
and if there's too much wire when using
it like this this is when those little
clips come in play and you can use them
to minimize the amount of wire that's
hanging on the back of your neck so
definitely good stuff there and here we
have a bit of a close-up of how the
secure fit cushions look inside the ears
kind of get an idea of how it fits and
why it's so secure very good stuff you
can see why it holds the ears very well
and of course as you'd expect I have to
show you guys a little bit of jogging
and jumping jacks as I usually do for
your in ear buds so so you guys can see
an idea of how well they stay in the ear
and I got to say the blue buds did not
disappoint in this department at all and
the secure fit made it even better I can
shake my head and as you
can see nothing's happening these are
definitely very secure and now for the
part you've all been waiting for the
sound quality I must say guys these
sound great they offer some great bass
and some beautiful clarity it's
important that you use the right ear
tips to maximize the kind of sound
quality you'll get but as far as music
goes this does wonderfully and I'd say
it's on par with the beats tours for
those who are familiar with them and
definitely better than other wired ear
buds I've tried and these are even great
for taking calls
you'll hear anyone you're speaking to
with perfect clarity and they'll hear
you the same way I've had no issues in
those regards whatsoever I was very
happy with the sound quality I got out
of these and I'm sure the average
consumer would be as well I've got to
say guys these are some really great ear
buds with a ton going for them if you're
looking for a pair of buds to work out
in look no more their sweat resistant
offered up to eight hours of battery
life and you can be pretty far from your
device without losing connectivity which
is great if you want to put your device
down while you shoot some hoops or
something and last but not least on the
list of noteworthy features is that it
has a voice prompt that lets you know
the actions being taken on the buzz
themselves such as turning them off
connecting them or even running out of
power like I said before tons of
versatility here these are great even
for casual use which I use them
primarily for and I can definitely
recommend these to the average consumer
if you're in the market for something
like this they retail for about 160 9.99
and I gotta say guys they're worth it
and that pretty much wraps up my review
