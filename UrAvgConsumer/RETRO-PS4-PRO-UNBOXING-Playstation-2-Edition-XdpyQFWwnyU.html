and today we have a very very special
unboxing from the guys over at kala
we're oh all right come to the stand
I'll take it
all right guys and here we have what
looks like a typical PlayStation 4 Pro
but it's from Colin ware so you know
it's not alright oh I feel like it's win
we're packaging here than ever before
but probably cuz I'm super height and
it's upside down
Oh looks just like the PlayStation 2 so
what we have right here guys is a retro
ps4 Pro you guys know color wear has
done retro ps4s in the past either the
PlayStation 1 but now right here we've
got the PlayStation 2 this thing looks
so good - some b-roll
and these are the accessories that come
with it just like your standard
Playstation 4 pro would we've got our
controller the terrible ear piece we've
also got the HDMI cable as well as a
micro USB cable and your power plug on
alright guys look at these bad boys the
PlayStation 2 this is listen this is my
baby right here I played this thing for
years you've got my childhood right here
in 16 megabytes but this was an awesome
system the PlayStation 2 was
revolutionary for those of you who don't
know this is the most old console of all
time the PlayStation 2 sold 155 million
units that's insane that is an insane
number but it makes sense this was an
awesome system I loved it
I spent so much time on it it back in
the day this was one of the first
systems that could actually go on the
internet and do it properly uh-huh but
the PlayStation 4 Pro here Byculla where
looks exactly like it honestly I'm just
in awe with how great color I did in
terms of copying the PlayStation 2 look
but I'm not surprised color where'd they
do this you know but they've gotten all
the things down like in gradient on the
ps2 like it is on the ps4 and even the
PlayStation 2 that's under it along with
the PlayStation 4 that's under here
there's Sony logos even that they've
even got the colored PlayStation logo
and color always kills it with the
details so I'm not surprised but this is
still a treat to look at and check this
out guys the vertical stand that it
comes with color where even colored that
up to match the stand that came with or
that the PlayStation 2 was often
pictured with I don't even know if it
came with the standard listen I bought I
bought this thing used it came with this
little extra attachment I was happy it
came with that I didn't have a stand I
don't know if it came in the box don't
know what unboxing experience was like
for that one and I just love that color
where's paying homage to the classic
systems like the PlayStation 1 the ps2
would be very interesting to see what
they do with the ps3 since that was a
very different design if they're working
on that
I'm very very excited to see it but now
the biggest question I have for you guys
is which one should I put in the gamers
paradise should it be the PlayStation 2
or should it be the retro Playstation
one that I've got let me know what to
comment down below which one you think
should make it in here and which one I
should take home now if you guys want to
get your hands on it I'll of course have
it linked down below in the description
they're a little pricey but if you
already have a PlayStation 4 Pro and you
want to still achieve the same look I
think they've got some skin options down
below so that'll save you quite a bit of
money if you're looking to get the same
look as your original PlayStation 2 so
if you enjoyed this be the cool guy or
girl that gives this video a thumbs up
and I'll catch you guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
