consumer and today I'm going to be doing
comparison of the beats by dre mixers
versus the beats wireless so let's not
wasting time let's get right into it
alright guys and here we have the beats
Wireless and the beats mixr's now I've
know I've done tons of beats videos but
the comparison requests keep on rolling
in so I got to give you guys what you
want and you guys wanted to see the
mixes versus the wireless so the first
thing we're going to talk about is the
design on both of these are great
looking headphones cannot complain
whatsoever about them the beats mixers
are probably one of the best-looking
beats that are out right now in my
opinion I think that these look amazing
um the design of it is really nice the
black long black with the red B looks
great I think that this is just a one of
the best looking headphones that they
came out with now the beats Wireless are
also very nice these are similar to the
solo HDS but and just in comparison to
the mixers I gotta give it up to the
mixers and as far as durability I also
got to give it to the mixers because of
this tough material that it's made out
of this isn't going to break anytime
soon it's really strong and you know
very happy with that now that doesn't
mean that the wireless are on week at
all or anything but this is just a
tougher material on the mixers then the
Wireless has is more of a plastic feel
this is more of a not even sure what
kind of feel this is but it feels harder
then it feels harder than the wireless
do so I got to give it up to wire up to
the mixers for the durability as well
overall for comfort I gotta give it to
wireless easily the wireless have much
softer cushions and the mixer is because
of that strong material it's got a
pretty
I feel and you know this gonna be really
you know hard to deal with because after
some time this can really you know clamp
down on your head and for me after about
a couple of minutes of using it it never
feels really that comfortable so that's
my only gripe with the mixers really
it's just comfort is not really good on
here and I've had tons of people
commenting and my friends who've tried
it who all agree so I think you know you
have to be very careful with the mixers
if you want them and you probably have
to go and try them out maybe at a Best
Buy because they do have them on display
so you might want to give them a try
before purchasing them if you really
want them buy them if if you feel that
they're uncomfortable after a while
there's no harm in returning them so
just something to keep in mind but the
wireless feel a lot more comfortable
these are great feeling the cushions are
extremely soft
can't complain whatsoever when it comes
to that now of course we're going to
talk about sound quality I do think that
the mixers have better clarity
Vande Wireless but the wireless offer um
pretty good bass they offer more based
on the mixers do them they still sound
good though wireless sound very good for
um for my listening but the mixers just
offer a bit more clarity might be the
base that's toned down a bit so I think
that you know that's the difference
between these two they're both really
really good that doesn't mean that this
lacks bass or this lacks clarity this is
that these are better in those
categories but I'm a huge fan of the
wireless the bass is great it still
sounds great to me
while these you know sound a little
clearer but just not as much bass so it
depends on what you really what you
really value more so that's about it for
the sound quality now to talk about the
little features that these have of
course the wireless one of the biggest
things on it is that it's Wireless of
course and you can use this with
Bluetooth on any device that you know
has bluetooth like your iPod your iPhone
cell phone like your Android phone all
those it works with everything
and it works well and the mixers have
this little neat feature where you can
swivel the earcup up and have one ear
exposed now I know this is supposed to
be like for DJs and stuff but for
regular people you can use this like you
know have one ear exposed when you're
talking to someone or you know on you
know you're just outside and you just
want to be aware of your surroundings or
whatever so it's good to have that and
also it's really nice that the mixers
have these two headphone jacks to plug
in your auxiliary cables which are the
little cables that the you know bees
come with and you can kind of listen to
one you can plug in one to your audio
device as well as plug in another pair
of headphones so you can kind of share
your music between one device between
two people so that's always really
really cool and pretty much guys that's
about it for the features and you know
the real differences between these two
headphones YUM overall the beats
Wireless have better base and the mixers
have better clarity as far as music goes
the mixers have better design in my
opinion as well as better durability
while the wireless has the Bluetooth
feature and these have do you know
swivel and for these you can daisy chain
which is that feature where you can
share your music like that and overall I
think that I really value the wireless
feature of you know the wireless and I
also value having a lot of base so these
are my go-to headphones but if you're
not big on the wireless or you don't
think you'll ever really use them um you
know mixers might be a better choice for
you and for the mixers you just got to
make sure that they're comfortable and
before you really invest in them even if
you do like I said you can always go and
return them and pick up something else
and pretty much that wraps up my
comparison of the two the beats Wireless
are currently my favorite pair of Beats
out until the executives comes out and
we'll see how that runs and that's about
it guys so if you enjoyed this video
