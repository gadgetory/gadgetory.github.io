consumer and today we're taking a look
at some awesome tech under 25 bucks
which is by no means easy to find but
Before we jump into that I want to let
you guys know running another giveaway
this time I'm teaming up with my man
Detroit Borg and we're not giving away
one but two phones an iPhone 7 plus and
a Google pixel XL and you've got the
standard rules all you got to do is be
subscribed to my channel as well as
Detroit Borg's

video and has if you want another entry
and boom you got your chance to win a
brand new phone a random one is gonna be
chosen in two weeks so be sure you're
following us over on Twitter because
that's where we're gonna be announcing
it and even if you don't follow us just
make sure you check our pages but that's
about it for that giveaway guys now
we'll talk about some of that awesome
tech we're gonna get this one out of the
way first we've got a portable charger
now I know you've seen tons and tons of
portable chargers but I like this one
because it's inexpensive it has 10,000
milliamp hours and it has an LCD screen
that lets you know how much juice you've
got left now most portable chargers have
an LED indicator that changes colors to
let you know when to charge it but I
think it's nice to have something a bit
more precise so you know how much you
can charge your phone or when you'll
need to actually charge the charger now
this portable charger is made by one by
one not to be confused with oneplus one
and it actually has 10,000 milliamps
which is pretty good especially at under
25 bucks and next up we've got the
Logitech X 100 now this is a small
portable bluetooth speaker which is
extremely extremely surprising because
it has some really decent audio quality
when Ari and I first tried to stop we
were shocked at just how loud this thing
got considering its size this thing can
easily fit in the palm of your hand and
with this little rope latch thingy you
can throw it on a book bag pretty easily
or however you'd like to travel with it
it comes in a bunch of different color
so you can match this with your gear and
it has all the functionality that a
regular Bluetooth speaker has but it is
missing those tracks skipping buttons so
you will have to rely on your phone or
whatever you have it connected through
just a bit more and I think this thing
was like 17 bucks so if you're looking
for a nice portable Bluetooth speaker
which definitely doesn't cost a lot
you're gonna be pretty happy with this
next up we've got the Avant rehab film
stand and I actually like this one for a
few reasons the surface that actually
holds your headphones has a nice long
padded bridge so when you do place your
headphones on it if you've got a soft
cushion you're not gonna see those crazy
imprints when you pick them up to use as
for that bottom surface it has a nice
little indent so that if your headphones
come with a cable you could have some
cable management thereby closing up
those cables and putting them right in
the center it's also super lightweight
but not light enough that you'll knock
off your desk and I think the overall
look of it is pretty nice especially if
you have a pretty black or similar theme
setup going on and while I may not be
super bulky with a weighted bottom it's
still solid enough to hold any pair of
headphones and speaking of headphones I
actually have some pretty cool in
earbuds by G chord which I've never
heard before but I was really impressed
when I tried these out we've got a nice
braided cable sorry I don't feel cheap
and flimsy and it even includes an
inline remote which only has one button
but that one button will work for
Android or iOS free iPhone 7 I guess but
it does include a mic so in terms of
build quality I really like what you get
here especially since these go for about
15 bucks and it also has that like black
and red theme that so many people go
crazy for so not only does it feel good
in the hand but it actually looks pretty
good too now in terms of sound quality
at this price range I expected these to
either have no bass whatsoever or have
way too much of it but surprisingly this
did have a good amount of bass but it
wasn't overwhelming and when I threw the
volume up it didn't sound crazy muddy so
these actually sounds really good
especially if you like a little bit more
bass in your music at 15 bucks build
quality sound quality and overall looks
this is definitely a steal and last but
not least we've got a USB type-c dock
since USB type-c is getting way more
popular and we're seeing it in a lot
more phones and tablets it's about time
we got to know which docks exist out
there and what I like about this dock is
that it offers some support in the back
so when you're connecting your phone you
don't have to worry about any damage
coming from the port's
it also has a nice rubberized texture on
the bottom so you don't have to worry
about this moving around or sliding on
your desk but that about wraps it up for
this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it

gives this video a thumbs up and make
