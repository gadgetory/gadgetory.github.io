consumer and today I've got a review of
our a chaise ma 750i it's a pretty cool
pair of earbuds so hey let's not wasting
time let's get right into it alright
guys here we have our a chaise ma 750i
now I know you've probably never heard
of these before but let me tell you
they're pretty sweet they're very well
built and have a great design but before
we get into that let's take a look at
what's included when you purchase a pair
you can see that this comes with some
really nice packaging with a ton of
details about the earbuds around the
entire box including specs you also get
a glimpse inside at the buds themselves
and also the ear tips included when you
finally get it out the box you'll
already be able to see how high-quality
these are the ear buds have a stainless
steel housing and you can find more
stainless steel accents around the mic
the middle of the cables and the input
and since this is a 750 I it does come
with an inline remote that works with
Apple products such as the iPhone iPod
etc but there is a version that is this
the 750 that doesn't include an inline
remote the cables are pretty thick which
is very nice to see on some earbuds
these all give it a very durable feel
and it's surprisingly light if you do
find it heavy at all which I doubt you
will be able to use the closing clip
that's included to keep it in place and
speaking of keeping it in place the
earbuds have an over ear hook design and
I'm pretty fond of the design because it
greatly decreases the chance of the bud
falling out of your ear and I found that
the 750 eyes are very comfortable to
wear because of this and it also helps
that the hook is in bulky at all it has
some very thin wires and that I'm really
really happy about that you can walk
around with these with confidence and
you don't have to worry about it just
popping out of your ear along with the
750 eyes you'll find a nice variety of
ear tips so you can find the perfect
seal and fit for you of course like any
other earbud having the right seal is
very important to sound quality and it's
great to see that there are tons and
tons of options provided to you to make
sure you get the right fit also included
a very nice carrying case and you can
carry all of your ear tips as well as
the earbuds themselves and the case
feels very high-quality and will
definitely help to protect the longevity
of these buds now the 750 eyes are a
pair of ear buds so we can't forget to
talk about sound quality you'll find
that these are very well balanced pair
of buds they're crisp they're clear and
they pack a punch
being a bass head that I am I'm quite
impressed at the bass quality here and
the overall aspect of sound that you'll
get from these overall these are a very
great package deal in the realm of sound
and it performed well with most genres
that I throw at it these are very good
at isolating sounds so you'll be able to
focus on your music and not really have
to worry about what's on the outside
you'll be able to hear all the sounds
and details of your music without any
problems
overall guys these are amazing buds and
are very well worth the one hundred and
twenty dollar price tag the design is
amazing followed by great durability and
comfort they didn't skimp on the quality
here and that's what's most impressive
about these guys although we can't
forget about the awesome sound quality
that you'll get from these as well with
pretty nice clarity and surprisingly
great bass I think that these buds will
be great for anyone who wants to pick
them up and start jamming to some high
quality music I definitely do recommend
these and I think it's well worth the
investment
now like I said you might not have heard
of these before but if you're looking
for some very solid ear buds take my
word for it these are definitely worth
the investment but that about wraps it
up for my review guys hopefully you
enjoyed it prove how cool you are and
