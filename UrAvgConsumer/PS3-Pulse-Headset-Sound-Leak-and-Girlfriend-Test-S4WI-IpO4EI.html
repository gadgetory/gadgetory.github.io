consumer this is my girlfriend hey
everyone and today we have another sound
leak sound isolation test ok other
girlfriend tests for you guys of the
PlayStation Paul's headset wireless
headset so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it so first we're
gonna start off with the sound leak test
and we're gonna play music from volumes
at 50% 75% and then 100% just so we can
see how much it leaks at those different
volumes with these headphones alright so
are you ready yes alright so let's try
it out at 50% and here we are
so I hear it a little bit it's
definitely looking a good bit for a 50%
so I mean it's someone who's not so
close to you won't really hear it but
being this close you definitely hear it
so 75% right good all right there goes a
great song
all right here 75% so there is a 75% all
right so now we're gonna play at 100%
all right yep alright so here goes
all right so that's it for 100%
definitely very loud very very loud it
leaks quite a bit considering this is a
wireless headset it's mainly supposed to
be used indoors especially for gaming
but Sony does advertise that you can use
it as a regular pair of headphones
especially since they give you a cord
for it and everything so just consider
just keep in mind that it will leak
quite a bit if you go outside with them
and pump your music really loudly so I
can feel like the bass on my head I know
that's my favourite part of this test
phones I love it also I keep in mind
that I did leave the volume of the
actual headphones at a hundred percent
so we can just control it from one so
that's something to keep in mind as well
and now we're gonna move on to a
girlfriend test okay next one yes
alright so this is my part and it's the
girlfriend so the girlfriend test is
basically a test to see if my girlfriend
likes things that I do like my nagging
my talking excessively my singing and
you can block all those out using his
headphones but today we have a little
spin on the girlfriend test is actually
not a girlfriend test today it's more of
a I guess a dog test test
so our dog Chloe is very very loud she
likes to protect us and whenever she
hears a knock on the door she goes nuts
oh so we're going to see how she reacts
to some knocking and with this music on
and see if I can block it out it those
three different volumes 50% to 75% and
100% and here is the star of our show
today alright so I'm gonna have her sit
here with us and let's try it out at 50%
alright okay tough girl alright so at a
50% definitely wasn't enough I did hear
her quite a bit so was drinking at 75%
and see if it works they're ready so I
did hear quite a bit at 75% as well so
let's see how it is a times percent
alright
all right so at 100% it did the trick
it definitely locked her out but it took
a lot she's very very loud though so
keep that in mind um it wasn't too bad
though definitely did the trick out a
hundred and not the others but like I
said she's very very loud so that's
about it for this test guys and here's
the bad guy herself I know I'm sorry
Clark not CeCe's family's she loves it
alright guys that's about it for the
song you can sound isolation test if you
guys enjoyed please feel free to rate
comment and subscribe and we'll catch
you guys in the next one
so then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
