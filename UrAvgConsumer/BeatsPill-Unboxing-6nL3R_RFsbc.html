consumer and today I have another
unboxing video for you guys of one of
the most requested products that I've
gotten in a long time and that's up the
beats pill buy beats by dre so let's not
waste any time let's get right into it
and alright guys here we have the beats
pill now this is a lot smaller than the
beatbox portable that I reviewed not so
long ago and it's going to be really
interesting to see how this is you guys
showed a ton of interest in it this is
at about half the price of the beatbox
portable and it's really really small
those boxes tiny compared to the
portable so it's going to be interesting
to see this works with Bluetooth it has
a bunch of special features like NFC and
for those of you who don't know what NFC
is on to put in layman's terms you can
put it next to something that you know
activates NFC and you get some kind of
desired effect I know it phones it
usually makes things pop up on your
screen but I don't know what kind of
effect it'll have with a speaker like
this so it's going to be interesting to
see I'll let you guys know in the review
but um enough of my talking let's open
this thing up so we just pop open the
top and pretty much this is a pretty
standard on beat packaging the products
a box goes shows you what's behind it
shows you some of the features mainly
bleed Bluetooth shows you that it can
work with tablets computers phones all
kinds of Bluetooth enabled devices so
let's pull this off the top and here we
are almost all right cool and let's see
we have the little flap here so let's
pull this open I feel we have the beats
pill and I gotta say guys I'm pretty
surprised this is really small really
small so I'm interested in seeing how
much sound it can put out but before we
get into that
let's see what we have in the box here
so here is probably Jessop standard
beats packaging I'm pretty sure it's
going to be just more booklets on the
other devices of course stickers and
warranty information all the standard um
manual stuff so let's put this back and
let's get to over here now inside this
little compartment here and pull this
flap up you've got some more
instructions I believe you got two
auxiliary cables none that to auxiliary
cable sorry one is a USB 2 S charge it
now this is interesting because the
original USB that beats normally come
with I think the only thing that came
with one was the beats Wireless was a
lot thinner the cable was much much
thinner and I actually happen to have it
right here
as you can see it's a much thinner cable
so it's now a pretty thick USB cable
which is pretty good and I guess it
comes with an auxilary cable so you can
plug in like an iPod or your phone or
anything like that into the beats pill
so you can play your music if it doesn't
have bluetooth so get some of those
we've got some more instructions here
all that good stuff let's see what else
we got
I guess we have a little clip here so if
we want to hook the beats pill I guess
has a case if we want to hook that up to
a like a book bag or anything like that
we have that option and once inside this
little box let's see here what's this
okay and here we have the beats charger
so you can use your USB cable to plug in
here and charge up the beats pill so let
me show you guys a pretty quick little
step of what this looks like and here we
have it guys this is the beats pill USB
charger so you can plug this into the
outlet and charge up your stuff and
here's the beats pill USB cable that I
was talking about that's pretty thick
compared to the old wireless USB cable
that's right here as you can see there's
quite a bit of a difference in the
thickness of this cable so good job for
bat beats for making this little thicker
and more sturdy and now to the star of
the show
just pull the SOB and okay this is a
pretty interesting little seal that it
has here I've never never seen these do
something like this where it's a sealed
package so that's interesting
you have to kind of pull it open and
that goes off and here we have it now
this is really tiny guys and this is a
really nice case that it has on it it's
a lifestyle
case I don't know if it's hardshell or
not let's open it up okay it is
hardshell but let me give you guys quick
close-up of what the case looks like and
here we have it it's I got the white
version so this is it here and take a
look around and I guess this is right
where here is where you put in the the
little thing to the clip so that you can
put it on to your book bag or whatever
you want to do this is what that is and
pretty much this is it I'm glad this is
a hardshell case should offer some good
protection
now let's unzip this thing see what it
looks like I'm just really really
surprised at how small this is guys this
is this is tiny this is really really
small okay now let me give you guys a
quick
of the actual beads bill and here we
have a guys this is it very small very
tiny so says beats pill at the bottom
you can see it has like a rubberized
texture right here I don't know if you
guys can tell but this is rubberized and
it kind of feels like the back is as
well it's got a really soft coating on
here and of course this is just regular
speaker material that the hard material
here for speakers and it's got that soft
coating all around it really if we take
off this sticker first let's see what
the sticker actually says this is tapped
to pair so you can pair right here this
also got the NFC give you some
instructions on how to pair a bluetooth
if you guys aren't familiar so you got
that information there
think you can take this off put that
over there and this is it without the
sticker or anything pretty nice I like
the white color not bad at all and up
here is where you have your volume
controls as you can see it says NFC so
it's got that feature you got your power
button you actually line in and out you
have the Bluetooth signal right there
and this is where you will charge it
with your micro USB point um cord and
pretty much that's it guys this looks
like it could be a mic right there so
I'm thinking that's what that might be
you can probably use this for phone
calls and talking into it and use it
kind of like the jam box that is out
there so it's gonna be pretty
interesting to see I'll let you guys
know all the features and all that good
stuff
once I spent some time with it and I
give you guys my full review all right
guys that's about it for this unboxing
you got some pretty cool stuff here this
is the tiny beats pill got the hardshell
case the little clip to put on your book
bag or something you get your auxilary
cable you're plugging your device to it
if it doesn't have bluetooth you also
get this micro USB cable to plug it in
and charge it and your wall adapter and
that's all you get in the box guys so if
you enjoyed this unboxing please feel
free to rate comment and subscribe
and I'll catch you guys in the next
video till then it's your average
consumer peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
