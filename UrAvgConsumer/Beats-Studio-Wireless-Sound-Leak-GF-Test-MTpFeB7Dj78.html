average consumer and this is my
girlfriend
hello and it's been quite some time
since she's been back on the show
so welcome her back like give her a
thumbs up and today we're going to be
doing a sound leak and sound isolation
test taking the girlfriend test and
today we're doing this with the beat
Studios Wireless so we told you guys
that the girlfriend test would be making
a comeback for these guys and we have it
so let's not waste any time let's get
right into it and first thing I want to
note is that we are in our living room
right now welcome to our living room
sofa at least and we're here because
we're going to be doing something
special with this test um give me a
boyfriend test actually yeah so stay
tuned for that but first we're gonna
start off with the sound leak test and
what we're gonna do is we're gonna play
music at 50% 75% and then 100% to see
how much the music leaks from the
headphones at those different volumes
and since of course this is a wireless
headphone all we have here is the iPod
and then films themselves and my hair is
not covering my ears at all I made sure
to remove them from the cups so put that
disclaimer out there so first we're
gonna start off with 50% and we're gonna
see how loud it sounds there you ready
yes and let's see here it is at 50%
that's silent is it playing mm-hmm Wow
so that's really good guys so 50% I
can't hear a thing right next to her
really good stuff so let's crank it up
to 75% all right all right ready see if
you can guess the song this is like one
of my favorite songs at the moment so
here it is at 75 I can hear a little bit
not that bad no all right so now we're
gonna do it at 100% are you ready yes
are you sure you ready I'm positive I'm
ready guys we don't recommend listening
to music at 100% as they can't damage
your hearing but we'll do it for you so
here it is at 100% I can hear that
so I think that anybody could pretty
much hear that but that's not bad at all
though it didn't sound like really
obnoxious I'm really next mm I'm really
close to you you are very closely so a
pretty good job there so Beats Studio
wireless gets a pass just like the
original did we know the old ones who
and so now we're gonna move on to the
boyfriend test yay okay now let's play
you can go in great one so the boyfriend
test whoa I'm speaking really
loudly
the boyfriend test is basically a test
to see if these headphones can block out
any annoying sounds it's usually a
girlfriend desk some pretty annoying
sometimes so I'm just picking bucket
like my singing my nagging and any of
those other kind of things that
boyfriends or girlfriends - so this time
I'm gonna be doing this and what I have
here today is I'm going to be using my
xbox one that I just got and I'm still
trying to learn the controls Xbox pause
see it's getting ahead of me here oh my
gosh let me tell you guys he has been
testing this thing out day and night and
it is very annoying so I want to see if
these can block out those sounds because
I'm if I can take it anymore so I'm
still trying to learn the features still
yelling out commands it all trying to
get it to function the way I wanted to
so I'm gonna just use it like I normally
do and give the commands that I'm trying
to give so we'll unmute this to use that
moderate volume and I'm going to hit
play
ready yes all right
Xbox play
cool so that worked
okay Xbox pause I hear you you hear me
yeah I'm about to TV though I don't hear
the TV but I hear your voice okay
so for now you heard that you heard my
voice machine you hear the TV why don't
you try the Xbox commands with Netflix
so we can hear like actual TV like says
consoling going right okay so here we're
gonna put it pump it up to 75% I'm gonna
get the Xbox to go to Netflix all right
so you ready yes
Xbox go to Netflix so we've got some
American bad on Xbox
fast forward faster play wasn't that
fast
didn't get through the intro uh no I
don't hear it Xbox pause Xbox pause yeah
I didn't hear anything at all you hear
me
I heard you very very sad little okay
that's what's going on for it but like
been a minute here
okay of anything so now we're gonna try
it at 100% just for the fun of it you're
gonna see how it does there see if it
could completely block me out you ready
yes all right
Xbox play no Xbox go to Skype you know
Xbox watch TV here what just fantasy no
Xbox cause that's TV all right
I knew it so well good
yeah yes'm um it was perfect didn't hear
anything from you and hear the TV as you
would expect from a hundred percent some
headphones you do have noise canceling
how the - Helen game my hair gets messed
up alright guys so that was about it
hopefully you enjoyed it was a little
weird trying to figure out all the Xbox
commands what to do but hopefully you
enjoyed it and if you did prove how much
you did by hitting the like button and

next video till then it's your average
consumer and his girlfriend peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
