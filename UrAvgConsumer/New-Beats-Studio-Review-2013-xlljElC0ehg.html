consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the newly redesigned beat
studios these are the 2013 version so
hey let's not waste any time let's get
right into it alright guys here we have
the redesigned Beats Studio for 2013
these retail for $300 just like the
original version but let's take a look
to see if it's worth your investment the
B's Studios have changed quite
drastically in the looks department now
they kind of look like a hybrid between
the Beats Studio of course the solo HDS
and the beats executive now all together
this does equal out to have a very nice
design one that I'm particularly a fan
of now they feature a very sleek compact
look very nice finish but one thing
though with this plastic material that
it's made out of it is a fingerprint
magnet and it looks terrible in black
but with white you shouldn't really have
an issue and just to give you guys an
idea of how sleek it has become
comparing this to the old beat studios
it's like night and day
so here's a quick example right now
we're looking at the original studios
they're a lot bigger a lot wider a lot
flashy with all the red and let's take a
look back at the new studios a lot more
compact similar to the solo HDS they've
got the big red studios I'm really a big
fan of the change now the studio still
had that plastic material that they're
made out of but I've never really had an
issue as far as the durability goes so I
think you don't really have to worry
here ever since they did the redesign of
the headband I think that it's going to
be just okay and the headband is quite
comfortable now taking a look at these
the ear cups are also very nice and this
is where you get that beats executive
kind of look going for it it has like
executive ear cups but I find these are
a bit bigger than the original
executives now your ear can fit entirely
inside of the ear cup and it's actually
very very comfortable it's quite soft
and I really have no
wearing this for a long period of time
I'm not afraid to call these the most
comfortable beats so far but while we're
on the topic of ear cups what I do like
with the new beats studios is that the
mute button on the side now features a
control where it doesn't just mute the
music immediately the volume decreases
until the music fades out and this is
great for when you accidentally press
the mute button or you press it thinking
you'll need to use it but you actually
don't so now your music doesn't just cut
off and you miss you know part of the
song now it kind of decreases into that
mute that you might need and here's a
quick example of what I'm talking about
here one neat feature of the studio's is
it now has a battery indicator that
takes away the guesswork of knowing how
much battery you have left which is
really helpful but the only downside
with this is if you don't have the cable
plugged in to power on the studio's you
won't be able to use it it'll just turn
off and you can't really guess how much
battery you have left at that point and
that leads to another feature that the
studios have it automatically powers on
and off depending on whether or not you
have your cable plugged into it now this
is really cool feature but it also is a
pain in my opinion because sometimes you
just want to take your Studios off like
your head or your neck and you place
them down somewhere but you have to take
out the plug if you don't want the
battery to sit there and drain and this
can sometimes feel like more work than
hitting an on and off switch but taking
a look at the cable that you use to
power it on it has an inline remote just
like all the other beats and it also
comes with one that has just a straight
cable but this one works with Apple
devices and Android for play and pause
now they did change the design of the
input and it looks really cool I like it
as like a swivel around the B but I like
the fact that it's a raised input more
so than anything mainly because you can
use this with mobile device cases or you
know mp3 player cases all that stuff it
works just fine with no problems there
now this also comes with a USB charger
because it is rechargeable one of the
best things they could have done to the
studios I hated the fact that before you
needed to have
bleh batteries and now you can just
charge these up and be ready to go
charging takes about like an hour or so
to get the full 20 hours of usage out of
this
so charging is pretty good it lasts a
very long time so I'm very happy with
this change definitely an upgrade and of
course it comes with a USB to wall
adapter so you can plug this up to your
wall charge really quickly you can even
charge it through your computer if you
want but charging it through the wall
would be the fastest of course the
studio's also offer a pretty new case
it's an egg shell case and when you open
it up you'll see that you have a ton of
space inside so you can throw a lot of
things inside of here but there is no
pouch so that you can throw your cables
inside of so your cables are going to be
pretty loose inside there flopping
around with the Kate with the headphones
and that's a bit unfortunate but it is a
solid case and will protect your
headphones from any damage that you'd
expect and it also has a little spot for
a clip if you want to put it on your
book bag or your suitcase or whatever
and how of course to talk about the
sound quality what you guys all been
waiting for the sound quality is a huge
huge huge improvement I am quite a fan
of the new sound quality that these have
it's really night and day in comparison
to the old studios they've done huge
improvements in the clarity department
now you're able to hear vocals and
instruments a lot more clearly than we
used to in the past now you're able to
hear that without worrying about the
bass being too muddy over the
instruments or the vocals because now
they've also did a really good job at
controlling the bass I find that the
bliss doesn't sound as bloated in
comparison to the old ones now it sounds
a lot more tight a lot more consistent
and what I mean by that is it just
doesn't sound like over-the-top now it
sounds like the bass is right where it
needs to be right where the artist
intended rather than just a ton of bass
being thrown at you and I really do like
the idea of having a more controlled
bass it really does up the sound quality
but no frets all the bass heads out
there like myself it still offers a
great amount of bass but what's great
about this is that it has the bass and
the clarity that it's been missing
in the past so it's a very very nice
combination and improvement overall so
now the studios are no longer limited to
just rap or hip-hop genres or even
dubstep or things like that
and now the increased attention to
vocals and high-pitched instruments like
flutes and things of that nature you're
going to get a lot better sound overall
and it's going to be able to work from
multiple genres rather than the hip hop
dubstep kind of thing but of course now
I have to show you guys what it looks
like on and here they are so here it is
on my head you guys can see it from the
front here it is on the side and there
you have it
like I said a lot sleeker with the noise
cancelling just now but alas sleeker
it's a lot more compact
I really wasn't a fan of the old Studios
simply because of some of the downfalls
they had but really the size of it was
really big I was never a fan of to huge
studios when I first bought my first
pair of Beats I went for the solo HDS
because of the size but this is a nice
nice medium between the two soloist
these are a lot smaller this is right in
the middle so I think that this is a
really really nice look and I'm really
happy with it um one thing to note that
I didn't mentioned before is that with
these when the battery is dying you
don't get that terrible sound quality
that happens before now when the
batteries on its last leg it just dies
when it's dead so you don't have to
worry about the sound quality decreasing
simply because the battery is low it'll
just die on you and then you just have
to charge it up so no worries there
that's really really good overall I'm
very happy with these um if you're
interested in looking for a pair of
beats I definitely would recommend these
and pretty much that's my review guys
hopefully you enjoyed it and alright

studios let me know in the comments down

new changes do you like them do you
