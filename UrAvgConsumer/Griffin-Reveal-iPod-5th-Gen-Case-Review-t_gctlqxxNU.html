consumer today I'm going to be doing a
review of the Griffin reveal iPod Touch
5th generation case so it's not wasting
any time let's get right into it alright
guys here we have Griffin's reveal iPod
Touch 5th generation case and this
retails for about 20 bucks so let's see
if this is the right case for you so now
let's take a quick look at the case by
itself as you can see as the back is
completely see-through with a cutout for
the I loop as well as the camera and on
the right side you'll see that it does
say Griffin and the left has the buttons
for the volume control as well as the
top has one for the power now as we take
a look at the case with the iPod Touch
inside you'll see that the case adds no
real bulk to the device and you can
pretty much see the device very clearly
the border around this case is made with
a rubberized material which makes
pressing buttons really easy and really
easy to access now when we take a look
at the back of the case you'll see those
cutouts I mentioned before and now you
can see it with the loop inside it's a
little awkward because the loop does
bend a bit inside but it works just fine
and the bottom of the case is completely
cut out so you can have space for your
headphone jack lightning connector and
speaker and even with this big cutout at
the bottom the device is still very
secure inside here's a closer look at
the iPod Touches camera and you can see
that it has a lot of space for the flash
and the camera itself but one thing I
don't like about this case is that
because it's see-through you can also
see all the scratches from when you
leave it on a surface or anything like
that overall I'm very happy with this
case as it looks really good it matches
the iPod Touches sleek design and the
see-through case really helps because
the new iPod Touch does have a really
nice design on them and since they're
multiple colors you'll find that you can
see right through it and it really does
help with the aesthetics of this device
so overall I would recommend this to
anyone who is interested it's only 20
bucks if you want it and it offers some
pretty good protection and it offers a
really nice grip because of the
rubberized sides and that pretty much
wraps up this roof
