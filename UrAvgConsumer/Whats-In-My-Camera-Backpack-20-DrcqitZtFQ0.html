consumer and if you follow me on
Instagram and Twitter you know I'm out
here in Las Vegas for CES and of course
with me I have a ton of camera equipment
all in this backpack so I'm going to be
doing here is going over everything
inside of this giant thing and letting
you guys know what I'm carrying with me
so hey let's not waste any time
let's get right into it so what I've got
here is a Manfrotto backpack this is a
videocamera backpack because I have a
video camera inside but it has a lot of
compartments as you guys can see on the
sides the front got a lot of stuff here
but we're going to do is we're going to
start right up front here with this
little tab that's hidden so let's unzip
it see what we've got
so the first things first we've got some
dividers that were inside of here but
these are just taking up space at this
point because this thing is so packed
can't divide anything I just have to
throw it all in there right here I've
got a white balance card so with this as
you can see it has a white part and it's
gray up here and this is I can get my
colors right do some color correcting
and post-production so this is why I
carry this thing around it really helps
as far as like getting good quality
videos so we're going to put this away
now and see what else we've got inside
this is just a little pouch this thing
now since this is a backpack and you're
going to be outdoors with it it comes
with a pretty much a raincoat so that
you can throw it over this guy
and you're protecting your gear from the
rain snow whatever it is so if you're
out in the weather this thing has got
you covered and it comes with the
backpack so that's pretty awesome and
also as you can see here down at the
bottom we've got some logos that'll let
you know where to put things as you can
see right here this is for the tripod so
you can actually put your tripod up
front here and strap it to the front of
the entire backpack so all your video
gear can be inside of here as well as
your tripod leaving your hands-free and
it's pretty nice but it's just a bit
much for me since this thing is so
packed
so this is what we've got in the front
and of course the sides do have a ton of
pockets but I'm not going to go through
them on the sides I'm going to actually
just pop this thing open and we have
access to them from the very top of the
bag so let's see what we've got here and
bam
so this is the camera backpack and of
course first things first
we've got my baby the fs7 the sony fs7
this thing is a monster it is a beast of
a camera it records 4k internally it can
do 1080p full HD up to a hundred and
eighty frames per second so if you want
some slow-mo shots this thing has got
you covered it can even do 4k and 60
frames per second of course YouTube
can't support that right now so you guys
don't have to worry about that yet but
this thing is just an awesome overall
beast of a camera I love this thing and
it is what gets me the awesome quality
that you guys are seeing in my latest
videos so super glad I invested in this
thing super comfortable amazing quality
where has this been all my life so right
here we have my shotgun mic this is the
88 97 this is where I get all of my
audio very nice clean mic pretty
inexpensive too so you guys can check
that out I have links down below for
everything that's mentioned in this
video if you're interested down into the
description so definite out and since
I'm at CES I got me one of those little
hand mics if I'm going to be doing any
of those interview style videos I'm not
sure if that's going to happen but I
wanted to be prepared so I've got this
short mic here and moving on I've got a
dead cat which is a pretty terrible name
for something like this but it's a dead
cat this is what will help my shotgun
mic if I'm outside so if there's wind
I've got some protection from the wind
right here and let's see now we can go
into some of these compartments where
these four right here are what you would
see on the side so let's get to opening
them right here in the back starting
with this side we've got some of the
stuff here that I use to monitor my
camera so right here we have the
electronic viewfinder
they're in combination with this you can
actually see everything that's on your
screen with a bit of a magnifying glass
you can kind of pop this open and then
you get a really close look at what
you're dealing with on the screen so
this is when you're you've got it on
your shoulder you can actually use this
to get a look at what your books on your
screen and your menus and all that good
stuff but my favorite display right now
is this guy this is the Adamo Shogun now
with this you can actually record 4k
ProRes onto an SSD in the back now I
actually went for a one terabyte version
so with this I can record about two
hours of 4k without an issue definitely
some great stuff this is an amazing
display it's a seven inch 1080p display
you can see everything like everything
on here when you're recording now I'm in
love with this guy this thing is just I
don't know where it's been on my life
but I'm glad that I have it now and this
is what I actually used to get all my
footage on my fs7 so that's all of my
display stuff over there now on the
other side here we've got a couple of
add-ons for the fs7 right here is a bit
of a hand grip so that you can attach it
to the fs7 and throw it on your shoulder
and you're able to use this and access a
lot of the menus and just use this
instead of having to jump onto the
camera itself and access anything we've
got all your controls right here and it
actually helps a lot to stabilize the
camera when you want to do some running
gun kind of stuff so it's very nice in
the hand very ergonomic love this thing
and let's see we've got a remote for the
fs7 as well you can do everything a
remote can and let's see we've got a
adjustable arm now this is what I would
use for my vlogs but I actually have
some use for it with the fs7 by throwing
the Shogun on top by using as an
external monitor and being able to
position it however I want to with this
arm so definitely some versatility with
this guy and let's see what else we've
got of course cables to attach the
Shogun on to the fs7 as well as a
to adapter to get it on there as well if
I want to go that route and some more
adapters so we've got that and of course
we've got to touch on audio now there
are tons and tons of audio stuff here
tons of cables I've got a lav mic from
Audio Technica uh let's see I've also
got a couple of XLR cables tons of those
too many of those actually I don't know
why I carry this much over-prepared if
there can be such a thing and a zoom h1
that I will be using in combination with
the lab mic if I need to this guy is
very handy for audio if you're a
beginner with audio this thing is
perfect and I still find uses for it
even today so definitely good stuff well
worth the hundred dollar investment and
for the super clean audio that I usually
pick up I use the tascam dr-60d this
thing has been a beast I get tons of
great great controls as well as great
audio from it so I'm very happy with
this and it's been a champ for me ever
since I picked it up and that is it for
audio now of course
to power everything here I've got a
couple of batteries and power cables ah
this is like the not fun part of
everything the batteries but it's so
crucial to have everything powered up or
it's all dead and you can't use it and
that's pretty much it for as far as
camera equipment but of course you can't
forget all the stuff that you edit all
your footage on so I've got some
computers here with me some laptops that
being my MacBook Air since I use Final
Cut Pro as my main editing software I
have to tag this along so that I can
edit on the go it's not the best
experience since it's a MacBook Air it's
not that powerful but it gets the job
done and I can't help but take this
everywhere I go this is the surface pro
3 I like I said can't help but take it
everywhere I love this thing and it's a
competitor of the air but it works for
me and that's it guys this is ever
thing that I've brought to CES tons and
tons of equipment but this is what I'm
going to be using to produce videos that
you guys see about the convention and
speaking of the convention guys let me
know if there's anything in particular
that you'd like to see me cover on my
channel so if you've seen anything from
the press events or maybe on Twitter
that you want your average consumers
opinion about let me know in the
comments down below and I'll definitely
try to get my hands on some footage and
that's about it guys hopefully you enjoy
