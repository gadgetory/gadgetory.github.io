consumer and today apple just announced
its plans for the new iphone so let's
not wasting any time skit right into it
Bob Bob Bob so today I apple's event
there were no real surprises in the tech
world but they did announce new iphone
5c and the new iphone 5s the iphone 5c
is a lower budget iphone and it's
replacing the iphone 5 you'll no longer
be able to purchase the iphone 5s they
discontinued that pretty much the iphone
5c is coming and taking its place and
it's pretty much a lower budget iphone
that you can get for ninety-nine dollars
for the 16 gigabyte version and 199 for
the 32 gigabyte version of course on a
two-year contract now the iphone 5c is
going to come in a polycarbonate design
it's a hard shell case pretty much and
it comes in a variety of different
colors from really bright colors like
yellow pink to like the white and black
stuff like that so you'll get in a ton
of different colors and it's a pretty
basic iPhone it has the same kind of
specs as the iphone 5 it has a FaceTime
HD camera a 8 megapixel iSight camera it
has a 4-inch retina display in a6
processor pretty much all the same
things you find in the iphone 5 but now
in this new form factor with a variety
of colors and what's interesting with
iphone 5s is that it's going to have a
matching wallpaper with the color that
you get so if you get a yellow one
you'll probably have like a yellow
background when you open the phone and
turn it on so little cool stuff there
but nothing too surprising of course
we've all heard about the iphone 5c for
quite some time now apple also announced
that it's going to have a case for the
iphone 5c for twenty nine dollars and
it's pretty interesting this cases has a
bunch of holes at the bottom and cut out
for the camera and they have a variety
of colors as well so you can kind of mix
and match it's not the prettiest case in
the world i'm not really a fan of it at
all especially since the colors can
really clash but you want to stand out
or something then it might work for you
so Apple does have that offering and
Apple has introduced the iphone 5s and
it's pretty much the same stuff that you
would expect from any s model it's just
the same design but it has ink
specs so the iPhone 5s is going to be
featuring a a 7 64 bit processor and
pretty much what that means is that it's
going to have the same processing power
as a desktop computer so apple claims
and it's also going to be a lot faster a
lot snappier now to the average consumer
what that really means is that you're
going to be able to do everything that
you used to do pretty fast but it's also
going to be able to handle grum process
intensive apps so like games like
Infinity Blade where there's just a lot
of stuff going on a lot of detail even
it's going to be able to handle that no
problem so all those really heavy apps
that require a lot of power that's where
you probably see the best performance
from it Apple's also stating that the
iphone 5s has improved battery life now
we've always heard that the iphones have
better battery life but we all know how
app about iphone batteries go so we'll
see how this one fares and they've also
of course included a better camera at
this time and now they have bigger
pixels in the camera and what that means
is you're going to be able to take in
more light get better shots and this
kind of reminds me of the HTC one
ultrapixel idea so that's what they're
doing here so you're going to get better
pictures better quality and from our
photographers out there it's going to
have a 2.2 aperture it's also going to
feature a dual flash for lighter tones
and another one for a cooler tones so
it's supposed to work really well in
certain situations it's going to be able
to make out the best kind of flash for
you and it works really well with skin
tones as apple claims so we'll see how
that goes in performance tests as well
but some of the shots that they showed
off did look pretty good but who knows
how actual performance is going to be
and the camera is also able to record in
slow motion for those of you who want to
take those action shots and stuff like
that so that's going to be pretty cool
for those of you who are interested one
thing that I really did like that I
noticed is that the camera app is also
going to have a couple more features in
it it isn't like a ton of features but
the camera app has only been pretty
barren to me it didn't have any real
features added on to it but it's just
supposed to work but I do like the fact
that now they're including some
customization in there so I'm looking
forward to that and one of the big
features apple included on this iphone
5s is the new touch ID which is a
fingerprint scanner and it's going to be
pretty interesting because you can use
this now to unlock your
phone pay for app purchases and itunes
purchases things like that and they
don't think this stuff to the cloud or
anything like that so you're not going
to have your fingerprint matching your
you know information anywhere stored on
any servers so that's pretty cool and
it's going to be pretty useful I guess
for you know quick unlocks people who
don't want to type in their password can
now do this so that's one thing that
Apple did include and it's gonna be
pretty interesting to see how people
adapt to it and was pretty cool is that
it can read your fingerprint in any
angle so no matter how you pick up the
phone you can you don't have to worry
about it being precisely like this
vertical or anything like that so that's
really cool an apple also announced that
the iphone 5s will have a new color the
gold color and so now it's got the white
the black and the gold and we've seen a
lot of pictures of the gold out on the
internet and it's cool to see that it
actually came to life and of course the
iPhone 5s is priced at 16 gigabyte for
199 32 gigabyte for 299 and 64 gigabyte
is 399 of course with a two-year
contract and even though Apple is
discontinuing the iphone 5 it's still
going to have the iphone 4s available so
you can get that for free on contract
other things from know apple announced
that the new iOS devices will be having
the iwork apps for free so that includes
apps like numbers pages and iMovie
things like that those will all be free
I'm not sure about old devices of how
they'll work with those if they'll get
it for free but the new devices is what
they were claiming will have to need the
iwork apps for free and for those of you
who are interested in iOS 7 it's finally
going to be available September 18 and
iOS 7 is also coming to other devices
from the iphone 4 4 s 5 5 s and up and
the app ipod 5th generation ipad 2 and
up ipad mini and pretty much anything
that comes out after that so all of
those will be able to get it on sep
tember 18th as well and for those who
want to know about the iphone 5s and 5c
those are going to be available
September 13 for pre-order and you'll
finally be able to pick it up on sep
tember 20th so you can get your hands on
it September 20s but get your pre-orders
in on the 13 and another note Apple did
announce the iTunes radio which is very
similar to pandora
so you'll have that available to you as
well that pretty much wraps up this
recap guys what do you guys think of the
new iPhones are you interested in
picking up a 5c I'm not really sure what
the public opinion on the 5c is so I'm
very interested in knowing what you guys
think and do you think the 5s is really
worth the upgrade if you have a 5 let me
know what you guys think I personally
don't think it's that big a deal to
upgrade to the 5s only if you really
want that fingerprint scanner and I
don't really think that's a big deal but
let me know what you guys think I'm
definitely going to have this stuff on
the channel as soon as I can and yeah
I'll catch you guys in the next video so
then it's your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
