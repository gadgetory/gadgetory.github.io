check out their new 2017 Ford Escape and
use it in a drivable version of escape
the room if you've never heard of escape
the room you basically get trapped in a
room and need to use teamwork to find
clues and solve some puzzles to get out
luckily I have my boy John retina from
TechnoBuffalo with me and so we formed
team your average Buffalo it was only
right side note if you guys have never
done and escaped the room google it
take some friends check it out but for
this version we had to use the features
of the new Ford Escape to help us solve
the puzzles and it kind of felt like a
test drive where you actually had to use
the features I was lucky enough to be
the one behind the wheel and saw
firsthand how impressive some of these
features were at one point we had to
make a perpendicular park but with the
enhanced active Park Assist all I had to
do was swap between Drive and reverse a
few times and hit the brake here and
there and boom the thing pretty much
parked itself and let me tell you guys
I've heard about features like this
online and even seen some videos but
it's still pretty mind-blowing when
you're actually behind the wheel
another insanely helpful feature that I
think will be great in real world use is
the implementation of 360-degree cameras
with these you'll be notified if you're
getting too close to an object and you
can adjust accordingly they has go
through a really tight turn that I'm
sure would have ended up in me running
into something if I wasn't getting the
alerts on the dashboard if you've ever
run into those little yellow posts at a
gas station I'm sure you wish your car
did this they also have this really cool
app called the Ford pass that allows you
to control and see a ton of info on your
car without even having to be in it you
can see how much gas we've got left use
it to track down your car and a huge
parking lot which is really helpful if
it ever gets stolen you can also unlock
your doors or start your engine and even
put your car on a schedule if you tend
to leave the house at the same time
every day which could be super useful
especially during winter but most
importantly John and I went to this
representing us techies and we did not
fail you we crushed the competition and
came in first but it was super cool to
do an escape room like this
and check out the new 2017 Ford Escape
it looks like an awesome car with a ton
of features that I haven't even
mentioned that we can actually use in
the real world and not just forget about
after you start driving it if you want
to learn more about the new Ford Escape
I'll of course have links down below in
the description and huge shout out to
forward for sponsoring today's video and
having us come check out the new Ford
Escape and do this cool escape the room
and if you guys want to go and check out
some behind the scenes more vlog style
stuff of what we actually did over there
go ahead on over to John's channel and
I'll have links to that video down below
as well but hopefully you guys enjoyed
it so the next one is your average
consumer base</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
