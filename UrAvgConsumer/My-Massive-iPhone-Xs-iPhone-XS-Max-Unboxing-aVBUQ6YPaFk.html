consumer and today we've got a massive
iPhone 10 and 10 s max unboxing with a
bunch of accessories and we can't forget
the Apple watch series for this thing
could all fall apart
but alright let's get into this but
Before we jump into this crazy unboxing
I gotta let you guys know of course
since it is since it is launch day we
gotta give some stuff away and you guys
know with every iPhone launch that we
gotta give away an iPhone
this time we're giving away an iPhone
10s and 10's Macs and all you got to do
it enter into this giveaway this of
course make sure you subscribe to the
channel and you got to hit that little
Bell notification so you don't miss a
video and of course leave a comment down
below as your official entry letting me
know if you want a 10s or 10s max and
which color and if you have social media
definitely leave your handle so I can
have an easier time getting in touch
with you guys but alright so this is a
pretty standard unboxing we've got our
little tab right here to peel off the
plastic and I know you guys love the
sound when peeling off the plastic so
let's do this satisfying now there isn't
much difference with the 10s prepared
through the iPhone 10 and the only thing
you'll find different in terms of the
specs is that you will get a processor
upgrade as well as a different camera
and maybe a very slightly different body
and this gold baby
gold is really clean look at that that
is noise
let's see look we've got ear pods we've
also got the wall adapter and we also
have a lightning cable now one thing
that you will see that is missing here
is the headphone dongle that is usually
in the back of the ear pods so now there
is no headphone dongle Apple as the
saying
forget the 3.5 millimeter jack we don't
care about y'all no boy right and that
to me is really disappointing because
I'm a big headphone guy so apples not
even trying to support with the new
iPhones this is crazy because these
phones can get really expensive but it
is what it is you can buy the dongle
separately for like 10 bucks or nine
bucks but man oh my life sucks oh that
was way more satisfying oh yeah this one
is going to be Aries and man am I gonna
lie goals looking all right this year
but okay this is the 10s we're gonna put
this right over here now it's time for
the tennis max now for the 10s max it's
pretty much identical to the 10s in
terms of specs
the only difference you'll see here is
of course the size and of course the
battery so for some size comparisons
tennis versus the 8 dial tennis is of
course a little bit bigger but you got
that much much larger display and
actually the display of the 10s is
bigger than the display of the 8 plus
now because the iPhone 10s it has
already has a bigger display that's why
they have to go and call the iPhone 10s
max max because it is bigger than the
10s and you couldn't just call it the
10s plus because bigger than the bus
you're right okay if the tennis max just
a slightly shorter
listen app it is very very slightly
shorter than the 8 plus so overall body
wise you're dealing with the same thing
here but you got a much much bigger
display and that's the thing I feel like
it's gonna take some getting used to
when we're dealing with the 8 plus you
don't really have to worry about getting
to the very top of the screen but you
got to do that with the 10s max so
that's something we're gonna be testing
out in the real day in the light we're
gonna put it through its paces
is an actual real-world usage but we got
some cases we got a lot of cases
actually so let's take a look at those
now I said it before and I'll say it
again
I am a big fan of apples first party
cases the silicone cases are really nice
because they just fit the body well and
they have that nice grip while the
leather cases just feel a bit more
premium but they do cost quite a bit
more and we got a couple of color
options already for the 10s which one
you're thinking all the way to the left
this guy what is this okay which color
is this again this is the this is the
stone color alright so we threw our
cases on this is mine
I think this leather case really
complements the gold it's like a perfect
perfect match but Aaron's got the stone
color which thing that was really fast
you like it okay so area is over the
stone color already that didn't last
long at all but this is are the cases
look I'm a fan of the silicone cases cuz
they're so grippy and the leather case
ah just looks so good with this but you
also got something else right Wow Wow
so I actually picked up the beats X I
personally am a really big fan of these
and you know I convinced her I didn't do
much convincing you just you sought you
wanted to copy me yeah and so she got
the beats X but this is like the stone
color or at least oh yeah no this
actually goes better with this blue you
know you're good good you're good okay
all right here we got him these are the
beats X now these aren't a pair of
wireless earbuds they've got a little
neck band design so it makes it really
easy to keep them in place
they've got apples w1 chip which is
really nice because once you pair it to
your device
it syncs with your iCloud account and if
you have a MacBook Pro or maybe in iPad
you're gonna be able to switch between
those different devices with
having to repair it every single time
this is why I love to w1 chip and I wish
it was any more products but apples
being smart they keep it in their beats
line and of course their air pots and in
the Box you get other things like
different ear tips you get these wing
tips for if you're working out and you
want to secure fit and you also get a
case as well as a short lightning cable
so you can charge up your earbuds
wherever you are and that's pretty much
all you get and some paperwork on the
inside but you know when you're talking
about that so those were the iPhones but
they're not the only new product we've
also got the Apple watch series for wow
that was subpar
what are these new candles oh okay
that's interesting now that's an
unboxing experience I'm like that okay
these are all kinds of bands and colors
oh and it even has abandoned boys oh
this is this is different y'all so now
they have the Apple watch right here and
I guess your paperwork over here and
under that you can find your Apple watch
charger as well as your wall adapter and
this is nice because the Apple watch
actually comes in this little sleeve so
Apple is now including a little sleeve
to kind of cover up the Apple watch I
like that a lot so if you're not using
it or something you can just kind of
tuck it right back into there that is a
really nice addition here we have it
this is the Apple watch series for still
a band on this guy so right here we've
got a few bands we've got two sport
bands and black and blue and we've also
got this guy which is a sport loop in
indigo I'm actually very curious to see
this one I think we've seen the sport
bands enough they a pretty standard but
let's check out the sport loop now in
terms of what's new with the Apple watch
series for there are a couple of new
things to look at the first being of
course a larger display you pretty much
keep the same body size but the display
gets closer and closer to us
so you have more screen real estate and
you have different watch spaces that can
take advantage of that you've also got
50% louder speaker so if you're making a
phone call you'll be able to hear the
person you're speaking to a bit more or
if you want to activate Siri you can
speak to her and actually hear her quite
a bit louder
and one thing that's interesting about
this series 4 is that instead of picking
it up and saying hey Siri all you have
to do is raise it and then say your
question or command and Sur will
automatically listen there are also some
cool health features introduced with the
series for fall detection being one of
them that watch is actually calibrated
to know when you're falling based on the
trajectory of your arms or the impact
level hitting the floor so it pays
attention to all of that and detects
when you have a fall and you can go
ahead and contact emergency services or
even a loved one but with some of these
health things in mind it definitely
makes me want to get something my
parents one thing that they did change
though with this one guys is the little
crown on the side it no longer has that
big red button like on the series 3 now
it's just a little ring on the inside of
the crown so they have that little
change if you really like that little
red button you got a little red circle
now now I did also get another accessory
for the Apple watch this is the Apple
watch magnetic dock and this isn't a
brand new product or anything but it's
something that I've never picked up
before and I think it's actually pretty
nice to have on the nightstand but let
me show you guys pass me a sword give me
a sword from one of my Gundam Gundam
alright oh hello big there goes his arm
and it's all good but there you go so
let's get the job done baby and here we
have it right here this is the magnetic
dock it's very nice and compact I like
that and one thing that you can do with
this is you can have it lay down flat
but you can also just prop it up so if
you have a band like this sport loop
that you can't just open up you can just
lay it down like this and boom you can
charge up your Apple watch so this isn't
really cool now there's got to be a
cable involved here and there is also it
just uses a regular lightning cable you
just plug that sucker in charge up and
you are good to go
I actually really like
design here this is a perfect match for
a nightstand or something but this is
like 80 bucks yeah I know a lot of
cheaper options so if you don't want to
go the Apple first party route I'll have
some links down below in the description
for other charging docks that you might
want to take advantage of but that about
wraps it for this video guys hopefully
you enjoyed it we got a ton of little
products here and accessories but of
course you guys know we're going to have
our real day into life with the iPhone
so definitely stay tuned for that
make sure you enter the giveaway get
your own chance at winning one of these
and we'll catch you guys in the next one
till then it's your average consumer
