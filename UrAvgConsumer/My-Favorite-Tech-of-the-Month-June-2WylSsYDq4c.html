consumer and today we're going to be
checking out my favorite tech of the
month for the month of June yes yes I
know I'm a little bit late but I was
busy but either way here we are and if
you're not familiar with my favorite
tech of the month videos this is where I
go over tech whether it's brand new and
I'm really liking it or tech that I find
myself using quite a bit that maybe
doesn't make it into a video I'm here to
talk about it today
so the first thing we're going to be
actually talking about today is
something my great-great wife got me the
Sonos play 5 this is a mind-blowing
speaker guys I am in love with so notes
by the way I have a Sonos home theater
system hooked up all over here in the
gamers paradise but the play 5 is
something that blew my expectations away
now I know you guys are used to seeing
the smaller portable Bluetooth speakers
on the channel but this is something
that's in a league of its own this is a
Wi-Fi speaker but this is like so
Knossos latest and greatest and it is
amazing this doesn't even belong here in
the studio I brought it over because I
had to let you guys know how much I
liked it this is what I use at home
personally it just sounds really great
in the bedroom the sound quality and
performance that you get from this is
something that you'd expect from a much
much bigger speaker you guys aren't
going to be able to hear the full range
of how great the sound is but just check
this out this by itself is able to fill
a room with excellent sound quality and
you can pump the volume up to ridiculous
levels and that was out on clarity even
at lower levels you're still getting
some really powerful bass it's not muddy
whatsoever so vocals will sound clear
instrument sound clear and the bass is
still very very powerful and with the
Sonos app you could go in and control
how much of the bass that you actually
want to be present this is definitely
the best speaker that I've ever come
across
and that's saying a lot guys this is
really amazing and actually right under
the Sonos on this little headphone
hanger here add the filling here on
wireless headphones don't mind those
crazy cables I'm working on a whole
little
thing over there either way these are
the song here on wireless headphones
I've talked about this a bit in the past
I really really do like these I've been
using them a lot more lately they've
been a bit overshadowed by the xB 950
and ones that I recently got or got a
little bit ago but I forget how good
they are I've been using them for the
last couple of weeks and I got to say
guys this is something if you haven't
heard of these or if you haven't given
them a listen you definitely should
these are awesome they have great sound
quality great bass they actually noise
cancelling and they're bluetooth so
you've got all the features that you
could possibly look for in a pair of
headphones right on these guys now
what's great about these as well is the
fact that they're now discounted pretty
heavily on Amazon I think these used to
retail for about 300 bucks but you can
find them close to the $200 range so in
the low 200s so at that price these are
absolutely a steal and of course they
come in a variety of colors obviously I
went with one that suits my taste but
what I'm usually talking about Sony
headphones people like to bring up these
the XP 950 and ones or the MDR 1000x now
there's a bit of a difference between
all three of them one is super heavy on
the bass side of things which I
personally really like this one is just
like kind of in the middle ground and
the MVR 1000x
is kind of like a souped up version of
this but you're going to pay a premium
for it
this has some more features and all that
but that's like closer to the $400 range
but that's why I'm shouting these out
you can get these for around 200 bucks
great sound quality good looks you
honestly just can't beat this Sony does
an awesome job with headphones in so I
love them but next we've got a pretty
late entry into the game Center came in
at the end of the month but this is the
Amazon echo show now you guys know that
the Amazon echo is pretty much what
powers this entire room this entire
studio and office I always felt like
what the echo is missing was an actual
screen to be able to read off some of
the search results or maybe see some of
the things that you're asking because
before you have to go into the app on
your phone after asking it a question if
you did answer it it was just a weird
little system but now with the addition
of a screen you can use it for multiple
reasons like
show me what the weather is like for the
week here's the wonderful news the next
game so with this I can just go ahead
and see exactly what's going to be
happening for the next seven days
whereas before it would take a bunch of
time just speaking out the weather for
the rest of the week but you can use it
to also do things like show me all of
Drake's albums showing albums in your
library
on day three so here we can see all of
Jake's albums so you know it's cool
little things like that I feel like a
really really nice but one of my
favorite additions to this is the
ability to work with things like the
nest camera so I can ask you things like
show me the office and with that getting
the other camera and with that I can
jump right into the room with my office
and kind of see what's going on over
there in real time so this is a really
really nice feature and there are tons
of other cool things that you can do you
can video chat with others you can do
this weird little future called drop-in
where you just see what's going on on
someone's camera but if you guys want to
see a full review learn some more of my
thoughts on it let me know as a comment
down below if you really want to see it
hit that thumbs up button
so the echo show is definitely taking
steps in the right direction in terms of
upgrades for the Amazon echo and that's
why it makes the list and next we've got
the tiled me now when I first heard of
tile and the whole concept behind it I
thought it was pretty wack and I was
going to lie to you I didn't think it
was really going to be that useful
I don't know something about the idea I
felt like I heard it so much that I just
kind of didn't believe how awesome it
was until I actually used it for myself
so this is a tile mate which you can do
a ton of different things with this but
the idea behind it is to be able to help
you find things that you might lose like
your keys or your wallet and those are
happen to be the exact reasons why I use
these I actually have a tile slim inside
of my wallet and this thing has been
awesome now I'm not going to lie to you
guys I happen to misplace my wallet and
my keys quite a bit it's happening a lot
Oh age you think they invent a keyholder
or something but either way I happen to
do that quite a bit and usually I spend
a few minutes looking for it means that
I don't usually have to waste on things
like that but now whenever that happens
my first thought is to grab my phone and
make it ring and with these little guys
you can actually make them ring by using
the app on your phone and in the app you
can see a list of all the things that
you have tile equipped - so I have my
keys my wallet no matter which is in my
backpack and of course this is the
iPhone so you can actually just use this
let's say I want to make my wallet ring
all I got to do is tap the find button I
don't know if you guys can hear that
jingle but this helps me out quite a bit
usually when you buy them you can get
them in multiples so you can get to tile
slims or maybe even for tile mates at
once so you can put them on everybody's
keys everybody's wallet whatever you
want to do with it and if you happen to
be a forgetful person like myself can
find these are definitely worth the
money didn't believe in that purse but
they're really really useful but that
about wraps up this video guys hopefully
you enjoyed it if you did be the cool
guy girl that gives this video a thumbs
up let me know if you guys want to see
the Amazon show video if there's enough
of you guys who are interested I'll
definitely get to that but I'll catch
you guys in the next one links to
everything will be down below in
