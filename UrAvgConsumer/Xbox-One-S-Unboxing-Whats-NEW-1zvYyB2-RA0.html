and today we're going to be unboxing
this guy the brand new Xbox one s now if
you want to win one of these you might
want to stick around till the end of
this video now this is brand-new and
this is got a couple of changes from the
regular Xbox one but let's get into the
box and see what you get so first off as
you can see on the box you've got the
picture of the one s the controller and
in the back you've got some typical Xbox
characters you've got the guys from halo
Gears of War 4 saloon and I'm not sure
what this is
give me - Maury Durr I think it's Tomb
Raider and on the sides pretty much
bunch of pictures of the console but
let's get to actually opening this guy
alright so it looks like we've got some
tape now I do have my unboxing knife
over here so let's pop this thing open
mmm easy enough we've got a little
pamphlet and this is pretty much a
QuickStart guide so you can look inside
here and see how to use all the
different things that come inside of the
box and hook it up else here no what's
this okay
so with the new Xbox 1s you can actually
use a stand the first Xbox was just way
too big to use a TV stand so now you
stand it up vertically instead of having
to leave it flat which is going to save
a lot of room when you're putting it
near your TV or wherever you want to
place it so this is going to be pretty
cool I want to get to the system already
okay and here it is but there's more so
that's what we got here before we get to
the main guy I'm sure this is where
we've got the cables and the controller
so first things first we've got the HDMI
cable we've got the new controller which
should be really interesting because
they did switch it up a bit
okay this is pretty dope it's got some
ridges now in the back so it doesn't
slide out your hands when you're playing
I've never really had that issue with my
Xbox one controllers feels nice
nonetheless black and white because this
is a white system this is the color that
they've got now this I'm excited about
because this is the power cable no giant
brick attached the brick is now internal
so you don't have this big heavy thing
sitting next to your console on your
floor very good move Xbox you should've
did this first let's get here cleaned up
and then we're gonna look at this guy
alright so here it is guys now I can
already see this thing is so much
smaller than the original now for those
of you who didn't know that Xbox 1s is
40% smaller so they almost got it down
by half so that is going to be a welcome
change for anyone who might be upgrading
or maybe who wants to get an Xbox one
for the first time you don't have to
worry about that space boom oh man
that's pretty nice this is really really
nice I like this uh the Xbox one is
pretty large and unwieldy but this guy
oh this is what's up
now let's talk about some of the changes
we're gonna find on this guy besides the
size so first things first you're going
to notice that it's white these are what
they all come in right now all the Xbox
bonuses come in white I'm sure there'll
be different colors
bundles come out and there's going to be
different versions whatever but for now
it's all white this is the two terabyte
model there's going to be a one terabyte
as well as like 500 gig version coming
out shortly but as a August second two
terabytes is what you're going to get if
you want to pick it up this early so
some of the changes that you'll see
besides the size difference is the new
design instead of a giant vent with a
lines going through it now you've got
these tiny circles and a giant circle
here so you can let out some of the air
for when the sky is on so it can release
some of that hot air and you've also got
a USB port in the front instead of the
side which makes things a lot easier
when you want to plug in like your
controller and you've also got the
addition of an IR blaster and for those
of you who don't know what an IR blaster
is you can use your television remote to
kind of control this a little bit so you
can change channels and do whatever you
need to now they add an IR blaster but
in the back you'll notice that they
removed a port of the connect areas
medicine
so they took out the connect port which
if you know me and Ari we are in love
with the connect it's how we use our
television you say Xbox on yada-yada can
do that right now but later on I think
in September they're going to be coming
out with an additional adapter so that
you can connect a cut up so that you can
connect the connect that's what I was
going to say it threw me off so you're
going to be able to connect a connect if
you want to which we definitely will now
let's take a look at the back you've got
a port for your power plug you've got
your HDMI out HDMI in two USB ports IR
out optical port for your optical cables
and you also got an Ethernet port and
two kinetic ends engine lock so if you
want to make sure this guy's secure you
can do that so now we're pretty familiar
with the Xbox one s and what it looks
like and what's in
but let's take a look at something
that's new and that is the addition of
the TV stand let's see how we can get
this guy attached so you've got some
little holes here at the bottom so you
can get this slide it in my lap okay so
you slide it in hear the click boom the
Xbox want to stand it up not a problem
now you might be wondering what are some
of the features what makes it special
well besides it being so much smaller
having a slightly different design
remote
it also supports 4k and HDR so about 4k
this doesn't actually do 4k gaming but
you can watch 4k Netflix and other apps
that can utilize it and it also has a 4k
blu-ray player so if you have one of
those 4k blu-rays you can pop this in
but of course you're going to need a 4k
TV now as for HDR
what that means is basically you're
going to get some nicer colors out of
your games movies all that stuff higher
dynamic range so if you've got one of
those new 4k TVs like one of samsung's
new s UHD TVs or maybe LG's OLED TVs
there are some the TVs out there that
can utilize it but this guy can output
better picture higher quality it's going
to be pretty good but I'm excited to go
and test this guy out
so that pretty much wraps it up for this
unboxing hopefully you got a good idea
