consumer and today I've gotten them
boxing for you guys of the brand new
Samsung Galaxy s5 now this is Samsung's
latest flagship device and in this video
we're gonna go over what you get inside
the box and also how different it is
from the galaxy s4 so let's not waste
any time let's get right into it and
alright guys here we have the Samsung
Galaxy s5 this is Samsung's latest
device it's a pretty standard box is the
same kind of box that Samsung has been
going with for the last couple of years
in the back we do have some specs listed
so its 4G LTE capable it has a smart
remote so it has two IR blaster so you
can control your TV with it it has a
Fitness heartrate monitor so that's
pretty much a gimmick but we'll get into
that later it's running the latest
version of Android that's which is 4.4.2
I believe it's got a 5.1 F HD Super
AMOLED display a 2.5 gigahertz quad-core
processor I think it's a Snapdragon 801
chip I believe it's got a 16 megapixel
rear facing camera and a 2 megapixel
front facing camera and of course it
records in HD in Full 1080p and I
believe also 4k so now let's actually
get inside the box so we'll pop this
thing out and we can throw this right
over here and here we have it now the
guys at t-mobile love getting inside
people's boxes and you know setting up
the device for them so they already
busted my tape open so no one boxing
knife for this one but let's get inside
luckily I told them don't setup anything
because I want it to be as is for this
video now I did get the black version
this is also 16 gigabyte and we're gonna
just put the phone to the side tons of
stickers and whatnot all over this thing
but we'll get back to it
and inside you have your SIM card so you
can pop your sim in and let's get past
that and let's see what else we've got
inside the box now this is typical
Samsung packaging really the same things
you'd expect from like any of their
Galaxy products so of course you get
your start guide and along with it you
have just
our guide accessory guide and as well as
some warranty and safety information so
we'll put the booklets to the side also
you get in the t-mobile version you get
a limited warranty booklet as well as
some merchandise return label just in
case you want to recycle some of your
older handsets so now with all the
paperwork out of the way here we have
the USB cable now what's interesting
about this cable is that it isn't your
standard micro USB this is a USB 3.0
cable so you can discharge this with USB
3.0 so you're gonna get much faster
charge times this shouldn't make it
really quick and you can usually tell
it's a USB 3.0 cable when it has the
blue on the USB part as well as the
longer portion that goes into the actual
phone so it's got a little extended part
and this is a very very thick cable guys
very thick and it's really um got some
good length
to it so you're gonna be able to
probably charge this on your in a wall
adapter and still be able to put it like
on a desk or a nightstand so it's good
when cables have good length and this is
pretty thick so it should have some
longevity as well hopefully now you also
get your standard wall charger so this
is the same kind of wall charger that
you could come to expect from Galaxy
products so this is to help the charge
up real quickly and let's see you also
get these earbuds so these are Samsung
earbuds now when you open these up and
you actually take a look at it they're
pretty decent in ear buds but what I
really like about the buds is that it
has a remote so it has a play and pause
button as well as volume controls volume
controls our rarity amongst Android
devices and it's really cool that
Samsung you know comes out with their
own ear buds and that actually support
that feature so volume controls are here
as well as the play and pause so you can
answer calls playing pause your music
and control over volume great great
stuff really love that Samsung does that
and then also included are some ear tips
so you have different sizes for those
ear buds so if you have small ears you
can use the small if you have large as
large and I believe the medium probably
come on it already and you also get a
pretty large battery here and this is a
2800 milliamp battery so that should
give some pretty decent battery life I'm
really looking forward to that The Stand
this is becoming the standard I'm really
happy seeing that companies are coming
out with batteries above 2500 milliamps
so the really good stuff so I'm gonna
put this over to the side and I think
that is about it for everything else
that comes in the box and real quick
just to go over what we got inside the
box again we have the battery the in
earbuds some extra ear tips just in case
you need them and as well as the wall
adapter and the USB cable along with a
bunch of booklets and manuals and stuff
so we can put all this stuff away now
and get here cleaned up in alright guys
so here we have it this is the galaxy s5
this is the black version and like I
said this has tons and tons of plastic
all over it but what it does say up
front is that it is the galaxy s5 and
it's got a Super AMOLED Full HD display
so it's 1080p and you've got the Android
technology Bluetooth and NFC so all that
good stuff is packed into this and in
the back we've got some instructions on
how to actually place the cover onto the
back now I'll kind of want to get into
this phone and see what it looks like
already so let me pull this thing over
pull it over here and get rid of this
now this just feels like an excessive
amount of plastic so get rid of that and
we've got some plastic around the sides
as well so we're gonna get rid of those
and let's see a couple of things here
and boom that's about it now this is
really light without the battery guys
very very light so I'm going to put in
the battery now and I'm gonna give you
guys a quick close-up of what's actually
going on inside of the back so on the
right side you'll see that there's a
little piece that you can actually use
your thumbnail to kind of just pry open
and then you can get a look inside the
back and just taking a look at the back
of the case guys you can see that it has
this little seal going around it and
that's because this is actually
waterproof and dustproof
so you can actually submerge the Galaxy
s5
for under I guess a bottom meter and
then you can do that for about 30
minutes but I think some people have
tested and seen that it can go longer
than that
but that's what they say that you can do
with this so that's pretty cool so if
this happens to fall in your toilet
you're not screwed okay so this is
pretty good so also in the back here you
have your micro SD card so you can
actually put in a up to a 128 gigs of
storage so even though it has 16 gigs
you can put up to 128 so depending on
how much you want to spend you can
upgrade them the storage on this quite a
bit and pretty much that's about it so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna install
this battery and then give you guys a
quick tour of the entire device alright
guys so here we have it this is the
galaxy s5 so we'll start with the front
and see what's up front so up top like I
mentioned it has a 2 megapixel front
facing camera and it's got a couple of
sensors here as well and towards the
bottom you have your home button now
what's interesting about this home
button is that it's actually a
fingerprint scanner similar to the
iPhone 5 but it's a bit different in
that you can't use it the same way you
can't just place your finger on it you
have to swipe it so it's still different
but I'll go over that in the review and
let you guys know how that works and it
also has some capacitive buttons you
have your back button here as well as
your recent app button so that's the
front of it and on the left side you
will have your volume rocker which is
pretty standard and on your right side
you have your power button and on the
bottom of the phone you see something
pretty interesting it has a little flap
that that gives you access to where you
can charge it so with this flap this is
what helps it to remain waterproof and
dust resistant so you can actually use
this flap to protect it now people hate
flaps because it's inconvenient whenever
you want to throw this thing on the
charger you have to pull it open but I
mean it does add to the phone it does
add a little feature but it can be
inconvenient of inconvenience whenever
you want to get a quick charge and you
always have to pull it off and I'm sure
that this thing gets flimsy after a
while but like I said this uses a USB
3.0 cable so that is can charge up you
know pretty quickly it has a large
battery but if you don't happen to have
a USB 3.0 cable like the one that comes
with it you can still use a micro
usb-cable a pretty normal one and still
charge it it won't charge us quickly but
it'll still get the job done and at the
top of the phone you'll see that it has
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and this
little part right here is the IR blaster
so you will be able to control your TV
with this and it has a couple of
microphones all over the bottom the top
all kinds of stuff now the back of the
phone is where you have your speaker at
the bottom left hand corner now I'm not
a fan of this speaker at all especially
considering the HTC One has the two boom
sound speakers that sound amazing so I'm
not expecting much from the speaker at
all and also you have your fingerprint
scanner here like I said guys before
it's pretty much a gimmick there are
other ways to do this I believe I heard
that you can kind of check that stuff
out with a flashing camera now honestly
I've never ever cared about you know
checking my heart rate on my cell phone
so when Samsung said that they did their
research and they heard that customers
really want that I was pretty confused I
didn't know that was a criteria for
people to want to get their fitness on
with their phone but man anyway it has a
16 megapixel camera up there as well and
of course you know you have your flash
there so you've got all that good stuff
that you come to expect and was pretty
cool about this camera is that it also
records in 4k so that's gonna be pretty
cool it doesn't have optical image
stabilization so you might get some
shaky videos but overall it's cool that
it can do that regardless and now
talking about this back now the back
actually feels way way better than I
expected I thought it was gonna feel
like something pretty cheap but this
actually feels pretty good in the hand I
actually like it I do like the little
grip that I'm getting from this this is
a pretty nice feel to me but it is still
plastic at the end of the day and it's
still really light and pretty much
that's it guys this is the galaxy s5 it
has a similar look to the galaxy s4 and
the note 3 it's like a hybrid between
the two the overall shape of it it's
like the note 3 but it does have the
size of like the galaxy s4 so there's
like a bit of a hybrid there so now
let's turn this thing on and see what
we're greeted with now as you guys can
see it's a samsung galaxy
five powered by Android and of course
the typical Samsung logo t-mobile
version so it's got fourth G LTE so I'm
gonna set this guy up and then I'm gonna
give you guys a brief overview of what
you can get once you get it started
alright guys so right now it's going
through the setup process downloading a
bunch of my apps all that good stuff I'm
just gonna show you guys quickly what it
looks like when you you know go through
the first couple of things so when you
go to the left here you have the my
magazine this is kind of like samsung's
version of blinkfeed if you know what
that is this is where you can get all of
your updates you can get news articles
your social media can be attached to
here you can do all kinds of stuff so
you can get all your updates when you
just swipe over to the left so to the on
the regular screen you have the ok
Google that has the search bar there and
what's really cool is that even though
this is TouchWiz you can still just say
ok Google and have that pop up with HTC
One you can't do that usually can only
do that with Nexus devices so that's
really cool that they have that here and
this is the little clock widget that
they have they have the S health here so
a couple of different things and pretty
much this is it it's really smooth so
far the only time you seems to lag is
when it goes into this my magazine it
doesn't it's not the fastest transition
but when you're going through the other
pages you can see how quickly these move
but when it comes to that it takes its
time so going through the rest of the
apps pretty quick stuff pretty simple so
let's take a look at the notifications
as these have changed quite a bit so as
you can see the design has changed up a
little bit so when you go into your
settings it still has that same design
as you can see with the notifications
where you can turn on different little
features different toggles so you have
all of those so let's actually go into
the settings and you can see here it has
quick settings and all kinds of
different little things so you have a
lot of options here typically there's
that list format but there's this little
thumbnail version so it's kind of like
apps within your settings so different
cool stuff here I actually like this
view it's actually pretty easy to digest
what's actually in your settings because
they have like little pictures and icons
so this is pretty cool and pretty much
this is it
I'm going to have a bunch of videos I'm
going to be comparing this to other
phones tell me guys what phones you want
this to be compared to I do have the HTC
One m8 a heavy Nexus 5 the iPhone 5 six
on hand so I have a bunch of different
devices let me know what you want to see
this compared to what kind of videos
you'd like to see about this device and
anything else you want to see let me
know so that's about it for this
unboxing guys hopefully you enjoyed it
it was a quick overview of everything
you can expect and if you enjoyed it
definitely be the cool guy that hits the
like button and subscribe to the channel
for more content from me and definitely
more as s5 coverage till the next video
guys your average consumer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
