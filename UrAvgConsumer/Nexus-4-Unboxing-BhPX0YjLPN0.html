consumer and today I have another
unboxing for you guys of Google's Nexus
4 so let's not waste any time let's get
right into it alright guys so here we
have the nexus 4 i know i'm a little
late to the nexus 4 unboxing party but
it's better late than never but if we
take a look around the box you can see
it's pretty standard Nexus packaging you
know just little information in the back
and just a picture of the device with
Nexus on the sides so the good stuff is
inside so we'll pull this off put that
right there and of course we got the
straight black box with the two pieces
of black tape so I've got my little
unboxing knife here and I'm just going
to slide right through this and through
that one right here as well and there we
go now let's see if we can pull this off
so it's really easy to get the top off
and here we have the actual phone so
there we get have it very nice design
very good looking phone so I'm gonna put
this to the side will clip and see what
else we have in the box can pull this
tab open and I'm pretty sure we've got
some documentation in here or something
and maybe I'm wrong alright so there's
actually nothing in here so that's
interesting you can open up in
everything but there's really nothing
inside of here alright so we're just
going to leave this over here and this
is where we have the Quick Start Guide
safety warranty all that good stuff this
is where we have that information moving
along we have the AC adapter as well as
the micro USB cord and we also get a sim
ejector over here so pretty standard
stuff um if you guys want to see a quick
close up of the adapter here it is and
as you guys can see it just says LG over
here and it's pretty pretty straight
adapter nothing too special about it
us about it and now of course to move on
to the phone so this is a really nice
phone I'm going to peel off the little
stickers that it has on top of it the
protection and just get this piece off
and boom there we have it now this is a
beautiful phone guys I must say very
beautiful phone so i'm going to give you
guys a quick close up of what I see here
and all right guys here we have a
close-up of the nexus 4 it is a straight
black device so it's kind of hard to see
it but up top here we have a 1.9
megapixel front facing camera and in the
back of the 8 megapixel rear camera as
well as the power button on the right
side the volume rocker on the left and
the top has a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack as well as an extra mic the bottom
has a mic as well I don't know if you
guys can quite see that the bottom has a
mic as well as well as a micro USB port
and pretty much this is it but the best
thing about the next is for it is this
glittery design as you guys can see here
now you can see that it doesn't always
show up but it's only in the reflection
of them a lot of light that you can
actually see the little sparkles so this
looks great I'm really a fan of on this
design really good stuff very beautiful
phone alright so now we're going to
quickly power it on just to see what we
get when we first turned it on and he's
got a little stuff on the side all these
Nexus products always comes a little
dirt on it and whatnot but it's booting
up it's getting through it pretty
quickly um let's see how long this logo
laughs I think in my ten-piece and yeah
there we go so that's a pretty quick
boot up for the first time so I'm going
to go and set this up and kind of show
you guys the front screen and all right
guys so here we have it finally set up
press the ok button and as you can see
this is a really quick phone going
through some menus tells you a little
tutorial stuff at first but you can see
a couple of stuff here it's really fast
very responsive is really what you would
expect from the Nexus
a nexus product so it's got some really
good specs for those of you who care or
understand it's it got a quad-core
processor it's an s4 pro which is a
really good chip that they're using
right now a 2100 milliamp battery which
the gizem should give some pretty good
battery life I've heard different things
about the battery life of the Nexus 4 so
we'll see what really happens and other
than that I mean it's a fast phone it's
supposed to be really fast it has the
purest version of Android no custom
skins or anything like that so it'll
always get updated really quickly and
very quick so this is supposed to be a
really good phone for what you pay you
can get the 16 gigabyte version for 350
bucks and three hundred dollars for the
eight gigabyte version but these are
really hard to purchase at the store
because they're always sold out I don't
know if they're doing this on purpose or
what but they're just selling out
extremely quickly and there's just not
much stock but this is my unboxing of
the Nexus 4 guys hopefully you enjoyed
it I'm going to have review and some
comparisons of this as well so stay
tuned for that alright guys this is your
average consumer until the next video
please please
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
