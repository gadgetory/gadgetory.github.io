consumer and today I've got a very
special video I've got an unboxing of
the v-moda XS and today we have my name
is Val Colton on the CEO and founder of
v-moda Wow
so we've got a really special unboxing
today we've got the CEO of v-moda Val's
gonna help us walk through the unboxing
of the v-moda XS so let's not waste any
time let's get right into it
alright guys so here we have the v-moda
XS in white and we also have you here in
black and today we're gonna be unboxing
the white version and you can go over
the black one and see what kind of what
kind of differences we can find between
the two similar to what we saw with the
v-moda m100 we have this little red
ribbon well what exactly is this ribbon
why well well I was always thinking
about how to how can we create a package
that was kind of theft-deterrent when
they're at retail stores but you know so
many packages even scissors when you buy
scissors yet to have scissors to open up
the scissor package they're so difficult
so I was thinking okay what how can we
make this experience beautiful and nice
and I was thinking you know what a
ribbon cutting ceremony is something
nice like no scissors so why don't we
include a red ribbon and make that kind
of the ceremony of open up a box very
nice it definitely gives that feeling
yeah thumbs up so umm alright so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna use my
little unboxing knife to cut this thing
open oh that's pretty big guy everyone
says that teases we've got called my
little yeah so would you mind doing it
right I'll do the honors so have the
ceremony here there we go
uh-huh so we can put the ibaka knife
away yeah alright so now that we pop
this open let's see if while we get
inside
so here's the case and Wow
do you this is a tiny tiny case yeah um
this is my first time actually holding
it and the hand this is a tiny footprint
guys I almost feel like it's pocketable
but I know it's not it kind of reminds
me of a CD player
yeah of how small a CD player is this is
exactly what it feels like
mm bit smaller though yeah timing yes
it's a it's a little bit smaller than
like an old CD player so it's an
interesting analogy so I see we've got
two little pieces here yeah so on this
one we actually designed just like the
m100 in our other products that you have
a carabiner clip so you can clip it on
the inside or outside of your bag or
wherever you want to
we also included two loops that we call
excess loops so what we'll be doing is
uh you know someone can clip and clip
another chain or something else to it
and we're gonna actually develop a chain
so you can hold it like this I like a
little bit like a man clutch or like a
club okay or you can actually even put a
strap around it if you wanted to mine so
it kind of is uh but other people can do
whatever they want with this that's just
two scenarios that we found in I'm sure
that with our customer base of people
will find other uses for them as well
all right so let's open this up we'll
see what the bad boys look like nice zip
so here we have it you guys can get a
quick look and this is the white version
have I mentioned so it's white and gray
and wow these have a tiny tiny footprint
up something yeah there's one extra cork
in here okay so we'll get to the
headphones in a second of course the
case has a very very soft inside with
this material
it's a suede it's a suede material
definitely a nice bill and I see we've
got two straps here so what did these
four so the straps you know they're made
to put your cable in you can also use
them you know in our m100 the straps are
actually originally designed to put a
USB stick in before you could put
clearance chapter or we also make
earplugs for helping to protect your
hearing loss you know you could fit that
and 100 case as well so but we like to
make it very versatile where you can put
you put anything small in there oh very
nice so we do have the user manual the
warranty and they sticker yeah nice and
in the mortise great that includes a 2
year warranty and an immortal life
program so you get 50% if you were never
something were to ever happen to it like
you went over it with a tank or
something and then you also get a
sticker so just you know yeah so I don't
expect many of you I'll have to use
warranty within the two years I know I
haven't had to so definitely good stuff
here but next since we brought up the
cable let's see what we have here so
this is the actual cable this is a great
cable and it still has that nice like
cloth material yeah it's made of so this
feels great and it also has the mic
built-in mic and it has a plain pause
button that'll work for Android devices
as well as iOS devices so you have
playing pause here and what's this
little part I've always wondered there
are two little pieces here yeah I'm not
sure with this one okay so so we
actually separated the microphone from
the control and what that does is it
we call it speakeasy so this will allow
you to have control it a little bit
lower than with a microphone so we the
microphones closer to your mouth and the
controls are closer to your hands okay
that makes sense because um yeah that
definitely does make sense cuz usually
yes like really reads
yeah I'm connecting right okay so there
you have it guys the top portion is the
mic and below it is be remote it has one
more benefit to that sometimes when the
microphone would hit your clothing it
creates noise
and so we really know that people in the
future amusing voice services like
Google now or Siri and by optimizing the
sound quality for the voice recognition
apps we've been able to do that as well
great
now look at those themselves so here you
have it guys and let me say these are
tiny these are very very very nice I
never really do this on my own by chance
but since its but here yep and you see
here that there's a it's a very
form-fitting design very oh it's made to
contour to the shape of your head or you
get a more distributed weight so it's
just at the end of day it's just much
more comfortable to wear for a long time
so it's got a very similar design to the
m100 and the m80 so between this okay so
here we have the m100 and as you guys
can see you can see the difference
between how big and how small the excess
is in comparison so here you guys have
it very very tiny so very good stuff so
between the XS and the m-80s what's the
difference well we have it has a the new
the new headband in design for the
ergonomics was really important on this
product because it'll create a better
not only does it create a better look
for so for the silhouette but it also
increases the comfort and then it also
increases the sound quality because the
better the fit the better the sound
right in and of course so it's really it
really can naturally adjust your head of
course it folds up very small but the
case is about half the size and you know
a smaller thing you can print in your
your in most coat pockets and you'll
even think twice about bringing up your
in years versus your on on your over
your headphones because they're so small
that you can just grab them out when
you're going to grab a coffee or on a
quick errand they're really good to
taking anywhere and and then we have
improved the sound quality as well so we
we always in each generation product I
listen to our consumers feedback and
always make them make a better product
with everything that we've found from
the last few years all right so we can
expect better sound quality a better
so this is gonna be really interesting
to try out guys so this is really cool
guys so um this is the same kind of
build quality you can expect it still to
a very tough very rugged
um I don't expect to have any problems
as far as durability goes if these are
anything like the M 100 that I've tried
out so I'm really looking forward to
this I'm also going to have the
girlfriend tests for these so definitely
stay tuned for that and here we actually
have the black version so we can
actually see the differences between
these this is all black and this is the
white and grey yeah so definitely look
nice the black looks very very low-key
and it doesn't have any colors it
doesn't have any other colors doesn't
just you know black it's all black and
you know it's very stealthy so you know
that's what v-moda really likes to make
policy it allows it to fit into your
style and you can either be in stealth
mode or you can give a little more
colorful you know we also have the
shield's you can if you buy from
t-mobile calm you can get at no extra
charge any color shield you want and
even have a laser engraved at no us or
charge so that you can get that same
laser engraving for these as well yeah
so and that's really a big bonus with
the de moto season it's really the you
know show your true colors in any style
you want from from stealth all the way
to is colorful and as we see it's a very
very contoured fit and remember guys I
have a big head so this is actually
really really cool and what's nice about
these is that I feel like I can wear
these for a long period of time because
they're not clamping
yeah they're not clamping hard at all
yeah so yeah that's really really good
yeah so we're really excited about the
fit especially yeah so for such a small
band I'd expect a lot more clamping
force but this doesn't have too much so
definitely good for long periods of time
yeah and there you have it guys so this
has been a quick unboxing of the v-moda
XS so thanks again Val for being a part

isolation with the girlfriend test so
