consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of D Sony rx100 and I
picked this up because I'm still looking
for a vlog camera and I'm not sure if I
want to use this or the next 5r so
enough of that let's not wasting time
but let's get right into it and alright
guys here we have the Sony rx100 this is
supposed to be a beast of a camera
it's a point-and-shoot and it's got
about 20 megapixels for those of you who
care I'm not gonna go too much into the
specs because you know this is the
average consumer Channel I know that's
probably gonna go over the heads of a
lot of people so I'm not gonna go over
the specs but this thing has gotten tons
and tons of great reviews and I've just
seen people just say great things about
it so it is one of the options for my
vlog channel I have the nex-5r but I
don't know if I really want to commit to
that so I'm trying this out while I have
that just to kind of test out my options
so enough of my blabbering let me show
you guys around the box really quickly
over here we do have the specs if you
guys can see here has some specs it's a
pretty simple box so some accessories
associated camera it's a really nice
looking camera and enough of that let me
open it up put my unboxing knife to cut
this little tape here and let's see
there we have it so I can put this away
and let's pull out this tab pull this
back pull this back on alright let's see
open it up now and the first thing we'll
find in the box is this little black box
here that has a tab and I'm guessing
this is where you have the user guide
and warranty information of course let
me know warranty it's got some other
stuff so I'm advertising I'm sure she
shows you some of that so they've got on
that little box usually they just keep
the papers all up on top cool to see
that they have a little box for it
and boom right there's the camera when
it pulled this out put it on the side
real quick and pull this out see what
else we get here now there's this is
just a holder there's nothing much to it
what else we'll find we've got a micro
USB cable a strap so that you can you
know have it around your hand since it
is a point-and-shoot let's see what is
this I don't know I guess it's a four
straps or something I'm not too sure but
more strap stuff we've got the battery
and we've got the wall adapter where we
can plug in the micro USB and I guess
connected to the camera to charge it and
that's pretty much it for the box as you
can see it's empty so these are all the
accessories that you get with it so we
got the cable the wall adapter battery
this stuff here I know this attaches
somewhere and we've got the strap so I'm
gonna put all the stuff away and let's
take a look at the camera
and this is a pretty small camera it is
a point-and-shoot on the sensor looks
pretty large this little thing right
here so that's always a good thing
and let me give you guys a quick
close-up of what I'm seeing here and
alright guys here it is we've got some
plastic on the top so we're gonna peel
this off and I do also believe we have
some on the back on the screen so we're
gonna take that off as well and boom and
now this is a pretty nice screen it
looks pretty good this is a pretty sleek
camera it's a little thicker than um my
previous camera my previous point and
shoot which was a DSC tx9 thousand
thousand a model there's a pretty slim
camera this is a little thicker but it's
not overly thick it's pretty pretty
good-sized and what's interesting about
this camera is that you have a focal
ring right here so that you can focus on
your shots if you want to do manual
focus if you don't want to use auto
focus you can kind of focus in on the
shots here with this ring which is
really cool I've never seen a point of
shoot with
that before but this isn't really nice
and I gotta say guys this is just pretty
good-looking now I'm gonna put in the
battery and turn it on and we might as
well just take a look at where the
battery slot goes here is where we can
put in the battery and I'll just throw
this in here and this camera can also
use regular SD cards as well as the Sony
micro micro but the memory stick duo so
it can take multiple SD cards and here's
where you couldn't can put it on a
tripod I believe it has an HDMI out as
you guys can see here it's got an HDMI
out and um pretty much that's it on the
sides are where you can find the little
holes so that you can put in your like
strap things like that so that's gonna
be pretty cool and alright there's also
a flash right here at the top so when
you want to take a picture we can turn
it on and let's see here
there it goes when it goes on and when
you want to take a picture with a flash
this little thing pops up over here boom
there you go so pretty much that's it
for this unboxing guys pretty simple
stuff not much to it um I'm definitely
gonna have a review and maybe gonna do a
comparison between this and the next 5r
and the x5 R that I have here as you can
see this is a much smaller camera it
doesn't have this giant lens the the
next five are can change up lenses so
it's pretty cool I can get rid of this
and use a smaller one but this is a much
smaller cameras more compact I'm gonna
see which is going to be better for the
vlogs
as far as image quality I really don't
mind having a bigger camera as long as
the video quality is really good so
we're gonna see which one's better I'm
gonna have a comparison if you guys are
interested let me know in the comments
down below and I will have that if you
are and pretty much that wraps it up for
this unboxing guys if you enjoyed it
