consumer and this is my girlfriend Hey
and today we've got another sound leak
and solid isolations has a cave a
girlfriend Tess and today we're doing
this with the boom phones phantom
alright so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it now first we're
gonna start off with the sound leak test
and with this test we're going to see
how much the music leaks from the
headphones at volumes of 50% 75% and
then 100% cool alright so first we're
gonna start this off with 50% maybe this
right it's sweet oh there we go
she's about to put on speaker and get
quite the leak there yeah I already yeah
so we're gonna start off at 50%
I don't hear anything at all this is
really good all right ready yep so now
we're going to do 75% 50% was really
good and here's 75 okay here this a bit
more so sitting next to someone they
probably slightly hear it probably not
much at all still very good at 75% and
then for 100% ready yeah now we hear
that pretty clearly now what I think do
I think somebody would be bothered by
this probably not that much I don't
think it's that bad there's definitely
one of the better 100 percents that
we've seen so definitely a plus in the
sound leaking test for the boom phone
phantoms and now we're gonna do the
girlfriend test okay explain sure the
girlfriend test is the girlfriend test
is it has to see if his headphones come
back out my annoying sounds nagging
singing any of those things that he
might feel might be annoying see if it
can be blocked out and these are noise
canceling so there should be much
there's much to be expected here and
today for the girlfriend test I'm going
to play a game on the Nexus 10 on the
Nexus 7 and we'll see if the apples can
back up but so now it's called jetpack
joyride it's my first time playing it so
hopefully I don't bear myself yeah okay
all right and also you guys have been
requesting that we do this turn this
down for a second
you guys have been requesting that we
start from 100% for the sound isolation
test and then work our way down to 50%
now we've polled you guys in the past
but there's been more requests for it so
let us know again this time you want to
see it stay like this or go back to the
old way yeah simply in comments 100% to
50 or 50 to 100% so today we're starting
at 100 ready

all right so I definitely didn't hear
about so I definitely didn't hear any of
that so 100% with the pass now I'm going
to take it down to 75% and see how that
is already Mona hit me try it
all right so at 75% a slight we heard it
but I'm very close to her I think that
if I were maybe even a foot away I
probably wouldn't hear anything so
definitely good a 75% for the noise
cancelling all right so that about wraps
up this sound we can sound isolation
test guys and the sound leaking was very
good a plus in my book for the sound
isolation at 75%
it was better than 50% 50% I did hear it
I said if I percent it did get better
though and 100% was of course nothing
but my headphones so overall I say this
the boom phones did a good job and
pretty much wraps it up
all right guys let's catch you in the
next video please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
