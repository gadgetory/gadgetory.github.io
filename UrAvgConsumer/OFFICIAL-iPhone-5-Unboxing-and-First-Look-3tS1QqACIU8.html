consumer and today September 21st so I'm
pretty sure you know what unboxing this
is going to be of course it's the iPhone
5 so let's not waste any time let's get
right into it
alright guys and here we have the iPhone
5
pretty simple box pretty standard
nothing too special to see here so let's
open this up and see what we get inside
of there
but of course grab my knife so to get
through some of this plastic and there
we are
kind of so scared even bringing a knife
to this thing but there we have it you
got rid of some of the plastic very
interested to see and put this away I'm
very interested to see what this um what
this iPhone looks like and feels like
everybody's going crazy for it two
million pre-orders in the first hour I
mean the first 24 hours so that's crazy
luckily I was one of the few to grab one
and um pretty standard box let's open it
up and there here's the iPhone 5 wow
this thing is pretty thin
not bad but before we get into this was
of course he wasn't of the rest of the
box so when you lift this up you have a
little package here packaged documents
I'm sure startup guides tips and stuff
basic controls and of course you get
your Apple stickers so that's what we
get here and inside of the box you'll
get your Apple earpods so these are
Apple earpods luckily these come with a
a pair
you have your wall adapter and as well
as the new lightning on those new
lightning cable so let's open this up
yeah and I must say this seems like it's
a pretty long cord
yeah that's pretty long so that's pretty
good
it's gonna have some link to it and
what's interesting about this cable is
that you can put it plug it in any way
to put it upside down either way you
want to put it in it'll work and give
you guys a quick close-up of what it
actually looks like so here you have it
this is the Lightning pin connector it's
pretty simple as you can see as I said
both sides both sides are identical so
it's gonna make charging pretty simple
you just got to plug it in so now that
we've got this other stuff out the way
let's take a look at the iPhone itself I
must say this looks pretty nice Apple
does a good job designing their products
of course this is a good looking phone
let me get this plastic off of here so I
can kind of get an idea of what the
aluminum back looks like I must say it
looks pretty good I actually like this
over the glass back that the iPhone 4s
and the iPhone 4 had so I'm really happy
with this design it looks really good it
was very sleek this is something you
definitely want to get the case for it
it feels it almost feels dangerous
holding it by itself so a case is
definitely a must in my opinion for some
something like this phone and you know
iPhones are infamous for shattered
screens so I definitely won a case for
this I'm gonna give you guys a close-up
so you can see around the phone and get
a better idea of what I'm looking at all
right guys and here you have the iPhone
5 and as I said about the back of the
phone it looks really nice and clean so
clean look the sides match the back so
you know it matches very well very happy
with this um it's very similar to the
iPhone 4 and 4s you're not gonna get
much else much else isn't changing
besides the length of it and this back
right here and of course the sides have
also gotten thinner so those are pretty
much all the drastic changes you'll
notice about this and of course the
camera is now in the middle instead of
on the side so that's about it I am
curious as to how thin this is I'm going
to compare to my iPod
fourth generation here LSC okay I still
think the iPod is a bit thinner um yeah
looking at it real quick
it looks like the iPod is still thinner
but um overall these bits this is
comparable so that's a really great job
by Apple I'm very surprised that they're
able to add all these new specs and
better specs inside a smaller phone and
alright that's it for this close-up
alright guys so let's see if we just
thing has any juice what's powered on of
course we have the first boot of the
iPhone 5 got the Apple logo of course
and I'm just really impressed by this
guys I must say the feeling holding it
is pretty um it's pretty nice it's not
much different from the iPhone 4 and 4s
it is longer but I don't think this is
gonna be a hard transition for anyone
who had that phone I might be used to
having a bigger screen already because
I'm used to using the HTC One S and as
you can see they're pretty similar size
the iPhone is a little shorter but
overall I think this is not bad and
there we are we have the intro I'm gonna
go and set this up guys start playing
with it get ready for my review alright
I hope you guys enjoyed this unboxing

days so thanks for watching this is your
