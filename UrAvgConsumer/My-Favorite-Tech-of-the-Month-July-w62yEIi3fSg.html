I've been using LastPass for years so
it's great to be partnering with them
again and for those of you who don't
know what last passes it's basically a
tool that allows you to store all of
your passwords so you don't have to go
type them into every website and you
don't have to remember all the different
kind of passwords that you use and for
those of you worried about hackers all
you have to do is enable multi-factor
authentication and with that you'll have
an extra layer of protection so nobody
can just go ahead and break into your
account and that's honestly something I
recommend you do with everything that
you can and one of the reasons why I
love having a LastPass account is
because whenever I get a new device I
don't have to worry about which password
goes to what all I have to do is install
LastPass and with that I'll be able to
get access to everything without having
to remember all of the different
passwords that I use and if you happen
to have a hard time coming up with
secure passwords LastPass can auto
generate some that are practically
impossible to guess so there's no more
using that password 1-2-3 password that
too many people use so if you want to
learn more about LastPass definitely
check the links down below in the
description but again who stinks
LastPass for sponsoring but now let's
get to that favorite tag of the month
it's been a while since we've done this
so we've got a little catching up to do
but for those of you who have never seen
one of my favorite tech of the month
videos this is pretty much where I go
over tech that I've been personally
enjoying whether it's old or new but
these are what I've been using for the
past few months so the first thing that
we're gonna take a look at is this
little guy this is the surface go now
this is brand new this just came out but
I've had it for a little while now and I
gotta say guys I was really really
impressed by what this thing can do it
is a 10 inch laptop or tablet I'm still
not really sure how to categorize this
thing because the keyboard doesn't come
with it it's a separate option but you
gotta have the keyboard that's what
makes the entire experience but the
surface go itself has been really really
impressive because it's got a small form
factor but you still can run full-blown
Windows on it honestly it reminds me of
those netbooks that people used to use
back in the day but this is like
Microsoft's take on it they took their
surface pro and made it super small now
I've been personally enjoying this
because it fits in like all of my
backpacks and I can web browser and type
up Word documents without a problem but
if you haven't seen my video about it
I'll have it linked down below this is
definitely something that's worth
looking into since it's back-to-school
time if you're looking for a nice
note-taking device or something in type
of Word documents you want to look into
this this thing is it's tiny look at
this like a pom it with no problem I
think is dope now something else that
I've been using a lot lately is this guy
this is the peak design everyday
backpack now this is geared more towards
photographers and videographers it's a
camera backpack so this thing what's
great about it is that it can hold all
of my gear and I walk around with some
pretty big cameras but you can see the
tripod right there that I'm bumping into
stuff but that is actually strapped
right here into the bottom of it so I
could walk around do what I need to do
without carrying any crazy things in my
hands no crazy camera no tripod although
when it's like this
it is pretty wide so I have to watch out
and make sure I don't bump into any
walls or people aside from that it has
been a godsend but when you're going for
something from the top you just hit this
little latch bring it down and you can
reveal its content so right here I've
got like my red camera I've also got the
screen to go with it and you guys can
just see this is a lot of space this is
a 20 liter backpack and I think there's
a smaller option as well in case you're
not carrying around anything too big but
this wasn't even taking up the maximum
capacity of this bag you can have it go
all the way up to right here if I can
just strap it in I can't if you want to
use it as a sling you can easily just do
that go for something inside here and it
works just like that now I've also got
two lenses in here I've also got some
batteries for my red also a pair of
headphones and you've also got
compartments here on the side so I've
got my media card reader a couple of
SSDs and you guys you guys can see the
theme here lots of space lots of
compartments and what's nice about this
is that like it looks good this is a
good-looking backpack it doesn't
protrude like crazy so it's nice and
compact and it's still very very
functional so this bag has been a win I
absolutely and highly recommend it to
anybody who has camera gear and has
issues with carrying stuff around you
can also even carry it like this which
is nice so definitely definitely worth
it I am a big fan now something else I
happen to have here on the side are some
lenses but for smartphones so these
right here are interchangeable lenses
for smartphones so with the smartphones
that I tend to carry with me I've always
got my iPhone 10 as well as my pixel to
excel the pixel to excel I mainly bring
around
I always carry around two phones but
this one is for the camera and combined
with the moment lenses I can get some
really really nice shots and this is
like a must for me lately I've had the
moment lenses for a little while but it
was more recently that I actually
started trying them out and man I've
been really really impressed now I'm not
super crazy about the cases they look ok
they're just like regular cases but
what's special about them is that
they've got these little cutouts around
the camera and that's what allows you to
just throw on any of the lenses that you
want right here so this one right here
is my personal favorite this is the 18
millimeter lens so it's like a wider
lens so if your shots have always been
too zoomed in and you have to back up to
get your shot throw this guy on and you
can position it however you want and get
a nice wide shot now there are other
lenses as well like a telephoto lens a
macro lens as well as a fisheye lens
which I don't really care about huh but
this one right here this 18 millimeter
if there's one lens you should pick up I
definitely think it's that this with a
pixel - it's an insane combo I don't
even feel like I need to carry around
the DSLR anymore as long as I have these
two in my pocket now something else that
I've been really enjoying that you guys
probably didn't even notice is this
little guy right here this is a
bluetooth adapter from Pheo Orfeo not
really sure but this thing has been
awesome so basically what this is is a
Bluetooth adapter that gets the
Bluetooth signal from your phone your
phone sends the audio over to this
little guy and what's special about it
is that it
as a headphone jack so with that you'll
be able to actually use headphones with
a cable like the one that I've got right
here so I can take this plug it in and
then I'm instantly getting audio right
from my phone and I'm still getting
great sound quality as well as no lag no
lag is a really big deal here because I
don't have to worry about watching a
video and having the dialogue be out of
sync it all syncs up perfectly which is
really really impressive I know some
headphones that can't even do that you
can just kind of clip it onto your pants
like this or like you guys saw on top of
the backpack strap that I had and you
can even answer calls from it now the
only caveat with that is that you can't
use the mic that's built into your cable
or anything you'll have to use the mic
that's built into this and that's kind
of why I had it under strap and in close
proximity to my face so that when I
speak the person will be able to hear me
so for those of you who have a favorite
pair of wired headphones you can now
make them bluetooth and still get really
great quality I highly highly recommend
this thing and the last thing we've got
right here and that's a screwdriver but
it's not just any old screwdriver this
one actually has a motor so you can and
it's not a crazy motor anything and
don't get me wrong this is probably not
the most exciting thing in the world but
it's been like super useful for me when
it comes to like tinkering with my PC
instead of having to all day use one of
these and this isn't as powerful as a
drill so we don't have to worry about
destroying your PC or anything like that
but this has you just enough power to
just make it less annoying to take out
all of those screws that you usually
deal with and let's say your battery
happens to die on you or you just want
to do it yourself manually you can just
lock it in place with this little switch
right here and it kind of just locks it
so you can just go ahead and manually do
it now this isn't a flashy product but
it's been something that's been helping
me out a lot with my tech so I
definitely think that this is something
people should look into if you don't
like just using a screwdriver I know it
sounds super lazy but that's what tech
is all about tech is all about making
the simple task even easier so don't
come at me about being lazy but this is
by
Decker I'll have links down below in the
description to this as well as
everything else that you guys saw in
this video favorite second a month is
hopefully gonna be on next month as well
but it is so hard to keep the series up
because I feel like I've shown you guys
all of my favorite things already but
whenever I come across something new
that I'd enjoy you guys know where to
find it but total next video guys
hopefully enjoy it if you did be the
cool guy girl that gives a thumbs up
I'll catch you guys in the next one so
then it's your average consumer proofs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
