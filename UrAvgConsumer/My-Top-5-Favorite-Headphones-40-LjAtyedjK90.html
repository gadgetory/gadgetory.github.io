let you know my top 5 favorite
headphones and this time around I've got
some highly recommended pics from my boy
Mike over a hi-fi insider but you guys
might remember him as hi-fi guy 5 to 8
but before we start talking about
personal audio let's talk about that
audio that we all share that TV so you
ever want to watch a movie but you can't
quite make out what they're saying so
you turn up the volume and then some
insane explosion happens or the
background music just gets too loud and
you're still not able to hear what that
dialogue is about well after master
reached out to me to let you guys know
that they've got the solution with the
after master TV this little guy hooks up
to your TV via HDMI and cleans up the
audio so you won't have to deal with
that unbalanced sound I've been testing
out an early version of this but I can
definitely hear the difference if you
guys want to upgrade your TV audio you
have to hit up the link in the
description to check out their
Kickstarter page and if you back them
early enough you can get some awesome
savings before it hits the market so
definitely check the links in the
description but onto our list we're
going to kickstart this list with the
Sennheiser HD 598 special edition my
told me about these and after spending
time with the HD 700 and you I'd
eventually have to get myself a pair of
open-back headphones an open back design
means the music won't be sealed off in
your headphones which means you should
expect a lot more sound leakage but
that's what they're supposed to do this
will give you a music a grandeur concert
like feel now these are a large but good
looking pair of headphones they are
affordable but considering the ear cup
size and the fact that they're open back
you probably won't be leaving the house
with these anyway they are however
insanely comfortable and I can easily
wear these for hours at a time with no
problem
I like the classic Sennheiser look
they've got to them and really like the
look of the grill
on the side and they're pretty solid so
durability won't be an issue and when it
comes to sound quality these are great
and honestly I wouldn't expect any
different from Sennheiser if you're
looking for a pair of headphones with a
great soundstage look no further and for
those of you who aren't familiar
soundstage will give you the ability to
visualize the placement of musical
instruments and vocalists as well as any
other sounds in your music these sound
crisp and detailed and the brace is
pretty controlled but if you're a bass
head you might want to check out some of
the other options on this list these go
for $200 on Amazon and I think they're
well worth it especially if you listen
to music that involves a lot of
different instruments next up we've got
one of my favorites of all time the BMO
de m100 and if you guys know me you know
I'm crazy about these there are tons of
reason to pick these up but here are
some of my favorite things about them
they've got a crazy compact design with
foldable hinges making them extremely
easy to carry around and they're
probably one of the most solidly built
headphones I've ever used as v-moda puts
them to military grade testing for
durability so you can count on these to
last they're also extremely customizable
you have tons of color options between
the headphones and a shield plate and
you can actually put a special design on
the shield plate like a logo or a
picture or even some 3d printed shields
made out of all kinds of metals from
aluminum all the way to platinum you'll
also find two cable inputs on these so
you can daisy chain a second pair of
headphones if you want to share your
audio this is especially useful if
you're on a plane with someone and you
both want to watch a movie or listen to
some music without having to share our
single pair of earbuds we've also got a
ton of accessories from gaming mics to
extra large ear cushions so you can
completely change up your experience
with them now you're probably wondering
about the sound and I gotta say I love
these they offer super rich sound with
some seriously awesome bass
and I can see these fitting well with
any genre and just about anyone will be
happy with their performance and another
bonus these used to cost three hundred
dollars which I definitely think they're
worth but v-moda has since dropped the
price and you can find them on Amazon
for less than 250 at that price these
are a must grab now if your budget is a
bit tighter you might want to look into
the sony MDR v6 these are our classic
pair of headphones and only go for about
80 bucks anyone in the audio industry
has probably seen or use these when Mike
first told me about these I instantly
recognized them because I've seen them
being used on various video shoot by all
of the sound guys and even though these
are studio monitors they have a foldable
and compact design which means traveling
with them won't be a big deal they've
got some nice cushions so they're very
comfortable and I found that long
listening session weren't an issue at
all now I'm not gonna lie to you the v6
isn't exactly a looker and it actually
reminds me of some of the gear my dad
used to use back in the day but if
sounding functionality is a priority for
you and you don't care for something
fancy looking these won't disappoint
they have a pretty flat response so
they'll be perfect if you're working
with audio whether it's making beats or
monitoring sound for video if you want
to hear a lot of detail
these are super legit for the price just
keep in mind the sound here isn't
altered so they aren't bassy
and don't feature any other significant
sound boost just raw audio now does that
mean you can only use these if you work
with audio heck no I've been using them
since I found out about them and
honestly I think they do just fine for
casual listening next up we have the
bear dynamic t51 eye now these are a
favorite of mics and it's pretty easy to
see why if you're looking for real
audiophile grade headphones you'll want
to take a serious look at these they
have a slim on ear design and are super
portable
they aren't foldable but their small
footprint makes them easy to take around
so if you aren't into walking around
with giant
phones these are a great option to look
at they're also very lightweight but
feel solid with their brushed metal
design and are pretty flexible the air
cups can rotate 180 degrees so you can
lay these down flat or use them to
listen with one ear now how do these
hi-fi headphones sound great if you like
listening to music with vocals these are
gonna sound amazing I'm really happy
with the richness of the sound quality
and I love even more that they didn't
skimp out on the bass to deliver it bass
is tight and controlled so you're
getting quality sound without any blow
these are definitely one of the most
premium on ear headphones I've ever used
and they retail for about three hundred
dollars but I've seen them on Amazon for
as low as 250 which I definitely think
they're worth and last but not least
we've got the sony MDR xb 950 bt and man
did these take me by surprise i didn't
expect them to rise up as one of my
favourite headphones so quickly but
these things are amazing I knew they
were a bass oriented pair of headphones
before I tried them on but after my
first listen I was blown away not to
mention their Bluetooth I love bluetooth
I love the convenience of Bluetooth
headphones and not having to use any
cables they're pretty nice looking and
have a nice black and red design but
they are admittedly on the large side
which doesn't make them ideal as outdoor
headphones but if you don't care about
big ear cups which are stupid
comfortable by the way then you'll enjoy
some nice cordless audio I do wish
however that they were foldable or at
least came with a case but one of my
favorite things about bluetooth
headphones is the ability to control
your music without having to reach for
your device you've got all the standard
controls you need on the right ear cup
and one of the biggest features with
this headphone is this guy right here
the bass boost button with this feature
on expect your brain to turn to mush
from all the bass trust me when I say
the bass is incredible without this
feature
with it you're on a whole new plateau of
based consumption now you aren't limited
to genres that use a lot of bass but
that's definitely where these excel if
you're a bass lover don't ask any
questions
buy these they typically retail for $200
but I've seen them as low as 100 bucks
whether you get a deal or pay full price
I think it's absolutely worth it but
that about wraps up this list huge shout
out to Mike over at hi-fi insider I'll
have links to his channel down below in
the description so if you guys want to
check out some audiophile headphones and
other audio gear definitely check out
that channel but hopefully you enjoyed
it if you did be the cool guy that gives
this video a thumbs up and I'll catch
you in the next one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
