and the next iPhone announcement is it's
less than a week away so I figured today
we'll talk about some of the new
software features coming to both the new
iPhones and current iOS devices
thanks to iOS 11 so we're gonna kick
this off with something simple that
everyone uses and that's the control
center now as iOS 11 you'll be able to
add remove or arrange the settings as
you see fit now I'm not gonna lie the
layout looks very different compared to
what we're used to but the beauty here
is the fact that you're able to arrange
it in a way that works best for you and
anything that gives us the ability to
customize and give us a bit more freedom
I'm a fan of and next up we've got the
file app now I think this is a feature
that most of us have been waiting for
for quite some time on iOS devices some
kind of file explorer so we can know
exactly what's on the device and get
access to things whenever we want it and
this app takes place of the iCloud Drive
app so you'll have access to all of your
iCloud Drive files as well as the files
that are on your device and I think some
of the best use cases that we'll see
what the files app will be with the iPad
pro with the iPad pro you have access to
multitasking and you also have drag and
drop and there are gonna be some apps
that take advantage of the fact that
will now be able to multitask with files
on the side and use that drag and drop
feature so that we can drag stuff into
the app and create something special so
it's awesome that we're finally gonna
have this files out below key I think
that drag and drop feature is gonna be a
game changer as well
and speaking of multitasking on the iPad
pro we had some kind of form of it where
an app would slide in on the right side
but now they've kind of upgraded that
with iOS 11 they're introducing a
redesigned dock which allows way more
applications to be stored in it
and you can also see your active
applications but what's cool is that you
can now slide up the dock grab an app
and actually place it on the side of the
screen and it pops up like a little
window so you can do cool things like
have your iMessage open while reading
the news or doing whatever you want
watching a video having access to those
little windows now that's gonna be a
really cool thing I think we're starting
to see more and more of a focus on the
iPad pro getting features that'll make
it competitive with laptops which could
actually make a pretty good video can
the iPad pro replace my laptop for like
a week
let me know if you guys would like that
I'll be interesting now another new
feature that's coming to iOS 11 that I
don't think is gonna get too much
attention because it isn't crazy flashy
but it's super useful and I think that's
the document scanner and don't get me
wrong I know there's a ton of document
scanning apps out there I've got a
couple myself but I love what a feature
like this is built in natively into the
operating system let me tell you why I
think this is cool
for students scanning notes from your
friends scanning textbooks from a
college students out there even adults
scanning receipts documents forms all
that kind of stuff you'll be able to
scan it here and what it does is it will
scan multiple pages so it puts it all
together for you so you don't have to go
and fill up your camera roll with a ton
of paperwork or anything like that now
there's a dedicated spot for that and I
really think that's cool
especially for those college students
like seriously and a nice little bonus
is that if you're using this with an
iPad pro and you have an Apple pencil
you can scan documents and make little
annotations to it or if you're scanning
a form of some sort you can sign it
right on the iPad pro and then send it
off to wherever you need to now
something that I'm personally excited
for is the new redesign of the App Store
right now my interactions with the App
Store are just to update my apps or
maybe to search for one specific app and
get out of there
and I don't know about you guys but I
haven't really been using the App Store
to discover any new apps in probably
years you always see the App Store with
a ton of apps thrown in your face and
you kind of just get numb to it all but
now I think it's pretty cool that the
new front page has focused on select
apps and you kind of sit down I wonder
why did these apps make the cut you look
into it a bit and see if it's worth your
download and I kind of like that in
terms of app discovery and another new
change that really helps in the new game
and app tabs is that when you're
scrolling down you get to automatically
see some gameplay or some usage of
certain apps and there's like a ton of
them out there right now so being able
to find new apps new things to fall in
love with to make our phones better I'm
down for and there are gonna be a ton of
other features coming to iOS 11 but I
think will really change things up like
being able to send someone money through
iMessage using Apple pay and new updates
to Siri and being able to translate
voices even augmented reality coming to
a ton of apps I think iOS 11 is going to
be something to look at
and if there's a cool feature that I
haven't spoken about here that you guys
really like let me know if a comment
down below but hopefully you guys
enjoyed this if you did be the cool guy
or girl that gives this video a thumbs
up and I'll catch you guys next week
when we talk about the new iPhone I'm
gonna be there it's gonna be awesome
till then guys's drivers consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
