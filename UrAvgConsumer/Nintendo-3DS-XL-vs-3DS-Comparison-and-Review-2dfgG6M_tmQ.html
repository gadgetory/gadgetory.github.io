want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind alright let's get to
another tech video what's going on
everyone a travers consumer today I'm
gonna be reviewing the Nintendo 3ds XL
and I'm also going to be doing a bit of
a comparison between it and the original
Nintendo 3ds so let's not waste any time
let's get right into it alright guys so
here we have the Nintendo 3ds XL and I
must say this is really a great revision
of the original 3ds I definitely love
the size on the Nintendo 30s always did
seem a bit too small to me and I'm
really happy with what they did with the
increased screen size very very happy
with how they did this um there aren't
too many changes here compared to the
original I'm gonna pull the original
right here now of course the biggest
thing that changed is the 90% larger
screen and you know that's really great
what scares a lot of people is that
they've kept the same resolution between
the two and at first you'd think that
it's just gonna come out and look really
blurry on the UM screens but it actually
looks very good I don't I was very
surprised when I first turned it on
because it didn't look so pixelated as I
would expect I definitely expected a lot
more pixelation I expected it to look a
bit more fuzzy but they did a good job
somehow I'm making it seem pretty smooth
um definitely a very easy transition
from the original to this one so I
really can't complain about the new
larger size it's a lot more comfortable
now you can kind of rest your um your
palms here and use it without any you
know real problems whereas for the 3ds
when you used it it would mainly be your
thumbs on the device so it gives a
little bit more of a nicer feel as far
as you know just holding it and getting
a good grip on the entire device itself
so very happy about that and it's very
just found it to be very comfortable now
what's also changed with the 3dsxl is it
also has a
bigger battery because it's a bigger
size you can take a bigger battery the
original had about thirteen hundred
milliamps of battery this now has
seventeen hundred and fifty so what that
translates to is about five to eight
hours on here and about six to ten on
here and I did find this to be true it
did have more battery life I was able to
play my games longer so I was very happy
with that improvement there overall I
definitely like it depending on the your
size I can't help but say this is the
better choice it does cost a bit more
these are priced at $200 and I believe
these are 160 $9.99 so about maybe 170
compared to 200 so 30 bucks
for a large improvement here I believe
some other changes that came with the
excel is that it now has on a couple of
different positions for certain things
the headphone jack is now at the bottom
left corner instead of the middle like
on the 3d s also another change is
instead of having the stylus in the back
here
they now include it onto the right hand
side and it also gives you a different
kind of stylus before I had this some
extendable stylus on the 3ds
and it's extendable because of how small
this was so it was an extendable stylist
and you can put it in the back here but
on the XL if it just comes out on the
right and it's just one simple stylus
another change that came with the the
excel is how they made the buttons at
the bottom I'm gonna show you guys a
close-up so you can get a better idea of
what I'm talking about so what we have
here is the original 3d s and as you can
see the Select home and start button all
are on this one little pad here and you
kind of have to like press them in to
get enough like get them to do something
you want so I wasn't really a fan of
this and I'm glad that they changed it
in the 3d XXL here on the XL you can see
that they're dedicated buttons now to
each of those three select home and
start all have their own little button
and it feels like you've pressed all of
them by themselves so that's pretty nice
here definitely a very very welcome
change for me instead of having that
little button that one long button that
you
to press each one I I just didn't like
it so definitely a nice improvement here
there's also a few other subtle changes
from the Radiesse to the excel what you
see here is before the 3ds when opening
it it goes straight to the back with and
when they started when it gets this far
back that's when it clicks and it can
hold it in position with the 3dsxl now
you can have it one here in one position
like this and it clicks
so it'll stop right here which is gonna
be pretty good if you're watching maybe
videos or something so that's really
nice then it can stop right here and it
can also go a little further back and
click there too so it can stop at those
two different positions which is really
nice instead of being back at this one
position on the 3d F so I do like that
they just added that is this an extra
little thing there which is always good
now another the last change really on
the young excel is the kind of finish on
the top before I had this glossy finish
on the 3ds gets with a lot of finger
prints and um you know it's very shiny
where the 3dsxl it's just like a smooth
back from a smooth top and bottom here
and you know just like a matte finish I
believe this is a matte finish and um
you know it's pretty nice very smooth
not the glossy fingerprint magnet that
the 3d s6 do yes was so I do like that
improvement on the excel I did say that
that was the last change but another
little thing that they didn't move they
didn't move the SD card from the root
left side the left side over to the
right hand side and instead of a 2 gig
memory card that you got with the under
yes you now get a four gig memory card
with the excel so everything is getting
bigger on the excel battery screen and
memory card so it's all great stuff
there
and now that's about it for the
differences between the two of them um
my overall experience with the three
ethic saw has been great I much rather
it than the 3d s if you guys go to
gamestop I believe you could trade in
your old 3ds and get like a hundred
towards the excel so that's really cool
definitely save some money there and if
the case you don't want to can't have
two of them so you can definitely get
like a hundred bucks off that's pretty
cool
and overall guys like yeah like I said
this is definitely great this is what I
wish the original 3d s came out as this
is that this is just the way it should
have been so like I said guys I'm very
happy with what the game how the games
look on the excel compared to the 3ds
even though they share the same
resolution there's no drop in quality
from the games I've played so far on the
excel so this just seems like the better
buy to me I've played these games and
3ds games and they've there's been no
dropping quality I'm gonna give you guys
a quick little look at you know maybe a
couple of seconds of me playing one the
same game on both devices just so you
can see there's no real difference in
the quality alright guys so here you
have the 3dsxl as you can see this is
what the quality would look like on here
nothing too fancy just giving you guys
an idea of what this looks like and now
I'm going to show you what it looks like
on the 3ds XL alright guys so here we
have tales of the abyss on the 3ds XL
I'm sorry for the flings the screen
flickering here you know the 3ds has
like a very interesting screen but
because of the 3d effects but as you can
see it looks pretty much the same as it
did on the 3ds there's no real
difference as far as quality goes um I
can't see a difference you'd have to
really be nitpicking to see um to think
it looks bad everything looks pretty
clear to me you can see in the options
even that it looks really clear there's
no huge pixelation or funky looks even
though they're same it's the same low
resolution on a big screen and hopefully
you guys got a good idea of what a game
looks like on both versions I know they
were very short clips but I want it to
be too long so you got a good idea there
they look exactly the same to the naked
eye to me I didn't see a huge difference
and pixelation maybe your experience
might be different by don't think that
like many people will notice it and
pretty much that wraps up my comparison
and reviews of the 3dsxl compared to the
3d s I definitely think that Nintendo
should have gone straight to this
version maybe if you like maybe you
might like the smaller form factor maybe
if you're younger or something like that
but for me I definitely think that Excel
is the way to go very happy with it it's
just a better overall product than the
3d s was so I'm pretty happy with this
if you're interested in you know on the
or on the fence about getting one
definitely go for the XL it's a little
big my data and there's no line about
that a little bigger but I definitely
think it's worth it I think you'll enjoy
it I think it's a good purchase
especially only for 30 bucks you get a
lot of better stuff get better battery
you got a bigger screen can't beat that
and that's about it for my review guys
