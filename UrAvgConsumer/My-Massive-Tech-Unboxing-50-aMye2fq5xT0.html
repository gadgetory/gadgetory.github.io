consumer and as you can see we've got a
ton of packages again so this is going
to be another massive tech unboxing
there's a lot of stuff here so I suggest
getting some snacks get ready to chill
let's check out some tech so you know
the deal
this one right here what is this a
random box okay so let's see you know I
don't even know why bother with knives
on these Amazon boxes because you can
literally just enough give them right
open oh okay I forgot I bought this so
this is a magnetic hourglass my field
brother-in-arms Dave 2d actually made a
tweet about this thing it was on sale
during like the Amazon Prime day so I
picked what but this is it so I don't
know how this works if there's any
special instructions oh it's a magnetic
base really ah okay oh this is dope you
guys won't be able to see it as well as
you should be able to so I'm going to do
some b-roll you guys are going to be
able to see this thing in all its glory
oh this is height this is hot
good job Dave thanks for the heads up
now I know we've got some stuff from
like Microsoft and razor in here so let
me actually look for one of those
this one's from Microsoft okay let's pop
this guy open I had no idea they were
sending anything I just kind of checked
my mail and so I had a package oh okay
Kutner enjoy these new controllers okay
oh oh you got a new version of that so
first up volcano shadow this looks
pretty hot oh we got more tape so let's
pop this open and see this volcano
shadow cool this is hot have a blue one
or like a teal ish looking one that's
called ocean ocean something it's hot
does like one of my favorites so this is
like the red counterpart this
awesome that's really good it looks
really good alright so we've also got
patrol tech here hop this guy open I
like this this one has the nice ridges
on the edges right here so you got some
nice ridges it's in blue and it's got
that textured grip in the back this is
dope you see one thing I can really
appreciate about Microsoft and Xbox they
make a lot of nice hardware so if you
want a controller that's going to match
your vibe they've got a lot of options
I wish Tommy had this many options but
when it comes to controllers Microsoft
is killing it so I've got this case
filled with
Xbox controllers in the gamers paradise
I had some different plans on things I
was going to fill in there but I think
controls are going to take up the entire
space so this is another one I have
three right now to add to the collection
so this is nice this one has like the
green is grey with green accents under
the joysticks this one's nice right if I
Castle but it really hits the Xbox team
man those are three really really dope
controllers and I've also got these a
controller stands to go into that big
case so I'm going to I'm going to drop
one but I'm going to open these later
and put them all inside alright so it's
getting kind of dark so doing another
light we did enough all right cool
so now let's move on to the next box I
want to find the Razer one that's here
okay cool so this is a new gaming
headset by Razer
holy moly this is way bigger than I
thought so this is the Razer thresher
ultimate so this is it for the ps4 oh
this is really good it's very
interesting to see it in a black and
blue color scheme since Ray's is all
about that black and green and for those
of you who have never heard of the Razer
thresher
this thing has 7.1 surround sound it
comes with a headphone stand its
Wireless of course
retractable bat retracted that
retractable boom mic noise-isolating
leatherette air-cushion yada yada yada
let's check this out
and we've got the Thresher ultimate stem
cells whoa big air cushions this this
should be very comfortable let's see oh
wow it goes completely over the years
it's like you're not even wearing them
that this is kind of nice comfort wise
this thing is awesome
got the attractable mic over here and
you've got a little PlayStation logo
over here as well on the ear cups so
they really went all out here we've got
some micro USB cables an optical cable
more USB chips the audio hub and I'm
guessing that the stand is underneath
all up here which it is and just so you
guys can see it when it's all hooked up
here I have the stand built out and the
threshers on top of it this actually
looks really really awesome so I can't
wait to give it a shot let you guys know
what I think of it and how it sounds
you guys want to see a full review be
sure to that like button let me know and
also comment down below but this is
exciting
can't wait to try it out here we go oh
oh sorry oh my oh my god were that I
ordered it last night same-day shipping
so I got it to come today this is not
visible to me that gum I told you up oh
yeah no there's no girl I feel very this
was gum so she'd be surprised for this
unboxing she was like what anyway so
this is the splatoon 2 pro controller
for the Nintendo switch re actually got
me onto splatoon - I've never played it
before not on the Wii U and I've been
enjoying it like crazy it is a very fun
game it'll like something that'd be my
type of game but after playing it I can
see why it's so popular but here it is
my gosh it looks kind of good huh
he was different here the fact is it's
of two different colors on the grips is
that it also has these little ink blots
all over the the front of the controller
which is nothing you see on the regular
pro controller of course so this is it
this is all you do thank you Oh sir got
me my Amazon actually just got them back
in stock so if you guys want these or
anything else as you see in the video be
sure to link down below in the
description and we've also got you
actually picked this up from a game spot
this is a what what is it the hybrid
cover for the switch but it's also
decked out in splatoon two characters
and whatnot oh this thing comes with a
screen protector as well so that's cool
and a microfiber cloth
oh it's become 2 microfiber cloth which
people know the way to my heart but here
it is you pretty pretty much just put
your Nintendo switch inside of here and
it allows you to use this as a stand
since the switch has a pretty poor
kickstand we all know this it sucks so
this comes from a company I bought this
myself but it comes from a company that
I've been following for a while try to
get my hands on this awhile back and
just couldn't happen but I finally got
one today this is the hydrate spark hide
your spark 2.0 well this pretty much
does is you fill it up with water and
when it notices that you didn't have
water in a while does a little add a
little light that goes off kind of
reminds you like head from some water
this is cool
now this also has some other smart
features like being able to sync with
your Fitbit app if you use Fitbit
products and you can keep track of your
water intake there as well so there have
a lot of cool features I'd a lot less
you don't typically see in a water
bottle and this is it is rather simple
looking I like to look though here
favorite is definitely bunker led to
novelty multiple China 2013 buddy asked
you Alexa okay Alexa be freaking out
sometimes but let's see I actually
ordered all his hives
I ordered a cloud amiibo I'm a huge
final fantasy fan now I don't really buy
a ton of amiibos but this one when I saw
it came out I had to pick it up
Cobb like one of the best he's not
better than squaw but he's one of the
best so this is the 4k pro webcam from
logitech now I actually put this up
because I wanted to upgrade the camera
that is in the gamers paradise once I
heard that there was a 4k option out I
had to do it so the very fact of this
thing is 4k still only 4k webcam that I
know of so I'd assume that this is
probably like the best for you know
Twitter or anything with a webcam
anything related to a webcam yeah so
this is it this is are pretty big it
actually uses USB type-c which is really
interesting can use this with a macbook
not that you ever would but you can so
that's awesome I'm always here this is
the other thing i got from Best Buy this
is a what is it mode down she they out
they have all the letters filled in
camera feed but I think is mode out it's
a three foot like me lighted cable so
this is a cool neat little USB cable if
you just want to kind of show off have
something fancy in your backpack or
plugged into your wall this thing lights
up doesn't do much besides charge your
phone and right up I still think is
pretty cool does so I got this from
Amazon and it came just like what you're
seeing right here the fact that it was
replaced in its kind of concerning and
it was something expensive I'd have a
problem but this is pretty much a
footrest that goes under your desk so I
don't know about you guys but for me
personally when I'm sitting on a desk
for a while arc time my feet elevated
and
these kind of things are really really
awesome and it moves so you can get the
right angle you can even play around
with it with your feet if you like to
fidget a lot of something this is a
really really nice little addition to in
Desa they're really inexpensive too I
can't live without these though I've got
a lot of desk setups here so have to
pick one up what is this
oh I don't even know I put this in here
so this okay so I got a couple of things
in here for back-to-school some book
bags and other tech I'm not going to
show that just yet you guys are gonna
have to watch the video but I'm gonna
have a back-to-school budget Edition and
baller Edition I'm not even sure which
one's coming out first but I'll have
links for those down below in the
description so if you guys want to check
that out you want to see cool tight that
you can take to school I'm gonna have
some options for you guys alright so
this last box funny story with this one
it's not going to be too excited about
seeing it already so this right here is
the sub pack em - now you're probably
wondering why did you get another one
well let me tell you guys I went home to
visit my family in Brooklyn subtag
happened to be on me in the car car got
broken into okay jack my sub pack yeah a
broken got our sub pack and now I have
to go out and buy another one
and you guys if you don't know these
things go for like about 350 so it hurt
it hurt luckily you know those insurance
involved in all that good stuff so
they're gonna hurt is that bad but it
sucks cuz I have to get another one of
these but the thing is I have a really
cool video in mind that I want to do
with this so I have to get another one
so this is something that you can expect
in a future video that I think should be
really really cool but it is the last
thing here this is our little haul over
here this is all the stuff that we got
I think we did pretty good though airy
lots of gaming stuff lots of with us
everything is of course going to be
linked down below in the description
