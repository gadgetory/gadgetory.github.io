consumer and today we've got another
favorite tech of the month this time for
the month of September and for those of
you who aren't familiar with my favorite
tack of the month videos this is pretty
much where I go over some of my favorite
tech that I've been using for the past a
month whether it's older than you and
the first thing I'm going to show you
guys is this guy this is the Acer
predator Helios 300 and sháá-faced are
for sponsoring today's video and I know
it's kind of weird I don't typically put
sponsors on my favorite tech of the
month series but I've been genuinely
enjoying this laptop of the past month
especially since my babies go she's
still gone so this is where I've been
playing all of my PC games and it's been
treating me really well so it felt like
just the right fit for this video and we
can't talk about a gaming laptop without
touching on the specs so this guy is
powered by an Intel Core i7 7700 HQ
processor a gtx 1060 graphics card as
well as 16 gigs of DDR 4 RAM which makes
this thing a beast at gaming I've been
able to play games with Ultra settings
in a lot of departments so it's actually
been awesome to game on it and just
taking a look at this thing guys it
looks like a gaming laptop and I'm ok
with that
it's got this nice black and red color
scheme it even has a red backlit
keyboard which is actually very
comfortable to type on it also has a
really solid and clicky trackpad and if
you're wondering about the i/o we've got
a couple of ports on the right side
you've got your port for power as well
as two USB ports and a headphone jack
and on the left side you've got an
Ethernet port a USB type-c port for USB
3.1 as well as an HDMI port a 3.0 USB
port and an SD card slot so pretty much
whatever you need to connect to this guy
you're gonna be able to do that now
something I like about this is that it's
actually user upgradeable you have 256
gigs of solid-state storage and if you
want to update that there's a base so
that you can add an SSD or hard drives
whatever capacity you want right into
the system you can also change it from
16 gigs to 32 gigs and it's a pretty big
laptop it's got a 15.6 inch IPS display
and it's in 1080p which is good enough
for a gaming laptop on a small screen
like this 1080p is just fine
the games I've been playing like The
Witcher 3 have looked really awesome
been playing for my old school games
like grandia to hit that thumbs up if
you know what I'm talking about and
you've also got access to the Xbox app
so if you have any Xbox there's little
games you can actually play them right
over here that's probably one of my
favorite things about windows and having
the Xbox you can play your games between
the two systems so that's really awesome
it's been really smooth guys this is
replace my my baby that's missing for
right now and it's been actually
treating me really well and it's just a
little bit over a thousand bucks which
if you think about it is a really good
deal there are a lot of laptops out
there that cost that much but can't
handle this kind of performance so this
is a very solid deal and I'm glad I got
my hands on it and next up we've got a
pic from both me and Ari let me
introduce you to the scooter board now
you guys know I love my electric
skateboards
I have like the booster board and Z
board and actually now have a prototype
of the scooter board now this isn't
officially out yet there's a Kickstarter
campaign of it going on right now of
course have a link down below in the
description I think there's like an
early bird special if you want to join
in early but let me tell you guys about
this thing this obviously looks like a
scooter but it also functions kind of
like a skateboard so the same way you
would balance on a skateboard it's just
like that but you now have this handle
to kind of help you with some turns do
some kind of movement just like this
it's actually very very fun it took me
some time to learn it I'm not gonna lie
to you guys but I think I'm getting the
hang of it and I've actually really been
enjoying this I've been enjoying it even
more than I am she's gotten way better
at this than I have and the reason why I
think area like so much is with those
electric skateboards it some time a
little bit intimidating especially if
you've never been on a skateboard before
but with something like this
you get a little bit more balance and
you can hold on to the handle and it's
got a pretty easy system to use too so
basically the way you use it is you want
to kick off and give it a little push
and when you do that you can actually
hit the accelerator right here which is
just like a little trigger and then you
can just take off and go really simply
and whenever you want to stop there are
two ways to do that
you got your electronic brake right here
which is just a switch that you can
tap down and there's a mechanical break
which is just like a regular scooter you
just hit it there and you're stopped
moving now in terms of speed the finger
that's a fifteen point five miles per
hour and it has about a seven point five
mile range which is very very decent
Aries been though and really Manning
this guy yeah you know you're right so
if you want to carry it I'm gonna cut
you off baby
but all you do is bring this thing up
and then you fold it down and boom you
just take it with you wherever you want
to go but like I said guys this is the
prototype the final version is going to
be coming out once the Kickstarter
campaign is over I can't wait to get my
hands up well I'm sure Ari can't wait to
get her hands on it I'm gonna be
sticking with the prototype I think it's
going for about 400 or 500 bucks
depending on what you get and all
together that's way cheaper than an
electric skateboard which goes for like
a grand if you want one of the good ones
booster boards expensive yeah so this is
awesome
definitely take the links below now over
here I've got something that kind of
changed up the game for me so this is
the hyperdrive for the MacBook Pro now
this is a USB type-c hub or a
Thunderbolt hub rather and this has
actually taken place of the hutu hub
that I used and the Satechi hub now this
is like the Satechi hub on steroids
because it uses both ports and
structurally this is actually a better
option than the Satechi because it takes
both of those ports and gives you a more
solid fit here now what you get with
this hub is a thunderbolt 2 report so
you get another thunderbolt to report
you get a USB type-c port as well as an
SD card slot and the micro SD card slot
as well as 2 USB 3.0 ports and lastly an
HDMI slot that supports 4k so you've
pretty much got everything you need here
compared to the houtou that I used to
use it's only missing one USB port but
you gain the functionality up
another micro USB and the Thunderbolt 3
port as well as a USB type-c port so
this has been a really solid option if
you have a MacBook Pro one of the new
ones this is what you need to get all
the functionality back that you used to
have before the whole switch up in the
nominal life but now we got to talk
about that last item so over here we
have the Omni 20 by Omni charge this is
probably the most powerful portable
charger that you've ever seen and just
like the name suggests this thing can
charge a ton of different devices from
phones to tablets to even laptops and
this thing is packing twenty thousand
four hundred million F hours I would
have liked to see a bit more but that's
definitely good enough to get all your
devices charged up in terms of ports
you're looking at two USB ports of the
bottom one actually has a charge 3.0
which is awesome if you have one of the
newest devices but what's also nice is
that you have an AC outlet so that if
you want to charge something like your
laptop you can do that I was actually
able to charge the Helios 300 over there
with this guy while gaming select the
juice up pretty quick but I was still
able to get a full charge on it you also
got a DC in and out and this is where
you actually charge it but what's
actually really crazy about this is
right up here on the top you have a
wireless charging pad so if you want to
throw a wireless charging device like
let's say the Galaxy Note 8 throw it up
here and it'll charge it so you can
actually charge about 4 to 5 devices at
once on this guy which is just
mind-boggling and while all those
charging options are cool what's even
cooler is the fact that it has an LED
screen so you can actually see all the
specs on what's going on with your
device and this thing gives you a ton of
information on what's going on with the
device so on the top right you've got
your battery percentage so you know just
how much juice you've got left and you
can even see it in watt hours over on
the left but what's also really nice is
the fact that you can see how long it's
gonna actually take to get this thing to
a full charge while it's charging and
you also got like little status icons so
if your wireless charging it'll show you
a little wireless charging icon as well
as when you're using USB power or the AC
power and when you're charging a lot of
devices or something like a laptop you
don't have to worry about this thing
overheating the screen will let you know
what the battery temperature looks like
but in case it does get hot it also has
built-in fans to kind of get some of
that heat out and while this is a very
robust and versatile portable charger it
retails for about 250 bucks which is
very very expensive I would have liked
to see it have maybe doubled the
capacity maybe 40,000 milliamp hours at
that price range but honestly with
something like this this is all the
portable charger that you're gonna need
it's very awesome but that about wraps
it up for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you did be the cool guy
girl that give this video a thumbs up
I'll catch you guys in the next one till
then it's your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
