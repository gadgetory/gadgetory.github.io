iPhone 6s or 6s Plus well let's take a
look both phones support an almost
identical design to last year's model
however this time around they're made
with a tougher aluminum which makes them
ever slightly thicker and heavier to
protect from possible bending when in
your pocket and we have our good friend
Lu the last phone vendor to thank for it
but the only other difference is you'll
file with this year's s model is of
course the S on the back and the
addition of the new rose gold color but
now that we have a better idea of what
it looks like let's talk about how it
actually feels to use these to the size
you pick is definitely up to you but
there are of course different benefits
between the two in the hands is a pretty
standard experience on both devices
however handling the 6s plus may take
some getting used to
if you aren't used to using big phones
yet and because of the curved design and
the size of the 6s plus it may be a bit
slippery in the hand and trust me you
don't want to drop a large phone like
this a pretty sweet solution is using a
skin like the one I have here from slick
wraps and as you can see I'm sporting
the dope new Imperial trooper skin which
is a great option if you want to avoid
adding the bulk of a case and change the
texture to something a lot less slippery
while still sporting some awesome looks
and I'm not gonna lie to you guys
this skin in particular has really made
me a believer in phone skins I'll of
course have links down below if you guys
want to check them out but using the 6s
feels very natural for all normal things
like texting talking on the phone and
pretty much anything else because it's
right in the sweet spot for phone sizes
the 6s plus is definitely much larger
the and requires a bit more time to get
used to the overall feel of it something
as simple as putting the phones away in
your pocket has slight differences with
the 6s you can throw it in just fine but
with the 6s plus it's a bit more
noticeable but honestly it won't be much
of an issue unless you're wearing tight
pants
the two biggest advantages to owning the
success plus versus the normal success
is of course the bigger 1080p display
it's great for media consumption and
while the 6s doesn't look bad it's still
nicer to have a big screen when watching
your favorite videos or even playing
games
the other advantage is having a bigger
battery with the 6s plus I'd expect to
charge the iPhone 6s towards the end of
a workday but I found that I only need
to charge the 6s plus before bed and I'd
call myself a pretty heavy user now you
might be wondering what's new with these
phones and is it worth upgrading to the
first change you'll find in this year's
models is the a9 processor which is the
same in both phones and this is a spec
bump that allows the phone to be
snappier and handle more intensive
applications the new iPhones are really
fast but you probably won't tell a
difference unless you're comparing it
side-by-side to an older model as
expected the new iPhones are smooth
performers allowing for quick and fluid
use of iOS and you'll have no issues
jumping between apps and making the most
of what I OS has to offer you'll be able
to go about your daily activities with
virtually no lag it also seems like we
have a much faster touch ID sensor which
sounds great but man has this thing been
annoying to me don't get me wrong I love
touch ID but if you have a ton of
notifications waiting for you and you'd
like to check them on your lockscreen if
you wake your phone with your thumb
it'll register it so quickly that you'll
miss the notifications and you'll have
to go into the notification drop-down in
order to see them it's not a big deal
since you can wake the phone with the
power button but if you're used to using
your thumb like me it can get pretty
frustrating Apple has also upgraded the
camera on both phones to a 12 megapixel
shooter which performs excellently while
the megapixel number may not be as high
as some of the other phones out today it
still produces amazing images and
definitely ranks in my top 3 smartphone
cameras today also with the new camera
is 4k video videos are definitely super
crispy in 4k and with the iPhone 6s plus
you get optical image stabilization
which will help you get smooth video
even while in motion something to keep
in mind though is that you have the 16
gigabyte model you're probably going to
run out of space really quickly
recording a 4k don't buy 16gb
my model and for the selfie takers out
there Apple has introduced a retina
flash this turns our screen into a giant
flash and it's similar to what we've
seen on Mac books and IMAX I rather say
it works pretty well
another cool new feature with the
cameras is the addition of live photos
with this you get to capture a few
moments after the original picture was
taken and it can be pretty cool to see a
bit more than you thought to capture in
your shot now the biggest change will
come across with the new phones is 3d
touch with this you can press the screen
with a bit of pressure and it'll cause
different things to happen depending on
the app your name now keep in mind this
requires actual pressure on the screen
and it's not just the long press this
will give you quick access to certain
features within apps right from your
home screen and to compare with
something we're all familiar with you
can pretty much think of it as a
right-click it of course has different
functions in different apps and a few
examples are being able to preview
emails or text messages without actually
having to open them viewing any live
photos you've taken or even previewing a
picture or someone's account on
Instagram now this might be one of those
features you completely forget about and
never use but I thought that would be
the case with the reach ability feature
and now I wish every big phone I used
had it these are indeed the best iPhones
today but if you're coming from the
iPhone 6 or 6 plus I probably wait till
the iPhone 7 comes out if you're looking
to pick up a new one hopefully you
enjoyed the video and if you did be the
cool guy that gives it a thumbs up I'll
catch you in the next one till then it's
your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
