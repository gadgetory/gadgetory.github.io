want to let you guys know that this
channel was made with the average
consumer in mind all right let's get to
another tech video hey was going on
everyone is your average consumer this
is my girlfriend hola and today we will
not be doing a girlfriend test we
actually have a video for you asking you
guys for feedback on some products or
you know tech related stuff that you
guys would like to see reviewed or test
it or anything like that on this channel
yeah we just want to UM be able to
review products and make videos that are
relevant to you so that you're actually
interested in what we're talking about
and actually can go out and purchase
these things that you that you want to
see definitely and now since I met about
our fifteen hundred plus subscribers I'd
like to you know reach out to some
companies and pretty much request
products and stuff and I just want say
thanks to you guys for subscribing and
making this kind of thing possible so
I'm going to be reaching out to these
companies and asking them for products
that you guys want to see yourselves so
just leave a comment below and let us
know what you want to see in these
videos and if you happen to see a
comment already posted about an item
that you want to see just make sure that
you comment below that and thumbs it up
so that we all see it and that we know
that there are multiple people
interested in a particular item yeah
definitely the more people who ask for a
second product the easier it will be to
get that from you know any company who
wants to lend them out for review and
also for the girlfriend test make sure
you write a comment about what let me be
a girl for a new roommate does that
annoys you and sometimes yet you like to
block out so that i can try and see if
it blocks if it gets blocked out yeah
that's definitely a pretty good idea so
you guys have a couple of things to do
here if you would like feel free to let
us know what you want to see reviewed
feel free to thumbs up or also comment
on someone else's idea and let us know
your ideas on the girlfriend test and
what you would like to see us try out
there and I'm pretty much that's it guys
we just want to get some feedback from
you guys
and really get whatever you guys want
out there out there yep and we even have
a lot of fun with this so just thanks
