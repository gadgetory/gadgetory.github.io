freedoms Jaybirds latest Bluetooth
earbuds but this time with a bit of a
different form factor than we're used to
seeing now let's take a look at what you
get when you pick up a pair of course
you get some nice packaging but inside
you're greeted with earbuds and it's
charging block which also functions as
an additional power source but we'll
talk about that later look a little
deeper and you'll also find a carrying
case and some paperwork if you want to
learn all the ins and outs of it we've
got some goodies inside of the carrying
case like extra ear tips in the form of
silicone tips and comple foam tips
you also get ear fins to keep them in
place a tiny micro USB cable and a few
clips I'll put just the length of the
cable all of this is pretty standard for
j-bert includes in their packaging
nowadays now packaging aside let's talk
about the design of the freedoms these
have a radically different design than
the blue buds X and the X 2's and they
come in four different colors Carbon
gold blaze and ocean the earbuds have a
much smaller footprint but it's actually
a gift and a curse the portion that goes
into your ear is very easy to work with
and allows it to feel really lightweight
because of the decreased size the remote
is now quite a bit larger and that's
where we start to have our problem it
has all the functions you'd expect like
a play and pause button volume controls
a mic and even some charging pins on the
back that give it the ability to charge
on the go what sucks is that the remote
is now a lot heavier which causes a
problem when you're moving around a lot
or you're working out with normal
activity these fit in the ear very
easily and tend to stay put but when I
tried working out with them the right
side with the remote constantly felt my
ear from the movement I tried using the
included wingtips and while they did
help
they didn't completely solve my problem
I was ready to write these office
earbuds not suited for very active
workouts until I tried using them with
comple foam tips these ear tips are
awesome because you can alter the shape
of them as you press down on it
and this means it will conform to the
shape of your ear canal allowing for a
much better fit with easing I found the
comfort and stability I was looking for
even without the wingtips and guys this
is why I like to stress finding the
right ear tips that work for you when
you're using in ear buds while I'm glad
I found the solution to keeping these in
I'll also warn you guys to be careful of
leaving these around your neck if you
let them just chill there without being
in your ear and you end up moving around
decide what the remote can potentially
slide down your neck fall off and you
may not notice so be careful one thing
to note though is that the build quality
of the freedoms is really good these
feel as premium as you'd expect
and since j-bird made these I'm really
confident in its durability the
bluebloods X and the X 2's have been
impressive in that department so I'd
expect the same here
now let's talk about some of the
features this guy's packing of course
since these are Bluetooth earbuds you'll
be pairing it wirelessly to your devices
and it has some very good range so you
don't have to hug your device to keep
listening to your audio another feature
we've got to talk about is the ability
to charge these on the go with the
included charging cable you can attach
this to the remote and even if it isn't
plugged in it'll charge your ear buds
think of it as a portable charger for
the freedoms this can extend battery
life from 4 hours up to 8 hours which
basically doubles it now this is cool
and all but like I said before the
remote can be a little bit heavy so
heading this on to such a lightweight
pair of earbuds can make it a bit iffy
for casual use like sitting back and
listening or even walking around the bit
won't be much of a problem but if you
plan on being active while this thing is
attached forget about it
it'll just be too heavy to comfortably
keep the right side in place weight
issues aside it's pretty cool to be able
to charge these without having to keep
the earbuds plugged into a wall another
warning though the charging clip is
pretty small which makes it easy to
forget or misplace if you forget to
bring this on a trip
be out of luck if they die on you now I
actually took the freedoms with me on my
honeymoon but I forgot the charging dock
and I ended up not being able to use
these as much as I wanted to but the
freedoms have two features that I'm
really in love with first being
multipoint what this feature does is it
allows you to pair the freedoms with two
devices simultaneously so if you've got
this pair to your phone and your
computer you can listen to your computer
and answer a phone call without having
to switch over or disconnect anything
and this is a feature I think every
bluetooth headphone should have I was
introduced to something like this
feature in years ago with some random
earbuds I had back in the day but never
saw it again in any of the devices that
have been made lately but I'm super glad
a top earbud grand like jaybird is
implementing it into its devices the
second feature I love is actually the
companion app and I love this because
you can completely customize the sound
that you get out of videos you have your
signature profile which is the default
but you can also pick between a few more
profiles like bring the base R&amp;amp;B jams
and quite a few more you've also got
some featured profiles from some
athletes that jaybird is partnered with
if you want to see what kind of sound
they're into you can also download other
profiles if you want to try out
something new what I like about these
profiles is that you can customize them
to fit your taste or the music you're
currently listening to to get the best
matching salad out of these you can save
your customized profile so you can use
them whenever you want and what's really
awesome about the freedoms is that the
firmware updates with in the earbuds
themselves so when you choose a new
profile you can bring that customize
sound over to any device that you
connect the freedoms to so if you like
based add as much as you want save it
and you're good to go
if you appreciate vocals a bit more you
can bring those up too it may take a
little tweaking to find exactly what you
like but it's definitely worth the
experimenting if you want some amazing
sound quality that works for you now
I've been a bit hard on these in certain
aspects
but do they get my recommendation they
definitely do these are amazing ear buds
with some excellent features and
technology I do have issues with the
weight of the remote and a few
complaints about the charging system but
those honestly aren't deal-breakers to
me if you're looking to have these be
your workout your buds and plan to do a
lot of movement like running or jumping
being Yuri of the weight issues when
you're making your purchasing decision
but your experience may be very
different from mine so don't be afraid
to try out these awesome earbuds because
to be honest with you these are what I
use on a daily basis whenever I'm on the
go and I actually like them so much I
want to give away a pair to one of you
guys so if you want in on this giveaway

so you can get details on how to answer
and I'll of course have my page linked
down below in the description as well as
