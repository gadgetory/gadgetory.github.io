and this is ari Hait and today we have
another Best Buy shopping challenge this
time with a budget of 500 bucks so
basically what's gonna happen in this
video is we're gonna go into Best Buy we
are going to be shopping around seeing
hey that's be better haul and you guys
are gonna judge afterwards with a poll
and let us know who got the better stuff
twenty minutes spent $500 let's see what
is that increasing taxes yes that
includes types okay alright guys so
we're here 20 minutes on the timers so
my thought is I'm thinking I'm gonna go
for this time around instead of a bunch
of little cool things I'm gonna go for
one big item and then you know a couple
of smaller good things alright so I
already know re-scope doubt the place
and found things that she wanted to buy
I know she's a cheater like that but I
got 500 bucks I got some room to work
with so we're in the PC section I know
you PC nerds love accessories
I'm just kidding I think you see nerds
please don't dock me points I love you
all so much
oh that name sounds really cool
dark core like that has to be bombed so
let's do this dark core RGB now I know
this brand usually makes those light-up
charging cables those are always really
nice ah here we go
so these are light up charging cable but
this one's micro USB
nobody needs micro USB anymore the thing
is like I know like he's sitting there
confident and he's been talking all this
smack this morning and I gets in my head
you know monitors Myra's are good let's
see we can get in terms of monitor 60
Hertz are frustrate I don't think that's
good I should be like 1 4
okay 144 okay we could probably do that
we gotta get something audio related
though that's a must always got to have
some audio so we got some Sony earbuds
over here I see savings I see a good
thing neck band design I don't know if
everybody's crazy about the neck band
design like I am look at this Peter
wants to look at more products oh my
gosh I hope he's not getting headphones
guys typical hmm get some creativity in
your life Oh pokemons a hit right now
maybe I need to buy something Pokemon
related Pokemon let's go okay so now we
are in the right section here we have
Nintendo and all the gaming stuff and
per my calls on where we frame the pass
okay so we're at the Nintendo section so
I'm gonna do what I plan on doing if you
vote for me I'll give it away Oh a
Nintendo classic hmm maybe the PS the
PlayStation classic oh let's try finder
let's try to find that what is an
attendance which game with that Nintendo
switch let's see if they have any here
come on PlayStation classic if I could
get that that's gotta give me some
points
oh come on I don't see you guys
well my plan oh what a nice gaming
headset Astro eight tens of course I
have to drop something right
boom got the Nintendo switch guys I mean
how can I not win what is he gonna get
that beat this TV see got it
let's go now I'm gonna hide this one cuz
I want to cheat there we go Oh does it
have it for switch oh okay thank you so
much guys I'm gonna win I have for
tonight I have a switch I have super
smash brothers or Bros ultimate whatever
it's called there's no way and I'm
giving it all away so I have to win
right now you just stop the video click
a little eye and vote for me okay so let
me just update you guys I got some Intel
from my boy Malcolm over here we're
working as a team and apparently forte
is free so scratch that we will not be
doing for tonight and pay 30 bucks for
it
this was only 30 so 220 Oh
so that automatically puts me out of
this the Nintendo switch conversation so
I don't know adding a Nintendo switch
that kind of sucks
but uh
you know it is what it is it's a cool
North Face backpack right here oh you
could just have it all open when you go
to the airport oh man this might be the
one it's an investment though this is a
hundred and twenty bucks 130 bucks
I'm really really calmed now suddenly
once I have this box in my hand I'm
spending a lot of time in the game oh
she got a freaking sweats oh that's it
I see that switch easy move to make a
few second guesses that sorts No oh my
god all right
and we're back here so now I'm gonna put
back this mouse I have no business with
this eight thousand milliamp hour
portable charger with qi wireless
charging so you don't even need a cable
as long as you have this and a phone
that supports wireless charging all
right I'm gonna get this because that's
that's a bit cooler oh this way to have
three minutes I need to hurry up okay
we've got oh my god all right okay 57
seconds holy mess and I spent $80 really
fast
oh snap guys 30 seconds so I don't think
that she can look for as many timing but
I don't know okay a phone holder there
you go
the call of doom time's up cheer let's
go I'm done a whole
what is that three things I think he
said a win so as hall Ares Hall looks
very meager it looks so weak so reading
this up and I'm still gonna search for
my coupon I think I have a $10 off
coupon so let's see if I can find it
suddenly my phone was to act up when the
stakes are high but I think I think we I
think we did okay I'm annoyed by seeing
that Nintendo switch I'm not gonna lie
oh my god no I'm gonna get a mission so
I'm under budget so it's my 475 so let's
do what step 425 can I put the remainder
to st. Jude 5:16 hold on I got a I got a
drop something
this is there oho this is coming off 505
alright guys so we went over
by five dollars I think we're doing all
right though
all right guys it's time you don't feel
confident oh I guess we do it one by one
right got it echo dot listen 30 bucks
very inexpensive why not grab a 30 bucks
$500 budget easy
oh that's the one you picked up at the
register after we ran out of time I love
you D so you know got that pocket I got
here and Astro a10 gaming headset yeah
40 bucks inexpensive it's the budget not
cheap
good go with like the best things
because you got like so dang cool like
well yeah they tend to switch of course
I have 500 dollars to spend so why not
get into the switch I'm going for
quality guys over it's the BSA he always
picks out though but this is a cop-out
move of course everybody love it's worth
and you put a lot of eggs in one basket
baby for all those folks out there who
don't care about the switch mmm you guys
know what to do with those voting
fingers though all right
this which is a good buy it's a freaking
switch of course it's nice but I know
you don't got much left in your bag so I
might have to go back to back on you all
right
like I have for the last couple of
videos here we have guys the PlayStation
Classic for all my folks out there who
grew up on the PlayStation the original
one we got the classic here 20 games
built right into it only a hundred bucks
arcade games this is that's the whole
point that is the entire point 2k the
old games
it's the classic re you really want to
hold on
okay so here's what I saw I kind of like
pecan I saw him pick us up but my
thought is like this must not be hot
because it's not sold out it was
released this week right and most was
known Silvo first came out its first
week you can invite you can find this
thing at all $1,000 for their hands on
it please you got that I got this and a
lot more so let me continue chorus had
to get some earbuds why not Bluetooth
earbuds only 40 bucks that's an ugly
neck band we don't even like that that's
bad guys anytime you review something
with that alunite band you guys trash
yes they do
yes they do okay you don't pull out your
next thing what else you die the next
thing I got this is really smart guys
you know the pre-order I got super smash
bros ultimate okay coming out December
7th and I said you know what we pick
this up we preorder it and I was very
smart and strategic because ended up not
even being sixty bucks I made five bucks
you just paid for the pre-order yeah so
you don't you don't even have the game
yet but you don't you don't have the
game basically layaway guys let's yeah I
got I got even a chromecast for the
folks who don't have one over and over
on the channel okay well next I picked
to go with this which this is the last
thing for the switch friends but the
last thing I picked up to go with this
which is an amiibo Kirby of course with
super innocence you go all in all in
with Nintendo yeah with Super Smash Bros
ultimate you can choose one of your
character and you have it immutable
right there it's your character you want
to pick a thing that you want to win if
I were to give it away
we're giving away so you want this whole
or this Hall I don't know and you guys
you know those uh lineup cables every
time I post one of these in video you
guys like oh what's that light of cable
how's it lighting up so cool we got a
light up USB type-c charging cable you
guys I would love for you to continue I
would love for me to continue and we
also of course have a portable charger
now this is a cool portable charger
because not only is it an eight thousand
milliamp
no charger but this guy also has
wireless charging built right into it so
go ahead and um I guess we just showed
like for probable charges in last week's
video
mm-hmm yesterday's video actually sorry
guys
Oh are we done are you done so this
thing has wireless charging built right
into it like 50 bucks
okay oldie but a goodie I got the N ones
you know wireless headphones I think
these were on sale
199 $120 this was on Jen's way dollars
yes yeah these are like my favorite so
in case you want to keep it you know
I'll give you that I love these so I
gotta give it to you but like that's all
you got
like honestly forget the lair where
items forget the stupid doll forget the
pop socket oh come on and we're not even
done so the commuters out there we also
have this North Face backpack this
backpack is legit guys tons of
compartments this thing feels solid look
at that but again I urge you guys to
just think about this if you were to get
one of these halls whose home would you
want and I will also say that I was they
also donated money so I came under
budget oh let's let's plot the receive
four hundred and seventy five dollars at
first is it for 273 anything something
like that and then I just donated the
residual to the saint-jean fund the
entire thing the entire thing so now I'm
adding even 500 bucks well
oh you aren't over I win no you do yes I
do
I went over five what happened last time
yeah but you didn't call them even call
it along no no but everyone else did you
call it a loss no but but you went
over-budget quite a bit there's only
five dollars there's only five bucks
yeah average consumer only five dollars
a lot of money oh that's a subway you
look at all of it but you guys know what
to do it is time to vote the pole is
gonna be up yeah the winner I icon and
