what's going on guys your average
consumer and today we've got another
favorite tech of the month video this
time for the month of April now for my
new folks out there this is pretty much
where I talk about some of my favorite
tech that I've been using recently
whether it's old or new but this is what
I've been liking in the month of April
now I skipped last month because
honestly there wasn't anything that I
was enjoying that was new that I haven't
already told you guys about so we
skipped it and this time we got some
cool stuff I don't usually make a big
deal about phone cases and even include
them in my favorite tech of the month
but these guys from Paducah actually
sent this over to my P o box yes I know
I didn't save it for the massive tech
unboxing but when I opened it up checked
it out I was actually really surprised
by how much I liked it now I know on
first glance it looks like your typical
carbon fiber looking case but it
actually has some pretty interesting
qualities now the first thing I really
like about this guy is the overall feel
in the hand with this it doesn't feel
like my phone's wearing a big bulky case
this is actually really really slim and
what's great about it even though it's
got a really slim design it's made out
of bulletproof materials not to say that
it's bulletproof
but those bulletproof materials
definitely help in terms of durability
so it's very low profile fits nicely in
the hand and I could just throw it into
my pocket with no issue not a big bulky
case and I like that now something else
I really like about this is that even
though it's got this really slim design
it's got magnetic plates embedded into
it so if you have those charging mounts
in your car where it's magnetic and you
just want to put it on there you don't
have to have an extra metal plate in the
back the case has a built in which is
really nice and it doesn't add any bulk
now something I'm not so crazy about
with this case is the actual top so if
you can see over here it's actually
exposed at the top I'm not crazy about
that because if this thing happens to
fall face-first there's no real
protection there and I'm also afraid of
scratches with the iPhone 10 you've got
the stainless steel edges which can get
scratched up so if you're rocking a
silver one you definitely want to be
careful so I'm not really crazy about
that Pitta cut if you're listening make
one that cover is the entire top I would
love that the packaging also came with a
tempered glass screen protector so that
is a nice bonus if you need
one so huge shout-out to petaca or
katika for sending this out I like this
a lot more than I thought I would and
I'll have it linked down below in the
description as well as everything else
mentioned in this video now moving on to
something that's kind of changed the
game for me
this is the elgato stream deck now this
thing is basically a tool with a bunch
of programmable buttons each button has
a display so that you can see what you
have programmed to it and I really
really like this now it is not for
everyone but if you are a streamer or
someone who makes content this thing
could be a really really great tool so
to give you a bit about how this thing
works
each button like I said is programmable
so you can have it set to launch
applications or do keystrokes or even
open folders on your computer you pretty
much have a ton of control on this guy
so you can have access to things for the
press of a single button so if I wanted
to launch an application something like
Lightroom I can just press that button
and you see immediately on the computer
it pops up and I was editing a picture
of the stream deck on Instagram and
there you go that's it but just like
that what that press of the button there
goes my program now for a program that's
already open
if I hit Final Cut Pro it takes me right
to it and something that's cool about
the stream deck is that you can have it
do a ton of different functions whenever
you press a certain button so whenever I
launch the Final Cut application I
actually switched to a second profile
and with this I have a ton of different
keys set up but if you want to have a
tool that speeds up your workflow this
thing is a really really good buy and it
even comes with this cool little stand
so that you can position it however you
want you can get the right angle for you
whatever works for you whatever your
style is I'd really really like that
thing now you guys know I don't always
talk about hardware when it comes to
favor attack of the month sometimes I
talk about apps and games right now I've
got a cool piece of software that I
think pretty much anybody will enjoy so
if you guys are familiar with stream
there's a pretty cool app called
wallpaper engine that allows you to
change your background to moving
backgrounds so it has animated
backgrounds so if you like live
wallpapers or anything like that this
thing gives you that
and there is a huge library of things to
use so right now you guys can see the
wallpaper that I'm using but I can
easily change that up to something like
this and I can still just use the
computer normally this thing that just
runs in the background I can just jump
into another program and it not be a big
deal now what's great is that if you're
using something like you're playing a
game or something that's really resource
intensive thing actually shuts down in
the background so it's not eating up
your memory or bogging down your machine
so I kind of like that and check this
out there's even wallpapers that kind of
follow your mouse so you can interact
with them and I kind of like that now
something you might notice is that I've
got two keyboards over here and a few
mice but I like to test out products at
once I usually have my favorite sticking
around while I'm testing out others but
this right here is the Corsair k63
wireless mechanical keyboard and that's
what makes it special usually you don't
find mechanical keyboards that are
Wireless but this one is by Corsair and
it's actually really nice it's got
cherry MX red switches so get that fast
typing you don't get those clicks that
you get with the cherry Browns that has
more of a clicky feel to it
but the Reds are pretty quick now I like
this because one the colors dope but not
only that but it feels nice it gives you
access to all the controls that you
would need it's a mechanical keyboard
and it's wireless so it's a good look
but one thing that's really awesome
about this is that it has an accessory
that allows you to take this thing away
from your computer desk so right here
we've got the k63 Wireless and this is
the corsair lap board and with this you
can basically take the k63 Wireless and
dock it in and then of course you're
gonna want to lock it in place
so that this keyboard doesn't slip out
and then you can pretty much take this
thing away from your desk and it is a
lap board so it's got this nice cushion
in the back so when you're putting it on
your lap it feels nice and comfortable
and what's really nice about this is
that it's got an include
mousepad built in on the side so if you
want to do some gaming away from your
computer you've got that option now over
here I've got the corsair dark core now
corsair is obviously not the sponsor of
today's video but I got this thing when
I Trump Ari in our shopping challenge so
I definitely got to get my use out of
this
uh-huh but right here you guys pretty
much can see the setup now what makes
this thing awesome for me is look at my
computer I've got a three monitor setup
so I can take this guy and basically
have the full experience of being able
to play on all three monitors away from
the desk and then I'll be able to kind
of take in everything that's happening
on all three screen and if you got a
chair with arms it's even better because
then you can just throw it over here
kind of enjoy yourself get to play in so
if you've got a triple monitor set up
that you want to take complete advantage
of like I do this is actually really
really nice alright guys so right here
we've got Marshalls mid anc headphones
active noise-cancelling for those of you
who don't know but it's inside of this
nice travel case which I've never seen
one like this before so kudos to
Marshall for making this pretty unique
and when you open it up inside its got
like this velvet material which is very
nice and smooth in the hand so it feels
very premium but let's talk about the
headphones so here we have them these
are Marshalls made a and C which is
active noise-cancelling now this
features an on-ear design so when you
throw it on it looks just like this and
I gotta say it's pretty compact you guys
saw me pull it out of the case this
thing can get pretty small so I'm a fan
of that it makes it really easy to take
this around since it's so portable now
it's great and probably a must these
days is that these are bluetooth
headphones which means you're going to
be able to connect it to any device that
you want regardless of whether or not it
has a headphone jack but if it does
Marshall also includes a 3.5 millimeter
cables which actually looks really
really nice now something that I like
that Marshall did is they kept the
buttons and controls to a minimum so
right here we've got the main control
and power button so you can just kind of
hold it down to power this thing on but
it also works as a
so if you push it up you get your volume
up push your down volume down and then
if you hit it left and right you're able
to skip between tracks and right here
you've got the active noise-cancelling
switch that you can turn on or off but
that active noise-cancelling is
definitely solid if you want to just
focus on your music the headband is made
out of the soft microfiber material so
it feels very comfortable and you've got
this PU leather on the ear cups as well
so comfort definitely not an issue feels
really good so I think they made some
pretty nice material choices but the
important thing is how do they sound I
gotta say they sound pretty good they've
got a nice punchy base to them which I
really love you guys know me I love me
some bass and even though you got that
nice punchy bass you're not missing out
on any clarity here but this isn't a
full review if you guys want to check
out the mid ANC's by Marshall definitely
check the link down below in the
description so again huge shout out to
Marshall for sending these out but that
about wraps it up for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy girl that gives this video
a thumbs up and let me know what cool
tech you've been messing around with
lately maybe there's a cool piece of
tech that I need to go ahead and take a
look at let me know what's a comment
down below but for the next one guys is
your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
