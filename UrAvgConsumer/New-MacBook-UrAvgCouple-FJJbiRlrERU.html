guy's headlights he's been following us
for quite a few miles now at least 30 40
minutes the same John out of the high
surviving it this is an hour drive by
standard base with the mirror it's like
I am right look at this can this was
driving crazy trying to bigger ride with
we let him
pass us and he was tailgating some car
not going fast so we jumped in a bit he
jumps out of the lane
really bizarre he just doesn't want to
separate from this good
you'll see he followed us Wow yeah this
guy is definitely just trying to stop

back out okay maybe holding your right
Peter to pay we can press once for some
contacts you can tap on one go back like
if you want to like send somebody a
thing yes they are
oh yeah I keep forgetting that you have
to tap it's kind of confusing to be
honest I mean those are a lot of
gestures you'll have to learn yeah you
guys can definitely expect some videos
on this guy I actually do have the Space
Gray coming in and I think it looks
really good now I don't know how how
great is going to be as a fully
functional laptop to use on a daily
