consumer and this is my top 5 favorite
headphones 3.0 now notice I said my top
5 favorite headphones
I'm not calling these the best because
sound is subjective and what may be the
best to me may not be the best to you so
hey let's not wasting time let's get
right into it and kickstart this list at
number 5 we have the Sony mdr-1r
headphones now these are a very classy
looking pair of headphones as you can
see here I have the brown and silver
version but there's also the black in
red which I think also looks really
great now these are well-constructed
sony did a really good job with design
also the ear cushions are very soft so
these are also very very comfortable
the only real downfall with design is
that it isn't completely foldable you
can get these flat however and throw
them in a bag so it's still portable but
not as portable as I would have liked
now when it comes to sound quality these
don't match my bassy preference as the
bass on these is definitely toned down a
bit but it does have some great sound
quality and where it really excels is in
the vocal Department so if you're
listening to music with a lot of singing
or anything with some vocal work it'll
definitely perform very well now what I
like about these is that they provide a
nice contrast and some variety to my
collection and as you guys know I love
bass and it's nice to step out of that
every once in a while and really get
down with the vocals and the 1r retails
for about 200 dollars on Amazon as of
the recording of this video and I'll
have links down below in the description
if you want to check them out and I'll
have links for all the headphones listed
in this video but they retail for about
$200 on Amazon and I've seen them as low
as 160 so depending on the day you go
for it you might find it a bit cheaper
but it's definitely a great value great
pair of headphones great looking great
comfort great sound and as long as
you're not looking for a ton of bass
you'll definitely enjoy the performance
on these and that's why we have the Sony
mdr-1r
at number five and for number four on
this list we have the bear dynamic
custom one Pro and these are probably
the most versatile headphones
on this list and they definitely live up
to the custom in their name the custom
one pros have an interesting design
they're not the most compact pair of
headphones they're actually a bit on the
larger side but what's interesting about
them is that you can actually switch out
just about every component on the
headphone and tailor it to be your own
so you can switch out the headband the
ear cushions the plates on the ear cups
just about everything to make it look
like something of your own creation in
my review of these I showed you guys
that you can switch this out to look
like a completely different pair of
headphones I think that's a really
awesome feature that you can customise
it down to this level better dynamic
also offers a boom mic cable so that you
can actually use this as a gaming
headset or maybe use it for video calls
whatever you want to do it offers a ton
of versatility and that's one of my
favorite things about the headphones now
one of the craziest things is that it
has customizable sound quality
now with the custom one Pro you can
actually use these sliders found on the
back that actually increase the bass
depending on what level you push it to
so you can go from absolutely no bass to
quite a bit of bass at the highest level
and you can adjust it to where you want
to be so whether or not you're a bass
lover you can adjust these to fit your
preference and what's really awesome is
that you can actually use this for
different genres so if you want to
listen to rap and hip-hop one day and
you want a ton of bass you can do that
and if you want to tone down the bass
listen to some classical boom you've got
that option as well these retail for
about 178 on Amazon right now which is
an awesome awesome deal because this is
a like I said a very versatile pair of
headphones the only problem is that
they're a bit on the larger side I
probably wouldn't go outside with these
because of the size but they are great
and I have tons of uses for them indoors
and that's how we have them at number
four and for number three on this list
we have the Logitech UE 9000 s now the
UE 9000 our Bluetooth headphones and you
guys know I love wireless headphones
because they're convenient portable and
they offer controls that you don't have
to actually touch your device in order
to use so you can actually play and
pause rewind tracks fast-forward all
that good stuff right from the
headphones themselves now some people
might think it's a little bit bulky but
I actually love the design I think it
has a premium look and feel to it and
the ear cups are just solid and comfort
I can wear these for long periods of
time and not even notice that I'm using
them especially without a cable but
what's awesome about these headphones is
that even though it's bluetooth you can
actually plug in the cable and use it
without any power so if you run out of
battery or maybe you just don't want to
use bluetooth you can plug it in and
still listen to your music without an
issue and the sound quality is still
there
and speaking of sound quality the UE
9000 has definitely hit home for me as
it offers a ton of bass when it's
powered on and even when it's not
powered on the basses withdrawn a bit
but it still sounds great so you kind of
get the best of both worlds but if
you're really not a fan of the bass you
can just turn it off plug in the cable
and still get some awesome sound quality
from them so like I said best of both
worlds and I'm really really happy with
the UT 9000 you can find them for about
a hundred and ninety dollars on Amazon
right now which is actually pretty good
coming from the $400 price point that it
used to be but now the only thing with
this is that it might be a little bit
harder to find
since Logitech is discontinued it so if
you're able to pick one up I definitely
suggest grabbing it it's a great pair of
headphones and definitely one of my
favorites and that's why we have the
Logitech UE 9000 at number three and for
number two on this list we have the
audio technica ath m50x now if you've
heard of the EM 50s this should come as
no surprise to you these are amazing
headphones and they come at a great
value now this is the m50x which is the
upgraded version now I like the EM 50s
but the m50x fixed about everything that
I found wrong with the originals so now
it features a detachable cable and that
was one of my problems with the original
it had a built-in cable that was really
long very cumbersome it wasn't really
portable but now with the m50x you have
detachable cables and audio technica
provides three different kinds of cables
so you've got a coiled cable a very long
cable and a very short cable that can be
used with like mobile devices if you
want to take it outdoors so this is one
of the best improvements that audio tech
maker could have made to the M 50s
because being portable is something
that's really important to me and the
m50 zarnow that so it's pretty awesome
that Audio Technica went from selling
different models of the m50 to selling
one that can be used as any of the
previous models so definitely kudos to
Audio Technica
and another area that they improved upon
is actually the comfort I never had any
real comfort issues with the originals
but the m50x are just a lot more
comfortable and the ear cushions are
made of a soft leather --is-- kind of
material that sits nicely on the ears
instead of the harder paper ish feel of
the originals so this is definitely a
very welcomed improvement and I'm happy
to say that the sound quality has not
changed on these at all and that's
really a good thing
em 50s had great clarity sounds really
good definitely well balanced sound now
the only thing with them for me is that
they didn't have that much bass but if
you want an overall well-balanced sound
these are definitely the way to go and I
actually use these a ton for editing and
all tons of purposes outside of just
using them for music so they have a ton
of applications and that's really great
and you guys can tell by now that I love
versatility and the m50x is
well-balanced sound definitely offers
that so you've got well-balanced sound a
very rugged build quality these things
can definitely hold up to some abuse
they're pretty portable they can
actually fold up pretty well and you can
store these and take them wherever you
want with you and they've got a ton of
options as far as cables go so these
definitely earn the number two spot on
my list and you can find them for about
one hundred and sixty-seven dollars on
Amazon right now and that's about thirty
to forty dollars more than the originals
but I definitely think it's worth the
investment I picked these over the
originals any day and that's why we have
it at number two and now it's time for
the number one pick on this list the
head honcho and that goes to the V motor
cross fade em 100 now these are one of
the best headphones I've gotten to use
so far as a total package they're
everything that I'm looking for these
offer some amazing build quality they're
built like a tank and B motor goes
through a ton of testing to make sure
that these things are very durable so
they're a great long-term investment and
one of my favorite things about these is
that they offer options options options
they've got three different colors we've
got the shadow black matte black and
white silver and we can take it a step
further with the colors by adding a
different color faceplate you can
actually switch up to any color
faceplate that you want and you can even
throw in your own
pictures any kind of designs on the face
play and kind of make it your own design
your own creation as you can see I have
you AC reviews plastered all over my
headphones and that to me is just
amazing that I can customize these and
kind of promote myself and it looks good
at the same time so definitely hats off
to V motive for putting out such an
excellent design and great customizable
options and you can actually use these
in a ton of applications just like some
of the previous headphones that I've
mentioned
yumoto offers a boom mic cable so that
you can plug these in and use them as a
gaming headset and they even offer a
cable so that you can plug this into
your gaming PC and not have any issues
so that is amazing they also offer a
thick long coiled cable so if you are a
DJ and you want to use something a
little bit more sturdy you've got that
as well so there are tons and tons of
options with the v-moda m100 and they
sound great the v-moda m100 to have some
amazing sound quality
you definitely have clarity great vocals
and that tight bass that you're looking
for so for me this is the perfect pair
of headphones I really have no
complaints as far as sound goes and the
build quality my only complaint used to
be the fact that the ear cushions were
really tight on the ear so it's a bit of
an uncomfortable fit but you can
actually also customize the ear cushions
as well
so with the XL ear pad you get a bigger
cushion and it's a lot softer now with
these they automatically became my
number one headphone they moved out the
Sony pulse wireless headset and I'll get
to that in a second but these have
become my number one headphones because
comfort was the only issue that I had
with them in the past and v-moda
presented a way to fix that so I have no
complaints these are just an amazing
pair of headphones and I honestly use
these just about every day they're my
go-to pair of headphones and they really
offer everything that I'm looking for
tons of versatility tons of customizable
options they look amazing
hey I can't complain they retail for
about $300 so they're a bit on the
expensive side but they do offer a nice
ecosystem that you can get into with
upgradable parts like the ear cushions
the blue mics all that kinds of stuff so
it's definitely worth the investment and
they last a long time these are very
durable headphones and I'm just a huge
fan of them and that's why they're my
number
unpaid and that pretty much wraps up my
list guys now I know you're probably
wondering where the heck is his last
number-one this only pulse wireless
headset well I still love those as far
as sound quality goes i love the bass
impact feature and i love the ability to
use them wirelessly but i did find that
over time they did start to crack on me
and a lot of people did complain about
that but it seemed to take me a bit
longer to see the cracks in mine but
eventually they did come and they did
become apparent and that's just a big a
really hard sell for me i can't really
push that as my number one it when it
gets broken and i have to buy another
pair so i had to bump them off the list
and i decided i might as well keep this
as a full headphone list instead of
including a headset so the pulse
wireless headset gets a honorary mention
as one of the best sound qualities for
bass that i've ever experienced and i
still love that as a gaming headset and
that pretty much completes my list but
