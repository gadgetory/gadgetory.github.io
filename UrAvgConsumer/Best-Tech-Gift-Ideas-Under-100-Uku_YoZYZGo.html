consumer and today we're going to be
talking about some awesome tech under
100 bucks
of course right before those holidays
hit but first we're gonna take a look at
a pretty cool piece of tech from the
guys over at Kingston who are coolness
to sponsor today's video this is the
Kingston MobileLite Wireless Pro a
portable charger with some awesome
features it has a built-in SD card and
USB reader that allows you to take your
files and stream them over to your iOS
or Android device using its own wireless
network this is perfect for travelers
who don't want to eat up their device
storage with big files like movies it
also has a built-in 64 gigs of storage
so if you want to backup or even free up
some space on your phone
you can send and keep your files over to
it and it packs a 6700 milliamp hour
battery so it's gonna be able to charge
most phones at least twice I even got
some extra so I can give away to some of
you guys and I'll probably do a giveaway
over on Instagram so check out the
description to learn more about the
MobileLite Wireless Pro and to find out
more about that giveaway and I'll even
have a link to Kingston's YouTube
channel if you guys want to see a bunch
of other cool tech tips but now let's
get to that under 100 lists and first up
on our list is the grip Gear movie maker
set now a lot of people ask me how to
start making videos if they don't have
an expensive camera and I usually tell
them if your smartphone has a decent
camera you should try starting with that
and with this guy you can get some dope
shots with your smartphone
it's a motorized slider with a head that
can move a full 360 degrees and you can
use it horizontally or vertically and
you can even slide it manually if you
don't want to use the included remote if
you have a decent portable charger you
can charge it with that or you can use
two triple A batteries which will give
you up to two hours of recording time so
if you're an aspiring youtuber or you
just want to get some cool shots for
Instagram or maybe as a hobby this is a
great way to get started now we all know
what the new year comes resolutions
about getting healthy and a great piece
of tech to help do that is the Hydra
smart bottle and I'll bet any of you a
dollar that you've never seen a water
bottle with this many features not only
is it a 20 ounce water bottle but it's
also a Bluetooth speaker which you can
remove to play it separately from the
water bottle and it also has a
multicolor LED light and you can use it
to charge your devices through a USB
and it's got a four thousand milliamp
hour battery so it'll charge most phones
at least once and then some all around
this is a really cool water bottle with
a ton of features and it makes a great
gift for somebody who likes to jog or
workout or maybe you just want to take
it to work but a nice bonus here is that
it's well under a hundred bucks I think
I found it in the fifty dollar range
but of course links will be down below
to anything mentioned in this video and
speaking of getting healthy
the Fitbit Alta fitness tracker
complements the smart water bottle very
nicely now we all know the various
Fitbit products but I really like about
the Alta is that unlike Fitbit flex it
has an LCD screen to show your steps the
distance traveled and the time it also
sends you an alert if you've gone too
long without being active to encourage
you to keep moving and a nice bonus is
that it will also show you your text
when you receive them it's a nice step
up from the Fitbit flex and I got it on
Amazon for around 85 bucks and we all
know Amazon's prices like to change so
I'll include the cheapest price I can
find down below in the description now
if you know someone that's obsessed with
great sound but doesn't want to spend an
arm and a leg check out the one more
triple driver headphones now these
earbuds were actually to UM buy a Grammy
award-winning sound engineer so you can
expect them to sound more than okay now
obviously they're called the triple
drivers because they have three drivers
which allow for a crisp and dynamic
listening experience for any genre of
music now of course it comes with an
inline remote that allows you to control
your music and take calls and you also
get some included silicone tips for the
perfect fit now I've personally been
enjoying them and for a hundred bucks
these are definitely a steal now a lot
of you know I dig the Logitech MX master
mouse but I found another Mouse in the
MX line that's pretty impressive this is
the MX anywhere 2 wireless mouse the
biggest selling point with this mouse is
the fact that you can use it pretty much
anywhere and get flawless tracking so
you can put this on a glass table or
wood surface with no problem and this is
perfect for those of you who are on the
go who don't want to travel with a mouse
pad unlike the MX master it can pair
with up to 3 devices at the same time
and you just push a button to switch
between them and no discrimination here
you can use it with Mac or Windows but
with the Logitech software you're able
to customize mouse buttons and the
gestures as you wish so it's a pretty
cool Mouse that I'm excited to put in my
travel back
but that's about it for this video guys
hopefully you enjoyed it if you did be
the cool guy or girl that gives this
video a thumbs up and I'll catch you
guys in the next one till then it's your
average console ma please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
