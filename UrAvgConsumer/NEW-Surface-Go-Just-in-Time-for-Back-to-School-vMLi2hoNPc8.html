consumer and I'm sure everyone's heard
of Microsoft surface products but
they've added a new one to the line
called a surface go now the surface go
looks like it belongs in the surface pro
lineup but in a much smaller body which
makes it really interesting this thing's
got a ten inch screen it's super
lightweight it has a keyboard option so
you can use it like a full-blown laptop
or a tablet ten inches that is tiny this
thing fits in all the tablet
compartments in my backpacks great for
portability thus the name surface go and
this thing's been getting a ton of buzz
if you follow tech on social media or
read any tech blogs but I got my hands
on it a bit early specimen time with it
and here are my thoughts and like I said
this thing looks like a surface pro but
in a much smaller more compact body and
with a smaller body like this we're of
course not gonna expect the same kind of
power you get from a surface pro line
but I found that with my time with it it
was able to handle a lot of the tasks
that I do at it pretty well and I think
Microsoft is gearing this towards
students if you take a look at when it
was announced and when it's going to be
released which is today it's right in
time for back-to-school not to mention
those folks who just want a Productivity
device that they can pretty much take
with them anywhere and I think that's
probably one of the most compelling
things about this device you can get the
full-blown Windows 10 experience on a
small tablet now it comes with Windows s
which is a more watered-down version
that really watered down you get the
full windows experience with it but one
thing about it is that you can't install
external ads from other developers you
can only use what comes inside of the
Windows Store so if you don't like that
limitation though you can completely
remove it and get the full-blown with
those experience but this is one of the
reasons why I think that it's geared
towards students if you give this to
like your little cousin or maybe your
son or daughter someone young they're
gonna be able to use it get full windows
without getting any crazy stuff on the
system so you don't have to worry so
much about viruses or anything like that
and when Microsoft announced the surface
laptop with Windows s that was geared
towards students so you kind of see
where I'm going here and what's great is
that Microsoft has gotten ridiculously
good at making hardware so even though
it's on the cheaper side of things
you're still not getting a really cheap
feeling product still feels just as
premium as other the
although it isn't much smaller and one
of the things I like about the NGO is
that it still has some of the features
you expect to see on the higher end
devices like Windows hello which lets
you unlock the device with your face you
also get expandable storage with a micro
SD card slot and a webcam which is to be
expected now of course with it being
less expensive and so much smaller there
are a couple of drawbacks that come with
it
and I know some people weren't thrilled
by the Intel Pentium Gold processor
that's inside of this and they would
have wanted to see something like an i5
but I found that it pretty much handled
whatever I threw at it within reasonable
expectations so no this is not the
device you're gonna want to take with
you if you want to play Fortnight on the
go it doesn't look that good Gaming is
definitely not its strong suit
whatsoever so I wouldn't try it if
you're using word processing apps you're
using this for emails of web browsing
that kind of stuff it's gonna be able to
handle it no problem I've been able to
do that with no issues at all except for
the typing experience now this is a
smaller device so that means you're
getting a smaller keyboard which thus
comes separate but you can purchase that
keyboard and use it as a full-blown
laptop but like I said it is a smaller
device with smaller keys
so the keyboard does feel a little bit
more cramped for me I have medium-sized
hands area actually had no issue with
the keyboard at all your hands are
smaller so that's definitely something
you're gonna want to keep in mind but if
you're getting this for someone younger
you probably won't run into that issue
but it does still have a nice big
trackpad which I have no complaints
about I think one thing you really have
to pay attention to is the single USBC
port on this and we haven't fully made
the jump to USB C so if you use certain
devices you already own with regular USB
ports you're gonna need a dongle it
sucks to need a dongle but again with
the price and hardware value it's hard
to complain but I'll make sure to drop a
few of my favorite dongles down below in
the description if you guys need it and
after my time with it I've walked away
feeling like this is a great portable
productivity device it's not great for
gaming but that's okay not every single
laptop has to be but this is Microsoft's
take on the netbook in 2018 in the
surface lineup that's the best way I can
put it it's fine as a primary device if
you're on a budget but is even better as
a secondary device for those of you who
want to do the basics while on the go
and if you plan on picking one
I feel like the configuration that'll
probably treat you better in the long
run would be the eight gigs of RAM model
with 128 gigs of storage because that
comes with an SSD so you're gonna get
faster speeds but that about wraps it up
for this video guys hopefully you
enjoyed it if you want to learn more
about the surface goal I'll of course
have links down below in the description
if you enjoyed it be the cool guy girl
that gives this video a thumbs up and
I'll catch you guys in the next one
till then is your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
