and if you own a ps4 today I'm going to
be showing you how to play your ps4 with
remote play on an Android device so
let's not wasting time scale right into
it now this may be nothing new to Sony
Xperia phone or tablet owners as they've
had access to remote play features for
some time now but to those of us who
don't have an expiry advise this is
pretty exciting the guys over at the XDA
developer forum always seem to find a
way to take features from one device and
make it accessible to everyone in a
thread by forum number the script Kitty
you can find the apk to Sony's Remote
Play app I'll of course have links down
below in the description to the apk file
as well as the forum post in case you
guys want to check it out the forum post
will give you all the information you
need to get this up and running on your
device
as well as a list of confirmed working
devices as not all of them are going to
support this there are different ways to
install it but I find that the simplest
way is to download it directly to your
device and install it from there once
installed like any other Remote Play
device you'll have to sync it up with
your ps4 you'll want to be on the same
Wi-Fi network as the ps4 to get
everything set up and actually use the
app but I believe there have been some
reports of people actually using this
with their carrier data and
unfortunately I'm not one of those
people once you actually start playing
you'll be quite surprised at how easy it
is to use the app the entire button
layout is directly on the screen of your
device so you'll have access to your
d-pad action buttons joystick L&amp;amp;R
triggers and even your touchpad if
playing while all the buttons are on
your screen takes away from your fun you
can always put the device in portrait
mode and have your buttons display it
under your screen only issue here is
that you have a much smaller screen to
work with but honestly with the size of
phones today I found it more than
acceptable I've been testing out the
feature with my Nexus 6 and Nexus 7 and
even a Galaxy s5
I've got to say guys playing your ps4 on
a device that has nothing to do with
Sony is pretty freaking cool
the only options right now the access
remote plate is from an exterior device
PlayStation Vita or even a PlayStation
TV now performance is of course very
dependent on your data speeds but if the
requirements for this is anything like
Sony's already stated numbers you'll
need about 5 megabits down to play
comfortably
now what I like about this is that you
don't need youth access to make it work
now for those of you who don't know what
root access is for Android device you
can pretty much think of it as
jailbreaking for an iPhone you will
however need root access if you want to
get your game on with the ps4 controller
I don't really root my devices anymore
so I haven't tested out this feature yet
but the thread on exudate developers
goes over how to get that up and running
as well I really enjoyed playing some of
my favorite ps4 games on my Android
phone and it just baffles me what
Android devices can do nowadays but
that's about it for this video guys
hopefully enjoyed it if you did be the
cool guy that gives this video a thumbs
up and subscribe to the channel for more
content from me and total next video
guys I average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
