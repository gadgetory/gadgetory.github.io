consumer and today I've got an unboxing
for you guys of the SOL Republic master
tracks you guys have been asking for
this for quite some time now so I
finally got my hands on it and I want to
shout out orb headphones for giving me
this pair to unbox and review for you
guys you guys will definitely want to
check them out they've got a ton of
headphones over there it's got some for
the average consumer audio files there's
a huge library over there I'm gonna have
some links down below and you guys can
check them out and if you type in the
code your average consumer you can save
$20 off your purchase of $100 or more so
be sure to check them out and save a
little money but let's not waste any
time let's get right into it and all
right guys here we have the SOL Republic
master tracks now these retail for about
$1.99 I believe they're over the ear
headphones to gotten over to ear design
the back has a little bit more
information it's got interchangeable
head bands just like the other Sol
Republic's the speaker the ear cups can
actually come off and you can switch the
different head bands get a different
look every time it's virtually
indestructible these things really can
bend and twist and do all kinds of crazy
stuff so that's a pretty solid claim by
Sol Republic this guy incredible sound
we'll see and this is like I said
over-the-air design and yeah all that
good stuff it should have like an inline
remote to work with the Apple devices as
well so we'll see how that goes and
enough blabbering let's open it up and
let's see first thing we'll see here
we've got some some information here on
what you get inside of course you get
your cable that has the inline remote so
that you can use play/pause volume
up/down with Apple devices playing pause
with Android you've got the two speakers
over here and of course the headband and
it comes with a little carrying case
1-year warranty
says it's supposed to have powerful base
and x3 sound and
sonic soft isolating ear cushion so all
kinds of good stuff so let's check it
out get this little wrapping off and of
course like I said it does work with
Apple devices and here it is so what
we're gonna do is open up the bottom
we've got some tape here that easily
came off and it does say pull here you
guys might not be able to tell but let's
pull this out there we go
nothing else inside the box as you can
see so we'll put this to the side for
now and let's see what we got here so
we've got the headband here and I must
say this looks a lot bigger than the
other headbands that I've seen by solar
public before so this actually looks
pretty nice though I like it um the
design is actually pretty cool it's got
Sol Republic as you guys can see I don't
see if I give you guys a quick little
close-up and as you guys can see it's a
Sol Republic it's actually looks pretty
cool it's a much thicker headband over
here or at least a feels thicker before
I had like a just a small lining of
cushioning right in the middle of the
headband now it seems to have a bit more
support which is actually really really
nice addition and I do like this look
and feel it feels pretty good and man is
that scary but isn't virtually
indestructible there you guys go you
guys can see for yourselves
woah alright enough of that now back
through these ear cups let's pull this
out we've got the ear cups here hanging
onto this little plastic thing and
before we go assembling this there's
some more stuff inside of the box as you
might not be able to see but it says
keep going more inside so let's see I
think that is here on the sides so open
this up
pull this out here's the cable this has
does this have the inline remote yeah I
think this does have the available so
that's the cable nothing else here so we
can close this bottom flap now there's
another Wow okay there's another flap
over here on the side I'm sure this is
where the carrying case is alright cool
so we got a couple of other stuff here
you just pull this out and there we go
so I'm gonna put this stuff over here I
think we're done and this is the
carrying case and this is actually not a
bad carrying case this is actually
pretty good
it's a better than the one that they had
previously it has a little zipper now
inside feels pretty cool so not bad I
actually kind of like this they really
stepped it up with these master tracks
so good stuff here of course what else
do we get got stickers probably some
warranty information register your
device and a booklet all kind of stuff
alright cool
so we'll put this on this little
mountain of stuff as well and finally to
the headphones themselves let's see how
do we get this off okay you slide one
side out there goes one here cup here
goes the other and yeah put that over
here and interesting so this moves a bit
and um let's see let me see if I give
you guys a close-up of what these ear
cups look like alright guys so here's
the air cup it's got a little adjustment
there so you can kind of move this
around that's gonna be pretty cool um it
feels pretty nice the cushioning feels
soft it feels very soft and plush so
that's good
yeah good stuff I'm gonna I can't wait
to try these out these seem like they're
gonna be comfortable now this little
circle here looks a little small so I
don't think any ears well unless you
have some really small ears mm I don't
see how ears can really fit inside the
air so I'm assuming it's gonna be like
an on-ear slash over here kind of feel
to it but we'll see so now we have of
course the wire let's see if we can rip
this open all right guys we got it open
so here's the cable and this is a pretty
regular cable it's not tangle free or
anything well the bottom portion is
actually tangle free but the top two
pieces are still skinny wires so yeah
skinny wires but here it is it's got a
wide shape so you guys can see how it
goes here goes into both ear cups and it
comes with a quarter inch adapter so we
can put that here so now let's do a
little assembly this is the left side
this goes into the left side here one
right side right side boom and I see
this is the right so we're gonna put
this here and done so all right so here
we have it now these actually look a
little bigger than I anticipated but
it's not too big or anything it's
definitely not bad um here it is all set
up all complete actually it looks pretty
good now this looks a little blocky on
the ear cups but something about it I
like so I'm actually pretty impressed
with the design I'm a fan so pretty much
guys this is it this is what it looks
like you guys got a quick look around of
all the pieces see the final results
here got the inline remote and yeah
that's about it guys hopefully you
enjoyed this unboxing and I'll
definitely have a review
you girlfriend tests all kinds of good
stuff unless you guys know how these
perform and if they're worth your 200
bucks or 180 if you get them from orb
headphones and you use the app your
