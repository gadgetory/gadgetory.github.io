consumer and it's time for another
installment of the best smart home tech
now I know a lot of you guys are off to
college and you're probably looking for
some nice cool tech to add to your dorm
room so I'm going to show you guys some
of the cool stuff that I recently added
to my studio and at first we've got the
UV genie you can think of this as a
better and less expensive option to the
Amazon echo dot and if you guys know me
you know I love to use the Amazon echo
to control all the stuff in my studio
and my apartment so huge shout-out to
you for not only sponsoring today's
video but putting this guy on my radar
and the genie can do just about anything
the Amazon echo dot can do because it
has alexa built into it so you can ask
it random things like what's the weather
or something crazy like something about
the Superbowl in 2015
whatever you want it can do it as well
so just like any of the echo products
all you have to do is say and you'll be
able to give it whatever commands you
want now what makes the genie better
than the echo dot besides it's $35 price
tag compared to 50 is the fact that it
has improved speakers now if you have an
echo dot you'll know that the speaker
game is kind of weak so you if you
decided to go ahead and improve that so
you can still have that small and
discreet form factor without sacrificing
sound and from what I've been told you
fees gonna be going on sale here and
there and there's actually a sale going
on right now where you can pick up the
genie for less than 30 bucks if you
still connect this to any smart home
device at the echo dot can but what I
like about you feet is that they're not
only making this - making other cool
smart home tech with the same mindset of
inexpensive stuff with good quality and
I was lucky enough to get my hands on
some of this stuff a bit early so I got
to try out the UV Robo vac which is a
robot vacuum you can set cleaning
schedules or even tell Alexa ask robo
vac to start cleaning or even tell robo
vac to go home and it'll do all of those
things automatically and I'm not even
gonna lie to you guys I can watch that
thing finding its way back home all day
and if you're into smart lighting UV
offers some inexpensive options as well
that of course work with Amazon Alexa
I'll have all link down below in the
description but if you just want to
start your smart home game and you don't
want to break the bank
these are definitely worth the look and
if you guys are interested in a chance
of winning some free yuffie gear i'm
gonna have a link down below in the
description for you guys to check out an
awesome giveaway and up next we've got
the august smart lock now I am super
late when it comes to this one but I've
been adding a little bit more security
to the studio and I am glad I picked
this up and this is a smart lock that
you can control using your phone and all
you have to do is use the app to lock or
unlock your door or you can do what I do
and set it to auto lock and with this
it'll automatically lock once it detects
that you've left home or if you've left
it unlocked for a set amount of time but
it'll also unlock once it detects that
you've gotten home which could be pretty
nice if it's your only lock so that you
don't have to fumble around looking for
your keys if you're carrying something
and this is great if you're the type of
person who tends to worry about whether
or not you lock the door you can kind of
just jump into the app and see the
status of your lock and lock it from
there and don't worry you can still use
your regular key and there's no sign of
it being a smart lock from the outside
so you don't have to do much and even
getting it installed took me about maybe
15 minutes super simple very easy to
install and I love the functionality
that you get from it and not to mention
this thing works with Alexa so you can
give it voice commands to make sure it's
locked but with that you kind of need
this add-on piece that gives it Wi-Fi
capabilities that cost about 70 bucks
which is a little bit pricey for that
functionality but if you do happen to
have an iPhone it does work with home
kit so you can just grab your phone and
do something like this hey Siri unlock
the front door boom there you go
so you still kind of have access to
voice commands even if you don't get
that additional Wi-Fi piece so yeah this
lock is great it's automatic has an app
uses voice commands and you can still
use it manually on both sides in case
your phone dies or you forgot it
somewhere you still have access to your
house in all the typical ways so this is
definitely a nice piece of smart home
tech but I'm glad I finally got in - and
last but not least we've got the Harmony
Home Hub now my longtime subscribers
know I've always been an advocate of
having the Xbox one and we connect into
a home entertainment system because of
the voice controls that allowed your
gv2 have but now the harmony kind of
switches that up for me and that's
because this also works with Amazon
Alexa there's kind of a theme here guys
but yeah this works with Amazon Alexa
you can tell it to turn on the TV
pause something even turn up the volume
all the kind of things that you would do
with your Xbox one and the Kinect with
Alexa and the harmony hub but something
I also like is the fact that you have
the Harmony home app which allows you to
still use your TV remote right on your
phone so instead of having to look
around for a TV remote that always seems
to go missing you have a fully
functional remote right on your phone
which is awesome even if it's a
completely different app you can have an
iPhone and a Samsung TV and still have
all the functionality there which I
think just saves a lot of time if you
don't want to look for the remote
awesome stuff guys I personally am a
believer in this as a tech reviewer and
someone who's always giving product
recommendations to friends and family
this kind of switches things up for me
if you're not a big gamer or you don't
have a big budget for it in Xbox one and
Kinect I can now recommend a different
combo with the Harmony Home Hub and an
Alexa enabled device which will all be
much cheaper than an Xbox and Kinect but
that about wraps it up for this video
guys as you can see there are a lot of
Alexa enabled products here
I think Alexa controlling the smart home
voice controls all that stuff is the way
to go but that's about it
hopefully you enjoyed the video if you
did be the cool guy or girl that gives
this video a thumbs up and I'll catch
you guys in the next one till then it's
your average consumer peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
