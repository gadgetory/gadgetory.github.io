finally got this guy over here Apple
took way too long I don't know if you
guys can even see it but it is the Apple
watch I know right finally anyway we're
gonna do an unboxing now I could have
made a full video for this but it's been
done probably run to the ground by this
point so I figured I'd do it on the blog
you guys can still get my first
impression hey our first impressions and
actually still got my ff7 all hooked up
here so you guys can at least get some
decent quality out of this unboxing only
1080p 60 frames though let me know if
you like that either way let's get right
into it
oh there we go also y'all don't mind my
hair I'm back to my my little like bun
to make it feel a little bit to make my
hair grow long shut also guys did I move
on I'm back to be healthy hairstyles
because I have been putting just way too
much heat in my hair and we are working
out today so yes so yes there you go
that's it
alright so here it is this is the Apple
watch now I got the leather loop this is
the black leather loop and this one
retailed for about 700 bucks the
stainless steel versions are freaking
expensive I try to get a sport one too
but this is what got to me first so this
is what I've got so let's see I've got
me a little tab here so you can just
kind of pop this guy open no unboxing
knife huh it's looking like it kind of
dissipation yeah love unboxing laughs
get rid of that thing and this well this
is the case it comes in hardshell case
okay this is stickers Apple watch blah
blah so uh know what night me up at that
way I'm gonna leave that right there
we've got the wall adapter as well as
the little charging dock so this is one
of those magnetic wireless charging
things so you can just kind of stick it
onto the Apple watch it's like magnetic
it's gonna get right on there here you
have it this looks like old school Apple
packaging by the way seriously right so
look wait you say general please all
right drum roll please
so this is it this is the Apple watch in
a day forever but it's here but just
taking a quick look around it you've got
this is the regular button this is your
digital crown just like I think a home
button I think the digital crown also
has a button as well not too sure yeah
you can definitely press that but this
is where you like how to navigate
through your menus and apps and this is
like the home button in the back you've
got the heart rate monitor and all that
good stuff so we've got your sensors
back here and yeah this is the leather
loop so once you get it in through here
it's got magnets on the ends so it kind
of just clips together like that so this
is what keeps it secure and it actually
feels pretty solid I can't imagine this
falling right off the wrist or anything
so this is actually really good on their
end to start pairing your Apple watch
all you have to do is hit start pairing
and then you have this little symbol
that's on your Apple watch sliding off
and then all you got to do is take this
this is your camera you put it over the
Apple watch and boom it's paired so hats
off to Apple for making that super
seamless that was not difficult
whatsoever so the Apple watch is syncing
apps right now it's kind of a pretty
born moment Harry laughs we lost her so
just waiting for this thing to finish so
we can actually take a look at what the
interface looks like and how we use it
some here for this thrilling moment of
watching a sync still going any way we
can get some impressions on what it we
think it looks like how do you think it
looks I think it looks way but I like it
yeah me too I'm line doesn't look like
that nice when you first got that I was
a wife you get that one yeah after all I
was God I was kind of regretting when I
purchased that wait a minute why do I
pull the trigger on that
am but it looks on the why Leo something
safer but like a regular leather but
this is actually pretty good
thank you how easy it is to adjust it
Apple actually has a bit of a focus for
the health side of things with this guy
so I'm definitely interested in that
Android wear didn't really have any good
options as far as you know work out
features and I've had products like
these in the past
these adidas workout things and God yeah
it was not a good good thing at all this
not a good experience so when you hit
this button over here it brings up your
contact menu oh look at that who's that
sexy mom that's me hey my girls my mom
onna my pops my daughters I mean my
daughter you hear me my sister's
daughter my niece all right so let's get
out of here let's see is this the home
button this takes you back to the watch
face yeah and you know guys I'm gonna
figure it all out I'm gonna make a video
about it but you saw what came in the
box you get all this good stuff but now
think it's time we work out yes so we'll
be working out today for the first time
in forever so last fall we showed you
were trying to cook more we have been
cooking a lot more really a lot better
high five um but now we ask to actually
get that work out aspect in he's just to
work out right now I'm not I just have
on like a t-shirt leggings and some
sneakers I am wearing all close to the
rainbow right now and we've got some
awesome song but we're gonna get into
that in a second but yeah we're good
we're gonna be working out um I
definitely want to see how the activity
app is for this because Apple actually
has a bit of a focus for the health side
of things
so this company bombas task reach out to
us we are first like wait what but then
we have these goals of getting fit and
getting ready hashtag sweating for the
wedding and we good why mister um we
also we don't take sponsorships lightly
so we looked on their website and we
also saw that they donate a pair of
socks with every print at you a purchase
yeah that's really awesome on their
statistics out there that say that the
most requested item in homeless shelters
are socks so when you buy one you donate
that's that's really awesome this is
awesome why not like social group yeah
we might as well just bring it to the
channel and they are pretty awesome
mind the ankle sauce so you can't really
see them but Judd has the the half calf
sock right here yeah and this thing
these are legit we've got a couple of
them actually over here don't mind the
cables guys my cable management game is
not on point but anyway
sleek it's not weak but yeah we've got
these signs and these are pretty awesome
and what was most surprising guys is how
freaking comfortable they are oh they
are so so comfortable at first we
figured okay we're on carpet it's gonna
feel cushiony yeah but then we stepped
into our kitchen which has regular tiles
and they were still feeling really
cushiony and really good they're so
comfortable they're really really fun so
as you can see right here it says one
pair purchased equals one pair donated I
just love how socially responsible they
are you don't find many companies that
are like that so it just it made it even
easier to bring this sponsorship to the
channel so now I want to test out uh
beyond the health app of this Apple
watch is to see if this thing can
actually stay on my foot the way they
claim they say that these will stay in
place no matter what so good like I said
they're made for athletes so this was a
steam test called stay fit take a stay
up technology or something Casa de casa
yeah so that's for these the ones to
boot knit caps so we're gonna try that
out on what are your special features of
the ankle sock it's this blister tab
right here and this poster tabs also
keep you from like getting like Oh from
the bottom of the shrubby yeah yeah so
no chafing anything like that yeah so
we're gonna test it out and we're gonna
use the Xbox one we're gonna work out a
little world party we're going to be
dancing to what we've got all kinds of
music so we're gonna be dancing you guys
are going to see that I'm not good at
dancing and neither am I so don't laugh
at us she's nice like
yeah Billy anywhere she's being humble
she's being so hot she's fine at these
workout games she always scores like
five stars and 99th percentile and I
cheat the system I can move my arms and
I actually lose my body good
that's some workout but either way we're
gonna go and test it out you're gonna
see me look terrible what but she's
gonna kill it so I'm not gonna kill it I
just raised the stakes for you hey no
fun all right
I am not good at this
is amended the spell

Biff any words I don't know yo these
socks are legit though
I want to see if they're sweaty I'm
sweating right now see I actually feel
pretty good and you know what these are
thick socks they're not that thick what
they're pretty thick but then they
didn't make me feel hot yeah apparently
there's like this um material this kind
of cotton they use that well you cool in
the summer and feel warm in the winter I
like this type of kind so you're working
out sorry I can't talk yeah it has a
really cool like kind of was here that's
made out of which is why we feel so
comfortable right now but that's enough
of that I'm gonna keep doing these kind
of workouts I want to lift the bed so
I'm gonna keep using the Apple watch and

but I really like him a lot but yeah

little while now and so far I'm
extremely impressed it's actually my
first time using any of the g LG G
phones so very excited to actually get
this in hand uh honestly this thing has
gotten me because of the nice camera the
quickest way to my heart with a cell
phone is having an awesome camera and
this thing definitely has that probably
one of the best alongside with the
galaxy s6 so I'm really stoked about
this and so first been like a really
cool experience I hope to have a day in
the life video out soon about it I'm
trying to make that my thing give you
guys a day in the life of how to use
your phone how it's going to be when you
use it on a daily basis but yeah
definitely stay tuned for that and
hopefully enjoy so
I'm looking for Harry the donut thing
I've spotted her she has a bun and it's
like a shark fin sticking out of the
water so I think I can I tracked her
down she's gotta follow the bun and you
see there she goes any I just had to
follow the bun alright guys so back at
home let's check this out I was not
joking about these speaking cases now
like I said and not a sponsor whatsoever
but I am just in love with these these
are like my case of my cases of choice
whenever I pick up a new phone I pick up
a new phone I run and grab one of these
kinds of speaking cases um they're not
expensive I think I paid 20 bucks for
this one I think they're all like around
20 bucks so you get some really solid
protection you get some really solid
protection as well as a pretty nice
design I think I like it so if you guys
are looking for a case actually just
checking those out I've links if you
guys are interested um what else do I
like let me sort of share with you guys
things that I just like that I happen to
have around I didn't make a video about
so this vid this one right here I made
an unboxing video of this mouse but oh
man I'm gonna be including this in my
ultimate a youtuber gear video as an
accessory this thing is so awesome
especially for video editing it's a
great mouse it feels great in the hand
but it also has these buttons on the
sides and I've mapped these to editing
controls so I use all these buttons to
speed up my workflow and editing so if I
want to cut if I want to zoom out if I
want to zoom in if I want to delete a
clip all of those buttons are right here
very awesome stuff probably the best
mouse I've ever used and that's even
with the new MX MX this new MX is nice
but it's like this is like a really nice
regular Mouse this is like us the
special Mouse this Mouse gives you a ton
of features while this is just a very
well performing pretty basic Mouse with
some additional features so you got your
back and forward scroll thing right here
you got some nice wheel features as well
that's all cool but to me it's not
topping
and this is a gaming mouse so giving us
that's where it's at
another Logitech product right here this
is this keyboard it's an easy switch
keyboard you can think up to like three
devices to this one keyboard which is
also nice kind of like the MX master
mouse this is on the second one but it
can do three at once oh this guy of
course the X what is this the xB 950 BT
now I know you guys probably want to
kill me for not having a review of this
yet but it's amazing I can tell you that
I'm going to be working on that
immediately
I've already written the review I just
kind of have to you know do the get get
some recording done pretty much but this

videos I've got a quite a bit of a list
over there that I need to work on but
let me get your input on what you guys
want to see next first thing I'm going
to be working on they're two choices
day-in-the-life with the LG g4 or a
damned life with the galaxy s6 vs. the
s6 edge now like I said before those
videos are going to cover how using that
phone is on a daily basis what you can
come to expect so which one do you guys
want to see first
whatever you pick whatever I see the
most of in the comment section down
below I'll work on so g4 s6 let me know
but yeah I'll be working on those too
but you guys let me know which one you
want to see released first and them you
