consumer and if you haven't noticed the
whole tech world is talking about the
new iphone 6 images that have leaked
recently and it comes from an article on
macrumors that said they got the
pictures originally from a nun ominous
Twitter account and then it came from
Sony Dixon who says that the pictures
originated from someone in China most
likely someone who's on the
manufacturing line so there are a couple
of images of a larger screen iphone
there's apparently two sizes one is at
5.5 inch and i believe the other is 4.7
so that's a weird move for Apple to make
two different iphone screen sizes but
seeing as they made a cheaper
alternative to the iphone 5s who knows
what they're planning but if you take a
look at these images they show that the
iphone has a much smaller bezel so now
it's a lot thinner and it has some
pictures of internals and different
stuff like that now the size of the
iphone in these pictures kind of makes
it look like an ipod touch and i don't
know if any of you have ever used an
ipod touch outside of this case but i
think is really hard to hold because of
how thin it is so seeing an iphone go to
this size is going to be a little
troublesome for some people i know for
sure if they have to use it like that
everyone will most likely have to get a
case if they want to use it but yeah
that's if these pictures are real now
there are other reports out there that
show that these images are fake and I
actually can't believe that these are
real simply because of some of the
evidence act out there some older iPad
render pictures show the exact same
smudges that the iphone thought the
iPhone 6 has on its screen and I think
that's way more than just a regular
coincidence this is something that it's
smudges smudges are almost always
different because they're you know your
fingers are all over the screen but
these have the almost exact same
alignment and it really makes it hard to
believe that this is an authentic iphone
6 there but there aren't any signs as to
where the internals come from so that
one's up in the air we're not sure about
that but me personally just from seeing
the smudges I finger I feel like it's
pretty much fake even if we're real
product why would they use someone
else's smudges from online to throw on
top of their if there are authentic
pictures and not just something that's
made through Photoshop so I think it's
pretty weird these pictures do look
authentic at first glance it's really
hard to tell that these are fake but i
think that evidence kind of really
brings it down for me but i think it's
way too early to see these kinds of
leaks typically we see you know product
leaks like this when it's closer to the
announcement date it's currently
februari and as of the last couple of
years the iphone has been released and
announced around september-october so
it's a little too early to see something
dis complete now I do believe that the
iphone 6 is going to have a bigger
screen Tim Cook had an interview with I
forget who exactly but i'll leave link
down below in the description and he was
actually asked about it he couldn't say
a word about it so I have a gut feeling
that it is going to happen a bigger
screen on the iPhone 6 but I just don't
think that it's going to come in the
shape of those images simply because of
those um renders that were used so
really really hard for me to believe it
but let me know what you guys think do
you think that these images are real do
you think that they're authentic what do
you think about the images that were on
the internet previously for the ipad
render that has the exact same smudges
on these iphone 6 does that seem like
too much of a coincidence to you i think
so so let me know down below in the
comments what you think and we'll see
what happens in quite a few months when
Apple actually decides to announce the
iphone 6 and that's about it for this
