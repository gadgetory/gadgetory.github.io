consumer and today I want to show you a
video making tool for your smartphone
that completely changes the game and
doesn't break the bank this is the
smooth four by gian and they were pulled
up to send me their smooth for gimbal
and sponsor today's video but for those
of you who don't know what a gimbal or
stabilizer is it pretty much allows you
to get super clean smooth footage from
your smartphone so you don't have to
worry about the shakiness that you
usually get from your hands this thing
also has some very special features to
help you get some creative shots that
you wouldn't typically be able to get
with your smartphone alone but let me
show you guys what this thing can do
so you guys got to see a little glimpse
of what this thing is capable of but
let's talk about what you get when you
actually pick this up so inside the box
you'll find some paperwork the carrying
case for the smooth four and the side of
that the smooth four as well as a USB
cable and some tripod legs and with that
you pretty much have everything you need
to get started - the smartphone this
thing has solid build quality so when
you get your phone in it it feels nice
and secure and on the body you'll see a
variety of controls that you can access
so that you're not sitting there
pressing the touchscreen once you've got
it locked in here this way you can reach
the controls you need quickly without
disrupting the position of the gimbal
and with the companion after the smooth
four you get a lot of controls if your
phones out there like the iPhone that
don't give you access to pro settings
for your camera with this app you'll get
access to all of that so you can change
them on the fly this way you'll get
exactly the look you want for all of
your shots now something you'll notice
on this smooth four is that control dial
on the left the control dial lets you
zoom in and out of your footage and it
also lets you control your focus
manually and you can also get this
really cool shot with the zoom called
the vertigo shop and this brings a
really dynamic look to your subject by
making the background and move either in
or out as your subject stays in focus
and you can do this manually by moving
with the zoom ring or you can use the
companion app where you can set all the
parameters and all you have to do is the
movement and you've got your shot and
I'm telling you guys this is a pretty
dynamic shot really intense but it
usually requires some practice but I
like that with the companion app it
makes it quite a bit easier to achieve
now let's talk about the five different
modes that you get with the smooth four
first one pretty simple is standby mode
when you're walking around you don't
want to have the gimbal and the motor
going you can just put the phone in
portrait mode and with that it locks in
and then it turns off the motor and
whenever you're ready to start shooting
again you just flip it back out motors
going and you're ready to shoot now it's
all of the other modes you'll find right
upfront first one is the pan follow mode
and with this mode whenever you move
around you can pan very easily and the
other one is the lock mode so whenever
you move it around it stays in place and
also you got some triggers on the
that give you access to two more modes
the bottom trigger will give you full
follow mode so that you can do the Pens
that you want as well as tilt so you can
move it all around and the smooth floor
will be able to follow you and the last
mode is called the phone go mode in this
mode the smooth force responsiveness is
dramatically increased so this could be
really nice for some action shots some
stuff that's really quick moving but if
you're into cool editing you can also
get some really nice transitions here as
well and as far as I know this is only
gimbal on the market right now that
gives you this kind of functionality but
have a look for yourself
and you guys see it for yourself this
thing can drastically upgrade the
production level of your videos right
from your smartphone and I know a lot of
people out there are using their
smartphones to create content this is
the camera that's you have on you at all
time so why not and this is a very
inexpensive tool to add to your arsenal
it's only 139 bucks and trust me there's
a lot of gear out there that'll try to
help you to get similar shots that costs
way way more so if you guys want to
check it out of course have links to
everything that you need to know down
below in the description and if you
enjoyed the video be the cool guy or
girl that gives us video a thumbs up and
I'll catch you guys in the next one
so then is your average consumer pace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
