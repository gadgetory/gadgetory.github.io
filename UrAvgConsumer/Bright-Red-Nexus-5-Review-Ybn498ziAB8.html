consumer and today I've got a review for
you guys of the bright-red Nexus 5 now
if you're on the market for an Android
phone it doesn't get more Android than
this so let's not waste any time let's
get right into it alright guys here we
have the bright-red Nexus 5 the Nexus 5
is the latest phone by Google and they
went with LG again for this iteration as
they did with the Nexus 4 there are
currently three variants of this phone
and they come in black white and now
bright red which to me kind of feels
like a mix between red and orange and
let me tell you it stands out quite a
bit when you're outside now let's take a
look around the device itself we've got
a four point nine inch 1080p display but
let's just call it five and it's built
with Gorilla Glass 3 to the left you'll
find your volume rocker which happens to
look like one button and on the right we
have the power button as well as the SIM
card tray on the top of the phone you'll
find a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
a mic for noise cancelling that'll help
you sound clearer when using the phone
on the bottom you have what looks like
two speaker grilles but only the left
grille is an actual speaker and the
right has your microphone between the
two is a microUSB port to get it all
charged also on the bottom is an LED
notification light that is pretty much
invisible to the naked eye unless you
get a notification and that light pulses
every now and then it has a soft touch
back due to the matte finish and it's
actually quite comfortable to hold in
the hand a word of caution though I did
notice the matte finish wear a little
bit with my Nexus and it leaves behind a
bit of a shiny look in the spots where
that happens this will probably only
truly impact those who keep their phones
under a microscope but being one of
those people I thought you guys should
know a 5-inch phone is pretty large too
a lot of people but I had no trouble
handling the phone and reaching it's
buttons and I happen to have medium
sized hands watching movies and playing
games are a pleasure on this device as
the screen is much better than it was
with the Nexus 4 although there is a
drawback that hinders the experience and
that's the speaker the speaker is very
easy to block depending on how you hold
the device and can lead to some
completely muffled audio
having to shift the way you hold device
can be a bit frustrating when this
happens now that we've taken a look
around the phone let's talk a bit about
what's inside the Nexus 5 is packing a
2.3 gigahertz Snapdragon 800 processor
which is one of the best processors
available right now and it helps the
phone to be very quick and snappy it
also has 2 gigabytes of RAM that will
keep the phone from slowing down when
using multiple apps and even
power-hungry apps and games on the back
we've got an 8 megapixel camera as well
as a 1.3 megapixel camera up front the
Nexus 5 also has LTE capabilities which
was disappointingly absent from the
Nexus 4 this phone has very solid specs
that helps it to perform to the
standards we'd expect from any smart
phone today but what makes this phone so
special is that it has the 350 dollar
price tag and really can't find that
kind of value anywhere else
another spec this phone is toting is a
2,300 milliamp battery now in the world
of Android phones this isn't too
impressive but I've gotten pretty decent
battery life from it but you can surely
expect to charge this thing every night
also if you're a power user or someone
who's constantly on their phone you
should expect to charge this at the end
of a regular work or school day a lovely
thing I noticed is that this phone
charges very quickly that may be due to
the smaller battery size but I find that
an hour and change of charging or so get
me to a full battery most times that is
something I definitely don't mind the
Nexus 5 also supports the wireless
charging which is also a very nice bonus
onto that 8 megapixel camera Nexus
devices aren't really known for their
camera quality or software but I find
that the Nexus 5 performed pretty
decently I haven't been able to pull off
any amazing shots with it but the shots
that I did get were definitely on par
with what I would expect from a phone at
this price so instagramers have no fear
you're in capable hands with the Nexus 5
I've never been too crazy about the
camera software the Nexus devices come
with but I think that the initial
interface is easy enough for anyone to
get accustomed to and here's some
footage of what you can expect from
1080p HD recording in alright guys so
here's the kind of footage you can
expect from the HD record
on the Nexus 5 this is also the same
kind of sound collar you'll get as I'm
talking directly to the phone so this is
the audio quality and video quality you
can expect and if video calls are a big
thing for you this is where the Nexus 5
may disappoint the 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera isn't high quality
at all
it's kind of just there to get the job
done and I gotta say it's a bit
disappointing unless you're under the
optimal lighting situation now let's
talk a bit about software as I mentioned
before the Nexus 5 is packin specs that
allowed to run on par with most high-end
smartphones today combined with the
latest Android you can expect to have a
smooth experience when using this phone
one of the new features you'll find is
the new launcher most people know it as
the Google experience launcher and it
has some changes to the homescreen and
AB section icons are now larger and a
long press on an open area of the
homescreen will bring up wallpapers
widgets and setting options another
notable change is having Google now to
the left of your main home screen with a
quick swipe you're able to access all
the information Google now thinks is
important to you but one of my favorite
features is being able to summon Google
search by simply calling out ok Google
what time is in Japan what's great is
you aren't limited to just searches you
can call out to open apps set reminders
call someone and much more other than
that is the same vanilla Android we've
all come to love typical smartphone
activities like web browsing using
various apps from the Play Store texting
and watching videos are all very fluid
experiences and that's really driven by
all the things the Nexus 5 has under its
belt if you're looking for the smoothest
and cleanest Android phone out this is
the right choice whether you're on a
budget or not this phone feels high-end
with very few sacrifices it definitely
is the best value out there when looking
for Android devices with the promise of
always getting the latest updates as
soon as they come out you can feel safe
that this phone will be on the edge of
what Android has to offer for a long
time and that about wraps up my review
of the Nexus 5 do you guys plan on
picking it up if so which colour are you
looking at
